Yes , it 's official , but not quite actually " officially " official until Google announces it during their annual I/O developers conference over the next two days ...
The gobbling Google has been busy acquiring bleeding edge technology firms for some time now .
The laundry list includes Grand Central and Gizmo5 along with their VoIP infrastructure offerings , On2 with it 's VP8 video codec technology , and now , for $ 68.2 million , it is adding Global IP Solutions ( GIPS ) - holder of the chat technologies that power the Yahoo and AOL instant messengers which compete directly with Google .
Google is smart , but not all of their launches achieve perigee , and some of those rockets tumble back to earth - like Google Docs .
But even if Google does n't always get it right the first time , they simply buy buy again , as was the case when Google swallowed up DocVerse a couple of months back .
The re-branding of DocVerse as Google DocVerse , and the expected morphing of it into a new and improved Google Docs is just one example of Google making lemonade from lemons .
The $ 30 million acquisition of Gizmo5 along with it 's softphone and VoIP routing via Google promises to bring an even greater plethora of widgeys and features to the Google Voice service , which was previously known as Grand Central ( before they were effectively Googled ) .
Okay so we 're witnessing a pattern here with Google 's voracious appetite for VoIP and Video technologies , but what does the Open Sourcing of VP8 actually mean for HTML 5 and the web in general ?
For starters , licensing body MPEG LA and Microsoft have dug in and are firmly invested in H.264 , while Apple tags along with them .
Mozilla continues vowing never to bow down and embraces the more popular open source alternative , OGG Theora .
Opera wants to play nice in the sandbox , and has landed in the Ogg Theora camp , but the entire cadre , with the exception of Microsoft , is expected to Jump on board the VP8 bandwagon almost immediately .
Here 's how the dichotomy of HTML5 video codec browser support is currently collated :
1. ) H.264 - Chrome / IE9 / Safari
2. ) Ogg Theora - Chrome / Firefox / Opera
Google , hedging its bets by supporting both H.264 and Ogg Theora , stands to lose absolutely nothing , and yet they are going to open source VP8 on top of everything - which On2 claims is capable of a , " 50 percent bandwidth savings compared to leading H.264 implementations . "
Considering the polarization of the various camps , Firefox stood to lose the most , with Opera playing catch up , while Safari and IE stick to their guns .
At this late date in the game it appears that Apple is swinging around to VP8 too .
Microsoft succumbs in its own time , when it can say it is adopting a new technology not their own with a yawn , but do n't think for a minute that it is n't hurting bad right now .
Adding insult to injury , Google is also going to launch Google TV this week at the conference , something that Intel CEO Paul Otellini claims is the , " biggest single change in television since it went color " .
So if Google is buying their competitors underlying chat technology , launching Google TV , cranking up Android ads to a fevered pitch , open sourcing their VP8 video codec , offering free phone services and cloud based document management , what does this spell out ?
How about a new way of thinking when it comes to " Democratization of the Internet " ?
Imagine , Apple , Adobe , Microsoft , and others such as Skype , Yahoo , and AOL being handed their hats all at the same time , with regards to some major part of their business models .
Apple stands to suffer with the emergence of VoIP and Video technology they have to adopt instead of appearing to lead the market with respect to the prominence of the iPhone , while Android sales skyrocket as a result of a carefully planned blitz of new product offerings following Google 's I /O developers conference .
Microsoft loses big in the area of IE and H.264 , as does MPEG LA , while Firefox , having taken the biggest gamble that could have threatened it 's very survival , gets a big payday by immediately embracing VP8 .
YIM and AIM are n't going anywhere - at least not anytime soon , but Google is now poised to play on their turf , by owning the underlying technologies they use in their instant messengers - something akin to what we saw late last year when Skype pulled the rug out from under eBay .
Skype now has , potentially , a real competitor , but who knows ?
perhaps the Google gobbling machine has already placed them in the cross -hairs of the reticle too .
This is n't going to completely destroy any products that were mentioned so far , but Adobe does stand to see their champion , Flash , fade from existence in one of those , " Too little too late " scenarios .
In the short term , we 're going to be seeing a revolution in video and telephony technologies tied closely to the Android and the web , via Firefox and Chrome .
In the long term , we 're witnessing over the next two days , a massive clash of the titans , and a restructuring of the power bases .
A year from now , we may very well all be surfing Google translated video television " Waves " , while editing and exchanging documents during teleconferences over VoIP - on our Droids .
All in all , the next two days promise to be fundamentally more exciting for the rest of us average joes than it was for Microsoft when Marc Andreessen bowed down , and kissed the Borg ring of Bill Gates at the Netscape developers conference a decade ago .
Two years ago a survey found that one in three teachers believed creationism is just as valid as evolution , while the Rev Prof Michael Reiss lost his job as director of education at the Royal Society after suggesting that creationism should be discussed in science lessons .
He is one of those to sign the new letter .
Feature story - 7 June , 2010
Want a way to stop the corruption and pollution that the fossil fuel industry is wreaking on our planet ?
We 've seen a better future , and here 's our plan to get there : the Energy [ R]evolution .
zoom The Energy [ R]evolution
The best way to stop an oil gush ?
Keep it in the ground .
If you think that 's impractical , or that it means shivering in the dark , or millions of people without energy , or millions of people without jobs , you 'd be forgiven for thinking that .
It 's the line that we 've all been fed by Big Oil and King Coal .
It 's wrong on all counts .
Greenpeace teamed up with more than 30 scientists and engineers from universities , institutes and the renewable energy industry to create our Energy [ R]evolution Scenario .
Using only existing technologies , it charts a course by which we can get from where we are now , to where we need to be : decreasing CO 2 emissions after 2015 ; 95 % renewable electricity by 2050 ; a phase out of nuclear power ; 12 million jobs by 2030 , with a third more jobs in the global power supply sector than in a business as usual scenario .
The scenario respects natural limits , decouples growth from fossil fuel use , and proposes an investment system in which costs are shared fairly under a global climate regime .
It also means finally providing energy to the two billion people currently without reliable access to energy services .
Learn more about the Energy [ R]evolution .
Why a [ R]evolution ?
It 's an evolution , AND a revolution .
( And yes , electronics geeks , that ’s the symbol for [ r ] esistance there as well . )
We need a [ r ] evolution because business as usual is not going to stop the tens of thousands of barrels of crude oil spilling into our waters , scores of workers losing their lives to accidents in coal mines around the world , or the countless other disasters we are all facing due to our reliance on dirty energy .
Jobs
The Energy [ R]evolution scenario outlines how to create about 12 million jobs , with 8.5 million in the renewables sector alone , by 2030 .
If we continue under business as usual , global renewable power jobs would be only 2.4 million of the global power sector ’s 8.7 million jobs .
By implementing the Energy [ R]evolution 3.2 million or over 33 % more jobs globally will be created in the power sector alone .
If that is n’t enough to convince you consider this - the overall annual market for renewable technology will increase from around US $ 100 billion today , to more than US $ 600 billion by 2030 .

Emissions
Global CO 2 emissions under the Energy [ R]evolution scenario would peak in 2015 and drop afterwards .
If compared with 1990 , CO 2 emissions will be more than 80 % lower by 2050 if the energy supply is based almost entirely on renewable energies .
By 2050 around 95 % of electricity could be produced by renewable energy .
zoom Co2 emissions Figure 2 : CO2 emissions per capita
Greenhouse Development Rights
At the core of the Energy [ R}evolution will be a change in the way that energy is produced , distributed and consumed .
It will also mean connecting the 2 billion people currently living without electricty .
Decentralised energy systems , where power and heat are produced close to the point of final use , will avoid the current energy wastage during conversion and distribution .
Investments in “ climate infrastructure ” as well as super grids to transport large quantities of offshore wind and concentrating solar power , are essential to making the Energy [ R]evolution a reality .
The sustainable future of the planet is rooted in the investment in people and local communities who can install and maintain renewable energy sources , rather than further subsidising dirty and finite fossil fuels .
We need to create a system in which investment costs are shared fairly under a global climate regime .
One such mechanism is the Greenhouse Development Rights framework ( GDR ) which calculates national shares of global greenhouse gas obligations based on a combination of responsibility ( contribution to climate change ) and capacity ( ability to pay ) .
Policy changes
To make the Energy [ R]evolution a reality and to avoid dangerous climate change , we are demanding the following policies and actions are implemented in the energy sector :
1 . Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy .
2. Internalise the external ( social and environmental ) costs of energy production through ' cap and trade ' emissions trading .
3. Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming appliances , buildings and vehicles .
4. Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and combined heat and power generation .
5 . Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to the grid for renewable power generators .
6 . Provide defined and stable returns for investors , for example by feed - in tariff programmes .
7. Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide more environmental product information .
8 . Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy and energy efficiency
The challenge
Despite the decline in support for offshore oil drilling as a result of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , a recent Pew Research Center Poll of the American public shows a * decline * in support for funding for alternative energy as well .
Now , a decline in support for nuclear we can understand : the failure of multiple safety technologies and the poor response to an ecological emergency are good reasons not to trust a technology that relies on deadly fuel to boil water .
But let 's look at those numbers .
At 73 % , a healthy majority of Americans support more investment in alternatives .
So why is the US government not delivering a big time investment in alternatives as a way out of the nightmare of dependence on oil , big oil slicks , pollution , corruption , poisoned fishing grounds , and an energy mix that 's choking the future to death ?
Why indeed ?
Sign up - Join the Energy [ R}evolution and join the more than 5 million Greenpeace subscribers worldwide who are asking this question of our elected leaders , demanding an end to subsidies for fossil fuels and investment in clean , renewable technologies .
An alternative future is n't just possible -- it 's happening .
Help us ensure it gets here in time .
You probably know this .
Like all people , I have gaps in my knowledge , and this was one of them .
I fixed it .
Here ’s what I learned , so maybe someone out there can learn too …
When you first get into Linux ( or Unix ) , file permissions probably seem confusing if you ’ve ever used any other operating system ( like Windows / DOS , for instance ) .
Then you learn what the rwx ’s mean and everything makes sense .
I ’m almost ashamed to admit that , until very recently , I was unfamiliar with setting the sticky bit and the suid / sgid bits numerically , because for some reason , it never clicked .
Of course , it ’s really easy to remember once you look at it the right way .
To illustrate what I ’m talking about , lets look at some remedial file permissions …
The very basic file permissions are read , write , and execute , and are represented visually when performing ‘ ls - l ’ by a series of flags , ‘ r ’ , ‘ w ’ , and ‘ x ’ .
The group of three is presented three times : once for the user who owns the file , once for the group who owns the file , and ones for other users ( who do n’t belong to the group that owns the file ) .
It looks like this :
$ ls -l test
- rw-r — r — 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 7 2010 –02–25 12:17 test
It probably looks familiar .
The first way that most of us learn to modify these commands is with the flag representations of the permissions , using the ‘ chmod ’ command .
Like this :
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ ls -al test.sh
- rw-r — r — 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 16:24 test.sh
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod +x test.sh
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ ls -al test.sh
- rwxr-xr-x 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 16:24 test.sh
As you can see , after the ‘ chmod ’ command , the execute bits are set on the file .
After a while , you probably learn the numeric codes , too .
Then you can do things like this :
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ ls -al test.sh
- rwxr-xr-x 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 16:24 test.sh
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod 644 test.sh
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ ls -al test.sh
- rw-r — r — 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 16:24 test.sh
In case you ’re rusty ( or never learned ) , the numeric codes are actually in octal , and go from 0 – 7 .
Each of the flags are assigned a value :
rwx
---
421
Remember that the set of flags appears three times , for user , group , and others :
rwx rwx rwx
--- --- ---
421 421 421
This makes it really easy to numerically set the flags .
You just take the match the flag at the top with the value at the bottom , group them by user , group , and other , then add up each group .
Here ’s an example :
I have a script that I want to make read , write , and execute by me , read and execute for the group , but not readable at all by anyone outside of the group .
In other words , I want permissions to look like this :
rwx r-x ---
Looking at the table above , we can match the flags with the values like this : rwx r-x — -
421 401 000
That should be pretty apparent , right ?
Now we just add up each of the groups .
rwx r-x — -
421 401 000
7 5 0 In other words , the permissions that I want are 750 .
So I can use chmod and specify that : msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod 750 test.sh
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ ls -l test.sh
- rwxr-x — — 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 16:24 test.sh
Terrific , that worked perfectly .
I feel like I should include a warning now , about the “ others ” group .
If you set that writable … in other words , if that last “ w ” bit is set , anyone on the entire computer can write to your file , empty its contents , and replace them with whatever they want .
If it ’s a script , they can make that script do whatever they want .
You almost certainly do not want this .
Good security begins from the ground up , and good security is that of the least permissions .
If someone only needs to read something , there is no reason to set the ‘ write ’ bit for them .
Note that you can technically remove the ‘ write ’ bit from yourself .
‘ rm ’ then asks if you want to remove the write - protected file ( unless , of course , you use - f , in which case the file is merrily blown away ) .
Right , so that ’s basic numeric usage .
Most of that was probably remedial , however now is the exciting part…or at least , exciting to me , because I recently learned it .
SUID , SGID , and Sticky Bits
You have probably heard of SUID … you probably have n’t heard of SGID , and you might have heard of Sticky Bits .
Here ’s brief explanation …
The Set User ID ( SUID ) bit on a binary program indicates that , when the program is run , it operates as the user who owns the file .
If a binary is owned by root , for instance , and has the SUID bit enabled , then that program runs as root , no matter who launches it .
The ‘ ping ’ command is a perfect example :
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ ls -l `which ping`
- rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 30856 2007 –12–10 12:33 /bin/ping
The reason that ‘ ping ’ is SUID is because it needs to create raw ICMP sockets ( which , if you ’re not a network programmer , just means that it creates them manually so that they can have very specific flags and contents , rather than relying on the ‘ safer ’ standard calls ) .
Because the root user is the only one with permission to do this , ping needs to run with root privileges .
Hence the SUID bit .
This is probably ringing alarm bells in your head , which is a good thing .
You should be concerned , because a bug ( or exploit ) in a SUID program is essentially a giant gaping hole in the security of your system .
If someone managed to find a way to exploit ‘ ping ’ before it dropped privileges , then computers everywhere would be vulnerable to attack .
For this reason , you should not , willy nilly , assign binaries SUID .
Only well tested , hardened programs should get that flag ( and ping is one of those ) .
As a matter of conversation , you cannot effectively make interpreted scripts SUID ( which is a good thing ) .
I ’m honestly not 100 % sure what , in the system , blocks it .
I believe it ’s the kernel , but maybe someone could enlighten me in the comments .
The end result is that , regardless of the SUID flag being set , the script runs as the current user .
When you are looking at a directory listing , a file with the SUID bit set has an ‘ s ’ or an ‘ S ’ in the column that normally holds an ‘ x ’ .
Whether the ‘s ’ is upper or lower case depends on whether the execute bit has been set .
If it ’s set , then the ‘s ’ is lowercase .
If the execute bit is not set , then it ’s upper case .
Here ’s the example :
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ touch test
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod 4755 test
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ ls - al test
- rwsr-xr-x 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 17:12 test
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod 4644 test
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ ls - al test
- rwSr — r — 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 17:12 test
Notice that when the execute bits are set ( 755 ) , the ‘s ’ is lowercase , but when the execute is not set ( 644 ) , the flag turns to ‘ S ’ .
The Set Group ID ( SGID ) bit works in a similar way , except that the group permissions it runs with belong to the group that owns it .
I do n’t find myself using it in that capacity much , but I do have use for the special effects that it has on directories .
The effect that SGID has on directories is that every file and directory created under that directory automatically inherit the group owner .
An example is probably the easiest way :
Lets start by touching a file and examining the default owners :
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ touch myfile
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ ls - al myfile
- rw-r — r — 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 17:17 myfile
As you can see , the group owning it is my default group , enterprise ^admins .
Whenever I create files , that ’s the group they get assigned to .
Now we ’ll make a directory , change ownership of it , add the SGID bit , and take a look :
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ mkdir mydir
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ chgrp domain^users mydir
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod 2755 mydir
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ ls - ald mydir
drwxr - sr-x 2 msimmons domain^users 4096 2010 –06–10 17:18 mydir
As you can see , the SGID bit is set , and the group ownership is ‘ domain^users ’ .
Now , lets go into the directory , make a file , and see what happens .
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ cd mydir
msimmons@newcastle:~/test/mydir$ touch mynewfile
msimmons@newcastle:~/test/mydir$ ls -al mynewfile
- rw-r — r — 1 msimmons domain^users 0 2010 –06–10 17:19 mynewfile
There we have it .
The file that we created in a directory with the SGID bit inherited the group ownership .
But something else happens , too .
Lets make a directory and have a look :
msimmons@newcastle:~/test/mydir$ mkdir mysubdir
msimmons@newcastle:~/test/mydir$ ls - ald mysubdir
drwxr - sr-x 2 msimmons domain^users 4096 2010 –06–10 17:25 mysubdir
Not only did the group ownership change to match , but the SGID bit is set as well .
This enables us to set the bit on the parent directory and have the settings affect every directory that ’s created .
This is ideal for a shared working environment where everyone needs to create files that everyone else can access .
“ Sticky Bit ” is an interesting term .
It can be set on files , but if it is , it ’s ignored by Linux .
There are other OSes that do use it , though .
Instead , it ’s very useful on directories .
Normally , files can be removed ( or in strict Unix speak , ‘ unlinked ’ ) by anyone who has write access , even if they ’re not the owner .
This normally is n’t a problem .
After all , if you can write to it , that means you should be able to erase it .
There are times when this is n’t ideal , though , and that ’s when the sticky bit comes to the rescue .
When a directory has the sticky bit set , only the user who owns the file ( or the root user ) can remove it .
Anyone else can still write to it , but removing it will get the error “ rm : cannot remove `file ’ : Operation not permitted .
You can tell if a file or directory has the sticky bit set if the very last ‘ x ’ in the ‘ others ’ column is set to a ‘ t ’ or a ‘ T ’ .
Just like the SUID and SGID flags , you can tell if the underlying bit ( in this case , the execute bit ) is set by whether the ‘t ’ is lower or upper case .
If it ’s lower case , the execute bit is set .
If it ’s uppercase , the bit is not set .
Example :
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ touch 1
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ touch 2
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod 1001 1
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod 1000 2
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ ls -al
total 24
drwxr - xr-x 2 msimmons enterprise ^admins 4096 2010 –06–10 17:47 .
drwxr - xr-x 171 msimmons enterprise^admins 20480 2010 –06–10 16:53 ..
— — — — -t 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 17:47 1
— — — — -T 1 msimmons enterprise^admins 0 2010 –06–10 17:47 2
SUID , SGID , and Sticky Bit Numerics
Interspersed throughout the examples , you probably saw me using 4 digit numeric codes ( such as 2755 when we were setting the SGID bit ) .
If you leave off the first of the four bits , ‘ chmod ’ assumes the first bit is 0 , and does n’t set it ( technically , any bits it does n’t find , it assumes are 0 , thus you could make a file
------r--
with a ‘ chmod 4 ’ command ) .
However , when you add that first number , you are instructing chmod to set the SUID , SGID , and Sticky Bit bits .
The breakdown occurs like this :
0 is nothing
1 is sticky bit
2 is SGID
3 is SGID and sticky bit
4 is SUID
5 is SUID and sticky bit
6 is SUID and SGID
7 is SUID , SGID , and sticky bit
Jeez , how could you not have that memorized ?
Well , I could n’t , anyway .
And it did n’t click , until today .
Those flags are octal , too , but the non-numeric flags are spread out over all three sets of rwx blocks .
Maybe I can make it more clear with this snippet :
msimmons@newcastle :/tmp$ touch test
msimmons@newcastle :/tmp$ for PERM in `seq 0 7` ; do echo -n \
" %PERM " ; chmod $ {PERM}000 test && ls -l test | awk '{print $ 1} ' ; done
0 ----------
1 ---------T
2 ------S---
3 ------S--T
4 ---S------
5 ---S-----T
6 ---S--S---
7 ---S--S--T
A little bit of explanation is probably in order .
First I touch a file .
Then , I write a for loop that iterates from 0 to 7 , and changes the permissions to 0000 , then 1000 , then 2000 , then 3000 , etc etc .
It then prints out the permissions on the file at that time ( along with the number that is set ) .
If you follow the pattern , it ’s exactly like the ‘ rwx ’ pattern , with the same numbers .
Instead of
rwx
---
421
we have
SST
---
421
The only difference is that the flags are set each in their own “ user ” , “ group ” , or “ others ” column .
Thus is becomes easy to numerically assign SUID , SGID , and Sticky Bit …
If you want a ‘ normally ’ permissioned directory ( rwxr - xr - x ) , except you want the SGID and Sticky Bit set , you do it like this :
According to the previous table , the SGID is assigned 2 , and the Sticky bit is assigned 1 . 2+1=3 , and the “ normal ” permissions come out to 755 , so our command will be msimmons@newcastle : ~/ test $ mkdir dirname
msimmons@newcastle:~/test$ chmod 3755 dirname
msimmons@newcastle :~/test$ ls - ald dirname
drwxr - sr-t 2 msimmons enterprise^admins 4096 2010 –06–10 17:55 dirname
There you have it .
An easy way to remember the numeric codes for SUID , SGID , and Sticky Bit .
Please comment if you have any questions , if I did n’t explain clearly enough , or if I screwed something up .
Thanks !
The Canadian Century
At the beginning of the 20th century , Canada was one of the richest countries in the world , enjoying boundless natural resources , a privileged place in the commercial empire established by still - dominant Britain , and access to the energetic American market .
Against this backdrop , it did n’t seem unreasonably boastful in 1904 when Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier proclaimed that " the 20th century shall be filled by Canada . "
Ninety years later , his words seemed more ironic than prophetic .
The Canada of 1994 in many ways resembled the United States or Europe of today .
Deteriorating public finances at every level were causing grave anxiety among both the public and experts .
The federal government was plagued by persistent deficits .
The national debt was growing at an alarming rate .
The media and the international community were all predicting a day of fiscal reckoning with far - reaching implications .
The Wall Street Journal went as far as to call Canada " an honorary member of the Third World . "
Fast - forward again to today , and Canada seems to be back on track .
The country ’s economy grew at an average rate of 3.3 percent between 1997 and 2007 , the highest average growth among the G - 7 countries , including the United States .
Canada ’s job - creation record was nothing short of stellar .
From 1997 to 2007 , Canada ’s average employment growth was 2.1 percent , doubling that of the United States and exceeding employment growth in all other G - 7 countries .
Perhaps most importantly for future economic prosperity , during the same period Canada outperformed the G - 7 average almost every year on business investment .
Canada outperformed the United States on this measure in every year but three over the same period .
So perhaps Laurier was not wrong , just 100 years early .
If the country continues on the path it is following today , it ’s not unreasonable to think that this will be the Canadian century , the era in which the country comes into its own as a world economic power and finally steps out of America ’s shadow .
The story of how a classic economic basket case transformed into a top global performer has implications beyond Canada .
Every one of the tools Canada used to extricate itself from its parlous position is available to the United States .
As the world ’s top economic powers gather in Canada for this year ’s G - 20 summit , U.S. President Barack Obama and his team would be wise to study the Canadian model , or risk being left behind .
First , it ’s important to understand how Canada got off track .
Prior to the early 1970s , Canada had a strict political culture , like many countries , which demanded balanced budgets and frugal government spending .
Ottawa began to abandon this traditional discipline in the 1960s and 1970s , as federal spending increased from just under 15 percent of GDP in 1965 to 23 percent by 1993 , but was not matched by equivalent increases in taxes .
It was a phenomenon observed in many , if not most , industrialized countries during this period .
Between 1965 and 1996 , Ottawa booked a grand total of four operating surpluses , and the real value of the national debt tripled .
By the late 1980s , roughly a third of Ottawa ’s revenues were being used to pay interest .
Then there were the entitlement programs .
The national public pension plan , the Canada Pension Plan , for instance , was increasingly unsustainable because its underlying assumptions , namely a growing population and continuous income growth , proved faulty .
Huge premium increases or benefit cuts seemed the only way to carry the program through the looming retirement of Canada ’s enormous baby - boom generation .
The problem was n’t only in Ottawa .
Canada ’s provinces , whose governments have much greater spending , taxing , and regulatory authority than U.S. states , were also hard at work creating a fiscal mess .
As a share of the economy , provincial spending more than doubled between 1965 and 1993 while provincial debt tripled .
The associated interest costs , as a share of revenues , also tripled .
By 1993 , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney ’s Conservative government was beset by mounting internal pressure from the deficits , coupled with external pressures such as the Mexican peso crisis , which heightened capital - market worries about deficit - laden countries ( three - month treasury bill rates more than doubled in 1995 ) , and embarrassing international recognition of Canada ’s fiscal crisis , exemplified by the Wall Street Journal ‘s mocking .
The public was hungry for change , and in October 1993 the left - of - center Liberal Party of Canada led by Jean Chrétien came to power .
For the first year , the new government ’s promises of reform went largely unfulfilled .
The turning point came in the 1995 budget when Finance Minister Paul Martin articulated a new direction for the federal government .
" We are acting on a new vision of the role of government , " he sa i d .
" Smaller government … smarter government .
The Liberals ’ 1995 budget relied chiefly on spending cuts rather than tax increases to slay the deficit and began the long process of debt reduction .
Spending was to fall 8.8 percent over two years .
Large cuts in transportation , industry , regional development , and scientific support were made .
The size of the federal government was to decline from 16.2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 13.1 percent in 1996 .
Public - sector employment was to fall 14 percent .
The new discipline paid off quickly .
Federal government spending as a share of the economy fell even more rapidly than planned .
Provincial government spending also decreased significantly from 25 percent of GDP to 20 percent .
Federal budget surpluses were consistently reported beginning in 1997 .
The national debt fell by almost half ( to a little over 40 percent of GDP ) by 2007 .
The quick return to fiscal surpluses coupled with stronger economic performance than expected meant Ottawa could cut taxes , including personal and corporate income taxes , capital gains taxes , and the corporate capital tax , which reinforced economic performance .
Canadian reforms did n’t stop with balanced budgets .
Chrétien ’s government went on to tackle and solve two previously untouchable entitlement programs : the Canada Pension Plan ( CPP ) and welfare .
The CPP , Canada ’s main public pension plan , is similar to Social Security in the United States .
Previously deemed a political third rail , the CPP ’s unsustainable finances suddenly became fixable in Canada ’s new reform - minded political climate .
The federal government and a number of its provincial counterparts seized the opportunity of the public ’s willingness to confront long - festering problems and bear the cost of reform .
Nine provinces along with the federal government agreed to a set of reforms to the program that went into effect in 1998 .
These included increasing the payroll tax , modestly trimming benefits , and investing budget surpluses in equities .
One can quibble with the specific nature and cost - effectiveness of the reforms ; no one , however , can disagree with the results :
The program ’s financing was placed on a solid footing that will enable it to weather the costs of the retiring baby boomers .
Like the United States , Canada achieved historic reform of the country ’s welfare programs in 1996 .
Canada ’s approach , however , was more decentralized than Washington ’s .
Ottawa offered a historic deal to the provincial governments : unprecedented freedom to make their own welfare policies .
This unleashed a wave of fruitful experimentation and innovation in the provinces , while spending was cut at the national level .
The results were stunning .
Large numbers of Canadians , previously trapped in poorly designed benefit programs , returned to the workforce :
By 2000 , the number of welfare beneficiaries in Canada had declined by more than a million people , from 10.7 percent of the population to 6.8 percent .
In short , the Canadian economy took flight as reform took hold .
Moreover , Canada weathered the recent recession better than its G - 7 partners , so the reforms of the 1990s are the gift that keeps on giving .
Consider that the recession in Canada lasted only three quarters , from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009 .
Beginning in mid-2009 , the Canadian economy turned a corner and is experiencing real GDP and employment growth .
Unemployment peaked at 8.7 percent in August 2009 and stood at 8.1 percent this May .
None of Canada ’s major financial institutions had to be bailed out .
Some in Washington might dismiss the relevance of the Canadian example to the United States ’ fiscal problems because of the differences between the two countries ’ political systems .
This is a misunderstanding of the Canadian experience .
Many reforms that were put in place required extensive political bargaining with powerful interests , and provincial consent was often necessary .
Moreover , as part of the reform package , the Liberals in Ottawa directly challenged several of their traditional interest groups , among them the civil service and social - welfare advocates — perhaps a precedent for Obama to consider .
In fact , circumstances in Ottawa and Washington in the early years of Canada ’s reforms showed parallel patterns .
The Liberals faced a fiscally conservative Reform Party opposition in Parliament , while Democratic President Bill Clinton was under similar pressure from Republican Newt Gingrich ’s congressional majority after 1994 .
This political alignment proved fruitful in moving both countries in a more fiscally responsible direction , but Canada was able to sustain reform whereas in the United States it quickly faltered .
For example , the Clinton - era Republican Congress began reducing the federal deficit in 1994 until surpluses were finally achieved in 1998 .
Unfortunately , the status quo mix of overspending financed with deficits returned in 2002 .
What made reform possible was the depth of the crisis Canada faced , the extent to which the Canadian electorate demanded an end to irresponsible public finances , and the degree to which the entire political class responded .
Governments at all levels then moved on a broad front , making it clear that no established interests would be exempted from contributing to the cost of slaying the deficit , lowering both taxes and the debt , and making the Canadian economy an outperformer .
Every one of these lessons is entirely applicable to the United States today .
America ’s budget mess can and will be fixed when the public demands action and the political class decides to set aside rancorous and extreme partisanship in pursuit of a robust economy , job growth , lower taxes , and focused government .
Call it the Canadian way .
Campbell Soup Co. is recalling nearly 15 million pounds of canned " SpaghettiOs with Meatballs " because of possible under- processing , the U.S. agriculture department said .
The recall includes 14.75 - ounce cans with a use - by date between June 2010 and December 2011 of three varieties of the product : " SpaghettiOs with Meatballs , " " SpaghettiOs A to Z with Meatballs " and " SpaghettiOs Fun Shapes with Meatballs ( Cars ) . "
Consumers who have purchased those products with a plant code of " EST4K " should not eat them and should return them to the store where they were purchased for an exchange or full refund , Campbell Soup said .

She ’s the ex-wife from hell !
An outraged judge slapped a Long Island woman with a jail sentence for trying to drive a wedge between her ex-husband and their daughters , keeping them apart for weeks at a time and even claiming he groped one of them .
Lauren Lippe is a vengeful roadblock , the barbed wire standing in the way of her two daughters and their desperate dad , Judge Robert Ross said .
Lippe often went nuclear , launching foul - mouthed tirades at Ted Rubin in front of the girls — calling him a “ deadbeat , ” “ loser , ” “ scumbag ” and “ f – – – ing asshole . ”
Ross said Lippe , 47 , was a scheming manipulator who deliberately planned last - minute trips and events when her ex was scheduled to visit the girls .
“ He was compelled to consent or risk disappointing the girls , ” Ross wrote in his ruling , which found Lippe in contempt for violating the couple ’s joint custody agreement .
If Rubin protested , Lippe berated him mercilessly .
“ We all hope you die from cancer , ” she once blared at him , the court papers said , with both daughters in her arms .
Lippe even had the nerve to smirk in court when an emotional Rubin described the agony of missing out on Hanukkah with his children .
Ross said Rubin was relegated to visit at the end of his ex’s driveway , where he lit a menorah with his daughters in his truck and watched them open presents from their grandparents .
But the worst , Ross wrote , was “ the crescendo of the plaintiff ’s conduct ” involving false accusations of sexual abuse .
Lippe charged in 2008 that Rubin had fondled the breasts of one of his daughters .
Lippe later conceded that she knew nothing sexual had occurred .
“ The evidence before me demonstrates a pattern of willful and calculated violations of the clear and express dictates of the parties ’ Stipulation of Settlement , ” Ross wrote in a decision handed down last week .
The judge was also annoyed that Lippe had punished the children for wanting to spend quality time with their dad .
On Thursday , Ross sentenced Lippe to six weekends in jail to be served on the first and third weekends of June , July and August .
Lippe , who has since remarried , was scheduled to begin her jail time Friday , but her sentence was stayed pending an appeal .
Rubin is expected to take care of the children while Lippe is on lockdown .
Ironically , it was Lippe who asked the court to modify the custody agreement .
Lippe declined to comment outside her Lloyd Harbor home , but her lawyer , Kieth Rieger criticized the decision .
“ It ’s extremely unusual , and in this case , it ’s inappropriate , ” Rieger said .
“ He chose to believe the husband and not her .
Of course , she ’s upset , but she ’s also worried about her children .
She ’s worried that if she goes to jail how it will affect the children . ”
Rubin , 52 , a marketing executive , declined to comment , but has sounded off about his dilemma on his Internet blog .
“ Spending time with my girls is something I put before all else , ” Rubin wrote last year .
“ They are teenagers now and being a divorced dad , it can be challenging to continue to reach out , put them first , and maintain this in the face of their occasional lack of interest and the roadblocks so easily put in place by their mom . ”

No one wants to be like poor Florida State Sen .
Mike Bennett , who was forced to apologize last week after he “ was caught on video viewing a picture of four young women in bikinis last week while his fellow senators were debating a bill dealing with abortion . ”
Sunshine State News executive editor Nancy Smith later said , “ The only thing is if I had to do it over again is I would probably not call the picture porn , ” but instead “ entirely inappropriate and risque , ” yet the damage was already done and Bennett ’s name will probably be forever linked to porn on the web due to his perhaps - four - seconds - long blunder .

And since no politician wants to be seen as soft on the politically incorrect subject , wielding pornography as a weapon can sometimes wreak havoc on proposed legislation .
“ House Republicans on Thursday unhinged an $ 80 billion technology bill after forcing a vote that Democrats said would expose their members to election - year attack ads claiming they support pornography , ” Jim Abrams reports for the Associated Press .
Democrats had to pull the bill after half their members voted for the GOP measure that , in addition to severely shrinking the technology bill , put them on record as supporting the firing of government workers who view or download pornography on the job .
It was the second time in a week that Republicans used such a tactic to their advantage .
Last week they brought about major changes to the Cash for Caulkers bill to subsidize people who buy energy - efficient products for their homes by attaching a provision barring building contractors from hiring child molesters .
“ You should be embarrassed , ” House Science and Technology Committee Chairman Bart Gordon , D - Tenn. , a moderate who works well with Republicans , shouted at the end of the debate .
He said Republicans had stuck in a “ little bitty provision that means nothing that ’s going to gut the entire bill . ”
A report at the Chronicle of Higher Education adds ,
The chairman of the science committee , Rep. Bart Gordon of Tennessee , said he understood the federal government faced urgent budget problems but warned that such problems could be even worse in the future if the country failed to invest in its technological pre-eminence .
Mr. Gordon said he was especially frustrated by the apparent success of Mr. Hall in using the issue of pornography to help defeat higher spending levels for scientific research .
“ Nobody seriously thinks that we do n’t want to deal with pornography here , for God sakes , ” Mr. Gordon told lawmakers at the conclusion of the House debate .
“ If you vote for this , ” he said of Mr. Hall ’s amendment , “ you should be embarrassed . ”
Despite the opposition among Republicans , the bill was largely supported by industry , with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers among hundreds of organizations writing in support of the measure .
The Chamber of Commerce ’s senior vice president in charge of education and work - force development , Arthur J. Rothkopf , said he hoped Congress would reconsider the matter , while acknowledging the effectiveness of politically emotional issues such as pornography .
“ It ’s an election year , ” Mr. Rothkopf said .

Last week , at Politico , Jake Sherman wrote about the first time House Republicans used the tactic :
The soft glow of a burning - hot wire in an incandescent lightbulb , and the bluish tinge from the screaming electrical plasma storm in a fluorescent tube may soon become largely things of the past .
LED lighting has arrived to beat them both .
Ever since British inventor Humphry Davy passed current through a platinum strip in 1802 , electrical lighting based on incandescent technology in vacuum - sealed glass bulbs has lighted up our lives .
Edison did n’t invent the things , despite what you may have heard , but he did perfect an early design that made the lightbulb a practical commodity .
Since Edison ’s experiments , the tech has been tweaked and polished , to the point that we ’re no longer amazed by the instant availability of electrical light , seeing it as merely “ normal . ”
And do n’t forget fluorescent systems either –decades of effort by Brits , Germans , French and Americans starting in the mid-1800 ’s resulted in those long tubes lighting up practically every office space everywhere , as well as the curling glass tubes that glow over the door of your favorite diner .
As concerns about the environmental impact of incandescent bulbs grew , compact plug - in fluorescent ( CFL ) tech even seemed briefly like it could be the future of lighting .
And all of these innovations will remain with us for some time –the differing benefits of the technologies will mean they retain a grip on niche markets in the lighting industry ( in stage lighting , and sign writing for example ) .
But for mainstream lighting , the CFL and the hot lightbulb are doomed .
Doomed faster than you may imagine , actually –thanks to the LED .
At the Light + Building trade show in Frankfurt last month , this quiet revolution in lighting technology could n’t be more blindingly obvious .
Where events like this had remained pretty stagnant and uninteresting for years , L+B was filled with drama .
Seemingly every company ’s exhibition stand was featuring LED technology with jazzy demos and snazzy music and , yes , pretty young female stand promotional teams ( LED Ladies ? ) .
The stand for Royal Philips Electronics more than every other :
The company had taken the bold step to light the entire sweeping exhibition hall with LED tech , and the only lighting gear made by the company ( which started out as an early pioneer in incandescent bulbs ) that was being promoted was LED - based from consumer practical and “ fun ” lighting to LED street lamps that could save authorities millions of dollars in energy bills .
The CEO of Philips Lighting , Rudy Provost , explained why at the beginning of his press conference : “ This Light +
Building is not about 2010 – it is about a new decade , a new era of growth , powered by innovation .
A decade of opportunity , driven by a fundamental transformation of our industry . ”
Explaining more to us , Provost noted that LED ’s are just a “ means to an end ” for delivering new lighting systems to people , while acknowledging that the arrival of the small , white , super - efficient LEDs has completely turned the industry on its head – “ A few years ago we would call ourselves a ballast and bulb company , and today we ’re talking about being a lighting solutions company … but of course LED allows you to do things you could n’t do before . ”
As I cycle home I 'm conscious of an ominous rumble behind me .
A quick glance over my left shoulder confirms my worst fears : a looming heavy goods vehicle is blocking out the sun .
I do n't fancy taking it on with only my helmet and luminous vest as protection , so I veer to closer to the kerb so it can overtake .
We meet again at traffic lights , and again I shrink towards the edge of the road .
I might think I 'm protecting myself , but in fact this is the most dangerous way for a cyclist to interact with a lorry .
Some experts believe that behaviour like mine is the reason that far more female cyclists are killed in HGV accidents than men .
This is particularly the case in London , which has the unenviable position of being the epicentre of lorry - related cycling deaths in the UK .
Last year , 10 out of 13 fatal cycling accidents in the capital were women , and eight of them were killed by HGVs , according to the cycling campaign group CTC .
This is despite the fact that there are around three times more male cyclists in London than women .
The trend has continued this year , with the death of 28 - year - old charity worker Shivon Watson on 10 March in an accident with a tipper lorry on a roundabout in Hackney , east London .
She was trapped between the lorry and railings as they both turned left .
Few cyclists have an understanding of how much lorry drivers can see from their cabs , which were designed for motorway driving rather than London 's awkward and elderly street plan .
This Metropolitan police video shows how huge an HGV driver 's blind spot is for anything close to their cab .
It was a revelation for me - I did n't realise that it is much safer to be out in front of them than alongside .
Every tragic accident is different but certain common themes run through the recent deaths : turning left , roundabouts and women .
But why would gender affect the likelihood of being killed on the roads ?
Barry Mason , a cycle safety campaigner with Southwark Cyclists , speculates that this is because women are less assertive riders and therefore tend to be less visible .
" You see more women cycling very close to the kerb than you do men .
They do n't take the lane , or overtake lorries on the outside .
They sneak up on the inside , which is fatal , literally . "
Mason recommends that everyone should have cycling training before taking to their bikes .
" Every adult makes errors .
A good trainer will iron out all sorts of bad habits . "
It makes sense , it 's a long time since most of us did our cycling proficiency tests at primary school .
CTC has a list of accredited trainers .
There 's one simple piece of advice for dealing with lorries - do n't be intimidated by them .
Mason says : " If you cycle in the gutter they 'll treat you accordingly . "
The third period of this game was one of the worst periods of hockey I 've ever seen from a team that needed to score two in order to tie the game .
The Montreal Canadiens were n't dominated .
They were just listless and perhaps confused .
They seemed to have no idea that they needed to score a goal and that the Flyers only interest was in preventing them from scoring ( though the Flyers did in fact score a goal , albeit from a terrible angle ) .
The only defender I saw consistently pinching up into the play was P.K. Subban .
Down by three while penalty killing with about five minutes to go , the Canadiens basically played it straight , never putting any pressure on the Flyers in their own zone .
It 's extremely rare for one team to go an entire period without registering a single scoring chance .
It is even more rare that the team doing so manages the task in the third period of a game that they 're trailing .
It was flabbergasting .
Scoring chances and more after the jump .
Scoring Chances
For those who'd like a definition : a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
And , of course , a big thanks to Vic Ferrari for making the whole damn thing possible with his awesome script .
Olivier ( En Attendant Les Nordiques ) and I were again quite close in counting chances .
I had the Flyers up 16 - 14 overall for 30 total chances while Olivier had the Flyers up 15 - 12 for 27 total chances .
Of the 30 chances I scored , we had 25 chances in common ( Flyers up 14 - 11 ) and using the Cohen Kappa Test that Vic set up for us , our results have a correlation of 0.78 which is right on track with Game One .
My " unique " chances were as follows :
Mtl - 1st - 2:05 ( shot from front of net as player is falling )
Phi - 2nd - 13:02 ( shot from top of FO circle , close to FO dot )
Mtl - 2nd - 5:40 ( shot from top of FO circle , middle of the ice )
Mtl - 2nd - 4:12 ( rebound , I have three distinct shots , Olivier has two )
Mtl - 2nd - 2:18 ( rebound , not well controlled , misses the net )
And these were Olivier 's unique chances :
Mtl - 1st - 12:51 ( one - handed wrap - around )
Phi - 2nd - 4:54 ( cross - crease pass , fanned by recipient )
This game was like an extreme version of Game One at even strength .
The Canadiens got the better chances in the first period but by the end of the game Philadelphia had taken control .
Given the score after two periods , the chances in the third period were very surprising .
The Flyers were also very good on the power play with five chances in about 5:30 minutes plus a lot of time set up in the offensive zone .
Two of those 5:30 minutes were also very late in the third period with Philadelphia leading by three , so they likely were n't pressing for a goal as much as you might otherwise expect .
By contrast , the Montreal power play had one really good sequence in the first period but otherwise did n't generate anything and had trouble gaining the zone .
Neither coach has really hunted any specific match - ups so far so it will be interesting to see what happens when the series goes to Montreal .
I would think Montreal would look to find some harder match - ups considering the outcome of the last two games , but it's hard to do that against a Philadelphia team that spreads its scoring to multiple lines .
A lot of Flyers did some good things on this night .
Claude Giroux had another solid evening , drawing a penalty and then setting up the Flyers ' first goal with a beautiful pass through traffic to Danny Briere who scored his ninth goal in eleven games .
Sheep
3. Andrei Kostitsyn - I liked his game a lot more than Jacques Martin .
Kostitsyn only got five shifts in the third period with Montreal looking for the tie which I found pretty surprising considering he 's one of their better offensive players .
Yet guys like Tom Pyatt , Maxim Lapierre and Travis Moen saw more ice .
Strange .
Once you consider that Kostitsyn was one of only a few Canadiens on for three or more positive chances at even strength and that he led the team in Corsi differential ( +8 ) it just gets that much stranger .
At any rate , I thought he played a good game .
2. Ville Leino - Leino was instrumental in creating the game 's second goal with his determined play in front of the net .
He then scored the third goal on what was a very poorly played shot by Jaroslav Halak .
Leino also led the Flyers with six shots , was one of five Flyer forwards with a positive Corsi differential and despite being one of four Flyer skaters without an official hit , seemed more than willing to battle physically to win pucks .
1. Michael Leighton -
On the one hand , it 's hard to imagine an easier third period .
On the other hand , Leighton is the biggest reason the Flyers came out of the first period with a lead .
A few very good saves in the first period was enough to maintain a lead through one and from there onward it was pretty smooth sailing .
He had some trouble controlling shots after he made an initial save but the Canadiens had even more trouble getting to those loose pucks in time .
But despite whatever flaws might be pointed out , two consecutive shutouts is an impressive achievement .
Goats
3. Scott Gomez - A second consecutive difficult game for Gomez .
The Flyers really have n't been matching lines much in this series and that trend continued in this game .
Peter Laviolette made sure to keep his bottom pairing defenders away from Gomez but other than that almost everybody got a turn .
Yet Gomez could n't capitalize against anyone .
Against Blair Betts he was +1 - 2 , against Mike Richards +1 - 3 , against Claude Giroux +2 - 1 and against Daniel Briere +1 - 4 .
The only center he beat was Giroux but he also took a hooking penalty on Giroux in the first that led to the Flyers ' first goal .
And really , Gomez needs to be one of Montreal 's offensive leaders .
In the third period , he ( and many others ) just did n't get it done .
2. Roman Hamrlik -
He seemed slow on a number of occasions and notably so on the second Flyers goal where he let Simon Gagne skate around him to go behind the net .
Then , Gagne passed the puck to the front and Hamrlik turned to see Leino with the puck .
After Leino took the shot , Gagne picked up the rebound and put it in the net while Hamrlik turned again .
The sequence ends with Hamrlik bent over either in exhaustion or frustration .
In the third period he seemed hesitant to cheat for offence and while that may not have been his call , it was hard to watch .
1. Jacques Martin - I try not to be overly critical of coaching but that third period was awful .
There 's a time to worry about strong defensive play and a time to let loose in order to create chances .
Now , maybe the Canadiens were letting loose and just are n't very good at it .
But something tells me that 's not it .
Playing Tom Pyatt with Gionta and Gomez through the third period does n't strike me as cheating for offence .
Neither does using your regular defensive forwards to kill a penalty when you 're down three with five minutes to go .
And , frankly , neither does a period in which there were only six total chances for both teams .
Paul Henry says there is no danger of TV One 's show tonight being as " unwatchable " as the quiz show three weeks ago .
Straight - talking TV host Paul Henry has put his foot in it again , calling his employer 's programmes " banal " and " unwatchable " , and questioning the taste and intelligence of the TV - viewing public .
Henry , who as presenter of TV One 's Breakfast has delivered sniggering put - downs of targets including a hirsute Greenpeace spokeswoman and British singer Susan Boyle , said " banal " stories on TV One 's news show Close Up and its TV3 rival Campbell Live end up being some of the " most - watched , the most commented - upon stuff " on television .
" I sometimes see stuff and personally despair , and I think : is that current affairs ?
But it actually is . "
When asked if programme - makers were underestimating or overestimating the intelligence of the New Zealand public , Henry giggled and said : " I seriously worry we might be overestimating it . "
He is often surprised by which stories rank highest on the TVNZ news website : " My God !
The things people care about .
They really do care about Victoria Beckham . "
Henry made the comments to the Sunday Star - Times during an interview to promote 50 Years of TV News , a whistle - stop tour of the history of Kiwi news broadcasting , which he co-presents with newsreaders Simon Dallow and Wendy Petrie tonight .
The programme comes three weeks after TV One screened the similarly nostalgic Cheers for 50 Years , a celebrity quiz show fronted by Jason Gunn that was widely watched but viciously panned by reviewers as " juvenile " , " low - rent " and " appalling " .
Henry appeared to side with the reviewers .
" I found it unwatchable – but I 'm in the minority . "
In a rare instance of self - deprecation , Henry added that he was as likely as any viewer to be drawn to trivia and " salacious gossip " , especially since he started reading headlines from the women 's magazines on Breakfast .
" I spend time flicking through them and I am genuinely intrigued that Jennifer Aniston can look that good at 41 .
It is extraordinary ! "
When asked if this suggested TV journalism was getting dumber , Henry said this was " too simplistic " a question , as a balance between worthy and trivial stories was necessary to keep viewers interested , and " We should n't condemn people for the things that interest them . "
Instead , the important question to ask of broadcast journalists in New Zealand was " are we missing really important stories ?
And the answer is no " .
Henry added that there was no danger of tonight 's show being as " unwatchable " as the Jason Gunn special .
" I would n't have said yes to doing it ...
I 'm pretty fussy with the things that I 'll do . "
PAUL HENRY ON ...
Doing push - ups : " Obese people would n't have to go up at all . "
Getting salmonella from fresh tomatoes : " It could be just those Hispanic people who pick them . "
Whether women can do anything : " No , they can 't ... they have no grasp of technology . "
Men watching women breastfeeding in public : " Go on , have a look ; have a good look . "
Old people in rest homes : " They 've moved into another dimension . "
Rats :
" They 're very clean ... they clean themselves with urine . "

For a plant , light is life .
It drives everything from photosynthesis to growth and reproduction .
Yet the chain of molecular events that enables light signals to control gene activity and ultimately a plant 's architecture had remained in the dark .
Now a team of researchers from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Duke University have identified the courier that gives the signal to revamp the plant 's gene expression pattern after photoreceptors have been activated by light .
" Light is probably the most important environmental cue for a plant , " says Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Joanne Chory , Ph.D. , professor and director of the Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory and holder of the Howard H. and Maryam R. Newman Chair .
" Understanding how light signaling triggers morphological changes in the plant will have a really big impact on every facet of plant biology . "
Most animals are able to move away from unfavorable conditions , but plants are sessile and must cope with whatever comes their way .
" They have developed an amazing plasticity to deal with varying environmental conditions , " says first author Meng Chen , Ph.D. , formerly a postdoctoral researcher in the Chory laboratory and now an assistant professor in the Department of Biology at Duke University .
Their findings , which are published in the June 25 issue of Cell , bring scientists a photon closer to being able to harness plants ' phenotypic plasticity to help boost agricultural yields and manage weeds under challenging growing conditions .
Because plants are so reliant on light , they have evolved a number of different photoreceptors that are defined by the color of light they absorb .
For example , photoreceptors absorbing in the red / far - red spectral range , also known as phytochromes , help sense the presence of other plants in their neighborhood by detecting changes in the color of light .
Plants then use this information to direct their growth resources toward stem elongation rather than bulking up harvestable portions such as leaves and seed under low light conditions or conditions where competition from other plants is detected .
For many years , scientists used the length of the embryonic stem , or hypocotyl , to quantify a plant 's response to light .
But scientists had still come up short in understanding the mechanisms involved in phytochrome 's earliest signaling events , explains Chen .
Other studies had shown that light directly regulates the relocation of phytochrome A ( PHYA ) and phytochrome B ( PHYB ) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , where they congregate in distinct foci that are commonly referred to as phytochrome nuclear bodies .
Sitting at the microscope for hundreds of hours allowed Chen to identify a new gene , HEMERA - named after the Greek goddess of day - based on his observation that PHYB could not be found in large nuclear bodies .
When HEMERA was missing , plants were unable to respond to light , Chen explains , and grew into spindly , albino seedlings that died before they could make flowers .
Chen and his collaborators then found that in hemera mutants , key proteins that must be degraded by cells responding to light were still present , thereby making the seedling believe it was still in the dark .
Digging deeper , they found striking structural similarities between HEMERA and the yeast protein RAD23 , whose job it is to shuttle proteins flagged for destruction to the cellular junkyard .
Thus , these nuclear bodies appear to be sites where key regulatory proteins go when they need to be removed from cells .
But Chen discovered that HEMERA does something else :
It also slips into chloroplasts , small compartments that contain chlorophyll and are in charge of photosynthesis , which could explain the pale appearance of hemera mutants .
" People had known for a long time that one of the things light does is to trigger the differentiation of chloroplasts after seedlings emerge from the ground , " says Chen .
" But nobody knew what the trigger was . "
Although chloroplasts contain their own tiny genome , most proteins necessary for chloroplast maturation are encoded in the nucleus and need to be directed to their final destination .
In order to ensure proper chloroplast differentiation , gene expression in the nucleus needs to be coordinated with gene expression in the chloroplast .
" A protein that travels to both organelles could serve as a simple yet elegant solution to ensure coordinated gene activity in both locales , " says Chory .
" Although we do not know what HEMERA is doing in the chloroplast , its presence in both the nucleus and chloroplast would ensure that the seedling has a rapid and appropriate response to light when it emerges from the soil . "
Researchers who also contributed to the study include Rafaelo M. Galvão and Meina Li at Duke University , as well as Brian Burger , Jane Bugea , and Jack Bolado at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies .
The work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health , the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , the National Science Foundation , and Duke University .

For their part , the ' workers ' handing out fliers — who are wearing In - N - Out caps and aprons — said they were the real deal and that the stores will open on July 4 , 2010 .
But it looks like it was not meant to be .
The real estate agent for the space on 933 Broadway says he has no lease with the burger joint and that it " sounds like someones having some fun on April Fools . "
And in any case , it 's a strange day to pick for a massive publicity campaign .
You have to hand it to the pranksters — this was a pretty genius play .

Google and Sprint might have a big problem on their hands , as the EVO 4G , coming out in less than a week on June 4th , seems to have a serious defect in the included internal storage department .
Update 6/1/2010 : I have terrible news .
While on vacation in France ( and therefore unable to swap out the SD card for another ) , I have today spent a whole day in Monaco and Monte Carlo which ended up being my favorite little places in all of France and its surroundings .
I have terrible news .
While on vacation in France ( and therefore unable to swap out the SD card for another ) , I have today spent a whole day in Monaco and Monte Carlo which ended up being my favorite little places in all of France and its surroundings .
After taking a myriad of breathtaking and irreplaceable pictures and videos and coming home , I found none of them were present on the card .
Instead , a LOST .DIR with about 2 GB of data .
The defect described here , which until now only needed a reboot to get fixed , has now progressed into something that I do n't think I 'll be able to recover from .
Needless to say , this is highly upsetting - these pictures are not replaceable .
If anyone has any tips on restoring data from a corrupted SD card , please let me know .
Update 6/1/2010 : According to a respectable member of Android Forums , Bek , who got in touch with Sprint Advanced Tech Support , the batch of EVO 4Gs distributed at Google I/O is the same as production units that are about to be shipped .
According to a respectable member of Android Forums , Bek , who got in touch with Sprint Advanced Tech Support , the batch of EVO 4Gs distributed at Google I/O is the same as production units that are about to be shipped .
Here 's the link to the post where he mentions that .
If true , this means thousands of consumers are about to be very , very unhappy , and if you see my last update above , will likely eventually lose their data .
The Defect
I 've been using the EVO since Google handed it out at Google I/ O last week , and it's been nothing short of amazing ( unlike what MG Siegler , aka Apple fanboy , seems to think ) , except for a one little thing .
Actually , a big thing - the 8GB microSD card that the device ships with seemingly randomly stops working and appears corrupt / empty / messed up - I 'm not even sure how to describe it best .
A reboot fixes the problem temporarily , until it happens again .
It started occurring on day 2 and has reoccurred almost every day as I 've been heavily testing and using the phone as a camera , camcorder , browser , and other features .
Here are some apps that rely on the SD card and start failing unpredictably :
The camera app starts complaining that it can't save pictures due to bad permissions , specifically : " Unable to save file to SD card due to insufficient file permissions " .
TuneWiki , a music app , goes crazy and almost freezes the phone while trying to play the playlist that is loaded into its memory but failing at accessing the card .
The gallery app sees no pictures .
The ASTRO app shows a mix of empty and unavailable dirs in a state I 'd never seen before .
It could be just me with a defective SD card , right ?
I was thinking that too but then I remembered seeing a few tweets describing similar problems by @NeilLund right after I/O and asked him for more details .
Apparently , he has been experiencing the same problem .
Yesterday , I started a thread at AndroidForums that has so far generated over 40 replies with users reporting seeing the same issue .
The final straw came today in MG Siegler 's post comparing EVO 4G to the iPhone , in which the camera app got major points taken away for not working consistently and showing the same " Unable to save file to SD card due to insufficient file permissions " message I 've seen before .
While no actual corruption has occurred in my case yet , chances are you may lose your data , like in this case , unless the bug is fixed .
Without further ado , I am posting this to bring Google 's , Sprint's , and HTC 's attention to the matter as well as gather some feedback from those of you who were also affected ( please comment on your experience ) .
The Root Cause ?
Opinions on the root cause are currently split .
Some users think software is to blame , while others cite bad SD cards ( that 's a whole lot of bad cards - perhaps a defective batch ? ) or faulty card seating mechanism ( which is , admittedly , really weird ) .
Here 's what the SD card and the seating mechanism look like [ view more unboxing pics ] :
Some users tried other cards and saw the same problem reoccur , which indicates that the original cards might not actually be defective .
Attempts to reseat the SD card or even tape it so it sits closer to the phone also went on the fail list .
Or perhaps software is to blame ?
It is possible that a software error somehow leaves the card in a bad state after a certain series of events , which would explain why a reboot or remount fixes it without physical intervention .
Those of you looking for a new microSD card for your EVO , whether to upgrade from the slower 8 GB or to replace the faulty 8 GB ones , if they indeed will end up being the problem , may want to Those of you looking for a new microSD card for your EVO , whether to upgrade from the slower 8 GB or to replace the faulty 8 GB ones , if they indeed will end up being the problem , may want to read our review and benchmarks of the 16GB Class 6 A - Data card which offers the best value for the money , in my opinion .
Whatever the root cause is , I hope Google , HTC , and Sprint will jump on this before it's too late and the EVO 4G is released , aka June 4th .
And for their own sake , I also hope it's a software problem fixable via an OTA update - otherwise they are about to have a whole lot of unhappy customers on their hands .
Any EVO 4G owners with this problem ?

After Laura Moon started suffering stomach pains , doctors decided to carry out an ultrasound scan on the teenager .
When they saw the results , they were astounded .
For the scan revealed that she had four kidneys .
The 18 - year - old is now hoping to donate the extra organs for transplant operations .
Only a handful of people in the UK have four kidneys , although having three is relatively common .
But Laura 's case is especially unusual because all four are fully formed and functional .
Scroll down for more
Laura Moon discovered she had four kidneys when she had an ultrasound
Laura , a customer services adviser from Leeds , said : " I think if I 've got four , I do n't need all four .
Why not donate if there 's someone else in need ?
" I hope I can help somebody else while I am young .
I will do everything in my power to become a donor . "
It is not known why people develop multiple , or duplex , organs but one in 125 people have one extra kidney , normally a partial organ .
Laura 's condition often causes the patient no problems , although sufferers can be more prone to urinary infections .
She discovered she had the unusual anatomy six months ago when she was undergoing tests following a road accident .
" I was in a car crash a year ago and six months later I began having a lot of pain in my stomach .
My GP referred me to the hospital for a scan . "
Doctors at Seacroft Hospital in Leeds carried out the procedure .
" I realised that the doctor scanning me had n't said anything for a long time .
I thought he was going to give me bad news , " said Laura .
" The guy just said ' You have got four kidneys ' .
" He measured them and I have two which are 14cm and two which are 9 cm .
" Then he also asked if I would mind if he took some photos to show to university students . "
Transplant surgeon Niaz Ahmad , from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS
Trust , said parts of the kidney system could be duplicated but he had never seen anyone with four full kidney systems .
" To have completely duplex kidneys on both sides is extremely rare , " he said .
By coincidence Laura 's aunt Dawn Fry has a third kidney - although the pair are not blood related .
Consultant urological surgeon Dr Robyn Webber , of Fife Acute Hospitals , said many extra kidneys are fully functional , meaning Laura should be able to donate .
Dr Webber added : " It is a relatively rare condition .
Ordinarily they are left alone unless the patient is suffering any problems .
But Laura will be able to manage perfectly well with two so assuming they are working correctly there is no reason why she should n't donate them . "
According to the UK Transplant organisation , living donor kidney transplants now represent more than one in four of all such operations .
It ’s amazing how celebrities change with time .
Most of them started their career as kids , and it is so fun to compare young stars back then and now .

A Bear Crawling Obstacle Course
I live a different kind of lifestyle .
And no , that has nothing to do with my sexuality .
And no , I do n’t expect you to care about my personal life .
But it is relevant to you , in that I found a great way to target your upper body , using nothing more than the stuff you already have lying around .
See , I was out in my yard waiting for someone the other day , and I got bored .
And fortunately , this time my axe was safely stowed in the shed .
No threat to my homeowner ’s insurance here .
But as you probably do not know , I have lots of logs and stumps in my yard – it ’s a lifestyle choice , respect it .
Being the type who likes to mix up my workouts , I decided to see how far I could get in pushup position .
Putting my feet up on my porch , I did a brief set of pushups .
Crawling to a nearby stump and putting my hands on it ( feet on the ground ) , I did another short set .
After only that many , my muscles were starting to burn .
I hit muscle failure after less than four sets .
Either I ’d gone all sissy , or I ’d stumbled on a good idea .
Try this out :
1 . Find six stable objects that are at least 8 inches high .
2. Arrange them in a line , so that you can crawl from one to the next .
3 . Starting with your feet on one of these objects , do a short set of pushups ( say , 10 ) .
4. Crawl a little ways , so that you can put your hands on another raised object , and do another set .
5. Continue crawling and doing your sets until you hit muscle failure .
By basically doing a super set that works both your upper and lower chest ( as well as most of your lats ) , you can get your upper body cooked in a hurry .
And on top of the pushups themselves , remember that the crawling means you are n’t “ just resting ” in between sets .
I ’d like to know how far you guys can get with this “ bear crawling obstacle course . ”
Am I a wimp ?
This will not be a real recipe .
It ’s getting warmer and warmer here , which makes people prefer more fresh and light foods .
In Winter we need warm soups with various ingredients while we do n’t want to have that heavy dishes in Summer .
Salads and fresh beverages are in favor in hot days .
Besides salads , we also love to have breakfast in the early evening in Summer .
Breakfast is n’t the name of meal here .
If you have sliced tomatoes , cucumbers and green peppers , black and green olives , cheese and tea on your table , it ’s called breakfast .
So not the time , but the foods on your table identify this name .
It ’s possible to enrich your breakfast table with egg salad , potato salad , grilled or fried vegetables .
Zucchini is more preferable for us to fry as it absorbs less oil .
So I just wanted to give you an idea of Summer dish in this post .
You know there is no difficulty in frying vegetables , so I will not give any ingredients with exact measurements .
I generally fry 2 middle sized zucchinis for hubby and me .
I chop zucchinis in circles , heat vegetable oil in a large pot , sprinkle a little salt on zucchini coins just before throwing them into hot oil .
If you sprinkle salt earlier , it may become watery .
So if your pot is not big enough to fry all zucchini coins at a time , add salt on just the pile of coins you are going to fry .
And repeat it for each pile until all coins finish .
Zucchini is the quickest vegetable to fry , so do n’t overfry them .
They will be fried in a few minutes .
Take them on a paper towel to leave the excessive oil on it .
Fried zucchini might sound heavy for Summer days , but when you have it with a yogurt dressing , it becomes a fresh and more appealing dish for your breakfast table .
We always have it with cheese , sliced tomatoes , cucumbers , green peppers and herbs like parsley , fresh mint , fresh basil or dill .
We always squeeze lemon on these herbs .
And if we have a pot of newly brewed black tea besides these , we are the happiest couple !
If you need a little more awesome in your weekend , then try this :
I know I 've been posting quite a few Saturn images from Cassini , but I really like this one .
It shows the big round moon Rhea , the lumpy small moon Janus , and a lovely view of the foreshortened rings .
Both moons were on the far side of the rings , well over 1 million kilometers away , when Cassini took this shot .
Rhea is over 1500 km ( 900 miles ) in diameter , while Janus is only about 180 km ( 110 miles ) across .
For comparison , our own Moon 's diameter is almost 3500 km ( 2100 miles ) .
Just last year , the rings were edge - on to the Sun .
In the months since , as Saturn slowly orbits our star , the Sun has begun shining down on the northern side of the rings .
Cassini was just above the ring plane when it took this shot , catching the sunlight reflected off the rings .
From this narrow angle , you can see the rings are divided into countless smaller ringlets , bright and dark sections carved into shape by the gravitational forces of the planet and its dozens of moons .
I love how the top of Rhea is playing hide - and - seek in the rings .
And look how dark the rocky Janus is compared to the icy Rhea !
Even at a glance you can see that Saturn 's environment is an amazingly rich and diverse place .
Cassini 's observations will keep planetary astronomers busy for decades ... and provide the rest of us with a glimpse of the beauty and awe just waiting to be uncovered .

This is about the 4th or 5th article I ’ve seen suggesting that increasing technology use is undermining our capacity to focus .
I ’m afraid to say I ’ve found it somewhat borne out by my personal experience .
But this post is n’t about me .
It ’s about the striking fact that increasingly , we “ spend the vast majority of each day staring at , interacting with , and deriving satisfaction from glowing rectangles . ”
We could , if we wished , lament this as modern decadence , or else minimise it , as a transitional phase , the first shock of information technology on unprepared humanity that will be corrected in time .
But I ’m going to suggest , jokingly but mindful that much truth is said in jest , a different interpretation – that this is a tendency towards the more - or - less total abolition of the human individual , and that we should welcome this .
Because what does it tell us , that humans should become so enraptured with , get so much pleasure from , ‘ glowing rectangles ’ ?
Remember , these rectangles do n’t give pleasure via .
taste , or smell , or stimulation of the skin or the muscles .
They give pleasure via . manipulation of information .
Everything you do on a computer , with the possible exceptions of 1 ) listening to music , and 2 ) looking at porn , gives pleasure , if at all , by allowing the mind to manipulate information .
Information technology allows us cerebral beings to largely ignore the skin - bone - muscle user - interface we ’ve used for so long .
But if the human mind finds its greatest satisfaction in the manipulation of information , then is n’t the best image of a human utopia one of people endlessly communicating , passing information between each other and processing it ?
Forget eating , fighting , walking , athletics , waving our hands and noses and entrails around – we ’ll just be plugged in , because that ’s actually what we want .
But should this grand network be merely a disorganised and chaotic one – indeed , could it long remain one ?
Or should it not rather tend towards organisation as an overall information - processing system , connecting its parts so as to function as a whole .
But that , my friend , is just a larger brain – if human brains are fit by nature to get pleasure from information - processing , then they are fit by nature to be components of a larger brain .
And this puts the much - reported downsides of our increasing communicative powers in a new light .
Suppose it ’s true that many people find it destructive of concentration , of attention span or even creativity .
These are precisely the virtues that our brains need in order to function as independent units .
Do we demand that our individual neurons display creativity or focus or deep thought as individuals ?
No – we recognise that they do n’t need that because their relations to each other supply it instead .
Similarly , what if technology weakens ‘ focus ’ because , in preparing us for our role as components of a larger brain , it makes focus obsolete ?
Should we be frightened by the possibility of our subsumption into a greater brain ?
Clearly we are – when a ‘ hive mind ’ appears in fiction it tends to be sinister , terrifying , a wave of ‘ mindless ’ robots or insectoid monsters .
But maybe this is just prejudice .
Why would a larger , stronger , smarter , more confident mind be more vicious , more grim , more voracious , than we are ?
Why should n’t it , instead , be more wise , more playful , more inquisitive and friendly , more interesting and creative , etc . ?
But maybe our real fear is what things will be like ‘ for us ’ .
Well , what is it like for your right hemisphere at the moment ?
What is it like for your cerebellum ?
Are they unhappy ?
Do you regret that you deprive them of their independence ?
I do n’t .
Moreover , if the driver of this process is how willing people are to spend time looking at glowing rectangles , should n’t be suppose that this experience , and what ’s most attractive about it , is the best guide to the end result ?
That would suggest that being a small part of a large mind is , phenomenologically , like playing a very well - designed game , or exercising a well - developed skill – the sort of completely ‘ absorbed ’ attunement to an evolving task in which we forget ourselves entirely .
( Forget ourselves , and remember ourself ? )
That suggests that it will probably be lots of fun .
So perhaps we should welcome our transformation from the paltry individuals we are into a 10,000 - times greater individual , who will probably be less neurotic and have better taste in music than we do .
Perhaps we should encourage it : people of the world , unite !
If you are a Sprint Hero owner and want the latest official 2.1 update baked into a custom ROM with root , then you currently have only one alternative - the Fresh ROM .
Custom ROMs For The Hero
There are pretty much only 2 main Sprint Hero custom ROMs - DamageControl ( by damageless and TrevE ) and Fresh ( by flipz ) .
Both are very good , have an excellent track record , and great communities behind them .
I 've personally been using DamageControl on my Hero but post - official 2.1 update , flipz has moved a little faster than damageless and TrevE , and incorporated it into his Fresh ROM pretty much on the next day , while DamageControl is still stuck at 2.08.1 .
The Fresh ROM , just like DamageControl , comes already rooted , which is a huge plus .
As far as I know , there is currently no standalone way to root a stock 2.1
Hero , other than by installing one of these custom pre-rooted ROMs .
If I understand it correctly , you would be able to upgrade to the Fresh ROM in the following situations :
you already have a rooted OS , such as 1.5 with the root hack or a previous version of DamageControl or Fresh
you 've had a rooted OS before at one point and flashed a custom recovery image that allows installation of custom ROMs
The only situation in which you cannot install a custom ROM then seems to be if you have never rooted your phone , never flashed recovery , and already upgraded to the official 2.1 .
In this case , you will have to wait for a standalone hack applicable to 2.1 .
Fresh ROM
Here is some information about the Fresh ROM from the official description :

Why have CEO salaries skyrocketed over the past 20 years ?
Much of the blame lies in the practice of compensation benchmarking , say the authors of a study to be published next week in the American Journal of Sociology .
Benchmarking is a standard practice in American corporations .
When setting pay , compensation committees use peer groups of executives at comparable firms to establish a " fair " market wage their CEOs .
But according to the study , led by sociologist Thomas DiPrete from Columbia University , a few CEOs each year " leapfrog " their peers by getting huge raises that have little to do with the performance of their companies .
Other companies then use the oversized pay of leapfroggers in subsequent benchmarks .
Over time , this ratchets up pay for everyone through a " contagion effect . "
" We show that rising CEO pay is not simply a function of what individual companies do , but is influenced by the behavior of leapfroggers at other firms , " DiPrete said .
DiPrete and his colleagues ( including a former CEO ) used procedures laid out in compensation handbooks to reconstruct likely peer groups for CEOs listed in Standard and Poor 's annual compensation surveys .
They could then look for evidence of leapfrogging in those likely peer groups over time .
Their simulation shows that leapfrogging explains about half of the overall increase in CEO pay from 1992 to 2006 .
The researchers say that the finding broadens the debate about what is driving CEO salaries upward .
Opinions on the subject have generally fallen into two camps : those who think CEOs are overpaid because of failures in corporate governance at individual firms , and those who think CEOs are paid what they deserve based on the profits they deliver to shareholders and a " superstar " labor market .
However , this study shows that ill - gotten raises for a few CEOs can lead to " legitimate " pay increases for others .
" [ T ] he linkages among firms produced by the benchmarking process guarantee that firm - level governance failure becomes a factor in the environment of other firms , " the researchers write .
Following the Enron and WorldCom scandals of the early 2000s , the Securities and Exchange Commission changed its rules to require firms to disclose benchmarking information .
The research team is now using the new data mandated by the SEC to better understand how the network structure of peer groups affects executive pay setting in American corporations .
" Whether the SEC regulatory change reduces the ratcheting effect of leapfrogging on CEO pay -- creating more transparency about who is in the peer group and at what level the company is benchmarking -- is an important question for future research " says DiPrete .

If you were a member of the popular Electronic music torrent tracker Elektronik.ro , here ’s some bad news – in fact , its the worst kind of news that could be associated with a BitTorrent tracker .
ELEK is shutting down and it ’s unlikely that the site will ever return .
A news post on the homepage cites ‘ obvious reasons ’ as the cause for shutdown – however , we ’re not quite sure what those obvious reasons might be .
The site did not seem to have any donation issues and it ’s unlikely that they ran into legal trouble .
However a bad hosting provider could be a fine guess as ELEK suffered from frequent downtimes in the past couple of months .
Either way this tracker will be missed by it ’s loyal members – this definitely was one of the best places on the net to find and download EDM ( Electronic Dance Music ) .
Quoted below is the full announcement posted on site homepage :
a few days ago we decided to close elektronik , so here we are .
as you can see , all the torrents and torrents related content are unavailable .
forum and shoutbox are still opened and will stay like this for a while , so if you need to contact other users , now 's the time to do it .
chances for elektronik to come back are very slim to none for reasons that were obvious in the last period .
that 's about it .
thanks a lot for this great community .
thanks to all those people that helped us .
/ elektronik staff ( marrat , Sebi , derek , Eddie , frigideru , Lebe )
Although the site is currently online , most of the functionality has already been axed as mentioned in the new post .
Elektronik is one of the oldest private music trackers and has been online since mid 2005 .
If memory serves correct , the site tracked around 15000 active torrents before the shut down .
It ’s too bad the site wo n’t be around for it ’s fifth birthday which would have been in just a couple more months .
R.I.P. ELEK , thanks for the music .

It looks like this young man is taking a dangerous leap into the unknown as a massive chasm opens up in the middle of a shopping mall .
In fact , it is an amazing piece of 3D street art that has been produced for a theme park that is being built in China .
Leap into the unknown : A visitor jumps over the 3d artwork at the theme park in Hai'an , Jiangsu province , China Already it has proved a huge hit with visitors despite the fact that the rather laboriously - named Hai'an Culture Industry Theme Park in Nantong City is still to be completed .
The master of the 3D pavement genre is street artist Kurt Wenner .
The American 's three - dimensional chalk pictures have included muses swimming in a pond by the side of a road in Lucernes , Switzerland , a Judgement Day scene in a medieval town square , and most recently a virtual Renaissance city painted on the pavement in Bettona , Italy .
Position : Defenseman
Age : 18
Date of Birth : February 20 , 1992
Place of Birth : Burnsville , MN , USA

Shoots : Left
Jarred Tinordi is a big defenseman playing for the US NTDP in the USHL .
He is a teammate of fellow draftee goalie Jack Campbell .
At 18 , Tinordi is being praised for his leadership ( note the " C " in the picture ) .
Son of former NHL'er Mark Tinordi , hockey in his blood , literally .
He 's big and strong , but it comes at a price .
2009 /2010 Regular Season Stats :
GP G A PTS +/- PIM 26 4 5 9 14 68
Scouting Report ( The Scouting Report ) :
Tinordi has all the intangibles that would excite any scout .
He ’s huge and has great leadership abilities as he is wearing the " C " .
Tinordi also seemed aware on the ice and has good hockey sense …. defensively .
Offensively , Tinordi struggled on the point as well .
In addition to the blocked shots , Tinordi clearly does not have the agility that his fellow defenseman have .
Tinordi is an awkward skater without good balance and footwork .
He will need to improve upon his skating and puck skills when he ’s at Notre Dame .
He ’s clearly a project that if he works out , will be a force on an NHL blueline .
There is just a lot of work to be done .
Why he'd be a good fit in Columbus :
Yet another kid in the draft we here at the Cannon do n't see fitting in .
Yes , his size is a huge plus but he does n't seem to be able to harness it .
His scouting report tells me he can be a liability on the ice .
With the defensemen we have , ones that could be acquired in Free Agency , plus the inevitable debut of John Moore , Tinordi will have to call somewhere else home .
Tinordi in Action :
No videos of Jarred can be found , but here 's one of his father , Mark Tinordi .
The elder Tinordi faces off with a ( very , very ) young Brendan Shannahan .
My two dads : Gay penguins adopt an egg and hatch a chick
Two ' gay ' male penguins have hatched an egg and are rearing the adopted chick .
The birds , at Bremerhaven Zoo in northern Germany , were given an egg rejected by its biological parents .
Named ' Z ' and ' Vielpunkt ' , the penguins became famous when they refused to separate or to mate with females .
Joachim Schoene , a zoo vet , said ; ' Another pair abandoned an egg by pushing it out of their nest and so we placed it in the care of the homosexual penguins .
Daddy 's chick :
The baby penguin in its cave at the Bremerhaven Zoo in northern Germany .
It has been adopted by two gay - and proud - male penguins
' They accepted the egg immediately and took turns in incubating it with their body heat .
They did this for 35 days and the baby was born on April 25 .
' It is in a little cave in the enclosure which is fiercely guarded by one or the other at all times so we do n't know yet if we have a little boy penguin or a little girl one . '
The two daddies feed their offspring with fish mash that they chew up and regurgitate into its ever - open beak .
Sorry , not allowed : Humboldt penguins Z and Vielpunkt stand guard at the entrance to the cave .
They have protected their new chick so fiercely that zoo officials have not even been able to ascertain if the chick is a male or female yet
Mr Schoene added : ' In eight weeks the baby will have its downy fur and be able to be removed to move about the colony . '
Bremerhaven Zoo in northern Germany made headlines in 2005 as it investigated homosexual traits in penguins .
Gay rights activists were outraged after the zoo flew in female penguins to try to get them to reproduce with three pairs of male penguins who had been seen trying to mate with one another and hatch chicks from stones .
But now the zoo has relented , leaving the six gay penguins to live happily with their chosen mates - Z and Vielpunkt among them .
One of the few godsends in this pandemic has been the fact that we can take care of a lot of our personal business online — from ordering food to meeting with health - care providers .
But if the eye - doctor lobby gets its way in Congress , many Americans will be forced to make otherwise unnecessary trips to an optometrist ’s office whenever they need to refill their contact lens prescriptions .
This is just the latest skirmish in a decades - long rearguard action that optometrists have been fighting to protect their lucrative industry from disruption .
Lawmakers should see through the effort and side with consumers .
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in Washington , Friday , Feb. 19 , 2010 .

The Minnesota Supreme Court 's decision to reverse some of Gov. Tim Pawlenty 's budget cuts is a serious blow to his efforts to fix the state 's sagging finances .
The ruling may also have crimped his wider political ambitions .
For months , Pawlenty has been traveling the country talking about his work .
He 's on a list of possible 2012 presidential candidates , and wherever he goes , he walks some familiar political ground .
Pawlenty often talks about his single - handed efforts to solve the state 's budget crisis , in what 's known as unallotment -- his power to cut the state budget or delay payments without the Legislature 's approval .
" We talk a lot about spending , and the deficit and the debt , " Pawlenty told attendees at a fundraiser or the Alabama Republican Party in February .
" So 49 states have to balance their budget -- constitutionally required , " Pawlenty said .
" It works .
I mean , it 's difficult .
We gotta make tough decisions .
We gotta fight with legislators .
I unilaterally unalloted almost $ 3 billion .
I got sued .
I 'm in litigation .
It 's a big battle , but it gets done . "
And now , it 's been undone .

A gift of $ 17 makes a difference .
The state Supreme Court ruling struck down Pawlenty 's withdrawal of funding for a nutrition program for the poor .
That decision could unwind his entire plan to solve a $ 2.7 billion budget crisis a year ago .
By a 4 - 3 majority , the court said the governor exceeded his statutory authority when he balanced the state budget on his own after the Legislature adjourned .
" This was the ace up his sleeve , but the card 's gone now , and it 's hard to know now how this will all work out , " said Steven Schier , a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield .
" He can't really point to that sort of fiscal accomplishment as sort of a distinguishing characteristic of his campaign .
It 's not really there any more . "
Schier thinks it 'll be hard to come up with another victory , with less than two weeks left in the legislative session .
Given the court 's decision , the state is back to square one on a budget deficit expected to top $ 3 billion .
Pawlenty still counts unallotment as a victory .
" We took matters into our own hands , because we did n't have the Legislature agreeing with us last summer , " he told reporters after the court 's decision .
" So it remains true that we attempted to deal with it on my own . "
Political observers say that may very well be good enough .
Although Pawlenty can't claim to have single - handedly righted the state 's financial ship , he 'll receive credit among the nation 's Republican faithful for trying , said Jennifer Duffy , a political analyst with the Washington - based Cook Political Report .
" He can talk about the process of how budgeting is done , and how governors probably need more authority than they already have , " Duffy said .
" He can run on the need for a line - item veto .
And while it certainly would be better to run with it as a major accomplishment , there 's some mileage to be had . "
Also , there are some aspects of the court decision that may work in Pawlenty 's favor .
Ben Smith , who writes a national politics blog for Politico.com , said the court 's decision has a political upside for the governor , who is trying to raise his national profile .
" It highlights the fact that he 's fighting , " Smith said .
" The conflict in a way in the sense that he fought this all the way up to the top court and that 's what Republicans want to see . "
Beyond that , the decision could cast Pawlenty as an unbending opponent not just of taxes , but also of what Republicans consider ' judicial activism , ' Smith said .
Even though one of his own court appointments , Chief Justice Eric Magnuson , wrote the ruling against his unallotment decision , the governor has already started making that case .
" Well , the decision itself is certainly disappointing .
I disagree with it strongly , " Pawlenty said of the ruling .
" When you have a statute that is at worst ambiguous , you should defer to the statute , to a minimalist interpretation of it .
Instead a group of judges on the court took an expansive interpretation and I think it's an unfortunate , unwise decision . "
Pawlenty is expected to meet with legislative leaders today to try to come up with a fiscal alternative to the unallotment struck down by the court .
Everyone 's favorite octogenarian hosted SNL tonight , in what was probably one of the best episodes of all time .
It all started with the opening sketch :
Tina Fey , Amy Poehler , Maya Rudolph , Rachel Dratch , Ana Gasteyer , Rachel Dratch and Molly Shannon all returned to get the show off to a great start .
Not that Betty needed any help .
She 's a real class act , her opening monologue was like an old - time opening , nothing offensive or stupid , just funny jokes and great delivery .
While I watch , all I can think is how this woman is 88 and 1 /2 years old and she 's up there dancing around with people half her age .
Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon jumped right back into their roles in their Delicious Dish sketch .
The sketch was so on - point and perfectly executed .
I thought the jokes would seem tired because it 's obvious what the sketch is about but the writers really seemed to pull it together .
When Molly Shannon looks at the camera and says " Your muffin just squirted in my mouth " it is just surreal , one of the best SNL sketches of the decade and better than " schweaty balls " .
Bravo :P
Towards the end of the episode
Fey popped up in a few sketches and also guest - starred in weekly update .
It was Ok .
The Census Worker sketch made up for it though .
They sent off Betty in a great way at the end by giving her flowers .
She did a terrific job and I really hope she hosts again .
All in all , a great episode .
I do n't see how Alec Baldwin can top it but I 'm sure he 'll have the entire 30 rock crew to help him .
Next week 's finale is going to be BOMB ( that means good ) , that 's what the kids are saying these days , or so I 've heard ...
Look it up .
Update :
Check out these clips from the dress rehearsal that never made the air .
The first is a Debbie Downer sketch starring Rachel Dratch .

[ SC2B ] Gas Matters Text by Arrian
Do n't get comfortable Aldaris .
You 're going to be chastising many a Protoss for not having enough gas for many years to come .
Do n't let the extra geyser fool you .
Things have changed in so far as concerns our favorite gaseous resource , vespane gas , and in quite a few far reaching and profound ways .
And it 's not just Aldaris who needs to be on his toes .
Every race has been affected by the changes made to resource collection in general , not just vespane gas , and the consequences are large .
Although most will know this , here is a summary to the basic changes to gas collection :
geysers now return only 4 gas a trip
every main and expo in the map pool has 2 geysers
geysers are 75 minerals ( 25 for zerg + the assumed 50 for the drone )
geysers return no gas once depleted
So naturally this plays much differently in terms of teching , but with some interesting options .
These changes make gas collection more graded , which in Brood War was accomplished by yanking miners off the geyser .
That reduced the collection rate substantially , and it was only with real purpose that workers would be taken from gas .
Thus , in Brood War , gas , more or less throughout the game , had 2 gears : high or none .
Yes , Terrans would pull SCVs in the opening but the majority of every match had 3 on gas once the mining structure was complete .
But that 's not so in SC2 .
There are debates about how heavily to invest in gas , when , and what the best combination is .
To this end , I did a detailed analysis of gas collection rates with the 9 possible ( read , reasonable ) combinations of gas collection based on the number of geysers used ( in parentheses ) and the number of miners used .
Granted this analysis is limited in scope .
While I strongly suspect there are no differences in gas collection rates between the races , my analysis was limited only to Terran , on Lost Temple at 6 o'clock .
Of course , I am assuming that these are typical geyser positions and there are no differences between the gas collection rates between the races , and there were other moderate sources of error , namely a non-uniform starting place for the gas collection , but this is normed by the large number of data points and the absolute nature of gas collection .
Thus , by linear regression , an approximation of the rate of gas collection can be ascertained , but more importantly , its relation to other methods of gas collection .
In the spoiler is the raw data table .
If people want to analyze the replays from which I got these data , I can release those as well .
+ Show Spoiler +
Below are the individual data points as they stack up .
Some error in imperfect data collection is visible but the overall pattern is fairly stable , and the conclusions are both rather intuitive and fairly reasonable .
As noted above , the number of geysers taken is in parentheses and the number of miners collecting gas is beside it .
A few things to note before going on to the conclusions :
The rate gas collection from 3 ( 1 ) and 4 ( 1 ) are identical .
3 miners saturates 1 geyser completely for all intents and purposes .
In Brood War the rate of gas collection of 4 vs 3 was approximately 4 more gas for every 200 , so the difference between 3 ( 1 ) and 4 ( 1 ) has not significantly changed between Brood War and SC2 .
The number of data points is uneven for each , although each has an acceptable minimum from which to draw conclusions .
In order to better standardize the collection rates , measurement began after the first gas trip was concluded , which is why every line begins above 0 .
All are at 4 excepting 5 ( 2 ) where both miners completed their first trips at identical times to start at 8 .
So , with that out of the way , it is generally true that the graph validates the intuitions of most players and many conclusions carry over from Brood War .
Despite how obvious many of these may seem to be , it is important to note every one of them because SC2 is a different game , and the changes to resource collection have been substantial .
So , taking nothing for granted , to make everything prettier and easier to read , I will once again bullet the conclusions :
With the exception of 4 ( 1 ) and 3 ( 1 ) , having more miners on gas increases the gas collection rate .
You do not see the line for 3 ( 1 ) because it perfectly overlaps with 4 ( 1 ) .
There is no significant difference between 2 miners on separate geysers and having 2 miners on the same geyser ( see the lines for 2 ( 2 ) and 2 ( 1 ) ) .
Possibly the most interesting conclusion from the graph is the difference between 3 ( 2 ) and 3 ( 1 ) .
The collection rate of 3 ( 2 ) is significantly faster than that of 3 ( 1 ) .
This would seem to make sense ; miners have a brief idle period in 3 ( 1 ) that is not realized in 3 ( 2 ) , allowing for faster gas collection .
There are clear ' don'ts ' for gas collection as relates to mineral economy ; 4 ( 1 ) , 2 ( 2 ) , and possibly 1 ( 1 ) waste a disproportionate amount of time or minerals per gas gained .
Now is an appropriate time for an aside .
I chose the Lost Temple 6 o'clock because it has a fairly typical mining distance , but not all geysers are created equal .
Some , like those on Metalopolis , have very short distances and can run at much greater efficiency than those on Kulas Ravine , for example .
In instances where the distances are shorter , the difference in the rate of collection between 3 ( 1 ) and 3 ( 2 ) is more exaggerated because there is a longer layover for the 3rd miner and because 2 miners is already very efficient , but on those where the distances to the gas are longer the difference is mitigated somewhat by the shorter layover .
The exact collection rates , however , are far more useful to draw conclusions from .
SC2 replays give vague and imprecise collection rates under the ' income ' tab which are hardly of any significant utility to a player trying to decide when to pull miners off gas , how many miners are needed , and when to start a second geyser , especially in - game .
The following are the collection rates based on linear regressions from data of the chart above .
The b values have all been dropped because they do n't mean anything aside from the consequences of my norming , and remember that the m value ( the rate ) is in vespane gas / second , but since vespane gas is n't collected continuously but rather in chunks of 4 these rates are only useful in so far as they are compared to other rates of the same units and wo n't give you measures in seconds on when you can most closely time your Orbital Command , for example .
That having been said , here they are :
1(1 ) | 0.74 gas/ second
2(1 ) | 1.50 gas/ second
2(2 ) | 1.48 gas/ second
3 (1 ) | 2.00 gas/ second
3 ( 2 ) | 2.23 gas/ second
4(2 ) | 3.05 gas/ second
5 ( 2 ) | 3.33 gas/ second
6 (2 ) | 3.94 gas/ second
Several things stand out from this .
First , as could be expected , having 2 miners on the same gas doubles the collection rate , and having 2 miners on 2 separate gas does the same .
However , noticeably , having 3 miners on the same gas does not triple the collection rate , but having 2 on 1 gas and 1 on the other does ( because of the aforementioned brief traffic jam on a saturated geyser ) .
Having 4 gas on 2 quadruples the collection rate , but again upon saturation of 1 the collection rate does not gain as much , and further unto the saturation of a second .
Perhaps more useful here would be to look at a somewhat unusual comparison , but paradoxically far more comprehensible to your average player , being seconds / gas .
Essentially , we 're just flipping the previous collection rates on their heads to get something far more useful out of it .
The following is how many seconds there are between gas returns .
1(1 ) | 5.40 seconds
2(1 ) | 2.66 seconds
2( 2 ) | 2.70 seconds ( * this is not a significant difference from 2 ( 1 ) )
3 (1 ) | 2.00 seconds
3 ( 2 ) | 1.79 seconds
4( 2 ) | 1.31 seconds
5 ( 2 ) | 1.20 seconds
6 (2 ) | 1.00 seconds
Now , a very compelling pattern emerges here , one that looks like an exponential function .
I took this and graphed it .
Now , naturally , the actual data is more accurate than the function , and several manipulations removed from the actual data we 're really getting into abstractions here , but the below graph essentially tells us that the amount of time exponentially decreases with each added miner per the function ( calculated via exponential regression ) f(x ) =8.02477326e^-.4418030032x
The graph bears some discussion .
Naturally , the actual utility of the graph cuts off after 6 , because geysers are saturated at 3 .
The fit also is n't perfect , especially because 3 ( 2 ) is quite anomalous to the pattern and is also very difficult to precisely compensate for , but the graph does reflect the effect that adding additional miners has on the speed of gas returns .
What this means for actual play could be very significant , or not so much .
Gas always seems to be in high demand , and its collection is far more limited than mineral collection , but the amount of options in adjusting collection rates and the varying methods of investment allow intriguing possibilites for opening timing windows or interesting transitions .
Essentially , what the gas changes have meant to play thus far is that there no longer need be just two settings for a player 's gas collection , that you can alter and adjust the rate of gas collection based on needs and especially transitions and openings .
This graph shows the value of each miner relative to the next or the one before it , and perhaps can , with care , be used to calculate more precise timings and adjustments for gas needs .
With all of this information we can also calculate which early gas is most cost efficient per minerals invested .
With this , we actually use the rate of gas collection because it 's easier to think about ( in my opinion ) .
Below is a friendly table that will make everything prettier to look at .
Unfortunately the table is the organized more by the scrambled nature of my brain than any real organizing principle so things may not be immediately apparent .
Some things , as with the other graphs and pretty pictures , should stand out immediately , though .
Namely , the value of adding just one more miner to gas early is huge .
For 40 % of the initial investment , there is a 100 % increase in returns .
Also , there 's hardly any reason to construct two early gas if only 2 miners will be dedicated to them .
Most SC players know this of course , but I 've seen it .
The most interesting datum is the 3 ( 1 ) v 3 ( 2 ) contrast .
For 75 % of the investment , ~ 90 % of the gas is returned .
So , while 3 ( 2 ) does mine significantly better than 3 ( 1 ) , it is probably not worth the investment .
Some other conclusions may be gleaned , but this would n't be fun if I just told you everything , now would it ?
The most important thing to remember is that this is an examination of a single race , on a single map , at a single starting position , in the beta test .
Because also these data were largely meant to influence how the opening can play out and options for tech , I did not do any testing on the high yield geysers included in the map editor or any testing on the varying distances that the geysers are from the spawn location .
While the conclusions from this examination can likely be extrapolated across many other situations , there is no guarantee that they can , and as much stock should be placed in this as it deserves .
And those are the gas matters .
EDIT : There seems to be a fair bit of confusion about the graph .
Just so everyone is clear , I should have put a domain on it and cut it off after 6 , or simply edited the image to go no further , but as it stands , my MSPaint skills are marginal at best .
Of course , I never meant for the graph to mean anything before 1 or after 6 , and some people were confused by this .
I submit this as my correction .

Spoilers ahead , Losties .
SERIOUS MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD .
IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED “ THE CANDIDATE , ” STOP READING RIGHT NOW .
But back to your thoughts .
“ Forget the title of the episode .
‘ The Candidate ’ had absolutely nothing to do with finding and naming Jacob ’s replacement and instead had everything to do with making me feel really , really , REALLY crappy !
How dare they take down Jin and Sun in a sinking submarine !
How dare they make the Korean couple ’s daughter Ji-Yeon an orphan !
And how dare they kill Sayid !
So what if he died a heroic death and by trying to smother the Locke- ness Monster ’s bomb ?
He ’s Sayid !
We love him !
Why did they have to die ?
WHY ? ”
“ Because now you know this show is willing and capable of killing anyone , ” says Damon Lindelof , suddenly materializing in my office in a puff of brimstone accompanied by Carlton Cuse .
( Actually , that is n’t true .
I interviewed the producers over hamburgers … but I ’ll tell you that boring story in Friday ’s Doc Jensen column .
On with the important stuff ! )
Why was it so important for Lost to prove that it can be downright homicidal during its last season ?
To establish once and for all that the Locke- ness Monster is the true villain of season 6 and quite possibly all of Lost .
“ There is no ambiguity , ” says Cuse .
“ He is evil and he has to be stopped . ”
Or , as Terry O’Quinn told me in a recent interview : “ Puffy is one nasty mo - fo . ”
To be clear , the producers are not heartless bastards .
They ’re only semi-heartless bastards .
They knew fans would be devastated ( and angry ) about the deaths and were pretty broken up themselves about offing three beloved creations .
“ When we watched the death scenes ourselves , it was brutal , ” says Cuse .
“ [ But ] the story always comes first . ”
Lindelof elaborates : “ In many ways , the season was structured as a long con on behalf of the Man In Black .
Once we revealed that Locke was the Monster , we knew the audience would immediately mistrust him , and we would have to spend at least a dozen episodes of Locke trying to convince the audience that he did not have malevolent intention , that all he wanted to do was get off The Island .
But everything he was doing was leading up to one moment , which was [ trying to ] get the candidates in one fell swoop .
He knew if he killed just one of them , everyone would know what he was up to . ' ”
Says Cuse : “ There will be very little debate at the end of this episode that [ Fake Locke ] is evil and bad and has to be stopped .
The main narrative reason for him killing our main characters is to establish how much of a bad guy he is and to clearly identify him as the antagonist rolling into the end of the series . ”
Lindelof recognizes that there ’s something “ brutal ” about killing Jin and Sun just one episode after their long - awaited reunion — which , he says , is exactly what made the lovers such an apt choice for making a statement about Fake Locke ’s malevolence .
“ At least they got to die in each other ’s arms , so they ’d have some sense of victory , ” he says .
And Sayid ?
Lindelof explains : “ Sayid ’s entire season - long arc has basically been , if you tell him that he is evil , you can convince him he is evil .
But if you tell him he is good , maybe you can convince him he is good .
We basically decided that in a moment of pure instinct , if he did something , if he sacrificed his own life in favor of saving the other people ’s lives , that would convey to the audience , ‘ This guy was actually a good guy . ' ”
The good news for fans of Lost and fans of Jin , Sun , and Sayid in particular is that they are technically still alive — in the Sideways world .
“ Still , it ’s bittersweet , ” Yunjin Kim told me in a recent interview .
“ They were kept separate for so long , and then they came together to die together . ”
She found it “ beautiful ” that Sun and Jin were given an end that served as an affirmation of their love and the heroic sacrifices they made for each other .
“ We ’ve come full circle , ” she says .
“ Sun came back to The Island [ and ] risked her life to save her friends and Jin , and then Jin does the same thing back . ”
When I asked her how she prepared for Sun ’s final Island moments , Kim told this story : “ Right before we started shooting , [ director ]
Jack Bender took me aside and told me about story that he read a long time ago , about this woman who was missing her dead husband , and how she had this beach ball that he blew up before he died .
Every day she took a little breath from the beach ball .
And that really got me right into the emotional core of where I needed to be to play that scene .
Can you imagine that woman , taking that breath little by little every day , just to feel her husband ’s presence ? ”
Daniel Dae Kim ’s thoughts on the end of Jin and Sun ?
“ They were the Romeo and Juliet of the show , and the fact they did n’t have a happy ending does make me sad , ” says the actor , who then expanded on the greater significance of the deaths to the show — but I ’m afraid sharing his insights ( including his take on the fate of Ji Yeon ) at this point would be a bit too spoilerish .
What was it like shooting his watery demise ?
“ It was pretty difficult that day , ” says Kim .
“ Shooting in water is never easy .
But the crew was considerate and made the water warm for us , in more ways than one .
Let ’s just say certain members of the crew who were in that water for a very , very , very long time without ever leaving .
I ’ll just leave it at that . ”
Now that ’s evil .
I ’m still processing the chilling events of “ The Candidate , ” and my own thoughts and feelings about the deaths of Sun , Jin , and Sayid .
My recap of the episode will post sometime tomorrow .
In the meantime , use the message boards below to start the discussion — and express your grief .
We 're still waiting on the official announcement , but The Miami Herald 's George Richards reported yesterday that the Florida Panthers will be lowering the arena capacity by covering just over 2000 seats for the Panthers ' games this year .
In addition , they will be instituting a new variable pricing scheme for single game tickets that is based on the model used by airlines , where prices change dynamically in response to demand .
These could be seen as desperation moves by a team that is losing money , has an empty building most nights and has proven itself adept at irritating fans .
However , I think that this is not our usual Panthers announcement .
Immediate fan reaction to the seat coverings has been mixed , no doubt related to the news that the tarps covering the seats will have advertising on them .
The Panthers ' building has a lot of advertising and is a sore point for many fans who attend a lot of games .
Anything involving advertising generally elicits quick complaints .
But there is also the worry that it will look bad .
Without having seen them yet , I think they will not be any more intrusive than the advertising banners already hung in the upper bowl and will look a lot better than the enormous sections of empty seats that normally make up the upper bowl on game nights .
As a season ticket holder last season , I saw three to ten upper bowl sections with fewer than ten people at almost every game .
Exceptions were some weekend games and the big draw teams .
The reasons management has given for the reduction in capacity are to introduce scarcity into the ticket market , create a better fan experience by reducing the number of empty seats and bringing the cheapest seats closer to the ice and also reduce the number of promotional tickets given away by the team .
These are legitimate reasons .
In fact , American Airlines Arena has already done this for at least some events .
I have seen concerts where the section behind the stage has been curtained off because it has n't sold to capacity .
When they sell enough tickets , it 's opened up and people are seated behind the stage .
While one can tell that part of the venue has been covered , it 's a lot less noticeable than empty seats .
Based on the seating charts now up on the Panthers web site , it appears that everything past row 10 in the upper bowl will be covered .
The only seating chart available is for season tickets , so this could be slightly inaccurate .
What the team has announced is that seating in the top of the corners and the goal zone will be covered without getting into specifics other than to say that the seating offered will be symmetrical .
So , the idea that they will cap all sections at the same row seems likely .
I do n't think anyone is going to miss these seats .
Season ticket holders will be moved into the new lower sections which offer a better view at the same price .
I do believe that this will create a better atmosphere in the upper bowl on game day .
The promotional tickets have been another sore point with fans .
Many season ticket holders complain about the large number of ticket giveaways every season .
The management decided that they would respond to these complaints by instead giving season ticket holders extra tickets to most games to give away .
As reported here late last season , this approach was not very well received .
Reducing the number of seats is a more sensible approach to the problem than flooding the area with cheap or free tickets .
The idea of increasing scarcity brings with it another new plan : variable pricing .
Single game tickets will be priced in different tiers : Bronze , Silver , Gold and Platinum .
Each section of the arena will have different pricing for each tier .
Games wll start out at one level and increase according to demand .
So , for example , weeknight games against Atlanta will probably be Bronze , the cheapest level and will likely stay at that level as the team is not a big draw .
Games against the New York Rangers will probably start at Silver or Gold and quickly move up as seats sell .
This will do three things for the team .
One is increasing revenue from fans of the visiting teams for those games that are big draws .
Another is encouraging early ticket sales , which will help drive sales of popular games .
And it will also be more flexible .
Sure , the annual holiday week games against the Maple Leafs , Rangers and Canadiens are guaranteed draws and can start in the premium levels .
But the variable pricing will capture more revenue on games that are unexpectedly popular .
Unless the price increases keep people home .
But it 's a chance worth taking and if it does n't work as well as expected , the team can change the algorithm that determines when the pricing changes .
This scheme appears to be a mix between what the Sabres instituted after the lockout and what the Stars did last year in their upper bowl .
For the last several years , the Sabres have had four price levels and picked the level for each game based on anticipated demand .
Games against unpopular opponents on weeknights were set at the lowest level and games against teams like the Leafs , Sabres , Red Wings and Flyers are set at the higher levels , as are all weekend games .
The Stars have four price levels for their upper bowl seats and as seats sell , the prices increase to the higher tiers .
The Panthers tried a couple seasons ago to charge a $ 25 surcharge to certain games , which did n't really work out that well .
I was surprised at the time that they had n't already instituted tiered pricing and were n't then .
I think this is something that the organization has sorely needed .
Given team performance the associated ticket sales , they need to make as much money as possible on the few big draws they have each season .
In addition , if they have a sellout and there is still demand , the upper bowl seats can be uncovered and tickets in those areas sold .
In conclusion , the people hit hardest will be the fans of the visiting team and those who get the biggest benefit will be season ticket holders .
I do n't believe any section season ticket prices have increased and some seat prices have dropped due to the closing off of the back rows , which are also the seats with the worst view .
The slightly more intimate upper bowl will help provide a better atmosphere than the old swaths of empty seats .
This franchise has given fans a lot to complain about over the years , but I do n't think these changes are among them .
I think these moves will ultimately provide the team with a much needed revenue stream and enhance the fan experience .
Management is starting to make good on their promises and like the new Den of Honor and the hiring of Dale Tallon as GM , this team may finally be on its way out of its status as a standing league joke .

Hayabusa ’s sample - return capsule will slam into the atmosphere in the predawn darkness over south - central Australia in June ( Illustration : JAXA )
It seems years ago – November 29 , 2005 , to be exact – since a Japanese spacecraft named Hayabusa touched down on a small asteroid in the hope of grabbing samples of its dusty surface and returning them to Earth .
Had the mission gone according to plan , the precious bits from asteroid 25143 Itokawa would have reached waiting scientists in June 2007 .
But the flight of Hayabusa , Japanese for “ falcon , ” has been anything but nominal .
In fact , it ’s been more of a train wreck .
The craft was nearly lost during its grab - and - go encounter due to a series of malfunctions that should have doomed the spacecraft .
But it hung on , despite suffering a massive fuel leak , battery failure , and being incommunicado for two months .
Then its attitude - control system failed .
The loss of three of its four xenon - powered engines meant it would take three extra years to get the crippled craft home , nursed every step of the way by its dedicated team of engineers .
Well , folks , Hayabusa is almost home .
Late word from project manager Jun’ichiro Kawaguchi is that the sole remaining engine was commanded to shut down on March 27th , having gently accelerated the craft by 400 metres per second over the past year and nudged it onto a trajectory that will pass within several thousand kilometres of Earth .
“ What is left is a series of trajectory corrections , ” Kawaguchi explains , “ and the project team is finalizing the preparations for them . ”

Unknown cargo
Barring an eleventh - hour setback , in mid-June a small 18 - kilogram descent capsule will separate from the main spacecraft and slam into the atmosphere over south - central Australia .
The larger craft will then manoeuvre to avoid Earth .
Streaking through the darkness at 12.2 kilometres per second , the capsule should parachute to the ground somewhere along a target zone , measuring 100 by 15 km , in the remote Woomera Test Range .
After whisking it back to a clean room at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) , scientists will carefully open the 40 - cm capsule to learn , finally , whether it contains any asteroidal bits .
It ’s hardly a sure thing – despite sitting on Itokawa ’s surface for 30 minutes , Hayabusa failed to fire two small tantalum pellets designed to kick surface material into a collection cone .
Hayabusa ’s successful return would be a big deal in Japan , and plans for the welcome - home party are well under way .
Kawaguchi has been careful not to divulge the exact date publicly , pending the engine shutdown and a sign - off from Australian authorities .
“ It is not at the beginning of June , and it is not at the end of June , ” he teases .
JAXA has produced an informative 21 - minute video about the mission , in English , that you can view here .
There ’s even a dramatic movie treatment : Hayabusa : Back to the Earth .
Airborne observatory
Because spacecraft rarely come down through the atmosphere so fast – Earth - orbiting satellites fall in about a third slower – there ’s plenty of scientific interest in the re-entry itself .
The capsule should create an artificial fireball beginning at an altitude of about 200 km and hit a peak brightness of magnitude - 6.7 ( several times brighter than Venus ) before deploying its parachute .
For the past year , meteor specialist Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute in California has been organising an international team to observe the capsule ’s arrival from an instrument - packed DC - 8 jet flying near the recovery zone .
Jenniskens mounted a similar effort for the return of the Stardust sample capsule in January 2006 .
Will Hayabusa , despite all its problems , make it back to Earth ?
Will the capsule contain hard - won bits of asteroid Itokawa ?
Will Kawaguchi and his team get a ticker - tape parade through downtown Tokyo ?
Stay tuned for the final chapter of this remarkable mission !

Here are some graphs showing income tax , national insurance , total tax and percentage of tax for the 2009 - 2010 tax year .
I have also included a graph showing how total taxation has changed from the 2008 - 2009 tax year .
If you want tax graphs for the current tax year go to my 2010 - 2011 tax graphs page .
I ’ve done my best to make these accurate ; however I ’m not a tax expert so I ca n’t guarantee these are correct .
These are therefore just for interest , and not for serious use .
2009 - 2010 income tax
First up income tax – everyone ’s favourite tax !
After a short tax free allowance you can see how the basic rate of tax hits , and then the higher rate of tax causes the angle to increase .
2009 - 2010 national insurance
National insurance follows a different shape as once you reach the higher band the rate drops to 1 % rather than increasing .
2009 - 2010 total tax
This graph combines both the income tax , and national insurance to show the total amount of these taxes that you would be paying .
And here is a version that is more zoomed in – it only goes up to £ 60,000 .
2009 - 2010 percentage of tax
Perhaps more interesting than the amount of tax you pay , is the percentage of tax you pay .
This graph shows the combined income , and national insurances taxes against gross salary .
The dip somewhere after the £ 40,000 level is due to the national insurance dropping to the 1 % rate before the higher rate of income tax kicks in .
Change in tax from 2008/09 to 2009/10
This final graph shows how the amount of tax you pay has changed from the previous tax year , to the 2009 / 10 tax year .
You can see that the amount of tax to be paid has actually decreased .
This is due to the increase in personal allowance for 2009 - 2010 .

The U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) has just issued a report detailing the outlook and challenges of next generation biofuels .
I provided some input during the drafting of the report , which hopefully was of some use .
Here I select five pessimistic projections from the report .
In the next essay I selected five optimistic projections .
The report is :
Next - Generation Biofuels : Near - Term Challenges and Implications for Agriculture
Here are five findings from the report that promise to strongly influence the country ’s direction on next generation fuels .
1. Production and Capital Costs
“ Estimated production and capital costs for next - generation biofuel production are significantly higher than for first - generation biofuels . ”
The report quotes costs for a 100 million gallon biochemical conversion plant ( e.g. , cellulosic ethanol ) at $ 320 million , and the costs for a 100 million gallon thermochemical conversion plant ( e.g. , gasification and conversion to liquid fuels ) at $ 340 million .
The report states that this is “ more than three or four times those for corn ethanol plants . ”
2. Biomass Feedstock Costs
﻿
The report suggests that the presumed costs for purpose grown biomass have likely been underestimated .
It cites POET , for instance , as assuming a $ 40 to $ 60 per ton price for corn cobs .
But the report states “ the range of prices may underestimate the cost of increasing biomass yields on marginal lands and the incentives required for harvesting , gathering , and delivering bulky material to the biorefinery ” and “ dedicated energy crops would need to compete with the lowest value crop such as hay which has had a price exceeding $ 100 per ton since 2007 . ”
In a previous essay I identified this as one of the bad assumptions many biofuel producers today are making :
That biomass costs will be low or even negative in the future as demand ramps up .
3. Algae Conversion Costs
The report repeats the mantra that you have heard from me many times : “ Production cost estimates ( net of capital costs ) for growing and converting algae to fuel are significantly higher than for first - and next - generation biofuels , ranging from $ 9 per gallon to $ 35 per gallon . ”
As I have noted before , I think people confuse the ease of growing algae with the ease of growing it commercially and turning it into fuel .
4. Support for Cellulosic Ethanol May Be Short - Lived
The report suggests that support for cellulosic ethanol may be short - lived : “ Given the limited market for ethanol as a gasoline additive ( due to the E10 “ blend wall ” ) and as a gasoline substitute ( because of slow development of the E85 market ) , developers and investors may turn away from cellulosic ethanol in favor of production of another class of next - generation biofuels , petroleum substitute fuels .
These so - called ‘ drop in ’ fuels can be used as gasoline or diesel substitutes in current vehicles without limit and distributed seamlessly in the existing transportation fuel infrastructure . ”
The report further states “ There may be a shift in favored technologies underway .
Several companies planning to be operational with some of the larger plants in the next several years plan to use thermochemical approaches or other processes that produce biobased petroleum - equivalent fuels . ”
My position on this is clear : I believe that thermochemical approaches are more scalable and less energy intensive than most biochemical approaches .
5. Scale
Fiberight is forecast to be the leading cellulosic ethanol producer for 2010 – with a production capacity of 130 barrels per day .
To put that into perspective , the very small oil refinery I used to work at in Billings , Montana had a capacity of 60,000 barrels per day .
The bits I extracted are all themes that I have addressed here many times .
In a nutshell , they relate to the fact that many would - be next generation fuel producers are making unrealistic assumptions about things like feedstock costs .
Thus , where they project falling costs based on their optimistic projections , the USDA report forecasts that their biomass costs will be much higher than expected .
But there were some bright notes , which I address in the next essay : Five Positive Notes on Next - Generation Biofuels .
The school is paying $ 636,000 a year in rent under the terms of a 20 - year lease .
The Controller 's Office notes that over the life of the lease , the school is scheduled to pay about $ 12 million to the nonprofit by 2023 , though the 10 - year mortgage is scheduled to be paid off in 2014 .
Lisa Mathewson , a lawyer for Joyner and the nonprofit , said she could not comment on reports she had not seen .
She did say Joyner 's role with the school and the nonprofit " was fully disclosed . "
A source with knowledge of the nonprofit Joyner founded in 1984 said Joyner had received no compensation from it for the last 12 years .

Republican wing nuts give “ pass the hat ” a whole new meaning .
First , the hat goes to Sue Myrick .
… In a letter [ wing nut delinked ] to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Myrick calls for a task force " to engage US and Mexican law enforcement and border patrol officials about Hezbollah ’s presence , activities , and connections to gangs and drug cartels . "
Myrick says she has to come believe that Hezbollah is operating on the border because of evidence well , would n’t that be crazy ?
She writes :
" The connection between Hezbollah and the drug cartels has seemed to grow over the past few years .
This may be especially true on the US Southern border .
Across states in the Southwest , well trained officials are beginning to notice the tattoos of gang members in prisons are being written in Farsi .
We have typically seen tattoos in Arabic , but Farsi implies a Persian influence that can likely be traced back to Iran and its proxy army , Hezbollah .
These tattoos in Farsi are almost always seen in combination with gang or drug cartel tattoos .
These combinations have been increasing in number and point to the fact that these criminals are tied to both Hezbollah and gangs and drug cartels . "
Myrick also points to the similarity between the U.S. border terrain and Israel as a reason why Hezbollah is there :
" Former intelligence officials have pointed to the terrain that makes up our border , especially in the San Diego border sector , as a reason why drug cartels have been partnering with Hezbollah .
This terrain is very much like the areas around Israel ’s borders .
As we well know , Hezbollah is extremely skilled in the construction of tunnels .
Israel has time and again found Hezbollah tunnels leading into Israel , some of which are large enough to accommodate trucks .
Likewise , these intelligence officials say that the drug cartels , in an effort to dig larger and more effective tunnels , are employing the expertise of Hezbollah .
For their expertise , Hezbollah could be receiving a cut of the drug money or even be helping put cash up front to assist in the overall drug operations . " …

WASHINGTON 
The fight to allow gay and bisexual people to serve openly in the military is already drawing political blood in Washington , but tucked into the same 852 - page Pentagon policy bill as the repeal of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” is a little - noticed amendment that takes on another emotionally charged issue : making abortion easier for military women in war zones .
In a vote that advocates of abortion rights sought beforehand to keep quiet , the Senate Armed Services Committee passed a provision on May 27 to allow privately financed abortions at military hospitals and bases .
Current law bans abortions in most cases at military facilities , even if women pay themselves , meaning they must go outside to private hospitals and clinics  an impossibility for many of the estimated 100,000 American servicewomen in foreign countries , particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The result , the advocates say , is that military women serving overseas do not have the same access to basic health care that other American women do , or that is ensured by the laws of the country they are fighting to protect .
“ It ’s an issue of basic fairness , ” said Cecile Richards , the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , one of eight women ’s advocacy groups that lobbied heavily last month for the amendment ’s passage .
Image Cecile Richards , of Planned Parenthood Federation of America , supports the plan .

Opponents say that because the abortions would be performed in government facilities , taxpayer money would still help subsidize the underlying costs  the reason that Senator Ben Nelson , a Nebraska Democrat who is opposed to abortion , voted against the amendment .
“ He opposes government - provided or funded abortion , ” said Jake Thompson , a spokesman .
More than a century after President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Pure Food and Drug Act , deception is still a far too popular marketing tool for food makers .
The Federal Trade Commission barred Kellogg ’s last year from running ads saying Mini-Wheats are “ clinically shown to improve kids ’ attentiveness by 20 percent . ”
To claim “ benefits to cognitive health , process or function provided by any cereal or any morning food or snack food , ” was a no - no , unless the claims were true .
But the F.T.C. ’s order covered only cognitive abilities .
So just as it was signing its consent , Kellogg ’s was starting a new campaign in which “ Snap , Crackle and Pop ” called out to parents from the Rice Krispies box promising to help “ support your child ’s IMMUNITY . ”
Last week , the F.T.C. said that it had closed that loophole , reaching an agreement with Kellogg ’s that would bar the company from making any claims about the health benefits of their food unless they were backed by scientific evidence and not misleading .
Businesses have been making dubious claims about their products at least since the 17th century , when the British clergyman Anthony Daffy sold Daffy ’s Elixir as a cure for scurvy as well as agues , gout , rheumatism , rickets , worms and other ailments .
Hucksterism  no matter how implausible the claim  lives on .
Conventional wisdom in Hollywood of late has said that you should stick to familiar brands when making movies .
It could be a sequel or an adaptation of an old TV show , board game , toy , or crumpled candy wrapper , just as long as people already know it .
So how ’s that working out ?
In a summer season where only three out of the fourteen major releases so far have come from a new idea , attendance is down 13.3 percent from last season .
Even with The Karate Kid ’s surprise bounty , box - office revenue is down 7.5 percent , according to the National Association of Theater Owners … and that is skewed more by 3 - D gouging than anything else :
Since the summer of 2009 , ticket prices have actually gone up 8 percent .
That ’s why studio execs at Warner Bros. , Paramount / DreamWorks , and Universal are now madly pinging agents and managers with an uncharacteristic , desperate , and welcome request :
Send us your fresh material !
“ We ’re on a lot of calls with people at the highest level [ of production ] , and they ’re just nervous , ” one agent tells Vulture .
“ They ’ve been telling us , ‘ We have our movies for next year , but attendance is down , so , guys , you know what ?
Get us the original material .
We need some original shit , because now our bosses are on us . ’”
It ’s no wonder panic is in the air , considering how moviegoers are rebelling .
“ People are feeling marketed to , as opposed to catered to , ” says JC Spink , a partner in the management and production company Benderspink and one of the executive producers of last summer ’s surprise original hit , The Hangover .
“ I think we ’ve all gone a little bit overboard as an industry .
There has n’t been room for original material for a little while now .
It ’s a shame , because I do n’t think it ’s what anyone [ who works in the business ] came out here for . ”
Here ’s a quantitative illustration of people ’s franchise weariness :
According to the most current market research by E - Poll , which surveys people ’s interest , connection , and loyalty to familiar characters for movie studios , 59 percent of Americans view the Shrek character favorably … as compared to 64 percent score for advertising ’s green M&M .
A year ago , studios might have reacted to this news by yelling , “ QUICK , STAKE OUR CLAIM FOR MEMORIAL DAY 2012 FOR GREEN M&M : THE MOTION PICTURE ! ” ; instead , they ’ve gotten the message that their franchises are fading and are suddenly paying handsomely for original ideas and — even better for the creative community — moving them quickly towards the big screen .
• In May , Ivan Reitman ’s Montecito Picture Company picked up Field Trip , an original sci-fi adventure - comedy from Jordan Cahan ( My Best Friend ’s Girl ) and set it up at Paramount .
That same month , the studio also picked up Fun Size , an original teen comedy from Colbert Report writer Max Werner , with Gossip Girl co-creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage producing .
• Two weeks ago , Summit Entertainment paid Boaz Yakin ( who , ironically enough , also co-wrote the video - game - born bomb Prince of Persia ) and Edward Ricourt handsomely for their script Now You See Me , an original heist movie about a gang of criminal illusionists who use their skills to make millions disappear from bank vaults .
Fringe co-creators Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci are producing .
• Also , two weeks ago , Universal paid $ 1 million for Most Wanted , a comedy pitch that would reunite The Proposal ’s cast , writer , and director .

One man killed himself , the other had his life destroyed .
All because one girl falsely cried rape .
So what does she have to say for herself ?
Olumide Fadayomi was cleared of rape after being accused by Miss X
The irony of moving to Sheffield from London hoping for a quieter life is not lost on this particular medical student .
After two frenetic years studying in the capital , the 27 - year - old hoped a spell in the regions would improve his quality of life .
How wrong he was .
Just four days after arriving in Sheffield , he was confronted by a uniformed police officer on his doorstep and arrested on suspicion of rape .
His accuser was a 21 - year - old girl with whom he had enjoyed consensual sex just a few hours before - someone who was such a willing participant in the act that she had , at one point , spoken of her desire to have his babies .
In the ensuing months , the stress of the forthcoming court case and the cloud of doubt over him would cost the young student , Olumide Fadayomi , his home , his job and many of his close friendships .
In the end , it took a jury at Sheffield Crown Court just 45 minutes to clear his name , while Judge Patrick Robertshaw was so horrified it had come to court that he launched a pointed attack on the Crown Prosecution Service for pursuing the case .
He suggested that they had been motivated by the victim 's desire for a trial , rather than a fair - minded assessment of the evidence .
his anger was understandable .
Olumide 's accuser - known as Miss X , because whatever the outcome of the court case , she enjoys lifelong anonymity - had , it emerged , made a similar accusation four years ago against a teenage boy .
On that occasion , after several months of investigation , the police decided there was not enough evidence to take the matter further .
That young man 's name was Daniel Devennie - although unlike Olumide he is no longer around to give his version of events .
In January 2008 , 18 months after he was first arrested , Daniel took his own life .
He was just 21 years old .
There will be many people who also feel that the weight of the law has become unbalanced , particularly in an age of relaxed sexual mores , when lines of consent are all too often blurred
And while it 's undeniable there were other issues in the young man 's life , his mother says her son 's problems were compounded by the legacy of Miss X's accusation .
' It upset him and hurt him , and he kept going on and on about it , ' his 43 - year - old mother , Bonita Fielding , told the Mail .
' He was questioned about it several times and asked me : " how many times do I have to explain that I have not done anything wrong ? " he did n't understand it . '
Few people would argue against the victims of rape and sexual assault being entitled to anonymity .
But there will be many people - Mrs Fielding and Mr Fadayomi among them - who also feel that the weight of the law has become unbalanced , particularly in an age of relaxed sexual mores , when lines of consent are all too often blurred .
That this disturbing series of events has come to light at a time when the Government has recently announced plans to grant anonymity to defendants in rape trials for the first time since the 1970s is , therefore , particularly apt .
Certainly the circumstances surrounding the complaints made by Miss X raise pertinent questions about this issue .
Should two men have found their lives destroyed , while she will always enjoy anonymity ?
What of Miss X , though ?
While her full history is not known , this much is undisputed : now 21 and one of three children , she left school with eight GCSEs and initially had hopes of a career in the Army .
After signing up in June 2005 , however , she failed to complete the training and left after nine weeks , taking up her current work in a call centre .
According to her friends , she is close to her family and a ' naturally bubbly and chatty ' person whose confidence has plummeted in the wake of recent events .
Daniel Devennie took his own life at the age of 21 after being accused by Miss X of raping her
No doubt such tidings will ring hollow to Mrs Fielding , a school attendance officer who remarried four years ago after separating from Daniel 's father .
In late Summer 2006 , she opened the door of the smart semi-detached home in Penistone , near Sheffield , which she shared with Daniel and his two younger siblings , to find two uniformed police officers there .
' They said they needed to speak to Daniel about something , ' she says .
' They could n't tell me anything more , but it was something that had happened about 14 months before .
I was taken aback , and when Daniel came home he did n't have any idea what it might be about . '
Daniel , then 18 , soon found out .
Later the same day , the officers returned to the house and took him to the local police station for questioning .
On his return , a devastated Daniel told his mother that a girl had accused him of rape .
' He said a girl claimed to police that he had dragged her onto a football pitch near their estate and raped her , ' Mrs Fielding says .
' She said she had asked him to stop and he said " no " , and she screamed her head off .
' He said it was ridiculous because if that had happened , someone would have heard her .
He told me straight away they'd had sex , but in no way was it rape . '
Moreover since the alleged event had happened more than 14 months earlier , both mother and son were baffled as to why it had taken more than a year for Miss X to make her complaint - although her son , Mrs Fielding says , had his theories .
' Dan said he thought she was lying because she'd got a new boyfriend , and if he'd found out about her sleeping with Dan it would have really annoyed him , because Dan was quite popular locally and a little charmer .
So it was easier for her to say it was rape . '
The investigation remained open for five or six months - a cloud over the head of such a young man .
Then , in early 2007 , Daniel was informed that he would not be charged due to lack of evidence .
But by then , for Daniel , the damage had already been done .
For much of that year , Mrs Fielding says , her son was depressed - although he did not confide in her .
' He was a sensitive lad , ' she says .
' A lot of things upset him , and a lot of things got him down . '
A move to Blackpool with a new girlfriend to take up decorating work was , she hoped , the fresh start her son needed .
But , instead , he chose another path .
In January 2008 , following a row with his girlfriend , Daniel took an overdose of pills and vodka .
' I do n't hold anything against her , but I think she has problems , and I hope she gets herself on the right path because I do n't want her to be able to do to any other man what she did to me '
He was rushed to hospital , but died a few days later , leaving his grieving mother with a host of unanswered questions .
Understandably , the latest court case has left her saddened and angered .
' how can she stay anonymous and he can 't ? ' she asks .
' It demeans genuine rape victims because people start harbouring doubts .
' And for the man , the accusation never goes away - people think there 's no smoke without fire . '
Olumide Fadayomi knows this only too well .
After arriving in the UK from Nigeria in 2007 to continue his medical studies , he moved to Sheffield to do a music production course .
' I thought if I liked the city , I would transfer my degree course to the university , ' he recalls this week .
Four days after moving in , he joined his housemates on a night out which ended in Static , a popular city nightclub .
There , he was quickl y approached by Miss X .
' I saw this girl staring straight at me , then she came up and asked my name , ' he recalls .
' She said she liked the way I smelled , and she liked my body too .
We chatted for a while and then she kissed me .
' I was pretty surprised , but of course I did n't mind .
She was a smooth talker - the sort that would make any man feel good about himself .
' I remember at one point she lifted up my shirt and was saying to her friend : " Look at his body , is n't it amazing ? " '
This was later echoed in a witness statement given by a friend of Miss X's , who told how she had boasted she was going to ' have his body tonight ' .
Like any red- blooded male , Olumide was flattered , and when Miss X suggested they ' get to know each other better ' , he willingly complied .
' We got a taxi back to my house , and during the journey she was saying she 'd like to have my babies as she liked mixed - race children , ' he recalls .
' I was laughing and feeling pretty good about myself , to be honest . '
Once back at his house , it was Miss X , he says , who initiated sex , boldly kissing his face and neck .
' She was being very complimentary , saying : " You 've got such a gorgeous body , " ' he says .
' She took her own dress off and removed my boxer shorts .
Sex felt very natural , and afterwards we lay there looking into each other 's eyes . '
Such was their ease in each other 's company that Olumide says he was surprised , on emerging from the bathroom , to hear her on the phone to a friend arranging to leave .
' I heard her laughing and saying " Yes , I 'm having sex " , and then she told me she had to go and meet her friend .
I was disappointed , as I 'd assumed she was going to stay till morning . '
Instead , when Miss X said she had no money , he gave her £ 8 for a taxi .
' She thanked me , gave me a kiss on the cheek , and left . '
It 's a scene which is enacted up and down the land every night of the week - although not , thankfully , with the consequences faced by Fadayomi .
After leaving the house at 6 am to buy some food , he returned to find a police van parked outside .
His first thoughts were that something untoward had happened to Miss X after she left him .
' The next minute , I 'd been handcuffed and arrested on suspicion of rape , ' he says .
' I could n't believe it .
I honestly felt like I was on another planet . '
Released on bail on the condition that he reported to the police station every day , a bewildered Olumide prayed that there was some mistake .
' I tried to call her , but I discovered she had given me a fake telephone number , ' he says .
' I felt so alone .
I was isolated in a new city , and I could only pray it would all go away . '
It did n't : three weeks later Mr Fadayomi was formally charged with rape .
' I was devastated , ' he says .
' I could n't eat for three days .
All I could do was place faith in the notion that justice would prevail .'
In the meantime , his life was on hold .
' My housemates asked me to leave the house , and if it was n't for one friend I would have been homeless .
' I even lost my job at a telesales firm where I was working to make extra cash , because it was too difficult to continue when my colleagues found out , ' he said .
But one of the hardest parts was telling my mother and father in Nigeria .
They are good Christian people , and they were heartbroken and very scared for me .
But they never doubted me .
' Even so , I thought about taking my own life on more than one occasion , as I could n't see another way out . '
As we now know , a jury took just 45 minutes to acquit him - after which Judge Robertshaw revealed to the court that Miss X had made a previous accusation .
That case had not come to trial , he said , because it was ' lacking in credibility ' , but the accused man committed suicide ' when facing that allegation ' .
' When I found out about the other guy , I was devastated for him , as I knew how he felt .
It could so easily have been me , ' says Olumide .
No one , of course , would suggest that any allegation of rape is subject to anything other than the most rigorous and robust of proper legal procedures .
Nonetheless , this case has raised disturbing questions about the disparity between the way the accused and the accuser are treated .
Despite being acquitted , he must live for ever with the lingering stain of the accusation , unprotected by the anonymity that Miss X enjoys
Not that Miss X sees a grey area .
Speaking to the Mail this week , she maintains that she has been unnecessarily demonised , and believes that Judge Robertshaw should apologise to her for his words in court .
' I want an apology from the judge for branding me a liar and blaming me for the death of another person , ' she says .
' It is just not true .
I am not to blame , and the judge has no evidence .
' I really am the victim here .
I have nothing to be ashamed of .
I am not a liar - in fact , I could n't lie if I tried .
It 's not in my nature . '
When pressed , Miss X insisted she could not remember much of what happened after she met Olumide in the night club , although she maintains she remembers enough to know she did not consent to sex .
' I told the police the truth .
They are used to finding out if people are lying .
What possible motive did I have to accuse this man ?
' There is a big difference between a false allegation and someone being found not guilty . '
There is , indeed , as Olumide Fadayomi knows only too well .
Despite being acquitted , he must live for ever with the lingering stain of the accusation , unprotected by the anonymity that Miss X enjoys .
Yet astonishingly , after everything he has been through , he bears her no ill will .
' I do n't hold anything against her , but I think she has problems , and I hope she gets herself on the right path because I do n't want her to be able to do to any other man what she did to me . '
They are , even the most generous soul might think , more forgiving words than Miss X deserves .
The tragedy of Kappa Marousi which burned down during a major protest march in Athens in 1991 leaving 4 people dead led the media to incriminate anarchists , although it was later proved the fire was caused by the police .
On the 9th of January 1991 in Patras , the 38 year old mathematics teacher and member of the Workers Anti-imperialist Front , Nikos Temboneras was murdered , by means of a metal bar cracking his head open , by Yannis Kalabokas , the local leader of the governing Conservative Party ’s Youth ( ONNED ) and local councilor of the Conservatives .
The murder took place during clashes between teachers and government thugs at the occupied 3rd High - school of Patras .
At the time thousands of schools and universities were under occupation and teachers were leading a long strike that would see all schools and universities shut for many months against the ultra - right educational reform bill of Minister Kontoyannopoulos who resigned the day after the murder .
( Let it be noted that the murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment but only served 3 years and is still today a leading political figure in the area ) .
The murder led to one of the most massive protest marches in the republican history of Greece , on the 10th of January 1991 during which violent clashes between protesters and the police erupted .
During the clashes a fire that initially started at Livas Bookstore spread to K - Marousi , a building with shops and apartments .
Despite efforts of the fire brigade , four men ( one never to be identified ) were found dead of suffocation in the building .
During the following days , when battles continued to rage in the streets of Athens until the new Minister of Education announced the withdrawal of the bill , the media spread as a fact the opinion that the fire had started as a result of Molotov cocktails used by anarchists .
The Special Administrative Investigation ordered indeed ruled that that was the case , despite many doubts by eye - witnesses at the time .
It would take 6 years for the decision to be reversed and to accept the uncertainty of the case .
Today all sober analysts accept that the fire was caused by rifle - shot tear gas canisters used by the riot police during the clashes .
The example of K - Marousi has featured today ( 6 - 5-2010 ) in many newspapers as a central argument against automatically putting the blame for the Marfin bank deaths on anarchists .
During a keynote at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Belgium , Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth unveiled a new lightweight user interface shell called Unity .
The new shell is designed to use screen space more efficiently and consume fewer system resources than a conventional desktop environment .
It will be a key component of the Ubuntu Netbook Edition and a new instant - on computing platform called Ubuntu Light .
The Unity environment eschews the conventional GNOME panel configuration .
It includes a dock - like launcher and task management panel that is displayed vertically along the left - hand side .
The top panel will house application indicators , window indicators , and the menubar of the active window .
Moving the menu out of individual windows and into a global menu bar will reduce wasted vertical screen space , leaving more room for content .
Window indicators ( windicators ) are a new concept that Shuttleworth introduced in a blog entry last week .
Designed to help reduce the need for status bars , they are interactive icon - based widgets that are specific to a window .
They can be used to signify that an operation is being performed , notify the user of application events , or to control application status .
For example , you could use a windicator to display a progress spinner when a program is loading data .
In the standard Ubuntu desktop user interface , windicators will be placed on the right - hand side of the window title bar — a region that is currently empty due to Canonical 's decision to move window management buttons to the left - hand side in Lucid .
In the Unity environment , the windicators and window management buttons will be able to merge into the top panel when the active window is maximized .
This is yet another technique for increasing the amount of available vertical screen space .
The Unity environment utilizes several key components of the GNOME 3 user experience .
It uses the Mutter compositing window manager and the Zeitgeist activity logging engine .
The Unity launcher is built with Clutter , the same rich graphics framework that is used to construct GNOME Shell .
Although much of the underlying technology is similar , the Unity user interface is a completely distinct implementation and does n't use any code from GNOME Shell .
Shuttleworth contends that the Unity launcher is intended to complement GNOME Shell , offering similar characteristics but specifically tailored for lightweight computing .
Ubuntu Light
One area of the desktop market where Linux is increasingly gaining traction is instant - on computing .
Companies like Phoenix and DeviceVM offer embeddable Linux environments that boot almost instantly and are shipped by hardware vendors alongside regular Windows installations .
These instant - on environments are generally designed to give users quick access to e-mail , web browsing , and instant messaging .
Ubuntu Light is aimed squarely at that market .
Individual builds of Ubuntu Light will be tailored to specific hardware for OEMs , meaning that it will not be installable as a general purpose Linux distribution .
Hardware vendors that adopt Ubuntu Light will be able to choose between the Unity environment and or a full GNOME desktop .
It is intended to be used in a dual - boot configuration on Windows systems .
Shuttleworth views this as an opportunity to boost the visibility of Linux in markets that have traditionally been Windows - centric .
" Over the past two years we have made great leaps forward as a first - class option for PC OEM's , who today ship millions of PC 's around the world with Ubuntu preinstalled .
But traditionally , it 's been an ' either / or ' proposition — either Windows in markets that prefer it , or Ubuntu in markets that don't , " Shuttleworth said in a statement .
" The dual - boot opportunity gives us the chance to put a free software foot forward even in markets where people use Windows as a matter of course . "
Hands - on with the Unity prototype
Ars got exclusive early access to the Unity prototype , which we tested on a Dell Mini 10 v .
When the packages are installed , the Unity environment can be selected from the session list in the GNOME login manager .
The prototype includes the side dock and a limited implementation of the top panel .
Some key features , such as windicators and Zeitgeist integration , have n't been developed yet .
The sidebar dock has a honeycomb - style backdrop and displays application icons in colored rectangles .
The dock shows the user 's actively running programs and favorite software .
You can pin an item to the dock and turn it into a launcher by right - clicking and selecting the " Keep in Launcher " item from a context menu .
The launchers will stay even after you have closed the program , making it easy to launch again later .
When you click a launcher , a glowing light will pulse behind the rectangle while the application is initializing .
When an application is running , an arrow will appear on the left - hand side of its launcher button .
A second arrow will appear on the right - hand side of an icon to indicate when the program is active .
At this time , the dock offers no special handling for applications that have multiple windows .
Each application is represented by one icon , irrespective of how many open windows are associated with the program .
Unlike Mac OS X , windows in Unity do n't get minimized to the dock .
Unity 's primary mechanism for window switching is Mutter 's Exposé - style window selector , which can be activated by clicking the Ubuntu logo in the top left - hand corner .
You can also get an Exposé - style listing of just the windows that are associated with a specific application by right - clicking an application 's dock icon .
This will display a contextual menu with various options in addition to showing the filtered window selector .
The dock itself can scroll , offering a relatively graceful solution to dock overflow .
You can scroll the dock by clicking inside of it and dragging up or down .
The user can rearrange the order of items inside of the dock by clicking and dragging a dock item to the right and then moving it to the desired position .
The different behaviors for horizontal dragging and vertical dragging are effective , but take a bit of time to get used to .
The Unity environment does n't make it easy to launch additional arbitrary applications .
It has no functionality that is equivalent to GNOME 's Applications menu or the comprehensive category - based launcher that is used in the current Ubuntu Netbook Edition .
As a stop - gap measure , the developers have included a launcher item that opens the /usr / share / applications / directory in the Nautilus file manager .
The dock still has some bugs and does n't always successfully track the open applications .
There are a handful of other minor window management glitches that we encountered during testing , like some cases where it does n't hide the open windows before showing the Expose - style selector .
The issues , and the general lack of completeness , reflect the fact that the Unity environment is still a work in progress .
Much of the missing functionality will be added as the Unity environment matures .
Shuttleworth believes that Unity can be made ready for Ubuntu 10.10 , codenamed Maverick Meerkat , which is scheduled for release in October .
" It will be an intense cycle , if we want to get all of these pieces in line .
But we think it 's achievable : the new launcher , the new panel , the new implementation of the global menu and an array of indicators , " Shuttlesworth said .
" Things have accelerated greatly during Lucid so if we continue at this pace , it should all come together . "
Our test of the Unity prototype leads us to believe that the project has considerable potential and could bring a lot of value to the Ubuntu Netbook Edition .
Its unique visual style melds beautifully with Ubuntu 's new default theme and its underlying interaction model seems compelling and well - suited for small screens .
Users who want to get their hands on the prototype will be able to test it soon when it is published in a public PPA .
Sunday was absurd with rain , so we spent the day Oh , yeah .
Hilarious , I 'm sure .
Please let this be a single thing .

Tough luck .
In a backroom was this .
Was there perhaps a cautionary scene of the dangers of combining eras never meant to meet ?

This place is fucking rife with mystery .
Such inscrutableness is a surprise in light of the avid blogging .

Obama orders troops to Mexican border
By Bill Van Auken
27 May 2010
President Barack Obama ’s order deploying 1,200 National Guard troops to the Mexican border marks another reactionary turn in his immigration policy and a threat of intensified violence against immigrant workers .
The order will more than quadruple the National Guard force presently operating in the four southern border states — California , Arizona , New Mexico and Texas .
Besides the added troops , the administration is asking Congress to appropriate an additional $ 500 million to step up operations by the US Border Patrol .
The action came on Tuesday , the same day that Obama met with the Senate Republican caucus , and appeared to be a gesture aimed at deflecting criticism from the Republican right that Washington has not done enough to “ control the border . ”
The White House did not issue any formal announcement of the military deployment .
Rather , an Arizona Democratic member of Congress , Gabrielle Giffords , revealed the decision to send more troops .
Running for reelection against a Republican challenger who is campaigning on the immigration issue , Giffords hailed the move .
Administration officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , later confirmed the decision .
The source of the announcement suggested that Obama acted largely on the basis of such short - term political calculations , attempting to give Democrats a right - wing platform on which to run against Republican opponents seeking to whip up anti-immigrant sentiments .
The government of Mexico reacted cautiously to the new US military deployment on its border .
It expressed the hope that the troops would be utilized to “ combat organized crime which operates on both sides of the border , ” and that they would not “ carry out activities directly linked to the enforcement of immigration laws . ”
The deployment comes just a week after Mexican President Felipe Calderón made a state visit to Washington , where he condemned , including in a speech before Congress , a new Arizona law that calls upon local police to detain individuals on “ reasonable suspicion ” that they are undocumented immigrants .
The law also makes it a crime for anyone to offer shelter or aid to the undocumented .
Calderón ’s statements on the Arizona law evoked a storm of condemnation from the anti-immigrant right .
Critics denounced him for daring to condemn a US law in a speech to Congress — as if US officials do not make a regular practice during visits to other countries of denouncing and demanding changes in policies that have nothing to do with the immediate welfare of US citizens .
It is unclear from the statements from the Mexican government whether it was given any advance notice of the troop deployment .
Its statements would suggest that it was not .
Obama ’s use of the military may in part be a means of distancing himself from Calderón ’s criticisms .
On Wednesday afternoon , a State Department spokesman appeared to reassure Mexico on the mission of the troops being sent to the border .
The spokesman , Philip Crowley , told reporters that the deployment was “ fully consistent with our efforts to do our part to stem , you know , violence , to interdict the flow of dangerous people and dangerous goods — drugs , guns , people . ”
He added , “ It ’s not about immigration . ”
Such formal claims are belied by the statements of Obama himself , who linked the further militarization of the border to his efforts to placate the Republicans and assume a “ get tough on immigration ” posture .
Speaking at a Democratic Party fundraiser in California Tuesday night after ordering the deployment , Obama described his meeting with the Senate Republicans : “ I said to them , look , I disagree with this Arizona law .
I think it ’s a bad idea .
But I also said I understand the frustration of folks in Arizona .
I understand they ’re feeling that somehow the federal government can’t control the border effectively , and I ’m willing to work with my Republican colleagues to create a stronger border here in California , New Mexico and in Arizona . ”
Obama linked this buildup on the border to a broader immigration “ reform , ” spelling out the punitive measures that such legislation would include .
As for “ the millions of folks who are already here , ” he said , “ we ’ve got to say to them , you ’ve got to take responsibility .
You broke the law , you ’ve got to pay a fine .
You ’ve got to pay your back taxes .
You ’ve got to learn English .
You ’ve got to go to the back of the line … ”
These conditions — pleading guilty to committing a crime , paying onerous fines and taxes , and getting “ to the back of the line , ” which in many cases means waiting up to a decade to get papers — assures that only a fraction of the 12 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US would be able to obtain legal status .
Obama ’s military action met with sharp criticism from immigrant rights organizations .
“ As we have seen time and time again , efforts to overhaul our broken immigration system have taken a back seat to dramatic escalations of border enforcement , including placing troops on the US border to serve in a function for which they have not been trained , ” said Rosa Rosales , the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC ) .
“ We are on a collision course of enforcement - only policies and , as experience shows , this will not solve the problem , ” added Janet Murguía , the president of the National Council of La Raza ( NCLR ) .
Obama won faint praise from the Republicans .
“ I am pleased that President Obama has now , apparently , agreed that our nation must secure the border to address rampant border violence and illegal immigration without other preconditions , such as passage of ‘ comprehensive immigration reform , ’ ” said Arizona Governor Jan Brewer , one of the main supporters of the reactionary legislation ordering Arizona police to pursue anyone suspected of being an undocumented immigrant .
Other Republicans , led by Senator John McCain of Arizona , have demanded that 6,000 troops be deployed on the border and that border enforcement funding be increased by $ 2 billion .
They have proposed this escalation in the form of an amendment to a $ 59 billion supplemental funding bill , the majority of which is directed to supporting the US war in Afghanistan .
Top White House aides have opposed the Republican amendment on the grounds that it infringes on Obama ’s prerogatives as commander - in - chief .
Other Republicans have demanded that the government announce specific “ rules of engagement ” that would ensure that National Guard troops have the authority to shoot down immigrants trying to cross the border .
Typical was a statement from California Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter , who distinguished himself recently by calling for the deportation of US - born children of undocumented immigrants .
Such children , under the US Constitution , are American citizens .
“ While the National Guard troops involved in this deployment appear to be taking more of a support role , it is still important that they are provided with clear rules of engagement to appropriately defend themselves under any circumstance , ” Hunter said .
Obama ’s action largely parallels that taken by his predecessor , George W. Bush , in 2006 , when 6,000 troops were sent to the border .
Like Obama , Bush ordered the deployment to appease the Republican right , while tying his escalation of the US military presence to an immigration “ reform ” proposal that includes many of the draconian conditions included in the present Democratic proposal .
In answering his Republican critics , Obama has pointed to the increased funding for border enforcement and a more aggressive persecution of immigrant workers launched under his administration .
Given present trends , the Obama administration is expected to deport a record 400,000 people in 2010 — 70 percent of them immigrants who have broken no law outside of entering the US in search of work .
This represents a substantial increase over the 358,000 deported during 2008 , the last year of the Bush administration .
It reflects the Democratic administration ’s increased use of police - state style raids of immigrant workers ’ neighborhoods , workplaces and homes .
Obama ’s latest actions are based on the most cynical political calculations .
They represent an attempt to balance between conflicting constituencies within the Democratic Party and appease the most virulent anti-immigrant forces within the Republican right .
However , more fundamental interests are reflected in this political maneuvering .
Under conditions of sustained mass unemployment , deepening poverty and drastic cuts to basic social services , the scape - goating of immigrants is a tried and tested means of diverting popular anger from the source of these conditions — the capitalist profit system .
At the same time , the measures being prepared against immigrants — including the proposal for a national biometric identification card as a condition for gaining employment in the US — can be utilized as means of repression against the working class as a whole .
The further militarization of the border , moreover , has the potential of unleashing a new round of killings and a major international crisis .
Armed National Guard troops will be standing across the border from Mexico , which has itself become militarized in the US - backed drug war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives over the past four years .
There is a danger not only of immigrant workers being shot by American soldiers , but of US and Mexican military forces coming into armed conflict .
The amazing campaign ads of Alabama
Alabama Republicans have , for reasons that I do n't understand but which I hope a reader will explain , produced a raft of strange and memorable television ads this cycle : Young Boozer 's broadside ; ' This is Alabama .
We speak English ' ; the scornful attack on an accused evolutionist .
This spot from Dale Peterson , a candidate for the Republican nomination for Agriculture Commissioner , may be the best yet .
It 's sort of a country Mad Max , and includes the phrase " thugs and criminals , " aggressive video editing , allegations of yard - sign theft and campaign finance infractions , a horse , and a gun .

How I Became a Better Writer …and You Can Too !
This is the last post in Better Writing Month .
Please do n’t remind me it ’s no longer April 😉
Writing skills are funny .
You could spend years studying ‘ important ’ literary works , deconstructing obscure texts , and writing post - colonial analyses of Salman Rushdie books … but still be a mediocre writer .
I speak from experience .
One English degree earned , hundred of books read , thousands of pages written … and I still ca n’t spell onomatopoeia without a spell checker .
However , over the past two years , I have become a much better writer .
I ’m no Joyce Carol Oates , but compared to where I was when I finished university , the difference is like comparing Spam burgers to Kobe steaks .
Did I climb a mountain , talk to an oracle , and receive sage advice ?
No .
Did I deconstruct even more texts ?
No .
Did I go back to university for more education ?
Hell no .
I ’ve had enough post - colonial / post - structuralist / marxist / feminist / post - deconstructionist theory for one thousand lifetimes .
How did I become a better writer ?
The answer will shock you .
Hold your breath …
I developed the habit of writing .
Every .
Damn .
Day .
While doing research for Better Writing Month , I became sucked into a swirling red vortex of articles on writing .
Most of these articles say write everyday .
Thanks for the letter postmarked Obvious City .
But how does one develop the habit of writing every day ?
Developing the daily writing habit is the hard part .
But once you have it , writing everyday is easy , natural , and as necessary as breathing .
Before I developed the daily writing habit , I wrote about 2,000 words per month…even though I wanted to write more .
I simply could n’t do it .
After I developed the habit , I started writing over 2,000 every day ( without writer ’s block , excessive procrastination , etc. )
Again , the difference is like spam and kobe .
Like curling , kayaking , and fly herding , writing is a mental game .
Developing the discipline to practice is difficult .
Writing without an audience ( or without the immediate feedback of academia ) is difficult .
But when you write every day , the effect is like compound interest ; your skills build and multiply over time .
You do become a better writer .
Plus you ’ll learn the secret of creative inspiration .
Please do n’t think I ’m bragging .
I ’m still a 3rd - rate hack with ambition .
And please do n’t think I ’m saying the development of the daily writing habit is the only way to become a better writer .
Reading one book a week , taking writing classes , getting feedback and critiques , reading books on writing , all these will help ( some more than others ) .
And of course , everybody ’s different ; what works for me may n’t work for for you .
How did I develop the daily writing habit ?
Well , I met this guy in a graffiti - covered alley .
He wears a hoodie , his eyes are always bloodshot , and he carries little glass vials
If you want to develop the habit of daily writing , you need a routine or a system that makes you write everyday .
You need to be writing with some purpose or goal .
Just saying you want to write every day does n’t work .
At least it never worked for me .
I tried for years .
Finally I tried something a little more regimented and structured … and it worked .
I found structure and regimentation in two different ways :
Nanowrimo ( past two years ) : Write 1,667 words a day for a month .
Easy , but damn hard .
The end product is unpublishable drivel , but that ’s not the point .
The real payoff is a the discipline you learn and the skills you pick up along the way .
Check out 10 Lessons Learned from Nanowrimo .
Before I started blogging , I set up a thirty day challenge to write a 1,000 word article every day .
By the time I hit thirty articles , I could write faster and better than before .
I know I dramatically improved my writing because , at the end of each project , I wrote and revised test pieces and compared the results .
For Nanowrimo , the before - and - after was a chase scene .
If the before was n’t so pitiful I ’d post a before - and - after sample .
Same for the articles .
Spam and kobe .
For me , hitting daily word counts for a minimum of thirty days burned the daily writing habit into my brain like a branding iron on a cow ’s flank .
Thirty days is kind of an arbitrary number to establish a new habit , but it seems effective .
Some people claim a new habit is established in as little as twenty - one days .
Here ’s an interesting Google answers entry on this topic .
If you want to develop the daily writing habit …
Set a daily word count goal or target .
Create a visual way to measure your progress ( calendars , spreadsheets , % complete bars ) .
Hit your wordcount goal every day for 30 days .
Write for an audience ( even if it ’s in your head ) .
That ’s it .
Soon you ’ll develop a routine and experience positive creative inertia .
That ’s all you need to do to begin to develop the daily writing habit .
Set a goal .
Write towards that goal .
Every .
Damn .
Day .

Just three weeks ago at a tea party rally in Tempe , he handed out fliers calling for landmines to be placed along the Mexican border to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing into Arizona .
Now , neo - Nazi J.T.
Ready says he plans to lead an armed group into the desert south of Phoenix this weekend to put a stop to what he called “ narco- terrorists . ”
Ready appeared decked out in camouflage during an interview Wednesday with KPNX ( Channel 12 ) .
He showed off a stockpile of guns and ammunition he plans to take with him and claimed his group will stake out an area of Pinal County that drug smugglers use as a route to bring “ chemical warfare into Phoenix . ”
Ready has grabbed more traction with local media in recent months as the debate over illegal immigration heats up .
He has also appeared frequently at rallies and protests in support of Arizona ’s new immigration law , hoping to attract supporters to his cause .
That was no different on May 29 at the “ Stand With Arizona ” rally in Tempe , an event organized by several tea party groups .
Ready was there handing out fliers for the Mesa chapter of the National Socialist Movement , the largest neo -Nazi group in the United States .
The fliers carried Ready ’s name and a picture of a landmine .
“ We all should be actively advocating daily to mainstream America the most humane , non-racist , fair border security plan available , ” they said .
“ Namely , A MINEFIELD ! ”
The flier , photocopied on plain - white paper , carried the letters “ N.S.M. ” as well as the address for post office box in Mesa , a local phone number and an email address that contained the number 88 , a neo -Nazi code meaning “ Heil Hitler . ”
Ready and another man told Heat City that night they handed out 1,000 fliers at the event but were having little success getting their message across .
Ready has a history of engaging in armed confrontation with immigrants .
When he was running for Mesa City Council in 2006 — a race in which he came in second place — he followed a vehicle down a dead - end street and corned a Hispanic man who later turned out to be an illegal immigrant .
Ready said the man opened fire on him with a BB gun , and he returned fire with a .38 revolver he pulled from an ankle holster .
Both escaped injury and police arrested the other man that night .
A month later , the man pleaded guilty to giving a false name to authorities .
The fact that the man received such a minor charge upset Ready , who told the judge overseeing the case that the other man should have been convicted of assault .
Ready called it at the time “ a travesty of justice . ”

Post - Consumerism espouses the virtues of responsibility and accountability in the commercial world .
Post - Consumerism is based on freedom of choice , and as such believes that free - market capitalism is the best way to run an economy .
Post - Consumerism , therefore , does not disparage corporate coffee houses merely because they are such , but , instead , believes that the individual has the power , freedom , and responsibility to cast the dollar vote accordingly .
Post - Consumerism , however , claims that far too many dollar votes have been cast in the direction of vanity , with little regard to selflessness .
Post - Consumerism suggests that consumerism has become a religion in the Western World .
Post - Consumerism proclaims , proudly , that to say the Dollar is not Almighty is Heresy .
The Post - Consumerism campaign has been given a logo which , on one hand , exploits the current mass - branding mentality , and the other hand , juxtaposes an oversized Registration mark next to the words " Post - Consumerism " .
Imagine : the idea of " Post - Consumerism " as a trademark !
( No , it is not trademarked ... yet . )
The Great Act of Post - Consumerism will be when an individual builds a viable , lucrative business to a substantial volume , and then discourages consumers from purchasing the product (s ) !
The Company will wither not through mis-management , but through the message of Post - Consumerism ; a commercial entity which destroys itself by market forces influenced by its own message .
The idea destroys the means of conveyance .
This will be the Jesus of corporations .
It will die for the sins of flagrant consumerism .

South African UN scientist Will Alexander writes the death notice for “ global warming ” hysteria in his final memo :
CLIMATE CHANGE
may it
REST IN PEACE
1. Provably false assumption that human activities can influence global climate for which there is no scientifically believable evidence .
2. Provably false assumption that the increases in global temperatures are the cause of climatic changes .
Multiyear variations in global climate are driven by variations in the receipt and poleward redistribution of solar energy via the atmospheric and oceanic processes , not temperature variations .
This is high school physics .
3. Complete lack of numeracy skills and logical deductions by the climate change adherents .
4. Deliberate manipulation of climate change science to suit political objectives .

Like you , I want to have advanced knowledge of future events that I can exploit to enrich myself financially , sexually or nutritionally ( if I can get a heads up on where to find a McRib , I am on that mother ) .
Despite doing Kegel exercises regularly , Iâve been unable to hone my own psychic prowess , so I figured Iâd have to turn to experts ; people who charge several dollars a minute for access to their mysterious gifts .
Â
But could I trust these people ?
Â
I canât abide charlatans , so Iâd have to run some tests .
In order to save money Iâd have to get my psychic friends to run a five minute gauntlet of psychicery to prove their worth .
Â
The challenge ?
Â
In that time , I would ask them to tell me what I had in my hand , what I had for breakfast and give an answer to one more or less preposterous and wholly fraudulent question like a more naked Dr. Peter Venkman ( oh , right , I 'd be naked ) .
Â Itâs on !
Telemedium
The Telemedium website had me hooked right off the bat .
Â
To start they were only going to charge me $ 1.69 per minute .
Â
Sixty - nine is hilarious on the Internet , Iâm sold ! Â
Plus , thereâs a long list of psychics I can choose from , itâs not even some random wahoo with specialized knowledge of unknowable events , itâs my choice .
Â
And what choices !
Tim there looked promising , and if anyone has seen the astral plane itâs gotta be this guy but alas , he was offline .
Â
Luckily they have about 90 psychics to choose from so I also ran Costanza here up the flagpole ;

My final choice was this charming looking lady , because I was hoping for some psychic phone sex as I assume she already knows what I like ( mostly degradation and threats ) .
The Test :

Unfortunately she too was offline , so I had to settle for a middle - aged lady whose picture wasnât even available .
Â Great .
My new psychic friend was named Claudia and she spoke as slowly and deliberately as any drunk Iâve ever met .
Â
I couldnât decide if this was because she was trying to milk my $ 1.69 a minute or because she had stroked out just before I called .
Â I didnât really want to ask .
Honestly , she should have known I wanted to know , but thatâs neither here nor there .
Since I didnât have time or finances to beat around the bush , I cut to the chase .
Â
In my hand was the one item I always have handy when Iâm doing research : a boxed set of the RoboCop trilogy .
Â I asked Claudia to tell me what I was holding .
Heâs a cop and a robo ?
This movie really speaks to me .
With only a minor stumble that I think was the beginning of a âwha ?â 
Claudia quickly changed directions and explained how she connects with my spirit guides to glean information from me and they show her what I need to know , not always what I want to know .
Â
You crafty bitch .
I tell her it was all three
Much nonsense has been written in recent years about the prospects of American decline and the inevitable rise of China .
But it was not a declining power that I saw in recent weeks as I jetted from the Middle East to the Far East through two of America ’s pivotal geographic commands — Central Command and Pacific Command .
The very fact that the entire world is divided up into American military commands is significant .
There is no French , Indian or Brazilian equivalent — not yet even a Chinese counterpart .
It is simply assumed without much comment that American soldiers will be central players in the affairs of the entire world .
It is also taken for granted that a vast network of American bases will stretch from Germany to Japan — more than 700 in all , depending on how you count .
They constitute a virtual American empire of Wal - Mart - style PXs , fast - food restaurants , golf courses and gyms .
There is an especially large American presence in the Middle East , one of the world ’s most crisis - prone regions .
For all the anti-Americanism in the Arab world , almost all the states bordering what they call the Arabian Gulf support substantial American bases .
These governments are worried about the looming Iranian threat and know that only the United States can offer them protection .
They are happy to deal with China , but it would never occur to a single sultan or sheik that the People ’s Liberation Army will protect them from Iranian intimidation .
In the Far East , a similar dynamic prevails .
All of China ’s neighbors happily trade with it , but all are wary of the Middle Kingdom ’s pretensions to regional hegemony .
Even Vietnam , a country that handed America its worst military defeat ever , is eager to establish close ties with Washington as a counter to Beijing .
What of America ’s two most important allies in Northeast Asia — South Korea and Japan ?
Not long ago , relations with Seoul were frosty because it was pursuing a “ sunshine policy ” of outreach to North Korea that the George W. Bush administration ( rightly ) viewed as one of the world ’s most dangerous rogue states .
More recently , relations with Japan became strained after the election of the Liberal Democratic Party in 2009 on a platform of cozying up to China , rethinking the 50 - year - old alliance between the U.S. and Japan , and moving U.S. bases out of Okinawa .
Now Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has had to undertake an embarrassing U - turn by agreeing to an earlier plan that would move a U.S. Marine Corps air base from one part of Okinawa to another but keep it on the island .
In justifying his reversal , Hatoyama said that “ we cannot afford to reduce the U.S. military deterrence ” because of “ political uncertainties remaining in East Asia . ”
There is no shortage of such uncertainties with the Chinese navy becoming increasingly assertive in moving into Japanese waters and with North Korea , which has missiles that can easily hit Japan , sinking a South Korean naval ship with the loss of 46 sailors .
The latter incident naturally has focused attention in Seoul and served to accelerate the reaffirmation of close American - Korean ties that had already begun with the election of the more conservative President Lee Myung - bak in 2008 .
The anti-Americanism that had been prevalent in South Korea only a few years ago has all but disappeared , and it is not only ( or even mainly ) because of President Obama ’s vaunted charm .
It is largely because South Korea has tried detente and found that it did nothing to moderate the aggressive behavior of the North Korean regime .
China is South Korea ’s largest trade partner by far , but Beijing shows scant interest in reining in Kim Jong Il .
The greatest fear of Chinese leaders is that North Korea will collapse , leading to a horde of refugees moving north and , eventually , the creation an American - allied regime on the Yalu River .
Rather than risk this strategic calamity , China continues to prop up the crazy North Korean communists — to the growing consternation of South Koreans , who can never forget that Seoul , a city of 15 million people , is within range of what the top U.S. commander in South Korea describes as the world ’s largest concentration of artillery .
South Korea knows that only the U.S. offers the deterrence needed to keep a nuclear - armed North Korea in check .
That is why the South Koreans , who have one of the world ’s largest militaries ( 655,000 activity - duty personnel ) , are eager to host 28,000 American troops in perpetuity and even to hand over their military forces in wartime to the command of an American four - star general .
Under an agreement negotiated during the Bush administration , operational control is due to revert to the South Koreans in 2012 , but senior members of the government and military told us they want to push that date back by a number of years .
South Korea ’s eagerness to continue subordinating its armed forces to American control is the ultimate vote of confidence in American leadership .
What other country would the South Koreans possibly entrust with the very core of their national existence ?
Not China , that ’s for sure .
And yet South Korea is not so unusual in this regard .
The Persian Gulf emirates also entrust their continued existence to America ’s benign power .
The Kurds , whom we visited in Irbil , are eager to host an American base , because they know that all of the gains they have made since 1991 have been made possible by American protection .
Even Arab Iraqi politicians , who traffic in nationalist slogans while running for office , are quietly talking about renegotiating the accord that would bring the U.S. troop presence in Iraq down to zero by the end of 2011 .
They know what Kosovars , Kuwaitis and countless others have learned over many decades : American power is the world ’s best guarantor of freedom and prosperity .
This is n’t to deny the prevalence of anti-Americanism even in the Age of Obama .
Nor is it to wish away the real threats to American power — from external challenges ( Iran , China , Islamist terrorists ) to , more worrying , internal weaknesses ( rising debt levels , decreasing military spending as a percentage of the federal budget , a shrinking Navy ) .
But if my cross - global jaunt taught me anything , it is that those countries that dismiss the prospects for continuing American leadership do so at their peril .
The U.S. still possesses unprecedented power projection capabilities , and , just as important , it is armed with the goodwill of countless countries that know the U.S. offers protection from local bullies .
They may resent us , but they fear their neighbors , and that ’s the ultimate buttress of our status as the world ’s sole superpower .

UPDATE : Unfortunately the BBC does n’t fare any better when it comes to kowtowing to the lobby .
But Channel 4 has a formidable anchor in the person of Jon Snow .
See below for a video of Snow ’s interview with Israel ’s chief propagandist Mark Regev .
Glenn Greenwald lays out the context for the confrontation :
I was just on MSNBC talking about Israel , the Gaza blockade and the flotilla attack with Eliot Spitzer , who was guest - hosting for Dylan Ratigan .
It was a rather contentious discussion , though quite illustrative of how Israel is ( and is not ) typically discussed on American television , so I ’m posting the whole 8 - minute segment below .
Two points : ( 1 ) before I was on , Spitzer had on an Israel - defending law professor , followed by Netanyahu ’s former Chief of Staff , and both of them ( along with Spitzer ) were spewing pure Israeli propaganda in uninterrupted and unchallenged fashion ; at the end of Spitzer ’s discussions with them , he asked them to “ stick around just in case , ” and once I was left , he brought at least one of them back on to respond to what I said without challenge ; ( 2 ) literally 90 seconds before my segment was about to begin , the new cam and sound system I just acquired stopped working , forcing me to unplug everything and use only my laptop cam and mic , which caused the technical aspects to be less than ideal ( though still perfectly workable ) .

This one took us a while to figure out , but here 's the deal : you apply a hydrogen peroxide gel to your teeth , use the included cheek retractors ( we 're not kidding ) to stretch out into a horrifying smile , and let the blue LEDs activate the gel 's superpowers .
To fill the one - hour treatment time with something other than thinking about where your vanity has led you , the kit also comes with " a real , high - quality MUSIC HEADSET " ( aka headphones ) that you can hook up to an MP3 player .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Scientists in the U.S. and U.K. have demonstrated that the short - lived radioactive and neutron - rich isotope tin-132 has a doubly magic nucleus .
Protons and neutrons in nuclei occupy orbital shells in a similar way to electrons in atoms .
Nuclear magic numbers were first identified in 1948 by Maria Goeppert - Mayer , who shared in the 1963 Nobel prize for physics for her work on developing the nuclear shell model .
Nuclear magic numbers are the numbers of nucleons ( protons or neutrons ) that form full ( closed ) outer shells in an atomic nucleus , like the magic numbers of electrons in helium , neon and other noble ( super - stable ) gases .
The magic numbers for nuclei are 2 , 8 , 20 , 28 , 50 , 82 , and 126 , while for electrons the magic numbers are 2 , 8 , 18 , 32 , and 50 .
Magic proton or neutron numbers give the nucleus greater stability and stronger binding , and are therefore usually more common than nuclei with unfilled orbital shells .
In doubly magic nuclei both proton and neutron shells are filled , leading to even stronger binding and stability .
The outer shells of doubly magic nuclei are rigidly spherical .
Other confirmed doubly magic nuclei include helium - 4 , oxygen - 16 , lead - 208 , calcium - 49 , and nickel - 48 , which are abundant and stable , and nickel - 56 , which was discovered in 1998 and is less stable than the others , having a half - life of just 5.9 days .
Tin -132 is even more unstable with a half - life of only four seconds , which has made confirmation of its doubly magic nature difficult .
It has 50 protons and 82 neutrons , and is the first confirmed doubly magic isotope that is both neutron - rich and radioactive .
Kate Jones , from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville , Tennessee , and her colleagues used a cyclotron reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory dating from the 1950s to carry out the experiments .
Jones said they were excited to have managed the feat , when most people thought it would not be possible until newer facilities were available .
One method used to identify doubly magic nuclei has been to strip neutrons from the isotope and examine the properties of the stripped - off neutrons to infer the structure of the nucleus .
To do this a film is made of the isotope in question , and this is then hit with a beam of deuterium ( an isotope of hydrogen having one proton and one neutron ) .
Tin -132 ’s extremely short half - life made this process impossible , so Jones and her team reversed it , using the isotope as the firing beam instead of as the film being hit .
They accelerated a beam of tin-132 to about 10 percent of the speed of light and fired it at a target of deuterated polyethylene .
As the tin-132 collides with the target some of the neutrons are stripped from the deuterium molecules to form tin-133 , leaving the deuterium proton to fall back to the target .
The researchers then analyzed the energy and angular distribution of the particles and were able to confirm the stripped neutron fell into a separate orbital shell above the closed inner shells of tin-132 , which means the nucleus must be robustly spherical as expected for a doubly magical nucleus .
The research findings will help physicists studying what is called the R - process , which is thought to be the process by which over half the elements heavier than iron are created through a series of neutron captures on seed nuclei such as nickel - 56 , probably in neutron star mergers or in collapsing supernovae .
The research paper is published in the journal Nature .

Violence has split the city in recent days
As government efforts intensify to dislodge the anti-government " red- shirt " protest camp from the centre of Thailand 's capital , Bangkok , the BBC's Vaudine England looks at the prospects for peace .
Early morning in central Bangkok .
Men emerge from an makeshift bathroom area , hair neatly slicked back , towels over their shoulders , bare torsos and sarongs .
They gather around a motorbike which has just carried in newspapers showing fresh pictures of the carnage of the day before .
In cooking areas , women are chopping huge piles of vegetables .
Inside the camp , the atmosphere is friendly and purposeful .
Waiting it out A short walk east of the protest camp , through barricades and an army checkpoint , one enters a different world .
Sukhumvit Road is home to hotels , bars and restaurants , apartment buildings and shopping malls .
At night , the bars are open as usual .
By day , the queues at the supermarkets are longer , and the guest - lists at hotels such as the JW Marriott , just beyond the edge of the army blockade , are changing .
General manager Peter Caprez said about half of his guests were Bangkok residents who had moved out of their homes inside the red zone .
He jokes that his hotel has become a high - class refugee camp .
" Before this , I used to say this was a political process which has to take place , and we foreigners have to remain uninvolved , " he says .
" Now , it 's not only a political struggle but a conflict on the streets .
We have to wait it out , keep our heads low and stay neutral . "
Near the hotel , beside a railway line that divides the militarised zone from the night life district , Thais are lining up at a military registration point to get permission to cross the divide .
Protesters have been living in red - shirt camps for months Crossing the political divide is much harder - many say national reconciliation will take not months , but years .
Back in the anti-government protest camp , awnings over the sleeping quarters display boards carrying gruesome pictures of dead or wounded comrades .
They are pasted up every day and groups of protesters - known as red- shirts - gather around , shaking their heads .
Six weeks ago , some of these people might have accepted an early election .
But early attempts to reach a deal collapsed .
Then 25 people - 19 of them red - shirt protesters - were killed in fighting on 10 April .
Since then , the anger has only grown .
The protesters have lived on the streets for many weeks , becoming increasingly confident as they derided what they saw as the weakness and vacillation of the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva .
They have settled in , with wooden pallets to raise their coloured mats , fans and mosquito nets - and a warm sense of community .
The old guard
But even if any protesters choose or are forced to leave , the anger will not go away so easily .
" The shooting is very bad , [ it is ] very bad people to kill people who have nothing , " says Lek Suthin .
He is usually a motorbike driver but is now spending time in the red - shirt camp .
Upmarket hotels are seeing a marked change in clientele
He does not insist on the return of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , but wants someone like Mr Thaksin , " somebody who makes Thailand go up " .
In the camp , demonisation of Mr Abhisit is graphic and constant .
Images of him painted as a devil are pasted on billboards advertising lavish new condominium complexes or boutiques .
He is seen by the protesters as a symbol of the patrician old guard .
Just over the wall from the Ratchaprasong camp is the Royal Bangkok Sports Club - an elite haven including a golf course , horse racing track and club house in the heart of the city .
The contrasts of rich and poor are a fitting reminder of what lies at the heart of this conflict - the loss of faith among the less privileged members of Thai society in the post - war consensus about how this country is run .
The protesters accuse Mr Abhisit of being unelected ; his supporters point out that he has been voted into parliament in seven elections , and became prime minister through a vote in parliament .
The red -shirts feel the process lacked legitimacy .
They say the old elite was behind the military coup that deposed Mr Thaksin in 2006 , and that the courts were politically influenced when they threw out the two Thaksin - allied governments that followed .
They assail what they call the double standards - terrorism charges against their own leaders while one of the so - called yellow - shirts , whose protests arguably helped bring down a government in 2008 , is now foreign minister .
People have lost faith in the system .
These people are not only the poor , Thaksin - lovers from the rural north - east , but also leftist intellectuals and middle class workers in Bangkok , who help to swell the camp 's numbers every evening .
Hardliners on the up ?
Where once there was certainty that the monarch would intervene , there is now concern about the health of the 82 - year old King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
The protesters say Abhisit Vejjajiva came to power illegally Old lines of authority and allegiance are fracturing .
Police have been seen joining the protesters , government ultimatums have been ignored , peace talks have fallen apart .
Mainstream red - shirt leaders and some government figures appear united in their wish for a negotiated settlement .
But hardliners on each side appear to have gained ascendancy .
And a violent , almost paramilitary , edge has come to the streets in recent days - whether aligned to either side is unclear .
It is helping to create more bloody pictures for the protesters to get angry about .
And it is confirming that just another crackdown and another election will not be enough to bring peace to Bangkok .

BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - Maxi Rodriguez scored twice as Argentina routed Canada 5 - 0 Monday in their final match on home soil before heading to the World Cup .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Winger Angel Di Maria also scored a fine goal at a packed Monumental stadium against a Canada side who were overwhelmed at times by the speed and precision of Argentina ’s attacks .
Diego Maradona ’s side , featuring reserve centre backs and without the rested Lionel Messi , went ahead after quarter of an hour with a right - footed free kick from Rodriguez .
Just past the half - hour mark he scored again , finishing off a lightning break that demonstrated the strength of Maradona ’s team on the counter - attack .
The ball came out of defence to Gonzalo Higuain , who laid it off to Carlos Tevez breaking through the middle .
Faced with two defenders
Tevez passed it to his right where Rodriguez hit a low first - time shot under goalkeeper Patrick Onstad .
Di Maria made it 3 - 0 shortly before the interval when he surprised the Canada defence by curling the ball inside the far post with the outside of his left foot .
“ The lads understood what I wanted , there are no friendlies , ” Maradona said in a televised interview on the pitch .
“ The fans can relax , we have good players . ”
The hard - working Tevez also got on the scoresheet just past the hour from a lay - off in the box by Higuain .
Sergio Aguero replaced Tevez and had only been on the pitch a minute when he took a long pass out to the left , cut inside , wrong - footed a defender and scored the fifth .
Argentina will face Nigeria , South Korea and Greece in Group B at the June 11 - July 11 World Cup finals in South Africa .

Ruy Teixeira is a demographics expert who is the co-author with John Judis of The Emerging Democratic Majority ( 2002 . )
He 's currently a Senior Fellow at both The Century Foundation and Center for American Progress and has recently published a working paper entitled Demographic Change and the Future of the Parties ( .pdf , 45 pages ) , reviewed here by Tom Schaller for FiveThirtyEight.com and Ed Kilgore at the Democratic Strategist .
Ruy 's work was featured yesterday in a NY Times column by Charles Blow .
From his CAP page :
Teixeira 's recent writings include " Demographic Change and the Future of the Parties , " " The European Paradox " ( with Matt Browne and John Halpin ) , " New Progressive America , " " New Progressive America : The Millennial Generation " ( with David Madland ) , and " The Decline of the White Working Class and the Rise of a Mass Upper Middle Class " ( with Alan Abramowitz ) .
Ruy has kindly agreed to answer a few question for us pertaining to the working paper and some selected contemporary political issues .
Daily Kos :
You ’ve been following demographic trends for years .
In your working paper , you note that the working class white vote , which is often conservative - oriented , is declining and by remarkable percentages ( 25 % in PA over twenty years , 24 % in NV ) , suggesting major repercussions for conservative politics .
Are those trends everywhere ?
Are places like the demographic changes since 1988
Ruy Teixeira : Absolutely — these trends are very definitely affecting states like these .
There ’s a table in the paper where I show the decline in the share of white working class voters by state since 1988 in all states where exit poll data are available .
Since 1988 , the share of white working - class voters in Florida has declined 17 points , while the white college graduate share has risen 4 points and the minority share is up by 12 points .
In Texas , the white working class share is down 17 points , with minorities up 9 points and white college graduates up 7 points .
In Ohio the share of white working - class voters fell by 15 points between 1988 and 2008 while white college graduates rose by 8 points and minorities by 6 points .
Even a state like Mississippi has seen a huge drop in the white working class vote since 1988 ( down 21 points ) .
These trends will continue to affect red states in the future .
About 90 percent of future population growth in Texas will be from minorities particularly Hispanics .
And the highest growth rates in the Hispanic population are currently seen in five southern states : Arkansas , Georgia , South Carolina , Tennessee and North Carolina .
Daily Kos :
The millennial voters by our polling and by others including Pew are one of the most progressive and Democratic party - leaning demographics .
What ’s their make - up and in your opinion are they likely to stay progressive and leaning Democratic ?
Ruy Teixeira :
By 2020 , Millennials will be just under 40 percent of eligible voters and will be even more heavily minority ( 44 percent ) than they are today .
This generation is not only growing rapidly and voting consistently Democratic but also leans heavily Democratic on party identification .
The recent difficult political environment for the Democrats has seen their overall party identification lead slip considerably , but they have retained a double digit lead ( 14 points ) among Millennials in the latest Pew analysis .
And Millennials hold a raft of progressive positions in various issue areas that should continue to propel them toward the Democrats .
On social issues , Millennials support gay marriage , take race and gender equality as givens , are tolerant of religious and family diversity , have an open and positive attitude toward immigration , and generally display little interest in fighting over the divisive social issues of the past .
They are also notably progressive on foreign policy issues , and favor a multilateral and cooperative foreign policy more than their elders .
Millennials , more so than other generations , want a stronger government to make the economy work better , help those in need , and provide more services .
These views extend to a range of domestic policy issues including education , clean energy , and , especially , health care .
But will Millennials remain as progressive as they are today ?
Some argue that Millennials will surely become more conservative as they age — a lifecycle effect will moderate their youthful progressivism and send them toward the GOP .
While it is possible that the Millennial generation may become more conservative as they age , evidence suggests that they are likely to remain largely progressive .
Dismissing Millennial progressivism as just the product of youth would be misguided .
To being with , while the degree to which people maintain the attitudes and opinions that they currently have throughout their life is a point of much debate , the general thrust of academic literature is that political ideas and attachments that are developed in early adulthood tend to last .
Research suggests that a socialization process occurs that leads young adults to hold onto the party identification and opinions that they developed in their formative years .
This is especially true with partisan identification .
Party identification is the single strongest predictor of how people vote and tends to stick with individuals once they form an attachment early in their political lives .
Duane F. Alwin and Jon A. Krosnick analyzed NES panel data over several decades and argue in a study in the American Journal of Sociology that " party loyalties either increase or persist with age . "
There is less research about whether people maintain their support for specific issues rather than general partisanship .
Yet many of these academic studies raise considerable doubt about claims that people naturally become less progressive as they age .
Alwin and Krosnick argue that attitude stability " appears to occur immediately following early adulthood ... and appears to remain at a constant and high - level throughout the remainder of the life cycle . "
This is particularly true on social issues but there is good evidence of relative stability on economic issues as well ( for much more on this , see my CAP report with David Madland , New Progressive America : The Millennial Generation ) .
It therefore seems unlikely that aging will make this generation any more amenable to strict economic and social conservatism .
Here as elsewhere the GOP will have to move to the center to compete for these voters and mitigate their currently large disadvantage .
And Democrats are likely to remain in a strong position though policy failure could certainly compress their advantage .
Daily Kos : Karen Tumulty wrote a fascinating article this past week
As political gambles go , it 's a big and risky one : $ 50 million to test the proposition that the Democratic Party 's outreach to new voters that helped make Barack Obama president can work in an election where his name is not on the ballot ...
suggesting that the Obama administration was targeting new voters at the expense of the traditional base voter .
Is this a misread of who the base is , or a continuation of inevitable demographic shift ?
Ruy Teixeira :
This strikes me as a good idea .
Critics of this approach are certainly right to note that these new voters , many of whom are from low turnout demographics like Hispanics and particularly young people , will not turn out at the levels of so - called base voters who have been in the electorate for a longer time .
But it still should be possible to increase the turnout rates of these new voters and reduce this differential — research suggests that outreach efforts , particularly those with a high dose of personal contact , can make a real difference in turnout levels .
That would obviously benefit the Democrats .
Of course , there are opportunity costs to these outreach efforts .
But my sense is that it will still be money well - spent , particularly when we keep in mind that the new Millennial and minority voters of today are the base voters of tomorrow .
Time and money spent contacting and motivating these voters is likely to pay off not just in this election but in future ones as well .
Daily Kos :
Some polls suggest that the AZ immigration approach under Jan Brewer is very popular , other polls suggest comprehensive reform is also popular .
Can these observations be reconciled ?
What effect is this likely to have on voters looking ahead beyond 2010 ?
Ruy Teixeira :
Yes it is true that the AZ ’s draconian immigration law and comprehensive immigration reform are both popular .
Consider these results from a bipartisan poll by Lake Research Partners and Public Opinion Strategies , conducted for America 's Voice .
In that poll — conducted after passage of the Arizona law — voters were asked if they supported " comprehensive immigration reform , " defined as :
" Under this proposal , the federal government would strengthen border security and crack down on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants .
Illegal immigrants currently living in the United States would be required to register with the federal government , undergo criminal background checks , pay taxes , learn English , and go to the back of the line for U.S. citizenship . "
This proposal received overwhelming support , 78 percent in favor against 16 percent against , despite all the publicity about the Arizona law .
How is that possible given the documented public support for the Arizona law ?
The reason is very simple : supporters of the Arizona law are also overwhelmingly supportive ( 84 percent ) of comprehensive immigration reform .
This suggests that much of the support for the Arizona law reflects an urgent desire for action on the immigration issue rather than a single - minded commitment to the Arizona approach .
Looking ahead , this suggests that comprehensive immigration reform could pay considerable dividends in the long term , both solidifying Hispanic support for the Democrats and responding to the public imperative for action in this area .
And the chief effect of the AZ law may be ensuring that most Hispanics do n’t bother to give the GOP a second look .
Daily Kos : Sarah Palin is an appealing figure to female evangelicals .
Is this a rising demo , or is the " mamma grizzly " appeal a media creation ?
Ruy Teixeira : Mama grizzlies seem likely to be just the latest in a long line of media - fueled electoral chimeras for the Republicans .
The reality is that female evangelicals are not much of a growth constituency .
And white evangelical protestants overall are roughly stable as a proportion of the population .
They are no larger at this point than unmarried women — who are a growth constituency — as a proportion of eligible voters .
The growth action on the religious front is among unaffiliated or secular voters , who are the fastest - growing " religious " group in the United States .
From 1944 to 2004 the percentage of adults reporting no religious affiliation almost tripled , rising from 5 percent to 14 percent .
Projections indicate that by 2024 somewhere between 20 - 25 percent of adults will be unaffiliated .
This trend , combined with growth among non-Christian faiths and race - ethnic trends , will ensure that in very short order we will no longer be a white Christian nation .
Even today , only about 55 percent of adults are white Christians .
By 2024 that figure will be down to 45 percent .
That means that by the 2016 election ( or 2020 at the outside ) the United States will cease to be a white Christian nation .
Looking even farther down the road , by 2040 white Christians will be only around 35 percent of the population and conservative white Christians ( a critical part of the GOP base ) only about a third of that — a minority within a minority .
These developments will put increased pressure on the GOP to moderate its socially conservative stance .
That stance may appeal strongly to a key segment of their base , but that segment will shrink substantially over time as religious diversity increases .
A more moderate approach would have some chance of appealing to this diversity rather than leaving the field wide open for the Democrats .
But of course Sarah Palin and her mama grizzlies takes the GOP in precisely the opposite direction .
Daily Kos :
What do the demographic trends suggest to you in terms to the continuing ( or declining ) appeal of the tea party ?
Ruy Teixeira :
The tea party concentrates in one place the most extreme and reactionary views of the GOP which is already too conservative for most voters in rising demographic groups : Hispanics and other minorities , Millennials , unmarried women , professionals , white college graduates , seculars and so on .
Therefore , while tea party activists may help drive up Republican turnout in the 2010 election , an election where the economic situation and historical patterns already ensure the GOP will make significant gains , the longer term political effects for the party will almost certainly be negative .
The demographic imperative for the Republicans is to move toward the center to compete for rising , relatively progressive constituencies .
But the tea party activists will have none of this and they will have more power , not less , over the GOP after the 2010 elections produce gains — gains the tea party forces will aggressively claim credit for .
This is the GOP dilemma — they feel the need the tea party in the short term but are trading off political flexibility in the longer term .
This loss of flexibility will , in the end , be very bad for the GOP but at this point I believe they are locked into their current path .
Daily Kos :
Thank you , Ruy Teixeira .

Be Afraid of Criminals ; Be Very Afraid of “ Good Citizens ”
Just idly listening with one ear to the TV on in the other room , I heard Rick Sanchez on CNN discussing the arrest of a college student — Robyn Foster — who reportedly became violent and disruptive in a class .
She was shouting at the instructor and other students , threw a water bottle at a critic , and refused to leave when requested to do so .
Cops showed up and carried her out ( “ You ’re goint to have to carry my ass out ” ) , managing to cuff her after a confused period of thrashing around in which they all fell to the ground several times and knocked over some desks .
She reportedly threatened legal action afterward because of alleged injuries
Viewer email responses ranged from “ the cops went too far — they always do ” ( which moved Sanchez to say “ They ’re actually blaming the cops ” ) , to “ when someone with a gun tells you to do something , you drop everything and do it . ”
Intrigued , I did a Web search to get more details .
From what I ’ve seen — and leaving aside the issue that government cops were involved — any group of people associated for some voluntary effort like a class would be fully justified in forcibly expellinganyone engaged in such egregiously disruptive behavior .
And if the disruptor resisted being ejected , and those ejecting her used only a reasonable and proportionate amount of force , she probably would n’t have any grounds for complaint if she were injured in the process .
But what really struck me was the authoritarian nature of viewer responses at YouTube and other video sites .
There was the remark above on Sanchez ’s program , about automatically doing whatever someone with a gun tells you .
That might be pretty good advice , in the same category of backing slowly away and not making any sudden moves when dealing with a rabid dog .
But in this case , I get the impression the commenter considered the mere fact of possessing a gun sufficient to put the rabid dog—er , cop — in the right .
Another viewer email to Sanchez complained of the culture of entitlement , and called for teaching the young whipper - snappers a lesson about who ’s in charge in the schools ( “ the teachers are ” ) .
Similarly , I read something in the local paper a few years ago about a nursing student who was denied her degree because she disobeyed the school administrator ’s dress code for the graduation ceremony .
The administrator justified the decision by asking something like “ What ’s she gonna do when a doctor gives her orders ? ”
Hmmm .
Last I heard , higher education is a service offered on the market .
Seems kind of odd to me that , in what should be considered a contractual exchange between equals , one party is “ in charge . ”
It ’s almost like they ’re importing some sort of in loco parentis authority relationship into an exchange of services on the market .
You know , the same way some people want to import the authoritarian culture of master - servant relationships into the wage labor relationship — what ’s supposedly another form of voluntary exchange between equals .
Come to think of it , it seems to be pretty much the same Archie Bunker types who think the person you purchase educational services from is your master , and that the person you sell your labor services to is your master .
The common denominator , apparently , is that the person sitting behind the desk calls the shots .
Another comment on the classroom incident , at Mahalo : “ I ’ve always been taught that you are to respect police and do whatever they tell you to do , regardless if you are in the wrong or not . ”
And at YouTube : “ She MUST comply with an order from a police officer … no matter what !
Her recourse is to sue for an unlawful arrest , not ignore them and fight with them when theyre forced to remove her stupid ass .
Laws are for everyone to obey …even big nasty ghetto bitches with attitudes .
Cops had no choice . “
Wow .
Just wow .
This is what comes of a society in which most people spend the first eighteen years of their lives being taught to do whatever is necessary to please an authority figure behind a desk , watching CNN war coverage and shows like COPS that teach them to roll over and show their bellies to any alpha male in uniform , and spend another forty years in which their livelihood is entirely at the mercy of some boss .
That ’s one hell of a lot of mutually reinforcing conditioning , all to the effect that when someone in a putative position of authority says to do something , a Good Little Do Bee just does it without question .
That disruptive student was a dolt , plain and simple .
I ’d really hate to have someone like her disrupting an event where people were trying to get something done .
But it ’s the “ good , ” non-disruptive people out there who REALLY scare me .
I ’m not afraid of the disruptors kicking my door in at 3 AM , or turning me in to the Gestapo .
But I ’m afraid the Good Germans in this society might do just that under the right set of conditions .
“ In addition to the job listings , In addition to the job listings , several people working with Amazon who are not authorized to speak publicly about products in development , said Amazon representatives had been meeting with publishers to discuss new games the company hoped to put on the new version of the Kindle .
It is unclear , though , when consumers could expect a new product , ” Nick Bilton reported .
The political lessons of the Thai protests
By Peter Symonds
27 May 2010
Last week ’s military crackdown may have crushed anti-government protests in the streets of Bangkok but the underlying social tensions and political issues remain and will inevitably erupt , sooner or later , in new forms .
After four years of bitter feuding in the Thai ruling class , supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra called the protests in mid-March to hit back against their factional opponents and the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva .
The sharp divisions in the political establishment , however , opened the door to a broader movement dominated by protesters from the country ’s rural north and northeast .
As the demonstrations continued , the farmers , traders and small businesspeople began to find their own voice .
The “ Red Shirt ” protesters pointed to the chasm between their lives and those of the wealthy who worked and shopped in Bangkok ’s commercial hub .
They expressed their hostility to Thailand ’s traditional elites — the army , state bureaucracy and monarchy — that had ousted Thaksin , for whom they had voted and regarded , wrongly , as their champion .
These protesters showed ample courage and determination .
Using little more than slingshots and petrol bombs , they drove back soldiers who tried to clear a protest site on April 10 .
Amid a mounting death toll , thousands stayed even as the army cut off supplies and marshalled troops and armoured vehicles for a final showdown .
When the military moved in , groups of protesters denounced the “ Red Shirt ” leaders who surrendered , and torched buildings regarded as symbols of wealth and privilege .
The rampage , however , only exposed the critical weakness of the movement — it lacked a program and perspective to advance its interests .
The events in Bangkok are a striking confirmation of the essentials of the Theory of Permanent Revolution elaborated more than a century ago by Leon Trotsky .
Drawing on the experiences of the 1905 Revolution in Russia , Trotsky drew far - reaching conclusions : firstly , that the bourgeoisie in backward capitalist countries was organically incapable of leading a genuine struggle for democratic rights or addressing the needs of the peasantry ; secondly , that the peasantry could not play an independent political role and inevitably followed either the bourgeoisie or the working class ; and thirdly that the proletariat was the only social force able to lead the peasantry in a struggle against the Czar .
Having achieved power , the working class would be compelled to make inroads into private property as an integral component of the world socialist revolution .
The theory passed its first and most decisive test in the year of 1917 , which produced the October Revolution and the world ’s first workers ’ state in Russia .
Much has changed in the past 100 years , but basic class dynamics under the outmoded profit system remain the same .
In the absence of a politically conscious movement of the working class , the farmers , petty proprietors and rural poor flocked to Bangkok under the banner of the Thaksin and his United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship ( UDD ) .
For all his demagogy about “ democracy , ” Thaksin ’s aim was limited to early elections and a government more conducive to his interests .
When in office , Thaksin repeatedly demonstrated his contempt for democratic rights — journalists were threatened , hundreds of extrajudicial killings took place in his “ war on drugs ” and military operations were stepped up against Islamic separatists in the south .
Moreover , the telecom billionaire Thaksin is no more capable than the Oxford - educated Abhisit of resolving the deepening social crisis facing Thailand ’s rural masses .
Thaksin ’s limited handouts and cheap health care were part of his government ’s efforts to stimulate the Thai economy in the wake of the devastating 1997 - 98 Asian financial crisis .
Thaksin and the UDD leaders are staunch defenders of the capitalist system that is the root cause of the financial uncertainty and indebtedness facing farmers and small businesspeople .
Predictably , rather than extending the protests , the UDD confined and ultimately abandoned the demonstrations as the confrontation with the state apparatus intensified .
At the same time , the social grievances expressed by various protesters were never formulated into a political program — nor could they have been .
As Trotsky pointed out , the peasantry is not a homogeneous class — its upper layers have ties with the bourgeoisie , while its lower ranks merge with the rural proletariat .
Unlike the working class that expands with the development of capitalism , this class of petty proprietors is , in the long term , doomed by further economic development .
In Thailand , the percentage of the population in agriculture has plunged from 70 percent of the total labour force in 1980 to 40 percent today .
Only the working class can assist the rural masses by abolishing the profit system that is the source of their oppression and providing financial and technical aid .
In the latest events in Thailand , the working class played no independent role .
Insofar as workers participated , it was as individuals under the UDD banner .
Opponents of Marxism will no doubt cite this as further evidence that the proletariat is not a revolutionary class .
But the transformation of the working class from an exploited mass into a revolutionary social force requires , above all , a consciousness of its class interests and is impossible without a party that educates , mobilises and leads it into battle .
The lack of such a party in Thailand is the legacy of the far - reaching betrayals of Stalinism and its apologists that must now be overcome .
The Stalinist bureaucracy that usurped power from the working class in the Soviet Union promoted the reactionary program of “ Socialism in One Country ” and denounced Trotsky and socialist internationalism .
In Asia , Stalin resurrected the discredited two - stage theory that assigned a progressive role to the national bourgeoisie , with disastrous consequences in the Chinese revolution of 1925 - 27 .
While Trotsky ’s Permanent Revolution was buried under a mountain of calumny and lies , the banal peasant radicalism of Mao Zedong was presented as Marxism and guerrilla warfare as the way forward for countries like Thailand .
The bankruptcy of Maoism is demonstrated above all by its “ success ” in China , where Mao ’s political descendants have transformed the country into the sweatshop of world capitalism .
The political wreckage of Maoist guerrilla projects is evident throughout the region .
In Thailand , the now defunct Communist Party turned to guerrilla warfare in the 1960s .
Students radicalised by the political turmoil of the 1970s that culminated in the brutal 1976 massacre at Thammasat University were not turned to the working class , but to the countryside .
Many returned disillusioned .
The Maoists of yesteryear are today integrated into the Thai political establishment , including as “ left ” political advisers to both the UDD and its opponents .
Thailand , like the rest of the world , is being plunged into a new period of revolutionary upheaval by the crisis of global capitalism .
The protests in Bangkok are a harbinger of events that will inevitably bring the working class in Thailand and internationally into struggle .
As throughout the rest of Asia , the proletariat that was in its infancy at the turn of the twentieth century has vastly expanded in size and is integrated into global production processes .
Global capital has transformed Thailand into the world ’s 10th largest auto exporter , with around 400,000 auto workers .
The challenge facing workers and young people in Thailand is the construction of a political party based on the program of socialist internationalism that can lead the working class in the struggles ahead .
Above all , that requires the assimilation of Trotsky ’s Theory of Permanent Revolution and the lessons of the key strategic experiences of the working class in Thailand and internationally during the twentieth century .
That is only possible as an integral part of the world Trotskyist movement — the International Committee of the Fourth International .
Jupiter has lost a belt , giving sky - watchers an unusual view of the gas giant planet 's pale bottom .
Two wide stripes — known as the equatorial belts — normally circle the huge planet , products of the fast - moving jet streams that roar through Jupiter 's atmosphere .
But pictures of Jupiter taken by an amateur astronomer show that sometime during the past couple weeks , the south equatorial belt completely faded from view .
" The basic view of Jupiter is of two dark belts .
Now there is only one , " said Alan MacRobert , senior editor of Sky & Telescope magazine .
" This is the most obvious change on Jupiter that I can recall , " he said , adding that anyone with a backyard telescope should be able to see the difference .
" Any instrument powerful enough to show any of Jupiter 's surface features will easily reveal the change . "
( See a picture of a dark spot on Jupiter made by a recent impact . )
However , the planet 's " belt buckle " remains :
The lost stripe " means that Jupiter 's Great Red Spot is now floating all alone in whiteness , whereas usually it is in an indentation in the south equatorial belt , " MacRobert said .
The spot — actually a raging storm three times bigger than Earth — is rarely brick red , he added , and often becomes quite pale .
MacRobert characterizes its current color as " somewhat orangy . "
( Find out why the Great Red Spot has been shrinking . )
Jupiter 's Dark Belt Lost to Light Cloud Cover ?
Despite the dramatic change on Jupiter , the lost belt does n't concern experts .
The planet has lost this stripe before , most recently in the 1970s and the early '90s .
So far , the stripe has always reappeared .
Astronomers are , however , somewhat stumped for a complete explanation .
A dozen or so jet streams move alternately east - west and west - east on Jupiter , said planetary scientist Andrew Ingersoll of the California Institute of Technology .
The clouds in between these jet streams create the planet 's multicolored stripes and swirls .
Unlike atmospheric features on Earth , Jupiter 's streams have remained at constant strengths and stayed in almost exactly the same locations since we first got a close look at them during the Voyager 1 probe flybys in 1979 .
( See a Voyager picture of Jupiter 's Great Red Spot . )
The shifting upwellings and downwellings of north - south air currents may cause changes to the cloudy stripes by bringing up different substances , changing the belts ' shapes and chemical compositions , Ingersoll said .
" If one band has an upwelling , at least the top of those clouds could spread out over [ and obscure ] neighboring bands , " he said .
" What 's probably happened is that this very slow upwelling or downwelling circulation has changed , but we can't measure it . "
But even if lighter clouds have covered darker ones , scientists do n't yet know what causes the different colors of Jovian belts , Ingersoll added .
Jupiter 's clouds may be made of ammonia , hydrogen sulfide , or other substances .
Each chemical would react differently to environmental changes , such as exposure to sunlight .
" We still have n't figured the colors out , " Ingersoll said .
" It could be sulfur compounds , it could be organic compounds — or even more exotic things like phosphorous .
We just do n't know the chemistry . "
Such mysteries about Jupiter may soon be solved by NASA 's Juno probe , due to launch in 2011 to study the Jovian system .
Not Certain Jupiter 's Lost Belt Will Return
In the meantime , people hoping to catch a glimpse of the " new " Jupiter might have to rise early .
Sky - watchers in mid-northern latitudes , including the U.S. and Europe , should look to the east in the brightening skies about an hour before sunrise , Sky & Telescope 's MacRobert advised .
" It 's by far the brightest thing low in the east , " he said .
" You ca n't miss it . "
Many people might also be keeping their eyes peeled for the stripe 's eventual return , which Caltech 's Ingersoll said is likely — but not absolutely certain .
NEW YORK — Speaking at an HBO press junket Monday , acclaimed writer - producer David Simon , creator of the gritty urban dramas The Wire and Treme , announced that his next project will be an epic , multilayered examination of the contented and comfortable streets of suburban Wilmette , IL .
Critics have praised the show 's true - to - life depiction of Wilmette 's occasional recycling - pickup problem .

According to Simon , the sprawling new series , tentatively titled The Township , will offer a searing and unsentimental glimpse into the happy social fabric of modern - day Wilmette , an area known for its deeply untroubled history and well - functioning political structure .
" As a writer , my mission is to tell a story that makes viewers think about how conditions in American cities are created , " Simon told reporters .
" We can't just turn our back on the staggering levels of happiness occurring in a place like Wilmette and say , ' Well , that 's not my life . '
We have to confront this tranquility head - on and shine a light on the institutions that are responsible for it . "

Added Simon , " I want this show to be an unflinching dissection of how the system has in no way failed the people of this town . "
According to HBO sources , the novelistic series will chronicle the interconnected web of police officers , politicians , tradespeople , teachers , and ordinary families who are " all complicit " in perpetuating the cycle of institutional effectiveness that makes Wilmette the seventh best place in the country to raise children .

Using these disparate strands , Simon hopes to weave a narrative of civil ease and affluence that extends all the way from Wilmette 's happy schoolchildren to the competent , fairly elected trustees of its Village Board .
" Each episode will explore , in unsparing detail , many different facets of Wilmette , " Simon said .
" One might begin by depicting the productive bureaucracy lurking behind the Wilmette PTA , and then suddenly shift its focus to the struggles of a Wilmette policewoman desperately trying to settle on the right color scheme for a new addition to her home . "

" It 's a panorama , " Simon continued .
" A panorama that asks , ' What are the inherent niceties that bind these characters together ? ' "
The Township will feature an ensemble cast , including actors Wendell Pierce and Dominic West from The Wire as a pair of successful , well - adjusted real estate agents who occasionally grab one quick drink after work before returning home to the families they love .

Simon also confirmed that he had hired a number of his usual writing collaborators , including hard - edged urban - crime author Richard Price , to help realistically capture the pleasant , grammatically impeccable vernacular used on the nice streets of Wilmette .
Real - life citizens of the town will also be cast in various small roles to lend the show an intense , you - are - there quality .
" It 's crucial to the veracity of the series that we depict Wilmette as it really is , frills and all , " said Simon , who claimed that shooting at the actual promenades and well - maintained public spaces of Wilmette will provide a powerful sense of authenticity .
" The tree - lined avenues , the manicured lawns , the quaint but state - of - the - art school buildings — we 're going to take all these things , put them on the screen , and say , ' See ?
This , this , is the real Wilmette . ' "

Simon concluded his announcement by stressing that , even under pressure from the network , he would not shy away from portraying some of the tougher elements of Wilmette life that take place each and every day .
" The truth is that some pretty unpleasant things happen in Wilmette , " Simon said .
" Sometimes it rains .
Sometimes a kid accidentally leaves his backpack at school .
Our goal is to show how these problems develop . "

Added Simon , " And to show how they are quickly resolved , too . "

" Please do n't take our apathy and detachment personally .
We have no awareness of who we really are .
Without the constant feed of electronic devices , our minds are like television static . "

I am wide - awake at 2 a.m.
I 'm watching the Wikileaks video of American soldiers gunning down Iraqi civilians for kicks on a loop , but the reality of the footage wo n't compute .
I can't feel shocked .
Eventually I give up and collapse into an uneasy sleep , disgusted with myself .
If I 'm not outraged , then I must be sympathetic with it on a primitive level .
My generation 's notion of what is real and unreal has become blurred .
The video is little more than an unsatisfactory piece of entertainment , inferior in brutality and detail to computer games and films .
This mindset is the product of our media - saturated lifestyle .
We grew up isolated in our bedrooms and were formed by entertainment machines that allowed us to disappear into a black hole .
Even on the move , we can stick headphones in our ears to deafen thought .
Our daily life is a seamless blend of the mundane and fantasy that becomes surrealistic .
We are amusement junkies .
We are like the smoker with his cough or the fast food addict with his mammoth waistline .
Stunted and simplistic speech is the sign of our sickness .
We have devoted little time to our intellectual development through reflection , reading and debate .
Our mind is weak and disorientated , a tumbler drier of media , impulses and implanted desires .
Seduced into being intellectual cripples , we can barely express anything more than impulses ; we can't talk , we TWITTER .
The result is a strange zombie - like creature that is incapable of intimacy with others .
Please do n't take our apathy and detachment personally .
We have no awareness of who we really are .
Without the constant feed of electronic devices , our minds are like television static .
We feel no urgency to develop intelligence because there is no outlet for it .
What is the point of reading and formulating your own ideas if those around you want nothing but novelty and cheap thrills ?
I felt I was playing with fire by reading and writing .
I would fight to reach out to my friends .
Their superficial exterior consisted of mimicked bits and pieces from entertainment .
Who were they really ?
The problem was that they did n't know either .
We never did find out .
The effect of blasting your senses with amusement all day long is the dissolution of the self .
Entertainment culture was reflected in the perfect dominance of group mentality in my school .
The ' alternative ' groups were always the most conformist .
Goths in my town expressed their resistance to the dominant culture by hanging out with other identically dressed Goths .
I remember a story of a teenage girl who started taking Prozac to cure her depression .
Upon taking the drug she seemed much improved to those close to her , until one evening she was watching television with her parents and without warning walked into the garage and hung herself .
All the drug did was numb her mind as her inner turmoil continued to escalate , and overdosing on amusement has the same effect .
I can see this in the drinking culture of Britain .
We have a desperate need to intoxicate ourselves to function in social situations .
From my early teens we would gather at night and drink intent to make ourselves sick .
We did it to purge ourselves of the pain we felt .
When you are lost in media , you become alienated from your own perceptions and experiences , and in consequence the pain you suffer is terribly abstract .
I remember reading Boxing autobiographies as a teen and feeling jealous of the men who had fought their way out of poverty - stricken backgrounds .
They could at least see an enemy and had the opportunity to channel their desire for success in a constructive way .
“ At first , I could not do it , ” she said .
“ My sister - in - law went for me .
But then we went together , and now I do what I have to do . ”
In addition to two hot meals , she is given a loaf of bread , a liter of milk and four containers of yogurt .

Soon , the Riveras will borrow a car from a relative and go to France , where they expect to camp while picking beets , asparagus and artichokes , then grapes in the fall .
They got work there last year , though the cost of the campsite ate up half their wages .
This time , a French farmer has agreed to let them stay on his property .
Mr. Rivera ’s predicament is hardly unique .
Mayors across Andalusia say local residents come to their offices all the time looking for work .
Some do not want farmwork , saying it is too hard .
But many , says Emilio Vergara , mayor of Paterna del Campo , a small farming village outside Huelva , would gladly take it .
Together with three other nearby mayors , Mr. Vergara began an effort to persuade farmers to hire local people .
But , he says , of the 450 people who signed up from his village , none have been offered a job .
“ I am concerned about a potential outburst of xenophobia , and hope that it can be avoided at all costs , because Spain is traditionally a hospitable country , ” Mr. Vergara said .
Experts say some farmers do hire immigrants to take advantage of them .
Mr. Cañamero , the union leader , says 15 to 20 cases of serious abuse are reported each year , in which workers have not been paid or do not have enough food or water .
This story by Madhvi Ramani considers the struggle of one person to measure up to the beauty standard
The first thing I saw were her feet and right off I knew she was a stunner .
By then , I had become a connoisseur of feet .
Feet and lower legs to be precise .
I had just moved into a basement flat in South Kensington .
It was a curious place to be , stuck halfway between the earth ’s surface and the underworld .
The front room had a window that looked out at the main road .
The pavement was at eye level , and just above it , about 30 centimetres high and a metre wide , was the sky .
Across this patch of sky would skate , run , walk , shuffle and stumble legs of all shapes and sizes .
I was hanging up a print of ‘ The Scream ’ , when I heard the approaching tap tap tap of her heels .
The only reason I turned to look at those feet was because I had heard them coming down the steps that led to the pavement from the flat above me and I was therefore curious to see what my neighbour looked like .
I saw a perfect white foot held in a high - heeled leather shoe , in an arch that reminded me of the shape that women ’s feet make just before orgasm .
One of her delicate ankles was decorated with a thin silver anklet from which dangled a single pink pearl that rolled against her marble - smooth skin as she walked .
Her leg – from what little I could see of it – was shapely and firm .
Before I could get to the window to get a better look at her , she was gone .
I said the first thing that came into my head ; ‘ I love you ’ .
She twisted round like a doll to look back at me
I sat on the armchair in my living room all night watching legs criss - cross past my window waiting for her return .
I had to see her .
I woke up to a growling sound .
It was dark and raining , and a black cab had pulled up outside .
The door of the cab opened and those perfect white feet flashed across the slimy black pavement and pitter - pattered up the stairs , out of sight .
For the next couple of weeks , although I was vigilant , I did n’t catch a glimpse of her .
Then one day , we bumped into each other just as I had climbed up my stairs and she had descended hers .
She was like a porcelain figure .
Her skin was clear and smooth , her hair , bright gold , her body thin and tight with all the right curves in the right places , her nose straight and narrow , her neck long , her cheeks rosy , her mouth red , her eyes bright and blue , her expression expressionless .
After a brief second , she turned to go on her way .
I had to stop her .
I said the first thing that came into my head ; “ I love you ” .
She twisted round like a doll to look back at me .
“ What ’s your name ? ” I said , trying quickly to redeem myself .
She laughed – a hollow , playful , tinkerbelle laugh .
“ But you ’re not thin enough , ” she said , and walked away .
Over the next few weeks I did everything I could to lose weight .
I had never thought about it before , but since she pointed it out , I realised that I was overweight .
I looked into my gold gilt mirror that I had not found space to hang up yet and saw myself through her eyes ; a paunch , love - handles , flabby thighs , thick arms .
Compared to her I was a pig .
I did the Atkins diet , the GI diet , the Zone , the Liquid Diet , Raw , Macrobiotic , Weight Watchers – until I was as lean as I had ever been .
I returned to her like a trimmed piece of meat , packaged in shorts and a tight t- shirt , certain that she would not turn down the opportunity to devour me now .
No way .
No way was I going to do that !
I rang the bell to her apartment and waited .
She answered the door , and wore that same , unmoving doll - like face as before .
“ It ´s me . ” I said “ I´ve lost weight ”
She eyed me up and down , then , in her sing - song voice , she said , “ There ’s still some fat , and your skin … ” she shook her head and closed the door .
I went back to the mirror .
Indeed , my skin had become saggy since I had lost all that weight , and there was still a bit of fat around my lower abdomen and lumps in my thighs that I just could not get rid of .
I went to a plastic surgeon .
Dr Clay Corpus prowled around my body like an eccentric artist , marking me with different coloured felt - tip pens .
Here was a man who clearly knew what he was doing .
First I had the lipo- suction , then the tummy tuck .
I had no more fat now and my skin was taut .
I felt born again – in fact Dr Clay Corpus had redone my belly - button as part of my surgery , moulding my round , deep well into a long and narrow slit , so it was partly true .
I went back to her as a beautiful person .
Again , there was no joy in her eyes when she met the new , improved me .
I tried to make conversation before she slammed the door in my face again , and asked her , once more , for her name .
There was no answer to my question .
Instead , she commented that my hair was too dark .
I went to a hairdresser and had it bleached and highlighted .
Of course , when I went back to Paris – for that is what I had started calling her as she reminded me of the famous heiress – she said that it was not nearly long enough .
I got extensions put in .
From that point on , I became obsessed .
I had my nails done , the skin on my face pulled tight , my toes made slimmer , my nose made straight , silicone implants inserted into my chest and arms , my eyes made brighter , my thighs and legs shaped curvaceously , and my glutens tightened .
I was ready .
This time I was sure .
When I met her at her door this time , there was a flicker in her bright blue eyes .
She put her hand on my cheek and ran it down my smooth skin , my hard and firm chest , all the way down to my groin – where she stopped and pulled away .
Before she could say it , I shook my head .
No way .
No way was I going to do that !
I sat in my apartment , distraught .
All this – and for it to come to nothing .
I needed to talk to somebody .
I went to see Dr Corpus .
He was ecstatic , and convinced me that the operation would make me complete .
The process took place in three stages , the castration , the remoulding , and finally the labiaplasty to make it look plump and symmetrical .
I had spent months at home in my darkened apartment , recovering from each stage of the operation .
Then one day I turned on the lights .
I took down ‘ The Scream ’ and hung the mirror in its place .
As I caught my reflection , I fell in love ; I looked exactly like Paris Hilton .

Pablo Solon ( second from left ) and the Bolivian delegation address a press conference during the Copenhagen climate talks , December 2009 .
Pablo Solon interviewed by Derrick O'Keefe
While G20 leaders barely made mention of the climate crisis , Pablo Solon , Bolivia 's UN ambassador , was in Toronto to encourage action on the Cochabamba protocols .
It is no surprise that Pablo Solon , Bolivia ’s chief climate negotiator and ambassador to the United Nations , was not on the list of special invitees to the G8 / G20 meetings in Ontario this weekend .
After all , in April Solon and the Bolivian government he represents organised the World People ’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth , an international convergence of as many as 30,000 people determined to challenge the Copenhagen Accord being pushed by the world ’s richest countries .
Solon was invited to Toronto to share the results and lessons of Cochabamba by the Council of Canadians .
He was one of a number of featured speakers at the council ’s " Shout Out for Global Justice " attended by more than 2500 people June 25 at Toronto ’s Massey Hall .
[ You can read Solon 's speech at Climate and Capitalism . ]
Before going on stage at Massey Hall , he sat down with me to discuss the BP oil spill , the contradictions of Bolivia ’s process of transformation and the next steps going forward from Cochabamba .
Derrick O’Keefe :
It ’s worth noting that the historic BP explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico happened in April at the same time as the Cochabamba World People ’s Conference on Climate Change was taking place .
Do you see any silver lining in terms of an increased consciousness around these issues , after the BP disaster .
Pablo Solon :
You know , the other day I was in the Mermaid Parade on Coney Island , usually it ’s an event where artists come together .
And I was surprised to see that that parade became a protest against BP , with the mermaids saying , " We do n’t want to live in the toilet of BP " .
There were a lot of protest signs there .
So I am absolutely sure that the issue of BP and what has happened has raised consciousness everywhere .
This is very important for the issue of climate change because the issue is the same , the only difference is that the oil goes into the ocean instead of the atmosphere .
You can not see it like you can see it in the Gulf of Mexico but it is the same issue , and it ’s the same because it keeps going on and on , and if this continues then you have less and less space in the atmosphere , the same as in the ocean .
What are the key steps , post - Cochabamba , for you in preparing for the next round of negotiations at Cancun ?
The key point is that the conclusions of the Cochabamba summit were formally presented to the United Nations process of negotiation on climate change on May 26 .
But they were n’t taken into account .
And now we have a new version of the text that is going to facilitate the negotiations that does n’t take Cochabamba into account – not at all , not one single proposal – and it does n’t take into account even the proposals of the G77 - plus China .
So we need to put a lot of pressure in order to see first included , as options , the Cochabamba proposals .
This is the key thing , because the negotiations for climate change are not only going to be in Cancun , they are already going on .
The next meeting we are going to have is August 2 in Bonn .
So we need to have the pressure of all of civil society and the social movements in order to have those proposals put back as options on the table in the process of negotiation .
That is key .
There was an informal working group at Cochabamba , Group 18 .
What do you say to their criticism that Bolivia is still an economy based on extraction industries , and that mining and natural gas exploitation should be stopped ?
That there is a contradiction between the international discourse of the Bolivian government and your country ’s local development model ?
The problem is that you cannot change everything in four years .
The main resource of Bolivia is gas , and if we are able to have growing employment and we are able to have growing salaries and we are able to have more social benefits it ’s because we have nationalised gas .
So if we were to just shut down our gas , we would be committing suicide .
So I can understand that , from the perspective of some environmentalist groups , but I would say that they have to look at the big picture , because otherwise the process in Bolivia would n’t have any forward [ movement ] .
That does n’t mean that we want to be a country that forever lives from mining and gas .
We need to be a country that , first of all , develops some kind of industry that adds value to what we produce , because at the moment we only export raw materials .
But you cannot change that just by saying " just leave everything under the ground " , you have to find a way to change from that kind of model to another model .
And there also needs to be technology transfer and redistribution – climate debt payment – from the global North .
How much time does it take to develop industry ?
For example , Bolivia imports paper .
Bolivia could produce paper .
Bolivia imports nails , but we have rich resources of iron , but we need to be able to develop this .
The problem is that from some environmentalists ’ perspective , and also from the perspective of some in the North -- what they do n’t take into account is the need of countries like Bolivia to go through a process of development in order to have enough resources to change the reality .
But we do n’t want to follow the same path of developed countries .
But that does n’t mean that you can suddenly say , " oh we can stop producing gas . "
That would mean bankruptcy .
And the fall of your government as well .
The fall of the government .
That is the reality .
Those are the contradictions of the reality too .
So there is only an international solution ?
You ca n’t have climate justice in one country any more that you can have socialism in one country .
Yes .
One of the most inspiring things about Bolivia ’s process is the power and pride of the country ’s Indigenous majority , reclaiming and refounding the nation .
What is your message to Indigenous movements in Canada ?
I would say that in order to change that reality it is necessary to strengthen our capacity of organisation , unifying different kinds of social movements .
Indigenous people have reach out to urban groups , trade unions , NGOs .
Our experience , even though Indigenous people are a majority , is that you ca n’t change reality if you are not able to build alliances , to build a powerful coalition that brings everybody together .
So that is the challenge that we have now .
We have to build a movement that is global , that is able to defend Mother Earth , that is able to defend the rights of immigrants and workers .
Once we see that our rights are related to the rights of others then we begin to build that alternative .
Jessica
Stern is among the world ’s experts on violence and evil , a woman who spends her time thinking about bad men and bad deeds .
She has lectured at Harvard about terrorism and is the author of a respected book , “ Terror in the Name of God : Why Religious Militants Kill ” ( 2003 ) .
During the Clinton administration she was on the staff of the National Security Council .
She presents herself as hard , no - nonsense , buttoned up .
She is certainly possessed of the perfect surname .
“ If the plane goes down , ” she writes in “ Denial , ” her new memoir , “ you want me at the controls . ”
“ Denial ” is Ms. Stern ’s plainspoken and very raw account of why , long before 9/11 , she was driven to study terrorism and to put herself repeatedly into danger as she flew around the world , like some scholarly twin of the former CNN war correspondent Christiane Amanpour , interviewing committed terrorists .
Central among the reasons , it turns out , was her own experience of terror .
On Oct. 1 , 1973 , when Ms. Stern was 15 and her sister 14 , the two of them , alone in a suburban house in leafy Concord , Mass . , were raped by a man who cut the house ’s telephone lines before walking inside and leading them upstairs .
Ms. Stern describes that evening in brutal detail .
It was a night that changed her and taught her a dire lesson : “ Shame can be sexually transmitted . ”
The crime was n’t properly investigated .
The police did n’t believe her when she said the rapist was a stranger .
Because her story and those of others were not publicized or taken seriously enough by the police , the same man was able to rape some 44 girls — an incredible , heart - collapsing number — from 1971 to 1973 .
“ The entire community , ” she writes , “ was in denial . ”
About these facts Ms. Stern is understandably bitter .
Her pain is amplified by other sinister aspects of her upbringing .
There was the grandfather who took naked showers with her and may have molested her .
This same grandfather , a doctor , thought X - ray machines had curative powers and accidentally killed Ms. Stern ’s mother , who he believed had an enlarged thymus .
She died at 28 from lymphoma caused by an overdose of radiation ; the author , at the time , was 3 .
Ms. Stern ’s father , who had twice remarried , did not care enough , upon learning that his daughters had been raped , to return immediately from a trip abroad .
This was a family with issues — issues that , like the sun , were stared at only glancingly .
The Geography of the European Monetary Union
Introducing the Euro
Mechanics of a Euro Exit
Scenario 1 : Germany Reinstitutes the Deutschmark
Scenario 2 : Greece Leaves the Euro
The drachma would not be a store of value , given that the objective in reintroducing it is to reduce its value .
The drachma would likely only be accepted within Greece , and even there it would not be accepted everywhere — a condition likely to persist for some time .
Reinstituting the drachma unilaterally would likely see Greece cast out of the eurozone , and therefore also the European Union as per rules explained above .
The European Dilemma
Rumors that Greece may exit the eurozone hit European media late Friday , May 6 .
The rumors are reminiscent of those that circulated in mid-2010 that said Spain was going to access the European Financial Stability Fund ( EFSF ) over the weekend , rumors which also started on a Friday .
One reason these rumors have emerged may be that a number of investors have put themselves into a position where they have bets on the euro that are about to turn sour .
As our analysis from 2010 below illustrates , however , leaving the eurozone is not a simple affair , and certainly not something one does over the weekend , if ever .
Rumors of the imminent collapse of the eurozone continue to swirl despite the Europeans ' best efforts to hold the currency union together .
Some accounts in the financial world have even suggested that Germany 's frustration with the crisis could cause Berlin to quit the eurozone — as soon as this past weekend , according to some — while at the most recent gathering of European leaders French President Nicolas Sarkozy apparently threatened to bolt the bloc if Berlin did not help Greece .
Meanwhile , many in Germany — including Chancellor Angela Merkel herself at one point — have called for the creation of a mechanism by which Greece — or the eurozone 's other over - indebted , uncompetitive economies — could be kicked out of the eurozone in the future should they not mend their " irresponsible " spending habits .
Rumors , hints , threats , suggestions and information " from well - placed sources " all seem to point to the hot topic in Europe at the moment , namely , the reconstitution of the eurozone whether by a German exit or a Greek expulsion .
We turn to this topic with the question of whether such an option even exists .
As we consider the future of the euro , it is important to remember that the economic underpinnings of paper money are not nearly as important as the political underpinnings .
Paper currencies in use throughout the world today hold no value without the underlying political decision to make them the legal tender of commercial activity .
This means a government must be willing and capable enough to enforce the currency as a legal form of debt settlement , and refusal to accept paper currency is , within limitations , punishable by law .
The trouble with the euro is that it attempts to overlay a monetary dynamic on a geography that does not necessarily lend itself to a single economic or political " space . "
The eurozone has a single central bank , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , and therefore has only one monetary policy , regardless of whether one is located in Northern or Southern Europe .
Herein lies the fundamental geographic problem of the euro .
Europe is the second - smallest continent on the planet but has the second - largest number of states packed into its territory .
This is not a coincidence .
Europe 's multitude of peninsulas , large islands and mountain chains create the geographic conditions that often allow even the weakest political authority to persist .
Thus , the Montenegrins have held out against the Ottomans , just as the Irish have against the English .
Despite this patchwork of political authorities , the Continent 's plentiful navigable rivers , large bays and serrated coastlines enable the easy movement of goods and ideas across Europe .
This encourages the accumulation of capital due to the low costs of transport while simultaneously encouraging the rapid spread of technological advances , which has allowed the various European states to become astonishingly rich :
Five of the top 10 world economies hail from the Continent despite their relatively small populations .
Europe 's network of rivers and seas are not integrated via a single dominant river or sea network , however , meaning capital generation occurs in small , sequestered economic centers .
To this day , and despite significant political and economic integration , there is no European New York .
In Europe 's case , the Danube has Vienna , the Po has Milan , the Baltic Sea has Stockholm , the Rhineland has both Amsterdam and Frankfurt and the Thames has London .
This system of multiple capital centers is then overlaid on Europe 's states , which jealously guard control over their capital and , by extension , their banking systems .
Despite a multitude of different centers of economic — and by extension , political — power , some states , due to geography , are unable to access any capital centers of their own .
Much of the Club Med states are geographically disadvantaged .
Aside from the Po Valley of northern Italy — and to an extent the Rhone — Southern Europe lacks a single river useful for commerce .
Consequently , Northern Europe is more urban , industrial and technocratic while Southern Europe tends to be more rural , agricultural and capital - poor .
Given the barrage of economic volatility and challenges the eurozone has confronted in recent quarters and the challenges presented by housing such divergent geography and history under one monetary roof , it is easy to forget why the eurozone was originally formed .
The Cold War made the European Union possible .
For centuries , Europe was home to feuding empires and states .
After World War II , it became the home of devastated peoples whose security was the responsibility of the United States .
Through the Bretton Woods agreement , the United States crafted an economic grouping that regenerated Western Europe 's economic fortunes under a security rubric that Washington firmly controlled .
Freed of security competition , the Europeans not only were free to pursue economic growth , they also enjoyed nearly unlimited access to the American market to fuel that growth .
Economic integration within Europe to maximize these opportunities made perfect sense .
The United States encouraged the economic and political integration because it gave a political underpinning to a security alliance it imposed on Europe , i.e. , NATO .
Thus , the European Economic Community — the predecessor to today 's European Union — was born .
When the United States abandoned the gold standard in 1971 ( for reasons largely unconnected to things European ) , Washington essentially abrogated the Bretton Woods currency pegs that went with it .
One result was a European panic .
Floating currencies raised the inevitability of currency competition among the European states , the exact sort of competition that contributed to the Great Depression 40 years earlier .
Almost immediately , the need to limit that competition sharpened , first with currency coordination efforts still concentrating on the U.S. dollar and then from 1979 on with efforts focused on the deutschmark .
The specter of a unified Germany in 1989 further invigorated economic integration .
The euro was in large part an attempt to give Berlin the necessary incentives so that it would not depart the EU project .
But to get Berlin on board with the idea of sharing its currency with the rest of Europe , the eurozone was modeled after the Bundesbank and its deutschmark .
To join the eurozone , a country must abide by rigorous " convergence criteria " designed to synchronize the economy of the acceding country with Germany 's economy .
The criteria include a budget deficit of less than 3 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; government debt levels of less than 60 percent of GDP ; annual inflation no higher than 1.5 percentage points above the average of the lowest three members ' annual inflation ; and a two - year trial period during which the acceding country 's national currency must float within a plus - or - minus 15 percent currency band against the euro .
As cracks have begun to show in both the political and economic support for the eurozone , however , it is clear that the convergence criteria failed to overcome divergent geography and history .
Greece 's violations of the Growth and Stability Pact are clearly the most egregious , but essentially all eurozone members — including France and Germany , which helped draft the rules — have contravened the rules from the very beginning .
The EU treaties as presently constituted contractually obligate every EU member state — except Denmark and the United Kingdom , which negotiated opt-outs — to become a eurozone member state at some point .
Forcible expulsion or self - imposed exit is technically illegal , or at best would require the approval of all 27 member states ( never mind the question about why a troubled eurozone member would approve its own expulsion ) .
Even if it could be managed , surely there are current and soon - to - be eurozone members that would be wary of establishing such a precedent , especially when their fiscal situation could soon be similar to Athens ' situation .
One creative option making the rounds would allow the European Union to technically expel members without breaking the treaties .
It would involve setting up a new European Union without the offending state ( say , Greece ) and establishing within the new institutions a new eurozone as well .
Such manipulations would not necessarily destroy the existing European Union ; its major members would " simply " recreate the institutions without the member they do not much care for .
Though creative , the proposed solution it is still rife with problems .
In such a reduced eurozone , Germany would hold undisputed power , something the rest of Europe might not exactly embrace .
If France and the Benelux countries reconstituted the eurozone with Berlin , Germany 's economy would go from constituting 26.8 percent of eurozone version 1.0's overall output to 45.6 percent of eurozone version 2.0 's overall output .
Even states that would be expressly excluded would be able to get in a devastating parting shot :
The southern European economies could simply default on any debt held by entities within the countries of the new eurozone .
With these political issues and complications in mind , we turn to the two scenarios of eurozone reconstitution that have garnered the most attention in the media .
The option of leaving the eurozone for Germany boils down to the potential liabilities that Berlin would be on the hook for if Portugal , Spain , Italy and Ireland followed Greece down the default path .
As Germany prepares itself to vote on its 123 billion euro contribution to the 750 billion euro financial aid mechanism for the eurozone — which sits on top of the 23 billion euros it already approved for Athens alone — the question of whether " it is all worth it " must be on top of every German policymaker 's mind .
This is especially the case as political opposition to the bailout mounts among German voters and Merkel 's coalition partners and political allies .
In the latest polls , 47 percent of Germans favor adopting the deutschmark .
Furthermore , Merkel 's governing coalition lost a crucial state - level election May 9 in a sign of mounting dissatisfaction with her Christian Democratic Union and its coalition ally , the Free Democratic Party .
Even though the governing coalition managed to push through the Greek bailout , there are now serious doubts that Merkel will be able to do the same with the eurozone - wide mechanism May 21 .
Germany would therefore not be leaving the eurozone to save its economy or extricate itself from its own debts , but rather to avoid the financial burden of supporting the Club Med economies and their ability to service their 3 trillion euro mountain of debt .
At some point , Germany may decide to cut its losses — potentially as much as 500 billion euros , which is the approximate exposure of German banks to Club Med debt — and decide that further bailouts are just throwing money into a bottomless pit .
Furthermore , while Germany could always simply rely on the ECB to break all of its rules and begin the policy of purchasing the debt of troubled eurozone governments with newly created money ( " quantitative easing " ) , that in itself would also constitute a bailout .
The rest of the eurozone , including Germany , would be paying for it through the weakening of the euro .
Were this moment to dawn on Germany it would have to mean that the situation had deteriorated significantly .
AsSTRATFOR has recently argued , the eurozone provides Germany with considerable economic benefits .
Its neighbors are unable to undercut German exports with currency depreciation , and German exports have in turn gained in terms of overall eurozone exports on both the global and eurozone markets .
Since euro adoption , unit labor costs in Club Med have increased relative to Germany 's by approximately 25 percent , further entrenching Germany 's competitive edge .
Before Germany could again use the deutschmark , Germany would first have to reinstate its central bank ( the Bundesbank ) , withdraw its reserves from the ECB , print its own currency and then re-denominate the country 's assets and liabilities in deutschmarks .
While it would not necessarily be a smooth or easy process , Germany could reintroduce its national currency with far more ease than other eurozone members could .
The deutschmark had a well - established reputation for being a store of value , as the renowned Bundesbank directed Germany 's monetary policy .
If Germany were to reintroduce its national currency , it is highly unlikely that Europeans would believe that Germany had forgotten how to run a central bank —
Germany 's institutional memory would return quickly , re-establishing the credibility of both the Bundesbank and , by extension , the deutschmark .
As Germany would be replacing a weaker and weakening currency with a stronger and more stable one , if market participants did not simply welcome the exchange , they would be substantially less resistant to the change than what could be expected in other eurozone countries .
Germany would therefore not necessarily have to resort to militant crackdowns on capital flows to halt capital trying to escape conversion .
Germany would probably also be able to re-denominate all its debts in the deutschmark via bond swaps .
Market participants would accept this exchange because they would probably have far more faith in a deutschmark backed by Germany than in a euro backed by the remaining eurozone member states .
Reinstituting the deutschmark would still be an imperfect process , however , and there would likely be some collateral damage , particularly to Germany 's financial sector .
German banks own much of the debt issued by Club Med , which would likely default on repayment in the event Germany parted with the euro .
If it reached the point that Germany was going to break with the eurozone , those losses would likely pale in comparison to the costs — be they economic or political — of remaining within the eurozone and financially supporting its continued existence .
If Athens were able to control its monetary policy , it would ostensibly be able to " solve " the two major problems currently plaguing the Greek economy .
First ,
Athens could ease its financing problems substantially .
The Greek central bank could print money and purchase government debt , bypassing the credit markets .
Second , reintroducing its currency would allow Athens to then devalue it , which would stimulate external demand for Greek exports and spur economic growth .
This would obviate the need to undergo painful " internal devaluation " via austerity measures that the Greeks have been forced to impose as a condition for their bailout by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the EU .
If Athens were to reinstitute its national currency with the goal of being able to control monetary policy , however , the government would first have to get its national currency circulating ( a necessary condition for devaluation ) .
The first practical problem is that no one is going to want this new currency , principally because it would be clear that the government would only be reintroducing it to devalue it .
Unlike during the Eurozone accession process — where participation was motivated by the actual and perceived benefits of adopting a strong / stable currency and receiving lower interest rates , new funds and the ability to transact in many more places — " de- euroizing " offers no such incentives for market participants :
The government would essentially be asking investors and its own population to sign a social contract that the government clearly intends to abrogate in the future , if not immediately once it is able to .
Therefore , the only way to get the currency circulating would be by force .
The goal would not be to convert every euro - denominated asset into drachmas but rather to get a sufficiently large chunk of the assets so that the government could jumpstart the drachma 's circulation .
To be done effectively , the government would want to minimize the amount of money that could escape conversion by either being withdrawn or transferred into asset classes easy to conceal from discovery and appropriation .
This would require capital controls and shutting down banks and likely also physical force to prevent even more chaos on the streets of Athens than seen at present .
Once the money was locked down , the government would then forcibly convert banks ' holdings by literally replacing banks ' holdings with a similar amount in the national currency .
Greeks could then only withdraw their funds in newly issued drachmas that the government gave the banks to service those requests .
At the same time , all government spending / payments would be made in the national currency , boosting circulation .
The government also would have to show willingness to prosecute anyone using euros on the black market , lest the newly instituted drachma become completely worthless .
Since nobody save the government would want to do this , at the first hint that the government would be moving in this direction , the first thing the Greeks will want to do is withdraw all funds from any institution where their wealth would be at risk .
Similarly , the first thing that investors would do — and remember that Greece is as capital - poor as Germany is capital - rich — is cut all exposure .
This would require that the forcible conversion be coordinated and definitive , and most important , it would need to be as unexpected as possible .
Realistically , the only way to make this transition without completely unhinging the Greek economy and shredding Greece 's social fabric would be to coordinate with organizations that could provide assistance and oversight .
If the IMF , ECB or eurozone member states were to coordinate the transition period and perhaps provide some backing for the national currency 's value during that transition period , the chances of a less - than - completely - disruptive transition would increase .
It is difficult to imagine circumstances under which such support would not dwarf the 110 billion euro bailout already on the table .
For if Europe 's populations are so resistant to the Greek bailout now , what would they think about their governments assuming even more risk by propping up a former eurozone country 's entire financial system so that the country could escape its debt responsibilities to the rest of the eurozone ?
Europe therefore finds itself being tied in a Gordian knot .
On one hand , the Continent 's geography presents a number of incongruities that cannot be overcome without a Herculean ( and politically unpalatable ) effort on the part of Southern Europe and ( equally unpopular ) accommodation on the part of Northern Europe .
On the other hand , the cost of exit from the eurozone — particularly at a time of global financial calamity , when the move would be in danger of precipitating an even greater crisis — is daunting to say the least .
The resulting conundrum is one in which reconstitution of the eurozone may make sense at some point down the line .
But the interlinked web of economic , political , legal and institutional relationships makes this nearly impossible .
The cost of exit is prohibitively high , regardless of whether it makes sense .
Eat your heart out Geoffrey Howe .
Take a back seat Norman Lamont .
Austerity has a new champion and his name is George Osborne .
Today 's budget was billed as tough but that failed to do justice to a package that made Sir Stafford Cripps look like a soft touch .
Not content with the £ 73bn of tax increases and spending cuts inherited from Alistair Darling , Osborne added an extra £ 40bn of tightening of his own .
Brutal stuff , but if things go according to plan the bulk of Britain 's record peacetime deficit will have disappeared by the end of this parliament , the financial markets will give Mr Masochism a big thumbs up , a re-energised private sector will take the place of a shrunken public sector to be the engine of growth , the north will grow as rapidly as the south , and the coalition government will reap a big political dividend come the next election .
That all rests , though , on a very big " if " : the ability of the enfeebled and unbalanced UK economy to withstand these draconian measures without slipping back into recession .
Should that be the case the coalition could be dead in the water within 18 months .
But let 's start with some plus points .
For a chancellor of only six weeks , Osborne delivered his budget like a grizzled veteran : he was clear , crisp and eschewed the irritating gimmicks that Gordon Brown used to favour .
Provided you accept the premises on which the government 's economic strategy is built , the package made eminent good sense .
What 's more , there was evidence that lessons had been learned from Conservative mistakes of the 1980s and 1990s , both in the attempt to shield the poorest from the full impact of the measures – at least temporarily – and from the acceptance that indiscriminately cutting capital spending is short - termism of the most futile sort .
There were plenty of regressive measures in the budget – the VAT increase , the three - year freeze on child benefit , the indexing of benefits to consumer prices rather than retail prices – but this was not a crude " soak the poor " affair .
The £ 2bn increase in child tax credit , bringing forward the restoration of the earnings link with the state pension , and the £ 1,000 increase in the personal allowance all helped to soften the blow from the budget .
Taking all the tax and benefit measures into account , everybody loses but the biggest losers in the short - term were those households with incomes of more than £ 50,000 – the richest 10 % .
The increases in the child element of the child tax credit lasts for two years only : from 2012 - 13 onwards this budget looks a whole lot less progressive .
The sense that the budget was less fair than it looked was underlined by the soft - touch approach to the City .
The increase in capital gains tax was smaller than expected and the £ 2bn bank levy was hardly suitable punishment given the role of the financial sector in Britain 's most grievous post - war recession .
Campaigners for a so - called Robin Hood tax said Osborne could have raised £ 20 bn through a financial transaction tax – enough to pay for the £ 12bn he will raise from pushing up VAT to 20 % with plenty to spare .
The next chapter in the austerity saga will be written over the next few months and published in late October in the form of a comprehensive spending review that will take the axe to departmental budgets in the three years from 2011 - 12 .
These cuts are likely to fall disproportionately on the poor families that rely most on public services .
But unlike Howe in 1981 , Osborne was able to make a decent fist of portraying his budget as an equitable sharing of unavoidable pain .
Indeed , his summing up – " We've had to relearn the virtue of financial prudence .
But in doing so we have ensured that the burden is fairly shared " – was positively Crippsian in its mixture of moral repugnance for debt and its 1940s echo of the whole nation being in this together .
Interestingly , both Cripps and Osborne had the same macro-economic objective for their budgets .
They wanted Britain 's resources to be biased towards investment and exports rather than consumption ; in the 1940s the squeeze came in the form of a continuation of wartime rationing ; over the next few years it will come largely through a shrinking of the state .
The rebalancing was easier to finesse in the 1940s than it is now .
At that time Britain was the second biggest manufacturing nation in the world , the US had fully recovered from the Depression , the global economy was poised for a reconstruction boom , and many rival powers – Germany , France , Italy , Japan – had seen their industries ravaged by the war .
In 2010 , Britain 's share of world manufacturing has shrivelled , the recovery in the US is petering out and the eurozone – the destination for more than 50 % of UK visible exports – is crisis - ridden and economically stagnant .
As such , this budget is a colossal gamble .
There was little evidence before the election that Darling 's fiscal plans – themselves draconian – were insufficient to keep the febrile financial markets sweet .
The pound and gilts strengthened during the election campaign , even though the possibility of a hung parliament was ever - present .
The international backdrop is less favourable now than it was two months ago , both because growth prospects are weaker and because the deficit - cutting fraternity have the upper hand in the G20 .
Far from being a terrible evil , government spending spared Britain from an even worse recession in 2008 and 2009 , and Osborne 's doctrinaire approach to deficit cutting risks not just slower growth and higher unemployment , but a fresh leg to the downturn .
Not all the lessons of the 1980s have been learned , it seems .
ULUKHAKTOK , N.W.T. — Researchers in the Northwest Territories say they may have found the first recorded offspring of a hybrid female polar - grizzly bear in the wild .
Government officials say an Inuvialuit hunter , David Kuptana , shot an unusual - looking bear during a hunting trip April 8 near Banks Island , in the Inuvik region .
He provided federal scientists with samples to see what type of bear it was .
Officials with the territorial government say those test showed that the dead bear was the offspring of another hybrid bear — a female polar - grizzly mix who had mated with a male grizzly .
Scientists confirmed this by comparing the dead bear ’s DNA with that of local polar bear and grizzly populations , and that of a male polar - grizzly hybrid , which was shot on Banks Island in 2006 .
Officials say it confirms that a female hybrid bear in the region is reproducing with other bears .

On his FNC program The O’Reilly Factor tonight , Bill O’Reilly used the Gulf oil spill as evidence that President Obama has become more polarizing than George W. Bush , “ The fuse has been lit .
President Obama has become even more polarizing than George W. Bush was . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

O’Reilly said , “ The United States is the most powerful country the world has ever seen , and now it is an angry nation .
The fuse has been lit .
President Obama has become even more polarizing than George W. Bush was , and almost every elected politician is in danger of losing his or her job .
Simply put , Americans are fed up .
They believe they can no longer control their own lives . ”
That is a nice little bit of Fox News fantasy O’Reilly put out there .
It ’s too bad that it is n’t true .
If Americans are so fed up and there is such a rising tide coming in the November elections , then why are these establishment politicians from both parties doing so well in the primaries ?
There is no doubt that Americans are frustrated and angry about the economy and the oil spill , but if Obama is so polarizing , why are n’t Republicans more popular ?
Why have Democrats now taken a small lead on the generic congressional ballot , and why do the Republicans in Congress have an 11 % approval rating ?
If Bill - O is speaking the truth , then something does n’t add up .
It would be impossible for Obama to be as polarizing as Bush , because the Florida 2000 fiasco polarized the country before Bush ever took office .
Under his ideologically driven administration , the polarization continued to grow .
Whereas , the Right has been on a mission to obstruct , minimize , and make Obama seem as polarizing since the day he won the election .
It is their strategy to defeat him .
The Republican strategy is to make Obama look as bad as Bush , this is where Bill - O ’s comments fit in .
People like O’Reilly are hoping that the American people do n’t notice that it is the Republican Party and their media arm , Fox News who are trying to divide and polarize the nation .
Obama tried his best to be bi-partisan when he first arrived in Washington , and got spit in the eye for his efforts .
People like O’Reilly continue to blame Obama for the polarization , while they continue to work to divide the country every single day .
Bill O’Reilly can try to sell his half baked con job , and even if the viewers of Fox News are n’t smart enough to see through it , lucky for us , the rest of the country is .
I ’ve written before about a study showing how you could control ulcerative colitis through your diet .
But that study involved mice , not humans .
So I asked everyone to to “ stay tuned ” because I was sure that scientists would get the same results , once they tested their claim on men and women .
And , sure enough scientists from Sweden have proven that you can in fact control colitis symptoms by eating a simple fruit .
Not only that , you can even super - charge the soothing effects adding a simple supplement .
What to do when your immune system misfires …
Many scientists believe that ulcerative colitis occurs when your immune system misfires and attacks a part of the body that it ’s supposed to protect .
In the case of ulcerative colitis , your immune system attacks the lining of your intestines , creating inflammation .
This can cause …
bloating ,
severe diarrhea ,
pain ,
and even fever .
And over time , it can even increase your risk of colon cancer .
But it turns out you can tame your immune system by adding one simple fruit to your diet …
Now , what is the super - food that reduces inflammation ?
Scientists from Sweden gave ulcerative colitis patients three different types of foods : rye bran , oat bran , and blueberries .
And contrary to all the advertisements , they found that blueberries worked the best to control painful symptoms of colitis .
Blueberries are particularly unique because they contain tannins .
These substances help to control inflammation .
Blueberries also contain plenty of insoluble fiber .
This kind of fiber does n’t break down in your intestines .
It stays intact and helps to flush away harmful waste , bacteria , and toxins .
Plus , your body converts the insoluble fiber into short - chain fatty acids , which scientists believe , also help reduce inflammation .
So , not surprisingly , when the Swedish patients ate blueberries , their symptoms improved .
The blueberries acted like a sponge in the intestines .
They soaked up anything that would typically cause inflammation and flushed it from the body .
But then , the scientists took it one step further .
They gave patients a probiotic supplement along with blueberries to see what would happen .
Surprising findings about this powerful combo
The scientists found that blueberries worked even better on UC patients when taken with a probiotic supplement .
You see , it ’s all about creating a friendly environment in your intestines .
Probiotics help to boost the friendly or “ good ” bacteria in your gut .
And blueberries contain polyphenols , which kill any harmful bacteria .
Plus , blueberries and probiotics boost your body ’s production of butyric and propionic acid .
These helpful acids feed the cells in your intestines and promote a healthy immune system .
Prior to this study , most doctors believed that these types of acids never left your intestines .
But the Swedish scientists proved that theory wrong .
They found that when UC patients took blueberries and probiotics , the helpful acids actually circulated throughout the body in the blood stream .
In my book , that ’s an important discovery .
It means that if your body makes enough of the helpful acid that some of it will spill over into your blood stream , which may help tame inflammation in other parts of the body , such as your joints .
So it ’s true – You CAN heal your body with foods
This study reaffirms what I ’ve been saying for years .
You CAN heal your body with food .
So if you ’re prone to intestinal problems , make sure to eat plenty of fruits , especially blueberries .
And to keep UC under control , make sure you also take daily probiotics .
Yogurt ’s not enough .
If you ’re lucky , a cup of yogurt will contain 10,000 active strains of bacteria by the time if reaches your mouth .
But it also comes with a host of sugar , which is counter - productive .
A good probiotic supplement will contain billions of units of active bacteria , which will actually give you the desired effect .
Your digestive tract will thank you .

Gary Troup was a middle - section survivor of Oceanic Flight 815 .
He was the author of mystery novel Bad Twin and the controversial The Valenzetti Equation .
He was one of the people who survived the initial crash of Oceanic Flight 815 but was sucked into a turbine of the plane only minutes afterwards , causing the engine to explode and kill him .
In " Pilot , Part 1 " , he was portrayed briefly by stuntman Frank Torres , but in interviews revealed on the Internet to coincide with The Lost Experience , he was impersonated by an unknown actor .
Troup 's name appeared on the wall of Jacob 's cave , suggesting he was a candidate .

Before the crash
Little is known about the author apart from information gleaned from published editors ' notes from Hyperion Publishing , where they posthumously praised Gary Troup after he disappeared on Oceanic Flight 815 .
What is known is that Troup was involved in a romantic relationship with Oceanic flight hostess Cindy Chandler , who was also present on Flight 815 .
Whether this was unrequited was never revealed .
Chandler was also given a cameo role in Bad Twin by Troup while dedicating the book to her as well .
Writing Bad Twin , Troup had also written a book on The Valenzetti Equation , detailing the theorem as well as including information on the mastermind behind it , Enzo Valenzetti .
However , it was known that the Hanso Foundation bought all copies of the book and obtained rights to reprint .
It was presumed by Troup that Alvar Hanso wanted to prevent the equation 's disclosure , with the theorem being one of the most closely guarded corporate secrets within The Hanso Foundation .
On September 16 , 2004 , 6 days before the crash , Gary Troup was interviewed by television presenter Laird Granger about his upcoming novel Bad Twin on Book Talk show # 1523 .
Troup discussed , among other things , The Hanso Foundation , The Valenzetti Equation , and his love for Cindy Chandler .
So far , only seven of nine parts of the interview have appeared on various websites in the Lost Experience , and it was suggested by Javier Grillo - Marxuach that there were no other two parts .
Troup has been described as an " acclaimed mystery writer " and a " master of quiet irony " by Hyperion Publishing .
Just days prior to boarding Flight 815 , Troup delivered the manuscript of his latest book , Bad Twin , to the publishers , and also visited Sydney , Australia to meet with Walkabout Publishing about promotion for his new book .
It was for this reason that Troup was on Oceanic Flight 815 , returning from this business trip .
Tragically , Troup had also been planning to write another book according to his interview , exposing the truths about the Hanso Foundation .
Though he was not able to accomplish it , his goal would later be achieved by Rachel Blake .

I wanted to drop you a line to tell you how delighted I am with the draft of BAD TWIN .
I think it 's the cleverest , and the same time spookiest , thing you 've done .
Good move setting some scenes in Sydney and at the reef not to mention including such an appealing , if not necessarily trustworthy Aussie woman as a love interest .
Your growing audience in our hemisphere will no doubt appreciate the local references .
I am happy to tell you that we are planning a major promotional push for your book , and I am wondering if we could lure you to Sydney sometime soon , to meet with our marketing people and to work out some details of your publicity tour .

Dear Christine–
Thanks so much for your kind note .
Like every other sort of salesman , I rub my hands with glee at the thought of expanding my territory — and Australia is a big territory .
Regarding my willingness to come to Sydney , you should know that I never miss a chance to visit your beautiful city — and if the trip is on the publisher 's dime , so much the better .
I trust that entertaining me will not be too difficult for you and your colleagues ; just have a few bottles of your excellent Shiraz on hand at all times .
Which reminds me , please do n't call me Mr. Troup anymore , I write private eye books , not literary novels and I 'm not to be taken too seriously .
Let me know when it would be convenient to have me visit , early September would work for me .
Cheers ,

Trivia
Ferrari driver Massa has scored 49 points this season
By Andrew Benson
BBC Sport at the Circuit de Catalunya
Ferrari are to launch an investigation into Felipe Massa 's performance following his continuing struggles alongside team - mate Fernando Alonso .
The Spanish Grand Prix was the fourth consecutive race at which the Brazilian has been well off Alonso 's pace .
Team principal Stefano Domenicali said : " We have to make sure the car is one he feels confident driving .
For the first time this weekend it was not the case .
" It is important to go back and see what we have done around Felipe 's car . "
Massa matched Alonso for pace at the first race of the season in Bahrain , which Alonso won from his team - mate .
But since then Massa has been several 10ths of a second behind the double world champion , who is rapidly emerging as Ferrari 's de facto number one driver .
The 29 - year - old said he did not understand why he was struggling to keep pace .
" Fernando is a very good driver but something has happened to me , " Massa said .
" Something is not going like I want , so I can't do the lap time or drive the car like I want .
" This is something that we need to understand , and improve .
" It looks like something is not working out to give the grip .
This is something that we need to understand , but I 'm sure we will . "
Until Spain , Ferrari's car was the second fastest in Formula 1 behind Red Bull , but the Italian team slipped behind McLaren on competitiveness in Barcelona .
Alonso and Domenicali both said the team were lacking aerodynamic downforce And Domenicali admitted that while Massa had been complaining about the performance of his car , that had also been the case with Alonso .
" Felipe started to complain about the level of grip of the car from the beginning and that never happened ( before ) , " Domenicali commented .
" To be honest , Fernando was also saying this . "
Alonso is second in the championship , three points behind leader Jenson Button of McLaren , with Massa down in seventh , 21 points adrift .
Alonso lost points in the second race of the season in Australia because , after catching Massa following an early spin , he was unable to pass the Brazilian .
Alonso also spent the Malaysian GP stuck behind his team - mate despite being faster than him , and controversially passed him on the way into the pits in China to avoid the same thing happening for the third race in succession .
But Domenicali said it was too early to make Alonso the number one driver to ensure his title chances Alonso added : " I 'm happy with this position [ in the championship ] , but as I said before , we need four or five podiums in a row .
" With one podium and then another three races with mistakes there is not enough to win the championship , " But I think we understand , we know the problems , we know the mistakes we made at the beginning of the championship and we arrived in Barcelona with a very good approach , super Ferrari team .
" This weekend [ we made ] no mistakes at all : preparing for qualifying in practice in a good way , at the maximum of our potential in qualifying and a very solid race .
606 : DEBATE
" Sometimes we know that we will be third , sometimes we know we will be fifth , sometimes we can maybe win the race , but we need to do our maximum and today or this weekend all the Ferrari team did the maximum so we are extremely happy with our job .
" There is a very aggressive plan of developing the car with some good gains and good improvements to come in the next races , so we are very optimistic on that .
" The championship is long .
There will be some circuits where we will be closer to Red Bull and some circuits like this weekend where we know it 's going to be more difficult .
" But overall , for the 19 races , I think we have a package , a car that can fight for the world championship which is the main goal . "

From its humble origins as a chunky black box of PC parts , the Xbox has grown into a strapping young adult -- attracting a social circle including Netflix , Facebook and Twitter .
Now , rumor has it that the Xbox 360's preening for a date with Hulu , too .
Though plans are n't set in stone , Gear Live tells us Hulu has been spotted in internal Xbox 360 dashboard builds , and that Microsoft will introduce the streaming video service as part of their Xbox LIVE experience at E3 2010 .
The publication is mighty certain here , but at this point we can't corroborate for ourselves .
If this does end up happening , the question is how much it might cost , as we hear there 's going to be some sort of fee -- perhaps Hulu will be part of that " Xbox LIVE Platinum Tier " rumor that gets dragged out most every year .
CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela will nationalize a fleet of oil rigs belonging to U.S. company Helmerich and Payne , the latest takeover in a push to socialism as President Hugo Chavez struggles with lower oil output and a recession .
A former soldier inspired by Cuba ’s Fidel Castro , Chavez has made energy nationalization the linchpin in his ‘ revolution ’ .
He has also taken over assets in telecommunications , power , steel and banking .
The 11 drilling rigs have been idled for months following a dispute over pending payments by the OPEC member ’s state oil company PDVSA .
Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said on Wednesday the rigs , the Oklahoma - based company ’s entire Venezuelan fleet , were being nationalized to bring them back into production .
Ramirez said companies that refused to put their rigs into production were part of a plan to weaken Chavez ’s government ,
“ There is a group of drill owners that has refused to discuss tariffs and services with PDVSA and have preferred to keep this equipment stored for a year , ” Ramirez told reporters in the oil producing state of Zulia .
“ That is the specific case with U.S. multinational Helmerich and Payne . ”
The company was not immediately available for comment .
Chavez , who faces legislative elections in September , often pushes ahead with radical plans during election campaigns .
The 55 - year - old leader is having a hard time in his 11th year in power .
Venezuela ’s economy is the worst performing in Latin America this year , a problem exacerbated by a drop in oil output since 2008 , power outages and soaring inflation .
NO SURPRISE
The takeover of Helmerich and Payne ’s rigs was not a surprise , considering Chavez penchant for nationalizations and the company ’s refusal to work before being paid the $ 49 million it has invoiced PDVSA .
Helmerich and Payne is a small player in the drilling industry , but global giants like Halliburton , Schlumberger and Baker Hughes also have a presence in Venezuela .
Halliburton and Schlumberger have avoided public spats with the government .
Chavez has kept pressure up on the private sector in recent months , blaming a “ parasitic bourgeoisie ” for Venezuela ’s recession and 30 percent annualized inflation ,
He has threatened to nationalize Polar , the top brewer and food processor in the country of 30 million .
The government has also seized a bank belonging to an owner of the leading opposition TV station and put an arrest warrant out for his partner , who is now on the run .
Chavez in 2007 nationalized multi-billion dollar projects in Venezuela ’s vast Orinoco oil region , persuading companies such as BP Plc , to accept minority stakes in facilities they had built .
Last year he ordered the takeover of dozens of smaller oil service companies as PDVSA , reeling from a sharp plunge in oil prices , struggled to pay contractors .
When he was flush with oil cash during a boom in oil prices that ended in 2008 , Chavez often compensated nationalized companies fairly , although the 2007 takeovers led to lawsuits from ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil .
More recently Venezuela has been slower in paying compensation .
SCO was dealt yet another blow in court today when District Judge Ted Stewart rejected the company 's motion requesting a new trial or judgement of law .
In a ruling issued today , Judge Stewart sided with a jury that issued a verdict against SCO in April , finding that Novell was the rightful owner of the UNIX SVRX copyrights .
According to Judge Stewart , SCO failed to demonstrate that the jury 's verdict contradicted the evidence presented in the case .
SCO 's campaign against the Linux operating system began in 2003 when the company claimed that Linux is an unauthorized derivative of UNIX .
On the basis of that claim , SCO sued IBM and threatened litigation against hundreds of other companies that use Linux .
The conflict took a major turn when Novell stepped up and said that it owned the relevant intellectual property and had never sold it to SCO , meaning that SCO did not have standing to bring any lawsuits regarding alleged infringement in the first place .
This led to a lengthy battle in the courts between Novell and SCO over the ownership of the UNIX SVRX copyrights .
SCO claims that it obtained the rights from Novell in an asset purchase agreement .
The actual documents that describe the terms of the agreement , however , do not include the UNIX SVRX copyrights .
The copyrights are only referenced in a term sheet that was drafted during an earlier stage of the negotiations .
In an initial bench trial where the agreement was reviewed , Judge Kimball ruled in Novell 's favor and ordered SCO to pay Novell millions of dollars .
SCO fell into bankruptcy shortly after , but continued trying to fight the ruling .
SCO eventually got a jury trial , but lost that , too .
In April , the jury ruled in favor of Novell after independently concluding that SCO never received the UNIX copyrights .
In a last - ditch effort to evade defeat , SCO filed a motion contending that it was entitled to a judgment of law or a new trial because the jury 's verdict was simply wrong .
In order to justify tossing aside the verdict in favor of a new judgement , SCO had to demonstrate that the jury 's conclusions blatantly contradicted the evidence .
Judge Stewart disagreed with SCO 's assessment .
" SCO argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the ' verdict cannot be squared with the overwhelming evidence and the law . '
The Court respectfully disagrees , " Stewart wrote in the decision .
" The jury found Novell 's version of facts to be more persuasive .
This conclusion is well supported by the evidence .
There was substantial evidence that Novell made an intentional decision to retain ownership of the copyrights . "
Because the verdict was sound , Judge Stewart sees no need to grant SCO 's motion for a new trial .
" The Court finds that the verdict is not clearly , decidedly , or overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence .
Therefore , SCO is not entitled to a new trial , " the ruling says .
" ORDERED that SCO 's Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or , in the Alternative , for a New Trial is DENIED . "
The ruling almost certainly means that SCO v. IBM will never go to trial .
Without ownership of the UNIX copyrights , SCO has no legal standing to bring copyright and misuse of IP claims .
" The Court finds that Novell had the authority under Section 4.16 ( b ) of the APA to direct SCO to waive its claims against these SVRX licensees , that Novell had the authority to waive such claims on SCO ’s behalf , and that SCO was obligated to recognize such waivers , " wrote the judge .
SCO has managed to stay alive for years despite its consistent losses in court , leading one bankruptcy judge to compare SCO 's plight to Samuel Beckett 's famous play Waiting for Godot .
It 's unlikely that the bankruptcy courts will allow SCO 's charade to continue now that two judges and one jury have all concluded that SCO does not own the SVRX UNIX copyrights on which its litigation is predicated .

As it stands now , the e-book industry is dominated by two closed and proprietary giants : Amazon ( s amzn ) and Apple ( s aapl ) .
Both have e-book platforms — the Kindle and the iPad — which they design , manufacture and control , and both have been busy trying to convince book publishers to do business with them , with Amazon pushing for lower prices and Apple giving in to publishers ’ demands for a more flexible approach .
The landscape will change dramatically later this year , however , when Google ( s goog ) is expected to launch a digital book - selling unit called Google Editions .
The search company ’s entry promises to turn the e-book business into yet another battle in the ongoing war of Open vs. Closed .
According to Google product manager Chris Palma , who described the search giant ’s plans at a recent publishing industry event in New York , it will start selling digital books in late June or July .
And unlike books bought from either Apple or Amazon , which are locked by digital rights management software and can only be read on the proprietary devices sold by those companies , Palma said that e-books bought from Google Editions will be accessible from a range of non-Google websites and will be readable on any device that has a web browser ( including presumably a Google tablet , if one ever materializes ) .
It does n’t get much more open than that .
The Google staffer said that users will even be able to buy versions of the e-books they want directly from book retailers , which would allow them to keep a larger portion of the revenue from a sale .
When it comes to pricing , however , the company apparently has n’t decided whether to set prices itself or adopt the so - called “ agency model , ” which lets publishers set the price .
The choice is an important one : Amazon has been pushing to get publishers to lower prices , hoping to spark demand for e-books that will help sell more Kindles ( the same strategy Apple chose when it was using iTunes to sell iPods ) .
But Apple has decided to play nice with publishers and use the “ agency model , ” which tends to keep e-books higher - priced .
Whatever pricing scheme it chooses , it seems clear that Google wants to come down on the side of being as open as possible — a choice likely designed , at least in part , to set the company ’s service apart from the proprietary models of its main competitors .
In a recent interview with Ken Auletta in the New Yorker , Google engineer Dan Clancy said that the company ’s approach is designed to create “ much more of an open ecosystem , ” and that Google was “ quite comfortable having a diverse range of physical retailers , whereas most of the other players would like to have a less competitive space , because they ’d like to dominate . ”
But will an open approach pull in consumers who have grown used to the Kindle or the iPad and iBooks ?
The one who stands to lose the most by Google ’s entry into the e-book market is Amazon .
The company has already lost a lot of the ground that it used to hold , thanks to Apple ’s support of the “ agency model ” of pricing .
Earlier this year , Amazon tried to force publishers to accept $ 9.99 e- book deals by threatening to remove their books from its online store — and in one case , it actually did so , with books published by Macmillan .
Unfortunately for Amazon , however , Apple launched the iPad , and along with it came an agreement with publishers to allow them to set their own prices for books , based on their existing sales models for hardcover and paperback editions .
Google ’s arrival on the scene is likely to give even more power to publishers , since they will gain even more leverage over Amazon ( and to a lesser extent Apple ) .
That will almost certainly make it harder for the company to try and bully publishers into accepting its pricing model .
And if Google decides to go with the “ agency model ” as well , and allow publishers to set the price , that could leave Amazon without much of a leg to stand on .
It ’s not clear whether that will necessarily be good for readers , however — at the moment , Amazon is the only one pushing for lower prices , and the rise of the agency model threatens to give publishers more power than they had before , which could keep e-book prices high , at least in the short term .

Do you find something seriously wrong with this scenario ?
Reports of faulty gas pedals , obstructive floor carpets , and failing breaks in Toyota and Lexus vehicles generated uproar across major media networks .
For the 4 - year period starting in 2006 , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) had reported 5 deaths , 17 injuries and 13 crashes , and an additional 29 deaths between 2000 and 2005 .
There was no hesitation among the networks and federal officials to demonize Toyota for knowingly risking the lives of people solely to empty its dealership lots .
Even Congress quickly called for a Congressional investigation , and Toyota took upon itself the responsibility to recall over 8 million vehicles .
During the same four year period while NHTSA was collecting crash data on Toyota 's lemons , the Centers for Disease Control 's ( CDC ) Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) database was gathering casualty data following vaccinations with Merck 's human papilloma virus ( HPV ) vaccine , Gardasil .
And it was clear that Merck was far ahead and winning its race against Toyota for the Lemon of the Decade Award .
Since Gardasil 's launch in 2006 , the vaccine has been responsible for 66 deaths and over 17,700 medical injuries of young girls , some as young as 11 years old .
Six percent of reported events , or 1,100 girls , were serious enough to require emergency hospitalization .
Unfortunately , vaccine injuries are not reported immediately and thoroughly as are automobile accidents and deaths .
There are no vaccine police rushing to the scene of vaccine accidents to investigate the incidents and to record injuries and fatalities accurately .
Consequently , only a fraction of vaccine adverse events are reported by pediatricians , physicians , medical clinics and hospitals , and make their way eventually into the VAERS database .
Few parents even know such a reporting system exists .
Cindy Bevington has investigated and reported about Gardasil extensively .
During a Progressive Radio Network interview , she reported on the hundreds and hundreds of emails she receives from girls , mothers and doctors around the US and other countries complaining about the HPV vaccines .
Often she receives parents ' requests " begging " for help because their pediatricians and physicians refuse to report their daughters ' adverse events as vaccine related .
By the CDC 's own admission , only 10 percent of adverse events get listed on VAERS .
Even this very conservative figure has been refuted by independent analyses ; actual records can be as low as 1 percent of all actual negative reactions for any given vaccine .
It is therefore realistic to suspect that Gardasil is associated with between 177,000 and 1.7 million adverse effects among vaccinated American girls and young women .
Medalerts.org reports that a young woman vaccinated with Gardasil is ten times more likely to file a VAERS report compared to an influenza vaccination .
HPV vaccines now account for 20 percent of all vaccine side effects aside from the H1N1 swine flu vaccine .
America 's daughters are twice as likely to have an emergency room visit .
They are four times more likely to have a death sentence , five times more likely to receive a report of " did not recover , " and seven times more likely be pronounced " disabled . "
Besides the 66 deaths , Gardasil 's serious side effects now include Guillain - Barre syndrome , lupus , seizures , anaphylactic shock , chronic fatigue , paralysis , blood clots , brain inflammation , blurred vision and blindness , convulsions , demyelinating encephalomyelitis , multiple sclerosis , pancreatitis and various digestive disorders .
Last autumn a case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , better known as Lou Gehrig 's disease , was reported .
And a recent 2010 issue of the Journal of Child Neurology investigated the case of a 16 - year old girl going blind following vaccination , a secondary symptom to multiple sclerosis .

When insects go foraging , they zoom off from their nest in complex zig - zag paths .
How do they manage to find their way back home ?
And how do they manage to do so along a straight path ?
These questions are explored in an exhibit at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition , currently taking place at the Southbank Centre in London .
" Despite their small size , ants and bees can teach us a lot about the cognitive building blocks of intelligence , and inspire the design of artificial brains for autonomous robots , " says Andrew Philippides of the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics at the University of Sussex , who helped put together the exhibit .
And it turns out that some simple maths sheds light on what goes on in insect 's brains .
The main navigation mechanism , used by most animals , is called path integration and involves a little geometry .
Look at the zig - zag path shown in blue in the diagram below .
It 's a sequence of arrows , known as vectors .
Moving along vector v 1 from the nest to point A is the same as moving one step to the right and two steps up , so we can represent the vector v 1 as a pair of numbers v 1 = ( 1,2 ) .
Similarly , we can write the vector v 2 from point A to point B as v 2 = ( 1,0 ) .
Now let 's add the two vectors as follows :
v 3 =v 1 +v 2 = ( 1,2 ) +( 1,0 ) =( 1+1,2+0 ) = ( 2,2 ) .
And now take the negative of the resulting vector v 3 :
–v 3 = ( - 2, -2 ) .
The new vector -v 3 ( taking two steps to the left and two steps down ) points from point B straight back to the nest !
The same is true if we add any number of successive vectors and then take the negative : we always get a vector pointing from our current location back to the nest .
So to know our way back home , we do n't even need to remember all the vectors we travelled along — we simply add the current one to the last total .
Biologists believe that insects have innate mechanisms to determine orientation and distance , which helps them represent each step in a foraging path by something akin to the vectors we have explored here .
Neural processing enables them to add vectors as they go along , so they always know how to get back home quick .
And insects are not the only ones — the technique explored here is sometimes called dead reckoning and it has been known to sailors for a long time .
With this technique small errors in measuring and adding up vectors can accumulate as the insect goes along .
Insects then use other mechanisms to correct these errors , for example comparing what they see now to what they remember the world looking like from the nest .
Scientists make extensive use of vector mathematics to model these other mechanisms too .
This article is based on the Maths Inside project , a collaboration of Plus and the Mathematics Promotion Unit ( run by the London Mathematical Society and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications ) , in conjunction with the How do insects find their way home ?

We all know Howcast is a source of how - to videos and guides , but is there really a need for a guide for women on how to fake an orgasm ?
We know a lot ( if not most ) women have faked an orgasm at some point of their lives ( some do it all the time ) .
Some do it to spare the guy ’s feelings , and some do it to get the guy off of them so they can go back to sleep or whatever it is they are doing ( lol ) .
Oh that ’s hilarious , now they can become masters ( or mistresses ) of fakegasms D :<
Increasingly , the Earth 's climate appears to be more connected than anyone would have imagined .
El Nino , the weather pattern that originates in a patch of the equatorial Pacific , can spawn heat waves and droughts as far away as Africa .
Now , a research team led by Brown University has established that the climate in the tropics over at least the last 2.7 million years changed in lockstep with the cyclical spread and retreat of ice sheets thousands of miles away in the Northern Hemisphere .
The findings appear to cement the link between the recent Ice Ages and temperature changes in tropical oceans .
Based on that new link , the scientists conclude that carbon dioxide has played the lead role in dictating global climate patterns , beginning with the Ice Ages and continuing today .
" We think we have the simplest explanation for the link between the Ice Ages and the tropics over that time and the apparent role of carbon dioxide in the intensification of Ice Ages and corresponding changes in the tropics , " said Timothy Herbert , professor of geological sciences at Brown and the lead author of the paper in Science .
" It certainly supports the idea of global sensitivity of climate to carbon dioxide as the first order of control on global temperature patterns , " Herbert added , " but we do n't know why .
The answer lies in the ocean , we 're pretty sure . "
The research team , including scientists from Luther College in Iowa , Lafayette College in Pennsylvania , and the University of Hong Kong , analyzed cores taken from the seabed at four locations in the tropical oceans : the Arabian Sea , the South China Sea , the eastern Pacific and the equatorial Atlantic Ocean .
They decided to zero in on tropical ocean surface temperatures because these vast bodies , which make up roughly half of the world 's oceans , in large measure orchestrate the amount of water in the atmosphere and thus rainfall patterns worldwide , as well as the concentration of water vapor , the most prevalent greenhouse gas .
Looking at the chemical remains of tiny marine organisms that lived in the sunlit zone of the ocean , the scientists were able to extract the surface temperature for the oceans for the last 3.5 million years , well before the beginning of the Ice Ages .
Beginning about 2.7 million years ago , the geologists found that tropical ocean surface temperatures dropped by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius ( 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) during each Ice Age , when ice sheets spread in the Northern Hemisphere and significantly cooled oceans in the northern latitudes .
Even more compelling , the tropics also changed when Ice Age cycles switched from roughly 41,000 - year to 100,000 - year intervals .
" The tropics are reproducing this pattern both in the cooling that accompanies the glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere and the timing of those changes , " Herbert said .
" The biggest surprise to us was how similar the patterns looked all across the tropics since about 2.7 million years ago .
We did n't expect such similarity . "
Climate scientists have a record of carbon dioxide levels for the last 800,000 years -- spanning the last seven Ice Ages -- from ice cores taken in Antarctica .
They have deduced that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere fell by about 30 percent during each cycle , and that most of that carbon dioxide was absorbed by high - latitude oceans such as the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean .
According to the new findings , this pattern began 2.7 million years ago , and the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans has intensified with each successive Ice Age .
Geologists know the Ice Ages have gotten progressively colder -- leading to larger ice sheets -- because they have found debris on the seabed of the North Atlantic and North Pacific left by icebergs that broke from the land - bound sheets .
" It seems likely that changes in carbon dioxide were the most important reason why tropical temperatures changed , along with the water vapor feedback , " Herbert said .
Herbert acknowledges that the team 's findings leave important questions .
One is why carbon dioxide began to play a major role when the Ice Ages began 2.7 million years ago .
Also left unanswered is why carbon dioxide appears to have magnified the intensity of successive Ice Ages from the beginning of the cycles to the present .
The researchers do not understand why the timing of the Ice Age cycles shifted from roughly 41,000 - year to 100,000 - year intervals .

The lorry drivers were oblivious to the stowaways hiding in one of their big TV trucks which carried them across the Channel until they arrived at their depot in England .
s stepmother -- who became the most prominent figure in the investigation into the boy 's disappearance Friday -- is scheduled to take a second polygraph test Saturday , according to a friend .
Investigators put photos of
, 40 , and the type of pickup she was driving the day Kyron vanished , on
Jaymie Finster , a longtime friend , said Horman is " tired and frustrated with the intensity of the questioning she 's been getting . "
After taking one polygraph test , Finster said , Horman is taking another one Saturday and " she 's not very happy about it . "
Finster has known Horman since they went to junior high in Roseburg and worked together in the Hillsboro School District , where Finster is a special ed teacher .
She said Horman and her husband , Kaine , are exhausted as the investigation drags on .
Friday , the Multnomah County Sheriff 's Office held a press conference to release the flier with Horman 's face on it and to dispel online rumors that the second - grader had been found .
»
»
»
»
Capt .
Jason Gates would not say whether Terri Moulton Horman is a suspect in the second - grader 's June 4 disappearance from Skyline School .
" Terri is the last known person to have seen Kyron before he disappeared , " Gates said .
" We are releasing this information at this time in hope that it helps jog people 's memory of that day . "
Horman told Finster , " I just do n't know what 's going on .
This is what I did that day . "
Finster said Horman had told Kyron 's teacher the day before that she was taking the boy to the doctor on Friday , June 11 , and gave the teacher paperwork to fill out related to the appointment .
Finster said that when Kyron did n't show up at the bus the afternoon of June 4 , Horman talked to the teacher who said she thought that Horman had taken Kyron to the doctor that day .
Horman told Finster that the child 's teacher was new , in her first year of teaching , and was hard of hearing in one ear .
" She does n't know if she understood her , " Finster said .
Investigators say Horman told them she last saw Kyron at 8:45 a.m.
June 4 as he walked to his classroom after the two had toured the school 's science fair .
Previously , officials had said that Kyron had been seen around 9 a.m. by an unnamed witness , but Gates declined to clarify the discrepancy Friday .
Gates said Terri Horman and the rest of Kyron 's family have cooperated with the investigation .
In a statement he read at the press conference , Kyron 's family expressed its support for the release of the flier .
" We want Kyron home , and we hope this will help do that , " the family said .
Gates repeatedly said he could not comment on suspects or persons of interest in the case .
In response to a question about the possible danger to the community , he said : " I can't say for certainty that it was n't stranger - to - stranger , I can't .
But I also can tell you that the need for the public to be alarmed is very low . "
Finster said Horman was very down .
" She 's exhausted .
She said I do n't understand why they keep asking me stuff .
They want me to take the polygraph again .
It does n't make sense because I did n't do anything . "
Authorities are also asking anyone who was at Skyline School between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.
June 4 to answer questions regarding Kyron 's disappearance , even if they have already been interviewed by investigators .
The form asks whether Horman or the family 's white Ford F250 pickup were seen at the school and when .
There are also questions about Kyron :
If he was seen at Skyline , when and if he was with anyone else .
Although investigators have already interviewed teachers , staff , students and parents -- in some cases , two or three times -- Gates said they want to be thorough .
" We can assure you that our primary goal is not to make any mistakes in this case -- to be as perfect as we can in investigating this case . "
Gates said the questionnaires would enable investigators to check and double - check leads .
They also want to make sure they have contacted everyone who was at Skyline that day , including people who might not normally be at the school .
" It 's very important that we reach everyone who was here , " Gates said .
Gates said the information gathered from the questionnaire would help advance the case .
" A huge part of this investigation right now is we 're eliminating a lot of leads and clearing a lot of leads , " Gates said .
" That 's important so we can get focused in . "
The pickup in question has since been towed from the Horman home .
Gates said that the family requested it be towed because of a mechanical problem and that the towing was not related to the investigation .
Gates said officials continued to make progress .
Minutes after the press conference ended , a dive team was seen searching a pond just down the street from the school .
Gates continued to ask for the public 's help in finding Kyron , and he said the many rumors that have appeared online about the case -- including reports Thursday on Facebook and Twitter that Kyron had been found and an arrest had been made -- were hurting the investigation .
" Those are not true , " Gates said .
" He has not been found yet , and the community needs to keep looking for him . "
Gates also addressed the missing boy directly .
" Kyron , we are still looking for you , " he said .
Kyron 's family thanked the Multnomah County Sheriff 's Office , searchers , the media and the community as a whole for their support since Kyron 's disappearance .
" Father 's Day is Sunday .
For the first time in seven years , we will not have Kyron around to hug and talk to , " the family said .
" It hurts us deeply and our heart is broken .
" Please help bring Kyron home . "
The fliers and questionnaire are available online and a link is on
.
Gates said the questionnaires can be returned to
where a deputy will be available to collect them between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. Sunday .

Food prices rose 0.2 percent , mostly because of higher costs for meat , poultry , fish and eggs .
But without the volatile prices for food and energy , the core index for consumer prices remained flat , as they did in March .
Over the 12 - month period that ended in April , the core index rose 0.9 percent , which economists said was the lowest it has been since the 1960s .
Image Energy prices led the decline , falling by 1.4 percent in April , the Labor Department said .

Other costs that fell in that period included housing , down 0.7 percent , and apparel , down 0.9 percent , the largest decline of all the nonenergy components .
“ I think what you are seeing is a continuation of a very soft trend , ” said Michael Feroli , chief United States economist at JPMorgan Economics .
“ And there is no evidence that it is about to turn around any time soon . ”
Altogether , the figures suggested that the government would be under no pressure to raise benchmark interest rates to curb inflation .
Joshua Shapiro , the chief United States economist for MFR , said that core inflation pressures remained “ benign ” and would remain so throughout the middle of next year , giving the Federal Reserve leeway to keep rates where they are .
PATIENTS in a vegetative state are , by definition , unable to respond to stimulation with any form of overt behaviour .
Recently , however , a group of British and Belgian researchers have shown that some of them respond to simple commands by altering their brain activity while in an MRI scanner .
At the annual meeting of the Organisation for Human Brain Mapping in Barcelona on June 7th , the British half of the group described how it has taken an important step towards helping such patients communicate .
Over the past four years , teams led by Adrian Owen at the Medical Research Council 's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge , and Steven Laureys of the Coma Science Group at the University of Liège , have scanned 23 vegetative patients between them .
Four were able to respond to yes - no questions correctly and consistently by following instructions to imagine playing tennis when they wanted to give one response , or walking round the house when they wanted to give the other .
Those studies have led Dr Owen to conclude that a significant minority of vegetative patients may be more aware than they seem .
Since they are responsive , they are not even technically vegetative , though current diagnostic techniques — which require that they respond physically to instructions , for example by blinking — are not sensitive enough to detect that .
If they are responsive , they are capable of communicating .
So the problem is how to facilitate this , given that it is not practical to put them in a scanner every time someone wants to ask them a question .
Damian Cruse of the Cambridge group thinks he may have found a solution in electroencephalography ( EEG ) , a cheaper and more portable way of measuring brain activity via electrodes pasted to the patient 's scalp .
Dr Cruse and his colleagues first asked six healthy volunteers to imagine either squeezing their right hand or wiggling the toes of both feet when they were presented with an audible tone .
They found that their volunteers ' brains ' responses to the two commands were clearly different .
The imagined hand - squeezing produced a response on the left - hand side of the brain , while the toe - wiggling produced one over the centre of the head .
They then applied the same procedure to a patient with “ locked - in ” syndrome — conscious but almost entirely paralysed — who retains some control of his eye movements .
His brain responses were the same as those in the healthy controls .
Finally , they gave the instructions to a patient who had been diagnosed as being vegetative two years earlier .
They found that , from the EEG signals alone , they could deduce which movement this patient had been instructed to imagine with 100 % accuracy .
This result , though preliminary , suggests it might be possible to establish some sort of dialogue with people who had previously been considered all but brain - dead .
That would be extraordinary .
Given that solitary confinement is one of the harshest punishments known , and that such people are condemned to the worst sort of solitary imaginable , it would also be wonderful .

COLUMBUS , Ohio --
Police in Columbus are looking for a man they say robbed a bank near downtown , then handed two $ 100 bills to passers - by as he ran away .
FBI Special Agent Harry Trombitas says the man robbed a Huntington Bank branch early Monday afternoon after showing a teller a gun in his waistband .
Trombitas says the man was running up the street when he encountered a mother and daughter window - shopping .
The robber stopped and gave them each a $ 100 bill , assured them it was real , then kept running .
Trombitas says the mother and daughter from the Cleveland area were in town for a visit to Ohio State .
They took the money to the nearest bank which turned out to be the Huntington branch that was just robbed , and there told police what happened .
The Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will not go ahead with plans to kill all the ringworm - infected animals at its Newmarket shelter , says chairman Rob Godfrey .
“ We heard the outcry loud and clear and that is part of the reason why we are here today — to set the record straight and to inform the public , ” Godfrey told a news conference Thursday afternoon .
He said the organization had misstated the actual number of animals — originally reported as nearly 350 — that would need to be put down as a result of the ringworm outbreak at its York Region branch .
But the “ aggressive strain ” of ringworm was “ not without its casualties , ” Godfrey said , confirming that 99 animals had been killed since Tuesday morning .
He also said 15 animals had been stolen from the facility , likely by staff or volunteers who feared for the animals ’ safety .
The OSPCA ’s reversal came after widespread criticism of the decision , announced earlier this week , to euthanize nearly all the shelter ’s animals in an attempt to contain the ringworm outbreak , which also affected six staff members .
Ninety - six animals have been placed in foster homes , where they will undergo further testing and treatment .
Most were fostered before the outbreak , Godfrey said , but they will still be tested as a precaution .
If infected , they will be returned to the OSPCA ’s care .
There is “ reason for hope ” that the 140 animals remaining at the shelter can be treated and returned to good health , Godfrey said .
The 23 dogs , 91 cats and other domestic animals will be tested over the course of the next month at other shelters and animal agencies .
Animals will be looked at on a case - by - case basis to determine whether euthanasia is required .
The OSPCA ’s about - face came after heated protests outside its Newmarket shelter , where volunteers , donors and other protesters openly wept and shouted “ Murderers ! ” at the organization ’s staff .
“ Over time , public opinion took over , very clearly , ” said Newmarket - Aurora MPP Frank Klees , who expressed his opposition to the OSPCA ’s decision this week in the provincial legislature and called Godfrey directly to express his concerns on Wednesday night .
“ We answer to the protesters , we answer to members of the Legislature , and we answer to all taxpayers in Ontario , ” Godfrey told the news conference .
About 40 protesters continued to demonstrate Thursday outside the shelter , saying they wo n’t leave until they know why the euthanization decision was made in the first place .
Many called for a wholesale resignation of the OSPCA board and senior officials ; others said there should be an independent third - party investigation .
“ The trust has been broken and the relationship has been broken , ” said Elizabeth Staunton , who said she felt sick knowing while she protested outside the shelter on Wednesday , dozens of animals were being killed just metres away .
“ They continued with this when they knew how we felt . ”
Staunton said protesters — many of whom are volunteers at the shelter — want to know how the euthanization decision was made , who made it , how decisions were made on fostering the animals and why they were never consulted .
Staunton said the ordeal has left many volunteers feeling cut out by the organization .
“ We have questions that we need to have answered .
Then we can begin to rebuild the trust . ”
Godfrey emphasized that , by law , decisions to euthanize animals are made by veterinarians , not OSPCA executives .
“ We walk the line of that law and we continue to walk the line of that law to save as many animals as possible , ” he said .
“ If we did n’t , you ’ve got to find two other people to do these jobs . ”
Godfrey said some of the organization ’s veterinarians have received death threats .

He said he and chief executive officer Kate MacDonald will investigate the matter with the completed report made available to the public .
They will review animal care and communication protocols to identify “ what can be done to stop this so it never happens again . ”
Ringworm , named for the scaly ring - shaped lesions it leaves on skin , is caused by highly contagious and resilient fungi called dermatophytes .
Infected animals will start to get hairless , crusty patches on their skin , usually around the face , ears , feet and tail .
The itchy lesions may cause them to scratch until they bleed .
Treatment includes segregation , followed by six to eight weeks of oral medication , as well as a special shampoo or spray .
The disease is n’t fatal for the animals , but diagnosis , treatment , isolation and decontamination of facilities is costly .
Since breaking out several weeks ago , the disease has infected everything from guinea pigs to shelter staff and its walls .
On Monday , the OSPCA said it was heeding the advice of its veterinarians by ordering a blanket euthanization of all animals .
Godfrey said the first case of ringworm was discovered in February .
But according to shelter insiders , the outbreak began in early April , after staff found a cat , believed to be a long - haired Himalayan , with bald patches and scaly skin .
The animal was put into isolation , the former employee said , and staff tried to disinfect the building with a bleach solution and a fungicide .
Meanwhile , all animals were treated with a specialized dip .
Several animals with severe lesions were put down in a bid to curb the growing epidemic , but the infection continued to spread .
The OSPCA has blamed the outbreak on “ human error , ” saying certain protocols were not followed .
They fired shelter manager Denise Stephenson on April 30 .
Stephenson , who worked for the OSPCA for more than five years , says she is being used as a “ scapegoat ” and was dismissed “ with no real reason given to me . ”
Klees said he felt compelled to get involved because the initial plans of mass euthanasia appeared to be “ drastic . ”
On Tuesday , he asked Community Safety Minister Rick Bartolucci to delay the euthanizations so alternate solutions could be explored , but Bartolucci said the provincial government had no authority over the OSPCA .
Klees wants to change provincial legislation to give the government more authority over agencies like the OSPCA , “ to make sure there is proper oversight . ”
One of the OSPCA ’s biggest fundraisers , the “ Friends for Life ” walk - a- thon scheduled for Sunday , was cancelled earlier this week .
Protesters are planning to organize a funeral march for the euthanized animals instead .

Reality shows such as " Celebrity Rehab " and " Jersey Shore " are so worried about sexually transmitted diseases that they pass out medication " like M&Ms " to cast members , the New York Post reported Friday .
In a roundtable discussion of reality show execs published in The Hollywood Reporter , SallyAnn Salsano , creator of " Jersey Shore , " said STDs are a constant concern .
" I do a full medical ( for cast members ) , but I also do a lot of STD stuff , " she said .
" The network ( VH1 ) requires me to do stuff with my patients that has no relevance to anything , " said Dr. Drew Pinsky , the host of " Celebrity Rehab . "
" Like everyone on the set has to take ( herpes medication ) Valtrex . "
" We hand it out like M&Ms , " Salsano said .
" ' Hey kids , it 's time for Valtrex ! '
It 's like a herpes nest .
They 're all in there mixing it up . "
A couple of months ago , I wrote about how to buy a used car .
I went through all the steps except for negotiating because it ’s a topic deserving of its very own post .
A post which I ’ll tackle today .
Now to begin , here ’s my honest confession : I suck at negotiating .
And it becomes really apparent whenever I negotiate for big purchase items like cars .
When Kate and I had to buy a “ new ” car last year , I stunk it up .
It was n’t for a lack of trying .
I was actually excited about the chance to improve my negotiating chops .
I felt ready to walk into the dealership and make a deal .
But I punted .
When the dealer started putting out numbers , I hemmed and hawed .
Thankfully , Kate is a kickass negotiator .
I think it ’s her Italian heritage that makes her so good .
Maybe the Polish .
I do n’t know .
She ’s just good at it .
She saw that I was flubbing it up and took over the reins and got us a good deal .
As we drove away in our new car , I ’ll admit that my manly ego was bruised .
And I could tell Kate was disappointed that I had n’t been able to take the lead .
I thought , “ I ’m the man damnit !
I should know how to negotiate and not have to let my wife do it . ”
Perhaps that ’s not too mature .
I ’m definitely lucky to have a wife who knows how to haggle like an Arabian bazaar merchant .
But I ’d like to be able to hold my own in this arena as well .
So I used the experience to double down on my efforts to improve my bargaining skills .
In an effort to prepare myself for the next time we have to buy a car , I did some research , asked guys I know for their negotiating tips , and went along with a friend who was buying a car .
Here ’s what I learned along the way .
Knowledge Is Power
In the negotiation game , knowledge is truly power .
And in the car buying business , the car salesman usually has the most information .
Think about it .
When the average buyer walks into the dealer , he ’ll immediately divulge to the salesman which car he wants , how much he can pay per month , and which vehicle he ’s trading in .
Meanwhile , the salesman gives away no information that would help the buyer .
Information like how much the car really cost the dealership , how low they ’ll really sell it for , or what ’s the real value on the buyer ’s trade - in .
Who do you think ’s going to get the better deal in this scenario ?
The dealer , of course .
He ’s the one with all the information !
Thus , to minimize the amount you pay for a car , you need to do two things : 1 ) hold your cards close by not telling the dealer exactly what you ’re looking for or how much you ’re willing to pay and 2 ) find out as much information about the car you want to buy before you walk into the dealership .
Know How Dealers Make Their Money
When you ’re talking with a dealer , it ’s important to know that dealers make money three different ways with each customer .
They can make money on the front end of the purchase by selling the car for more than what they paid to buy it .
They can make money on the back end , selling you things like financing , extended warranties , and dealer add - ons like rustproofing .
If the dealer includes trade - in value , they can make money on the difference between what they pay for your car and what they get when they sell it .
Most buyers just focus on # 1 .
However , car dealers might actually make more money on numbers # 2 and # 3 .
Thus , when you start negotiating for a used car , take into account things like financing and the trade - in value of your current car when calculating the final price .
How to Negotiate for a Used Car
Buy cars that are at least two years old .
Why two years old ?
Well , they ’re new enough that they still look nice and probably do n’t have a lot of problems .
But more importantly , a new car ’s wholesale value drops between 45 and 55 percent of its original sticker price after two years .
What a bargain !
Read Consumer Reports annual auto issue .
Consumer Reports annual auto issue comes out every April and has a used car section that gives you info like lists of most reliable and least reliable used cars and frequency - of - repair records for recent model years .
This information can help you create a list of used cars you want to check out .
Get the big picture value .
Once you have a list of possible used cars , get an idea of how much they generally go for by checking the Kelley Blue Book ’s Guide to Used Cars and the National Automobile Dealer ’s Official Used Car Guide .
Do n’t just rely on the website versions of these value guides .
The websites wo n’t give you a car ’s wholesale price , just the retail value .
The wholesale price is what dealers use to determine how much they should pay for a car .
After paying the wholesale price , dealers jack the price up for retail .
You want to buy the used car for as close to the wholesale price as possible .
However , do n’t take these values too literally .
The values in the Blue Book or Official Used Car Guide do n’t reflect the specific situation in your specific market .
For example , your town might have a glut of Astro Minivans ( Why are you buying an Astro Minivan ? ) , so the price on those will be less than the blue book value .
So you ’ll need to …
Fine tune your estimate .
Find out what the going price is for the cars you want in your area .
Check out autotrader.com for prices in your area .
Check the dealerships to see if they have the car .
Look on autotrader.com , call around to the dealerships or check their websites to see if they have the used car you want and what they ’re asking for it .
If they have the car you ’re looking for , swing by the car lot and write down the car ’s Vehicle Identification Number .
You ’ll need it later .
CarFax .
Get one .
CarFax gives a comprehensive report of a vehicle ’s history .
The report will tell you how many owners the car has had or if it ’s had any accidents .
That sort of info can help get you a lower price ( or steer you away from the car altogether ) .
For example , if the car belonged to a rental fleet , it probably had a bunch of different drivers who had varying degrees of driving skills .
Some may have gunned the engine at stoplights and others might have kept their foot on the brake .
Bottom line , an old rental car has a lot more wear and tear than a similar car that had only one owner ( especially of the old lady variety ) .
Consequently , the old rental car should have a considerably lower price than the one owner car .
To get a CarFax report , just visit CarFax and enter the Vehicle Identification Number .
They cost $ 34.99 , so try having the dealer get it for you .
“ Show me the Carfax ” seems to work on tv .
Research financing rates before you walk into the dealer .
Ideally , you should pay in cash when buying a used car , but sometimes you just do n’t have ten grand lying around to blow in one fell swoop .
That ’s when auto financing will come in handy and car dealers would love to help you finance your new used car .
Remember that dealers make money on the back end by getting you signed up with dealership financing .
A bank actually funds the loan , but the dealer acts as a middleman who gets a commission for signing you up .
Consequently , the salesman will pressure you to finance with the dealer .
But here ’s the deal .
You do n’t have to finance your car with the dealer .
You can use any bank that you want .
To avoid the pressure of inking a car loan at the dealership , shop around for different auto loan rates .
Check your bank .
When the dealer starts pushing you to the little finance office , you can tell them you ’ve already been approved for a car loan and what the interest rate is on that loan .
Of course , the dealership still wants to get that commission from their bank , so they ’ll start negotiating auto loan rates with you .
You might even get a better deal going with the dealer .
Who knows !
Just have your financing ready before you step foot on the car lot .
You ’ll save yourself some money .
Take care of the trade - in .
If you ’re going to trade - in a car to buy your new used car , do some research on your current car .
You want to get as much money as you can on the trade - in .
Dealerships will low ball you on the price so they can turn around and sell it for a hefty profit .
Ask for the wholesale price or as near to wholesale price as you can .
Again , to find the wholesale price on your car , check out Kelly Blue Book or the Official Used Car Guide .
If you do n’t want to deal with the dealer , you can always sell the car yourself at retail price .
It ’s a bigger hassle , but you might get more money that way .
Time to start dealing .
Alright .
You know the wholesale / retail price and the going price for the car in your area .
You also have a few auto loans with competitive rates lined up .
It ’s time to do business .
Step into the dealership with a set “ walking price ” fixed in your head .
If the dealer refuses to meet this price , you know you ’re walking away .
If you ’re shopping as a couple , make sure you ’re both on the same page and get your “ routine ” down .
When one person gets up to walk , the other gets up too .
You do n’t want one person hard balling while the other jumps in with , We ’ll take it ! ”
Make an offer .
Most dealers build about 20 % gross margin into the used car ’s asking price .
That means they ask for 20 % more than what they paid for it .
So offer 15 % below the asking price .
Tell the salesman you know that there ’s about a 20 % gross margin in the price and that you want him to make a profit , but you ’re not going to let him take you to the cleaners .
Then zip your lip .
Just stare at the salesman and wait for him to speak .
Do n’t hem or haw like I did .
That just lets the salesman know you ’re not confident with your offer .
He ’ll probably say stuff like , “ But our asking price is lower than the retail price !
You ’re getting a great deal ! ”
Tell him , “ I do n’t care about the retail price .
I care about the wholesale price and what you paid for it .
The closer we can get to that wholesale price , the more likely I ’ll drive out of this lot with this car . ”
He may act insulted .
He may go to the back to confer with his manager .
Remember , he ’s going to make you feel like you ’re bleeding him dry and he ’s doing everything he can to bring the price down .
Do n’t let guilt or obligation get to you .
This is business .
You want to buy a car ; he wants to sell one .
If he does n’t like your offer , he wo n’t take it .
No harm done .
Point out things that might make the car hard to sell .
Dealers want to move the cars off the lot , the faster , the better .
Point out how unpopular a standard transmission is or that the car does n’t even have a CD player or how there ’s a big tear in the seat .
Say , “ That ’s going to make the car hard to sell , but I ’m willing to drive it off the lot right now for x price . ”
If he counters with a higher number , ask for 10 % below the asking price .
If he counters again , tell him you have an appointment to see the exact same car with another dealer and walk out the door .
Before you leave , give him your phone number and tell him to call you if he changes his mind .
He ’ll probably call .
A profit is a profit , no matter how slim it is .
Turn down dealer add - ons .
If you ’re buying a used car from a dealer , they ’re going to try to sell you a bunch of add - ons like rustproofing or detailing .
Just say no .
If you live in a place that requires a rustproofing , you can probably do it cheaper somewhere else .
Be ready to walk away .
In any negotiation , be ready to walk away .
Be flexible in your choice and do n’t get too attached to one car .
Remember , there are plenty more automotive fish in the sea .

Physicists and mathematicians all over the world are feverishly working in these years on one of the most ambitious theories that have ever been conceived : the theory of superstrings , or strings , as it is often called .
Einstein searched for more than thirty years without ever achieving a unified theory , which reconciled general relativity and quantum mechanics , the two cornerstones of twentieth - century physics .
String theory provides perhaps the solution to this profound and fascinating problem , describing all the forces of nature in a single conceptual framework of supreme elegance .
Everything that is wonderful in the universe is the result of the vibrations of individual units , ultramicroscopic strings hidden in the depth of matter .
The ' modes of vibration ' , the ' notes ' intoned by these strings , determine the intimate constitution of matter , such as violin strings that perform an ordered and harmonious cosmic symphony .
In this book , Brian Greene tells the story of an extraordinary adventure , talking about it as a protagonist and transmitting all the enthusiasm of scientific discovery .
The revolutionary vision of the universe that emerges from his story involves hidden and rolled up dimensions in the folds of space , black holes that are transformed into elementary particles , discontinuity in the weaving of spacetime and universes that generate other universes .
" The elegant universe " describes with intelligence and vivacity the exhilarating discoveries and the still unsolved mysteries of the universe .
Through the wise use of analogies and fascinating metaphors , Greene manages to make immediately accessible some of the most complex and sophisticated concepts of contemporary physics .

Today , Mediabistro published some funny off - the - record comments from Washington Post liberal opinion columnist Dave Weigel .
He said that Matt Drudge should " set himself on fire " !
Ha ha .
Should he , though ?
Apparently , there 's this exclusive off - the - record message board called Journolist , where fancy journalists gather round their laptops and bitch about the people they cover .
( Please send us things from this message board !!)
One day , Washington Post columnist was pissed off at Matt Drudge for a misleading headline on his Drudge Report .
Weigel wrote the following screed :
This would be a vastly better world to live in if Matt Drudge decided to handle his emotional problems more responsibly , and set himself on fire .
Shortly after Mediabistro 's post went up , an embarassed Weigel posted this apology on his blog :
I apologize to Matt Drudge for this —
I was incredibly frustrated with the amount of hate mail I was getting and lashed out .
If he wants to link to this post with some headline accusing me of wishing death on him , I suppose he can do so .
But I do n't wish that .
I was tired , angry , and hyperbolic , and I 'm sorry .
Hold on , Dave Weigel !
Who said anything about wishing death on Matt Drudge .
You clearly wrote " set himself on fire " — a phrase which encompasses any number of acts of self - immolation .
And many of these would not only leave Matt Drudge very much alive — they would n't even hurt .
Maybe ... just maybe Dave Weigel still secretly wishes that Drudge would light himself up ?
It was in a review of former Gawker editor Emily Gould 's memoir that Ana Marie Cox wrote , " words matter and ... they hurt . "
In the most extreme cases , mean words on the Internet can literally cause people to kill themselves .
Other times , they might simply increase the net suffering in the world by supporting terrible ideas and distorting the truth , like by saying that simulated drowning does not constitute torture , technically .
Even in this milder case , people are being materially — if not physically — hurt by , for example , the blatant race - baiting and climate change denying that is Matt Drudge 's stock and trade .
Dave Weigel may not wish death upon Matt Drudge ; nor do we .
Hell , we do n't even wish any pain on the guy .
But we can forgive Weigel for ( maybe still ! ) desiring that Matt Drudge set an insignificant part of himself aflame — more as a symbolic gesture than anything — and thus inconvenience himself .
For example , he could set the sleeve of his t- shirt on fire and quickly put it out before he even felt the heat on his skin .
Hopefully , this would distract him for exactly the amount of time it would take to come up with one of his dumb headlines .
Or he could singe a single strand of his hair while it was still attached to his head .
( if we consider a long cluster of nerve - dead keratin cells part of Drudge 's " self . " )
This would stink up his house really bad , and make it a tiny bit harder to obscure the scientific consensus on global warming .
All we 're saying is , let 's not get too brash about this " not setting himself on fire " thing , Dave Weigel !
It does n't even have to hurt .
National Review ’s Robert VerBruggen has spent some time perusing the documentation that the Clinton presidential library has been willing to release on Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan .
While President Barack Obama casts Kagan as a moderate and an independent thinker , a couple of documents show Kagan as so hostile to the NRA and its advocacy for gun rights that she compared them at least once and perhaps twice to the KKK :
National Review has learned that in 1996 , Kagan apparently tied the NRA to the KKK — yes , the KKK — while debating the Clinton administration ’s position on a bill .
The bill in question was the Volunteer Protection Act , which , when it was passed and signed the following year , protected some non-profits ’ volunteer workers from tort liability in certain cases .
The administration worried that it would apply to volunteers from unlikable non-profits .
Two documents discovered at the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and obtained byNational Review suggest that Kagan was involved in these discussions .
One does not contain her name , but the handwriting appears to be hers .
( You can see an example of Kagan ’s handwriting here . )
It has the name of administration colleague Fran Allegra at the top , and lists two “ Bad guy orgs ” that might be covered — the NRA and the KKK .
The second does have Kagan ’s name on it ; it is a memo from Allegra to Kagan .
Allegra reports that he checked the IRS ’s “ Cumulative List of Organizations Described in Section 170 ( c ) ” — the list of tax - exempt organizations , which , he says , are the only organizations the bill would cover — and that neither the NRA nor the KKK was on it .
“ If you have other names you want me to run down in the Cumulative List , I would be glad to check them out , ” he adds , suggesting that Kagan requested the initial check of the NRA and the KKK .
This comes out at an interesting point in time .
Nancy Pelosi reached an accommodation with the NRA on the DISCLOSE Act , one that ended up torpedoing its chance at passage , at least for the moment .
Kagan ’s comparison suggests that Pelosi ’s deal would have been tantamount to dealing with “ bad guys ” like the KKK , a domestic terror organization aimed at ethnic and religious minorities , primarily African - Americans .
If this is what passes for mainstream thought in the Obama administration ( and for that matter in the Clinton administration ) , then … well , I ca n’t say I ’m terribly shocked .
When candidates like Obama run on class - warrior platforms , it should n’t surprise anyone to find that impulse to demonize people is n’t just bounded by income or wealth levels .
Putting the NRA , a peaceful and law - abiding organization that defends the political and legal interests of gun owners in exercising a Constitutional right , in the same league as the Klan shows a judgment that is not mainstream or properly tempered , but extremist and hyperbolic .
That ’s not the kind of thinking that we need on the Supreme Court , and not the kind of nominee Obama represented Kagan to be .
Her confirmation may be all but assured at this point , but hopefully the Judiciary Committee will press Kagan hard on this issue .
Clearly , the efforts to close the Clinton library to the committee are intended to hide evidence like this , and the committee should balk at taking a vote until all of the documentation from the Clinton administration has been released and reviewed in detail .
Understanding Water Conflict in Central Asia , and Solutions
( Edit 6/16/10 : Substituted some images from the paper for those previously used )
It is tricky to talk about research that is still underway , when you ca n’t yet discuss concrete results , but I want to share a particularly fascinating project happening at the Columbia Water Center .
A CWC research team is analyzing a complicated issue in a highly conflicted part of the world , and trying to find a way forward .
They are taking an in - depth look at Central Asia ( Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , and Kazakhstan ) , and the environmental , political and economic crisis building there .
A small nutshell description of a vastly complex situation :
The five states are connected by two major rivers , the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya , which are fundamental to their survival .
While under Soviet control , a system of infrastructure and commerce was set up to manage the region ’s water resources .
The upstream states ( Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan ) had dams and hydroelectric energy generation facilities , and were able to both produce electricity part of the year , and provide water to the downstream states ( Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan ) for irrigation during drier periods .
For their part , the downstream states provided the upstream states with coal and natural gas to supplement their energy needs .
This worked well enough as long as the Soviet State was enforcing the transactions .
With the break - up of the Soviet Union , the newly independent republics had to either learn to work together on their own to manage and improve the system – or not .
In actuality , each has tended to retreat into isolation , controlling their respective resources , water or energy , to their own immediate benefit without consideration for the needs of the other states .
The upstream countries have the advantage of dams and reservoirs which can capture the water , and have no obligation to release enough for downstream farmers to irrigate their crops .
The downstream countries have fossil fuels for energy production , which they are under no obligation to share .
Religious and political differences make cooperation increasingly difficult , to understate the issue .
Toktogul Reservoir , Kyrgyzstan :
To complicate things further , climate change is expected to affect the region sharply .
In very general terms , over the next 50 years or so , Central Asia might see an increase in runoff from the mountains as warming temperatures melt glaciers .
After that , towards the end of the 21st Century , there is likely to be a pronounced decline in runoff as most of the land - ice will have vanished – less water for every need .
So there will at first be flooding that must be managed , followed by a scarcity of water for irrigation , while at the same time warming temperatures will cause faster evaporation in the fields .
Irrigation Canal , Tajikistan :
The CWC project pulls together several of the different factors through a ‘ system - based computational model approach ’ to make a case for long - term management of the water resources .
On one hand , they are predicting the environmental changes ( precipitation , temperature , runoff , etc ) given the uncertainty of future climate conditions .
On the other hand , the project also explores the economic , social and political implications of diminished water resources in the region .
The analysis is intended to provide information and options for decision makers .
Figure : Glacier melt and runoff before 2049 .
These preliminary findings from the study show the glaciers that are expected to melt ( red ) , the movement of the runoff ( arrows ) and the increase in volume of runoff in cubic meters per second ( blue shading ) .
The model assumes an increase in atmospheric CO2 emissions from 10 gigatons of carbon per year to 30 gigatons of carbon per year :
Funded in part by the Earth Institute ’s CORC - ARCHES program at the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory and carried out in collaboration with ETH Zurich , the study stresses the importance of cooperation between the republics to prepare for the long - term needs , and avoid isolated short - term crisis management that will make things worse .
The answer , they say , lies in an interdisciplinary understanding of the problems , and a collaborative approach to solutions .
The research team , led by Tobias Siegfried , CWC Associate Research Scientist , is preparing two papers .
One will be an academic journal article exploring the physical data and climate models that help predict future environmental conditions .
The second paper will synthesize the information into a discussion of the policy issues and implications , for a professional audience .
CWC will continue to report on this important issue , and on the research as it is completed and published .

Policy , however , if properly informed , can mitigate much of the impact .
But such policies can only come through rigorous , context - specific mapping of the relationships between a changing climate and an attendant conflict . ”

A centuries - old drug used to treat excruciating gout pain had cost just pennies a tablet — until last year .
Now , the retail price has skyrocketed to more than $ 5 and some of the manufacturers have ceased production amid a battle over marketing rights .
The tale of how this common gout drug , colchicine , became the costlier branded drug Colcrys offers a window into the Byzantine world of drug pricing .
The price rise is a consequence of a Food and Drug Administration effort to improve the safety of long - used but unapproved drugs , with a trade - off often made between drug affordability and safety .
In July 2009 , a Philadelphia drug maker received FDA approval to exclusively market colchicine for gout attacks for three years .
The company , URL Pharma Inc. , was taking advantage of a push to bring medicines predating the FDA , like colchicine , under the agency 's regulatory umbrella .
The FDA offers exclusive marketing rights if a drug maker conducts clinical trials .
URL Pharma had commissioned studies that confirmed its colchicine product 's safety and efficacy , while demonstrating it should be taken at a lower dose than typical and not used with certain other medicines .
The company is marketing its drug as Colcrys — and the retail cost averages $ 5 per pill , according to DestinationRx , a health - care data provider .
URL is also suing longtime manufacturers of unapproved colchicine , saying the companies are now illegally marketing their products .
Some of the companies are fighting the lawsuits .
Some themselves have raised prices — including one increase of just under a dollar per tablet to $ 1.17 , according to DestinationRx .
The higher price for Colcrys was first reported by Kaiser Health News .

Question :
If you were a real terrorist group who wanted to appear fearsome and mighty , would you really release a statement claiming responsibility for an “ attack ” that amounted to little more than a car full of fireworks that killed nobody , injured nobody , and was an abject failure ?
This claim of responsibility holds about as much credibility as if Barney the Purple Dinosaur had made a video saying he did it .

MYFOXNY .COM – Fox 5 reports that the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the bomb plot .
According to Fox News , in a 1 minute video allegedly released by the Pakistani Taliban , the group says the attack is revenge for the death of its leader Baitullah Mehsud and the recent killings of the top leaders of al - Qaida in Iraq .

According to the AP , an unidentified speaker on the tape also says the attack comes in response to American “ interference and terrorism in Muslim Countries , especially in Pakistan . ”
The claim could not be immediately confirmed andhe tape makes no specific reference to the attack nor does it mention that it was a car bomb or that it took place in New York City .
A text in gold letters on a black background at the start of the video congratulates Muslims for the “ jaw - breaking blow to Satan ’s USA . ”

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea ’s ruling communist party has called a rare meeting to elect a new leadership team , in a move analysts said could set in motion succession plans for ailing leader Kim Jong - il ’s youngest son .

For the first time in three decades , the dynastic state ’s political elite have been summoned to a Workers ’ Party of Korea ( WPK ) convention in September , amid a series of military and political changes over the past few weeks .
“ The Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee decides to convene early in September ... a conference of the WPK for electing its highest leading body reflecting the new requirements of the WPK , ” the North ’s official KCNA news agency reported on Saturday .
Kim , 68 , suffered a stroke in 2008 , and is widely believed to be readying his youngest son Jong - un to take over as leader .
“ There is a great possibility Kim Jong - un will be assigned to a high ranked position in the Political Bureau during the convention of the Workers ’ Party , ” said Koh Yu-hwan of Dongguk University in Seoul , an expert on the North ’s leadership .
“ Also the Workers ’ Party is likely to go through massive reshuffling of personnel and changes in the organization as it readies itself for succession . ”
The WPK is the ruling body of the reclusive state and Kim serves as its general secretary .
He is also chairman of the increasingly powerful National Defense Commission .
Analysts said the role of the Workers ’ Party has diminished over the past decades as the North has increasingly focused on its military power , but the party still dictates political ideology .
Kim himself began his official role to succeed his father and state founder by taking on a Workers ’
Party title at a convention in 1980 when he was 38 .
Becoming a standing member of the Political Bureau that year was widely believed to be the first step in establishing himself as an heir to Kim Il - sung , who died suddenly in the summer of 1994 .
The apparent moves to smooth the way for Jong - un ’s succession comes amid growing criticism of the North over the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in March that killed 46 sailors and drove security tensions on the Korean peninsula to new heights .
Pyongyang denies sinking the ship , but the United States and South Korea insist the North is to blame and should be punished .
GROOMING A NEW LEADER
Kim has in recent weeks reshuffled the Defense Commission to put close aides sympathetic to dynastic succession on the panel .
His brother - in - law , Jang Song - thaek , who is seen as a potential caretaker in the event of Kim ’s early demise , was named to the powerful vice chairmanship .
Jong -un , in his 20s , has little experience and some analysts are skeptical he will pushed into a senior position at the convention .
“ The focus of the Workers ’ Party convention will be on reshuffling party staff and changing the structure to perform its functions effectively as it has stopped functioning over the last years , ” said the head of the influential Korea Institute for National Unification , Suh Jae-jean .
“ I do n’t expect any major steps to be taken for Kim Jong - un succession during the convention as it is seen too early and it will take two or more years before he appears in the front line of the ruling bureau . ”
But South Korea ’s spy chief has been quoted as telling a closed - door session of a parliamentary committee this week that there are moves afoot to boost Jong - un ’s image .
When two suspects rushed into the Wilson subway station brandishing handguns , they pointed their weapons at a lone TTC fare collector , ordering him to open the door to the booth .
But when the man panicked and could n’t open the door fast enough , one bandit swung a sledge hammer at the window , shattering the glass shield .
The two men then barged inside , one putting a gun to the collector ’s head while the other looted the booth .
The violent March 20 attack , shortly after midnight , was followed by another similar incident on April 23 , the fifth in a string of armed robberies that left TTC fare collectors “ shaken ” and “ traumatized ” as their stations were ransacked , said Toronto police Det. Michael Palermo .
Now two Toronto men are facing a combined 24 charges in connection with robberies at four subway stations , including two at Wilson station .
The Yorkdale , Lawrence and Leslie stations were also robbed in the spree , which began in February 2009 and continued through this month .
The bandits targeted fare collectors who were working alone late at night , police say .
Thousands of dollars in cash , tokens and TTC fare passes were taken in each robbery .
“ It would have been terrifying .
Just the mere fact that they had guns pointed at them , at their heads , and not knowing if the guns were real or not can be traumatizing , ” Palermo said .
In each incident , the employees “ feared for their lives ” when they were on the ground with handguns pointed at their heads by robbers wearing bandanas and hooded sweatshirts .
A replica handgun was found near the scene of the second robbery , and although no gun has been recovered , investigators believe the weapons used were authentic .
“ There is only one reaction we have and that is of tremendous concern for our employees and their safety .
Armed robbers in a public place , like the TTC , are a great worry to the police , us , and the public , ” said TTC spokesman Brad Ross .
Ross said officials implemented safety changes including the installation of a new video surveillance system in all collector booths , adding a shatterproof film to the glass shield , and limiting the amount of cash each collector has on hand .
Guled Ismail , 19 , and a 19 - year - old man who cannot be named because he was 17 years old at the time of the first crime , face charges including robbery , disguise and use of an imitation firearm .
The pair appeared in court Thursday morning .
This was the first link that popped up when I was trying to figure out that annoying pac-man noise that would n't go away .
We 're not the only ones .
I was watching a movie online and thought I got a virus , so I exited out of everything .
Annoying to say the least .
It 's unfortunate though .
Google tried using a fun idea and it backfired , losing them business .
I 'll still use Google .
KANSAS CITY , MO — Account executive Jeremy Trask , 33 , entered a local Best Buy Sunday , shopped for approximately 20 minutes , and bought a brand - new laptop computer right off the shelf , " like it was a bag of pretzels , " Trask 's friend Paul Cheng said Monday .
Trask and the computer Cheng ( inset ) witnessed him just up and buy .

" I did n't even know Jeremy was in the market for a computer , " Cheng said , still reeling from Sunday 's events .
" We were on the west side of town , and he asked if I wanted to stop in at the Best Buy .
I thought maybe we'd buy some CDs or look at the plasma - screen televisions , but , next thing I know , he 's dropping $ 1,200 on a laptop . "
The Toshiba Satellite Notebook laptop computer came equipped with an Intel Celeron Processor , a DVD - ROM / CD - RW combo drive , and a 15 - inch active - matrix display .
The 40GB hard drive came pre-installed with the Windows XP Home Edition operating system , Microsoft Works , and Quicken — none of which seemed to interest Trask in the slightest .

" Jeremy just looked at it , typed some ' quick brown fox ' crap on the keyboard , said the computer was nice and light , and asked a sales associate if they had one in stock , " Cheng said .
" He barely looked at the desktop computers .
He did n't ask how it compared to a Mac .
He did n't even ask about the warranty or any upcoming sales .
He just grabbed the box and headed up to the check - out area . "
According to Cheng , Trask " just assumed he knew what he wanted . "
" Before you buy a computer , you 're supposed to get some magazines , ask the office IT guy what he recommends , and find out how your friends like their computers , " Cheng said .
" People spend days just identifying their needs , let alone selecting a computer that meets those needs .
I mean , it 's a computer !
How do you know what you 're getting if you just snap one up ? "

Cheng said that , once he realized what was happening , he followed Trask to the counter and demanded to know if his friend had done any research on the Internet or visited the store on previous occasions .
" He had n't , " Cheng said .
" He just waltzed in there and bought the damn thing .
I asked him what he would be using it for , and he said ' work stuff and Internet stuff . '
He said he wanted a computer with a DVD player , so he could take it with him when he stayed at his girlfriend 's place .
And — oh , this was the classic line !
This killed me !
He said he wanted one that had an ' MP3 maker . ' "
Advertisement
" I am not kidding , " Cheng added .
" Those were his exact words . "
Cheng said he suspected that Trask simply looked for models that contained a DVD player , then chose one with a big screen .
Advertisement
" Can you believe that ? "
Cheng asked .
" I told him that if he 'd spend a couple days searching online , he could find that same computer for $ 50 or even $ 100 less , but he was like , ' I just want to get it and be done with it . ' "
Although he made repeated attempts inside Best Buy , during the walk to the car , and during the ride home , Cheng was unable to make Trask see the importance of his purchase .
Advertisement
" I told him , ' Hey , man , you just bought a damn computer , ' " Cheng said .
" He just looked at me like , ' Yeah , I know . '
I love the guy , but , I have to say , he did n't really seem to understand what it was that he 'd done . "
Cheng was further vexed to learn that , 24 hours after the laptop was purchased , Trask had yet to take it out of its box .
Advertisement
" I called Jeremy to see how the computer was working out , and he said he had n't had the energy to deal with it yet , " Cheng said .
" I said , ' Aha !
Having second thoughts , are you ? '
He said he was fine with it , but he just had n't gotten around to unpacking it .
I mean , Jesus . "
" So I asked him if he wanted me to come over and help him get his modem hooked up , " Cheng said .
" He said he did n't need it .
He said he got a flyer in the mail today and he signed up for a year of ' DSL or cable Internet or something . '
God ! "
On April 20th , an explosion occurred on the Deepwater Horizon 's oil drilling platform killing eleven workers .
The oil platform burned for more than a day before sinking on April 22nd , releasing 5 to 25 thousand barrels of oil daily into surrounding waters .
At the time of the explosion , the rig was on BP 's Mississippi Canyon Block 252 , referred to as the Macondo Prospect , about 41 miles off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico .
Transocean Ltd. owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon platform under contract to BP Exploration and Production Inc .
A production casing was being run and cemented at the time of the accident .
Halliburton has confirmed that it cemented the Macondo well but never set a cement plug to cap the bore as " operations had not reached a stage where a final plug was needed " .
Halliburton said that it had finished cementing 20 hours before the fire .
The rig 's blowout preventer , a " fail - safe " device fitted at the source of the well 5,000 feet below sea level , did not automatically cut - off the oil flow as intended when the explosion occurred .
In the first two weeks after the rig sank , BP sent six remotely operated underwater vehicles to close the blowout preventer valves , but all attempts failed .
On May 7th , BP tried to drop a 125 - ton dome over the largest of the well leaks to pipe it to a storage vessel on the surface , but this failed due to buildup of frozen methane hydrate crystal .
The well was still leaking as of May 13th and many are saying the spill could be the worst environmental disaster in US history .
On Wednesday , May 12th , Seize BP held a protest in front of the BP offices on New Montgomery Street in San Francisco to demand that the U.S. government seize BP and all its assets .
On Friday , May 14th at 5 pm , Act Against Oil held a demonstration in Berkeley at the site of a new BP building under construction next to the UCB campus .

Disastrous news for England fans ahead of the crunch last - 16 match with Germany Sunday : an octopus in Germany with a perfect track record of predicting World Cup matches has plumped for a German win .
Two plastic boxes containing tasty morsels , one with a German flag and one with an England flag , were lowered into the tank that houses
Paul the octopus at his home in Sea Life in Oberhausen , western Germany .
A two year - old octopus " Paul " , the so - called " octopus oracle " predicts Germany 's victory in their World Cup last 16 clash against England .
Credit : Reuters
Paul immediately climbed into the German box to a huge roar of approval from the crowd .
Earlier in the tournament , the mollusc medium correctly predicted Germany would beat Ghana and Australia in their group D matches and was also right to predict they would lose to Serbia .
I recently decided to upgrade my Ubuntu to Lucid Lynx .
Previous release worked just fine , so I was very optimistic about the move .
When it booted , I noticed that the fan on my graphics card ( ATI Radeon HD 4850 ) became pretty loud .
And louder every minute .
After 30 minutes of cursing and googling , I found out that there is an issue in open source drivers .
Basically , the GPU is overheating , some even suggested it may get damaged .
Solution 1 : If the kernel had KMS ( whatever that is ) , it could work .
It will be a part of 2.6.34 kernel , just a minute .
Oops , the current kernel in Lucid is 2.6.32 .
But if you add this boot switch , you will disable some features and it may resolve your problem .
The whole idea and explanation is flawed in so many places that I dumped it .
Solution 2 : Install drivers from ATI .
Get them from their website , start the installer and enjoy .
Finally the fan became silent , but also X became very slow with no hardware acceleration .
Scan of logs revealed that there is a conflict or unresolved dependency between proprietary and open source drivers .
At this point I became pretty desperate .
I wanted to use this system and my time to do something productive , not waste hours on fighting driver issues .
That said , I did follow some aggressive solutions .
Here ’s what finally worked :
Reinstall xserver - xorg - core – added or fixed the DRI module that the proprietary driver was missing .
– added or fixed the DRI module that the proprietary driver was missing .
That created a conflict that broke down aptitude .
Due to an a dependency issue it was impossible to perform an upgrade or use aptitude or dpkg in any other way .
I decided to ignore it for the moment .
After reboot my graphics driver was unusable again .
Apparently I broke something down trying to fix apt .
I uninstalled ATI driver using their shell script ( apt was still broken ) .
( apt was still broken ) .
I created a .deb package for Ubuntu / lucid .
Installing it , I told it to replace all Ubuntu fglrx packages .
That seemed to resolve the conflict apt was complaining about .
It seems executable installer did not do it .
for Ubuntu / lucid .
Installing it , I told it to .
That seemed to resolve the conflict apt was complaining about .
It seems executable installer did not do it .
Graphics driver was still broken and aticonfig was not installed .
So I ran the same installer from ATI again ( this time directly from the downloaded executable , NOT .deb ) .
It installed aticonfig etc .
Now it seems to work .
I did not give up only because I ’m a Linux enthusiast unable to work in Windoze .
But I am hugely disappointed because not being a complete newbie I wasted hours on this issue .
Open source driver is unusable , one dependency was fixed by reinstalling xserver , another by installing proprietary driver twice ( once to override open - source packages , then to install what was missing from debs ) …
Man , it ’s a mess .
Stop cheating yourself .
There ’s no way Linux is going to make it into broad consumer market when even power users are having so many issues .
Give up on the shiny fancy features and fix the fundamental flaws first .
You would n’t buy a car with the best sound system if the engine was broken , would you ?
Horrible accident captured on camera when a pickup driver carrying a load of people losing control of his vehicle and crashing on a road in Honduras ( Central America ) .
UPDATE : According to a news report a 15 year old girl died due to serious head and internal injuries , at least 11 people were wounded in this accident .
All victims were members of the same family and were brought to the hospital .
The pickup driver was speeding and lost control because of " a fault in the highway " .
1. Draft Text of ACTA Made Public
Since late 2007 , the United States and a number of other countries , including Australia , Canada , the European Union , Japan , Mexico , and South Korea , have been negotiating an “ Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ” ( ACTA ) .
A variety of speculation , rumors , and leaks regarding what ACTA might contain have prompted concern in the blogosphere and the tech industry .
Until recently , however , the only official documents that had been publicly released were high - level outlines and statements offering little guidance on ACTA ’s specific provisions and language .
In April , the negotiating countries ushered in a new and more transparent phase in the ACTA debate by making the current draft text public .
The draft is still very much a work - in - progress ; many of its provisions feature multiple proposed options or bracketed language reflecting a lack of current consensus .
Nonetheless , the release of the draft text allows interested parties to stop lobbying for transparency , as CDT and many others have been doing since 2008 , and instead turn their attention to the agreement ’s substance .
It also allows the discussion to get specific ; interested parties can analyze and comment on the details of concrete proposals .
( To its credit , USTR had at one point allowed CDT and a number of advocates to review and comment on a portion of draft text , but only subject to a non-disclosure agreement that prevented public debate . )
ACTA ’s stated goal is to establish a new set of high standards for enforcement efforts to combat “ counterfeiting and piracy . ”
The idea is that a core group of countries would agree to meet certain benchmarks for strong intellectual property enforcement , and then likely press other countries to meet those benchmarks as well .
CDT has focused principally on ACTA ’s impact for copyright policy .
CDT supports vigorous enforcement of existing copyright laws , particularly with respect to “ bad actors ” who flout the law and commit infringement on large scale .
But we have been concerned that ACTA could include provisions that affect a much broader range of parties .
For consumers , overly aggressive copyright policies can raise privacy , free expression , and due process issues .
For online innovators and businesses , there can be serious issues of liability exposure and barriers to innovation .
The draft text makes it possible to have a more concrete discussion about these risks .
CDT ’s specific concerns , based on the language and options currently on the table , are set forth in the following sections .
The biggest problem is that ACTA could skew foreign legal regimes by selectively promoting a stringent , one - sided model of U.S. copyright law .
In addition , several provisions could encourage problematic interpretations of or changes to U.S. copyright law .

2. ACTA ’s Selective Export of U.S. Copyright Law May Foster Highly Skewed Legal Regimes in Other Countries
Many ACTA copyright provisions appear to be modeled on U.S. law , particularly the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
But to the extent that the agreement aims to export U.S. law , it does so in a highly selective fashion .
The draft text repeatedly mandates those elements of U.S. law creating strong enforcement tools , while making entirely optional and discretionary those elements of U.S. law establishing limits on copyright .
In short , the draft unmoors the law ’s tough , expansive copyright provisions from its safeguards and limitations .
It therefore invites foreign countries to adopt copyright legal regimes that would be far harsher and far less balanced than that of the United States .
Nowhere is this more true than in the area of third party liability ( also known as secondary liability ) – the doctrine under which device or service providers can be held liable for infringements committed by their users .
Article 2.18.3 of the proposed text requires each signatory to ensure that its legal system includes third party liability .
Footnote 47 describes the circumstances in which third party liability should apply .
But limitations , exceptions , and defenses to third party liability , while expressly permitted , are left entirely to the discretion of each country .
There is not even a mention of the core principle , established by the Supreme Court in the 1984 Sony case and reaffirmed unanimously in the 2005 Grokster decision , that the act of making or distributing a product with “ substantial noninfringing uses ” cannot be a basis for liability .
Fair use , another crucial factor in U.S. third party liability cases , is referenced in ACTA footnote 47 , but is entirely optional .
Indeed , footnote 47 includes language designed to ensure that countries may not adopt overbroad exceptions and limitations to third party liability – but ACTA takes no similar care to ensure that countries will not adopt an overbroad approach to third party liability itself .
These are not minor omissions .
The Supreme Court in Grokster explained clearly that overbroad application of third party liability risks “ trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the development of technologies . ”
It described the third party liability debate as an effort to develop a “ point of balance between protection and commerce . ”
And it explained that “ [t ] he more artistic protection is favored , the more technological innovation may be discouraged ; the administration of copyright law is an exercise in managing the trade - off . ”
It is remarkable that ACTA , which as a trade agreement would be expected to carefully reflect the needs of commerce , shows little sensitivity to the potential commercial impact of the third party liability regimes it requires .
It demands third party liability and demands that it not be too weak , but takes a pass on all the Supreme Court law aimed at preventing it from being too strong .
Article 2.X.2 reinforces the concern that ACTA may expose third parties such as Internet service providers to legal risks far greater than they face under U.S. law .
The article says that rights holders may “ apply for an injunction against [ infringing ] intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right . ”
Under U.S. law , the availability of injunctions against intermediaries is limited by the Sony safe harbor , discussed above , for products and services with “ substantial noninfringing uses . ”
In addition , an intermediary qualifying for the DMCA section 512 safe harbor would be entitled to the protections of section 512 ( j ) , which directs a court to consider the burden an injunction would impose on the intermediary .
The ACTA proposal on injunctions makes no reference to such limits .
It thus could prompt other countries to embrace intermediary injunctions in a fashion far more burdensome and sweeping than in the United States .
ACTA ’s asymmetrical version of U.S. law is evident in other provisions as well .
The “ Option 1 ” text of Article 2.18.3 is presumably modeled on the DMCA ’s section 512 safe harbor .
But it fails to require countries to adopt anything close to a true safe harbor .
Instead of providing a complete shield against monetary damages , as U.S. law does , ACTA merely says that countries must provide unspecified “ limitations on the scope of civil remedies . ”
Such “ limitations ” could fall well short of holding intermediaries harmless .
Meanwhile , subsection ( b ) ( i ) of Option 1 could easily be interpreted as endorsing policies that place far more onus on Internet service providers than does the DMCA .
The subsection calls for measures “ to address the unauthorized storage or transmission of materials protected by copyright . ”
As a preliminary matter , “ unauthorized ” is broader than “ infringing , ” since some activity – such as fair use – can be unauthorized but not infringing .
In addition , countries implementing this section could well conclude that a policy of terminating the accounts of proven repeat infringers – the safe harbor prerequisite contained in the DMCA – does not sufficiently “ address ” the problem of unauthorized transmissions .
Countries might therefore adopt more aggressive prerequisites for whatever safe harbor protection they choose to offer .
Bracketed language suggests that affirmative monitoring requirements might be off limits , but anything else would be fair game .
The “ Option 2 ” text of Article 2.18.3 likewise fails to guarantee a real safe harbor .
In addition , it fails to include any protection for information location tools , in contrast to section 512 ( d ) of the DMCA .
Article 2.18.4 is based on section 1201 of the DMCA , requiring countries to prohibit both the circumvention of technical protection measures and the distribution of circumvention devices .
But once again , ACTA reflects U.S. law in a selective and asymmetrical way .
DMCA section 1201 includes seven important exceptions to the anticircumvention prohibition , including for interoperability , encryption research , and security testing .
ACTA , in the two options listed under Article 2.18.5 , merely says that countries “ may ” include exceptions .
The prohibition is mandatory , but the crucial balancing exceptions are merely permissive .
Finally , Article 2.14.1 calls for criminal penalties for infringement “ on a commercial scale . ”
It then goes on to describe “ commercial scale ” infringement as including any infringement that is willful and “ significant . ”
The meaning of “ significant ” would be up to individual countries , but this formulation seems to invite them to set a very low bar for treating infringement as a criminal rather than a civil violation .
In each of these areas , the United States likely would not need to change its domestic law to comply with ACTA .
But there would be a major risk that foreign countries implementing the agreement would create regimes that are far more skewed and one - sided than U.S. law .
The recent criminal conviction of Google executives in Italy based on an illegal video posted by a user – even though the company took down the video when notified about it – shows that some countries display an appalling lack of sensitivity to the costs of broad third party liability .
The end result of ACTA , therefore , could be foreign legal regimes that cater strongly to rights holders at the cost of discouraging a wide range of legitimate commerce and technology innovation – including the international business activities of U.S. information technology companies .
That would be a strange result for a trade agreement being pushed by the United States .

3. A Number of Proposed Provisions Could Encourage or Require Changes to U.S. Domestic Copyright Law
U.S. officials have indicated that they intend to “ color within the lines ” of U.S. domestic law , such that ACTA will not require changes to the U.S. legal regime .
But several proposals currently on the table could have an impact on the U.S. legal framework or could encourage future changes to it .
Footnote 47 to Article 2.18.3 attempts to briefly summarize third party liability doctrine as it has emerged from caselaw in the United States .
In doing so , however , it appears to take sides on an important unsettled legal question .
The Grokster case was ambiguous about whether “ inducement ” of copyright infringement represents a new , independent theory of third party liability , or simply a revised test for applying contributory liability .
There is a strong argument that it is just a restatement of the contributory liability test :
The Court said that “ one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement . ”
The doctrinal question is not merely semantic ; it has significant implications for the mental state ( intent versus knowledge ) required for contributory liability .
But ACTA appears to take the position that that inducement liability and contributory liability are two separate , alternative bases for third party liability .
By weighing in on that question , ACTA could affect U.S. law in this area .
The “ Option 1 ( b ) ” text of Article 2.18.3 , in setting forth criteria for qualifying for safe harbor protection , says that an online service provider must adopt a policy to “ address the unauthorized storage or transmission of material protected by copyright . ”
The DMCA safe harbor , by contrast , requires service providers to ( i ) have a policy for terminating repeat infringers and ( ii ) accommodate standard technical measures .
Given the broader nature of the ACTA language , it could well be used in the future to justify proposals for imposing additional requirements on online service providers seeking to qualify for the safe harbor .
One can envision an argument that the DMCA requirements do not really “ address ” the problem as ACTA demands .
The ACTA provision ’s phrasing , in other words , lends itself to advocacy for going beyond current U.S. law .
Proposed Article 2.18.3 ter is flatly inconsistent with U.S. law .
The proposed language would require each country to enable rights holders to “ expeditiously obtain ” from Internet service providers the identity of any subscriber that the rights holders claim are engaging in infringement .
This conflicts with settled decision of two federal appeals courts , which have held that the DMCA does not require ISPs in their capacity as conduits to turn over subscriber information based on allegations of infringement .
( See in re Charter Communications ( 8th Cir. 2005 ) and RIAA v. Verizon ( D.C. Cir. 2003 ) . )
Finally , proposed Article 2.18.3 quater would call on governments and ISPs to take on new roles not envisioned by U.S. law .
The proposal would require each party to “ promote the development of mutually supportive relationships between online service providers and rights holders to deal effectively ” with Internet - based infringement , including “ guidelines for the actions which should be taken . ”
In contrast , current U.S. law reflects a deliberate policy choice not to saddle ISPs with the affirmative responsibility to police and prevent infringing activity by users .
47 USC 230 and section 512 of the DMCA reflect this policy choice .
4. Other Concerns
While CDT supports efforts to enforce current copyright law , we have concerns that efforts labeled as “ enforcement ” initiatives may be used as vehicles to obtain significant substantive modifications to the existing legal regime .
CDT recently told the new federal Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator that the forthcoming I.P. enforcement plan should not try to reshape substantive copyright law by , for example , calling for modifications to the scope of third party liability or new obligations for ISPs .
In the ACTA context , CDT and a number of allies similarly urged USTR in 2008 to avoid delving into matters of substantive law .
In CDT ’s view , it is difficult to argue that provisions addressing how and when third parties may be liable for infringements committed by others is merely a question of “ enforcement . ”
Third party liability is not just about how to pursue those who violate the law ; it is about how far copyright law reaches and which parties can be considered violators in the first place .
To the extent that ACTA gets into matters of substantive copyright law , there are legitimate questions about whether it is appropriate to address such matters in an executive agreement that can be concluded without any role for Congress .
In addition , some have raised questions about ACTA ’s call for an Oversight or Steering Committee that would function as a brand new international I.P. institution separate from the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) and World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
The impact on existing I.P. institutions and the potential for “ forum shopping ” are worth considering .
In sum , while the draft ACTA text provides an opportunity to begin detailed debate on the pros and cons of specific provisions and language , it raises a number of serious concerns .
CDT hopes that the improved level of transparency will translate into better understanding of the potential pitfalls and a reexamination of those aspects of ACTA that pose significant risk to online intermediaries .

Goldsmith / Lessig article raising constitutional concerns about ACTA
Geist blog post on ACTA ’s institutional provisions
The Chicago Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup this summer I recall reading a number of comments about how unfair it was that Dale Tallon was n't getting sufficient credit for assembling this team .
Well if Dale Tallon deserves credit for the Cup win , he certainly deserves the blame for the fire sale that is about to happen .
The harsh reality is that Tallon set in motion both the construction and destruction of the current Chicago roster .
He made a number of good choices ( draft picks ) , bad choices ( bloated free agent contracts ) and mistakes ( screwed up qualifying RFAs ) .
Now Chicago is going to have to pay the piper .
( click here to read my previous comments on Tallon 's performance . )
Let 's review the facts and assess the damage .
The NHLPA invoked the 5 % kicker on the salary cap .
In essence this assumes that NHL revenues will grow by 5 % and if it does n't the players risk losing their money which is held in escrow during the season .
Invoking the kicker puts next season 's cap at $ 59.6 in cap dollars .
Most NHL clubs can carry a cap expense of almost $ 60 million next year -- but not Chicago .
Why not ?
Bonus money .
When Jonathan Toews won the MVP that triggered a bonus clause that pays him an additional $ 1.3 million .
Other Chicago players also had bonus clauses vest and that put the team over the cap ceiling to the tune of nearly $ 4 million .
That $ 4 million in excess bonus money will be subtracted from the 2010 - 11 cap for Chicago , which means the Blackhawks can only carry a $ 56 million cap hit next year .
During the summer NHL teams are allowed to exceed their cap ceiling by 10 % so they can make moves -- so Chicago could have as much as $ 62 million on the books , but they must get back down to $ 56 million in the regular season .
Right now Chicago has a hard commitment of $ 58.5 million to 15 NHL roster players ( a team MUST carry at least 20 roster players ) .
Chicago has 5 Restricted Free Agents ( RFAs ) to sign ( Ladd , Skille , Eager , Hjalmarsson and Niemi ) .
Now here is where it gets tricky .
NHL clubs must make Qualifying Offers ( QOs ) to all RFAS to retain their rights , if they fail to qualify to do so the players become unrestricted free agents .
The qualifying offers must at least match last season 's salary , if a player made less than $ 1 million then the qualifying offer must include a minimum raise ( either 5 % or 10 % ) .
Now here 's the key part :
Right now the Blackhawks are so hard up against the cap that they probably can't even deliver their qualifying offers to their RFA players .
The deadline for making those qualifying offers is fast approaching which means that Chicago will be almost certainly have to move one of their $ 3 million cap players in the next few days .
Many people have pointed out that Chicago could go the route of burying Huet 's $ 5.6 million cap hit in the minors this next season .
They can go this route , but his cap hit only comes off the books AFTER training camp .
So dropping Huet to the minors could be an effective method of getting the Blackhawks back under the cap ceiling before the start of the regular season -- but it is not a tactic that can buy them room to deliver their qualifying offers .
Now some people will complain that the cap " caused " the pre-mature dismantling of a Stanley Cup contender .
The truth is that every GM must make choices the future .
Dale Tallon tried to speed up the contending process by throwing excessive money at players .
He signed free agents Brian Campbell ( $ 7.3 million ) and Huet ( $ 5.6 million ) to huge deals and he paid checking line players guys like Bolland $ 3 million and Kopecky $ 1.2 million .
Tallon also signed UFA Marian Hossa to a rich deal .
All of those decisions by Tallon meant that there would not be enough money to maintain the team 's depth as they young players began signing their 2nd and 3rd NHL contracts .
Tallon 's foolish contracts helped Chicago in the near term at the cost of foreshortening the club 's window of contention in the long run .
You could argue that winning the Cup was worth sacrificing team depth -- but do n't blame the cap for that consequence -- it was a strategic choice , not some unpredictable edict forced upon the team .
They rolled the dice , won their Cup and now have to slash the team 's depth -- and you should credit or blame Dale Tallon for both outcomes .
CNN 's Mythili Rao reports from New York :
August marks what would have been Mother Teresa 's 100th birthday , with commemorative masses , exhibitions and other events around the world heralding the occasion .
But count the Empire State Building out of the celebrations .
New York City 's tallest skyscraper has declined to shine the colorful , festive lights that it reserves for special occasions in her honor , leaving some of the nun 's followers feeling slighted .
" Selection as an Empire State Building Lighting Partner is at the sole discretion of the ownership and management of the Empire State Building Company LLC , " the privately owned building 's website says .
The site says that selection is " a privilege , not an entitlement . "
Outside its practice of lightings for Christmas , Easter , Hanukkah and Eid al - Fitr ( the end of Ramadan ) , the Empire State Building " has a specific policy against any other lighting for religious figures or requests by religions and religious organizations , " ESB owner Anthony E. Malkin said in a statement .
Bill Donohue , president of the Catholic League For Religious and Civil Rights , called the decision " mind - boggling " and " indefensible and obscene , " speculating that anti-Catholic bigotry was at play .
" Malkin has made his decision to stiff Catholics , " Donohue said .
" His decision to double down at this juncture - in the face of massive support for our request - is something he will regret for the rest of his life . "
The Catholic League plans to demonstrate outside the Empire State Building on August 26 , which would have been the 100th birthday of Mother Teresa , who cared for the poor and homeless of Kolkata ( formerly Calcutta ) , India .
She died in 1997 .
The Catholic League says over 40,000 people have signed a petition in favor of the lights .
" I think that too many Catholics have fallen asleep at the wheel , " Donohue told CNN .
" It 's time for people , the rank and file to say enough is enough .
I hope it 's going to be nonviolent , I would n't encourage violence but I know there 's a lot of anger . "
The brewing controversy has found an ally in New York City Council speaker Christine Quinn , a Catholic .
Quinn said that lighting the Empire State Building in Mother Teresa 's honor would " be a very uplifting and unifying and inspiring message to have at a time when I think the city could use it . "
" I think the organization that owns the Empire State Building seeing this as a religious request is really missing much of the significance of the life 's work of Mother Teresa , across the world and in New York City , " Quinn said .
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York said that a spokesperson was not immediately available for comment .
The lighting tradition dates back to 1932 , when the Empire State Building shined a 50 - mile searchlight beacon to announce that Franklin D. Roosevelt had been elected president .
Colored lighting was n't introduced til 1976 , when the tower was lit in red , white and blue for the American Bicentennial .
The vast majority of the occasions and organizations honored in lights by the Empire State Building are secular causes - June honorees include the World Series , Caribbean Week , and the Belmont Stakes , among others - but the building has been known to make exceptions , honoring Pope John Paul II and former New York Archbishop John Joseph O'Connor in years past .
In May , the skyscraper was lit blue and white to call attention to the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York 's Salute to Israel Parade .
The Empire State Building has been recognized as an official landmark by the National Parks Services and the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission since the 1980s .

Robert Kubica is ready to commit his long term future to Renault , AUTOSPORT has learned , as long as the team can prove it has the finances and technical capability to fight for the world championship .
With the Pole having opened talks with the team about extending his contract with it , sources have revealed that Kubica is seeking guarantees that the outfit will have the money in place that it will need to take on rivals for title glory over the next few years .
Kubica is well aware that Renault had to consider sponsorship issues in its choice of a second driver for this season - opting for Vitaly Petrov because of the commercial benefit of the Russian 's involvement .
However , with sources suggesting a major title sponsorship deal is on the verge of being signed - with team insiders confirming talks with credit card company MasterCard - the team 's financial situation could be much improved .
In fact , AUTOSPORT understands that the team is so bullish about its financial prospects that team owner Gerard Lopez has informed senior figures inside the team that he may sound out Kimi Raikkonen in the next few months about whether the Finn is interested in a return to F1 with Renault .
Kubica has insisted that he is not spending too much time worrying about his future at the moment - with it certain he will remain next season - but the financial platform going forward will be key to him opting for a single year deal or committing himself beyond that .
Renault team principal Eric Boullier has confirmed that the outfit 's main task is to convince the Polish driver that it has the money to achieve its title targets .
" We definitely want him and we have spoken - and it is up to us to show that we have the ambition and the means to be ambitious , " he said .
" If we do that , then I am sure he will stay .
If he does n't want to stay then he will leave , it is as simple as that . "
Boullier said he was not unduly concerned about rival teams chasing Kubica - after a weekend when speculation linking him with Mercedes GP was dismissed .
" Robert is one of the very highly ranked drivers but , because his contract is supposed to end this year , he has become attractive , " said Boullier .
" It 's normal . "
As mentioned previously , I no longer have much interest in store - bought bacon , so naturally when the bacon supply in my freezer dwindled , it was time to buy another pork belly and start the curing process .
Last time , I smoked the cured belly on our little Weber kettle grill and sliced it with a chef ’s knife .
This time , I got to try out more purpose - built tools for the job .
Like last time , I followed the recipes and methodology from Charcuterie : The Craft of Salting , Smoking , and Curing .
I split the roughly six - and - a- half pound belly in half .
One half was cured in a simple mixture of coarse kosher salt , sugar , and pink salt .
The other though was cured with the same base ingredients and the additions of bay leaves , black peppercorns , and garlic , all crushed to release maximum flavor .
After about eight days in their respective cures , I rinsed the belly pieces .
Since the bacon came out a bit too salty last time , I spent extra time rinsing this time around .
Next , I let the belly pieces sit uncovered in the refrigerator so a bit of a pellicle could form , giving the fantastically tasty smoke particles something to cling to .
The skin felt a bit tacky the next morning , so I knew it was time for smoking .
Here ’s where the purpose - built equipment comes in .
We bought a very inexpensive smoker – the Brinkmann 852-7080 - 7 Gourmet Charcoal Smoker and Grill , Black .
I added the link from Amazon , but we actually found it on sale for less at our local Lowes .
There ’s a tray in the very bottom for the charcoal and the soaked wood chunks .
Above that is a bowl for water ( or other more flavor - contributing liquid ) to add moisture throughout the smoking process .
And above that are two separate racks for whatever items will be smoked .
Used the extra room on the grill to smoke a couple of hatch chiles as well
The only wood we had around the house were wood chips , but despite an hour - long soaking in water , the chips burned away very quickly .
I had to restock the chips about halfway through the smoking .
In the future , I will seek out wood chunks to smoke instead .
I expected the bacon to take two to two and a half hours in the smoker to reach its target internal temperature ; however , it wound up only taking about an hour and a half .
My one beef with this smoker is that the built - in thermometer does n’t actually tell you the temperature .
Instead it gives the essentially useless readings : WARM , IDEAL , HOT .
Turns out that “ ideal ” is in the eye of the beholder .
I ’ll have to experiment with alternate methods for determining the real temperature in the smoker .
The next purpose - built tool was a loaner .
My favorite offal - blogger , Ryan of Nose to Tail at Home fame , was kind enough to lend me his slicer .
Last time I had a terrible time slicing the bacon and had to resort to calling it “ rustic ” to cover up my crap slicing job .
After a fair bit of shopping , Ryan managed to find a fairly inexpensive slicer – the Chef ’s Choice 610 Premium Electric Food Slicer , and at least for the six pounds of bacon I sliced , it worked beautifully .
There ’s even a hand - guard , so the risk of me bloodying up the borrowed slicer by shortening my fingers was all but nonexistent .
And finally , the taste .
Well , unfortunately it was still a bit too salty .
It was suggested to me by the aptly named baconator that I give the bacon a soaking for an hour or so after curing to bring the salt level down to a more palatable level , so we ’ll try that next time .
We vacuum - sealed the extra bacon in half - pound portions and froze
Otherwise though , the flavor was again incredible .
Rich , creamy fat and clean pork flavor came through on the slab cured with the basic formula .
More incredible though was how well the garlic and bay and pepper came through on the other slab .
Even though the solids are rinsed well away before smoking the meat , the flavors have infused the brine and carry all through the meat during the curing process .
I know I ’ve said this before , but it is completely worth your time to do this yourself , even without the smoker and the slicer .
For people sitting at home and watching TV news last night , Toronto was burning .
The same police car on Queen St W. burned and blew up over and over again .
The same image of a young man very violently smashing Starbucks windows appeared over and over again .
Windows smashed all along Yonge St. None of us had ever seen Toronto like this .
It was shocking .
Lucas Oleniuk , Toronto Star
Most of the 400 protesters arrested last night and others who may have avoided arrest did n't see that violence .
From their perspective , they were facing a violent police state .
These demonstrations , militant but overwhelming peaceful , were resisting the right of the police to hold them to Queen Street .
They think the people have a right to protest in a place where political leaders can hear them .
They had nothing to do with torching police cars or trashing windows .
TVO host Steve Paiken was down at the Novotel last night with peaceful protesters .
He tweeted his experiences , " Shame on those that ordered peaceful protesters attacked and arrested .
that is not consistent with democracy in toronto , G20 or no G20 . "
I was on Queen West and Spadina when the trouble started .
David Fernandez has written an excellent report on what happened on his facebook page .
" Rewind to just before the riot happened , thousands of us marched in a very briskly moving group until we hit the intersection of Spadina and Queen .
Folks from the labour movement tried in vain to encourage the march to move back up towards queens park , but the mood was clear .
Many thousands of protestors were interested in being closer to the summit and letting the police know that we could n't be intimidated .
But nothing official was planned .
Labour walked back up the street leaving thousands to mill about in the confusion of what to do next .
And in that confusion , several hundred people changed their clothes and took off together running down queen street while thousands of riot cops picked their noses .
In full police view , they let a mob destroy banks and trash Yonge street .
And while riot cops had shields AND bikes and thousands of dollars in body armor to protect them from the remaining peaceful protestors , somehow they were so scared of us that they abandoned police cars . "
The police spokesperson told Metro Morning today that they waited until later when it was safer to make arrests but that can not be true .
I was there and like David I believe the cops could have arrested the Black Bloc right at the beginning of the action but they abandoned their police cars and allowed them to burn , not even calling the fire department until the media had lots of time to photograph them .
They had a water cannon but they did n't even use a fire extinguisher .
Why ?
A comment released to a media outlet last night from official police spokesperson tells some of the story , " We have never tried to curtail people 's rights to lawfully protest .
All you have to do is turn on the TV and see what 's happening now .
Police cars are getting torched , buildings are being vandalized , people are getting beat up and the so - called ' intimidating ' police presence is essential to restoring order .
That is the reality on the ground . "
Police playing politics , justifying the expense and responding to the critiques building all week about excessive and arbitrary police powers .
A politicized police force is unacceptable in a democratic society .
There are serious questions that must be answered and they have not been satisfactory answered .
People were shocked last night by a city out of control but the Toronto police -- without all the huge expenditures , extra police from across the country and sophisticated new toys -- have kept the peace in riots with a lot more people and in hundreds of demonstrations much larger and often angry .
I disagree with torching police cars and breaking windows and I have been debating these tactics for decades with people who think they accomplish something .
But the bigger question here is why the police let it happen and make no mistake the police did let it happen .
Why did the police let the city get out of control ?
And they did let it get out of control .
The police knew exactly what would happen and how .
Christopher
Watt was there when the first police car was torched ,
" The officers clustered and formed a line .
A second picket of officers lined up behind them , facing the crowd where I stood .
They started to move , but they were n't clearing the street ; they were clearing out and abandoning two police cars , including the one with the shattered windshield ...
In moments like this , someone needs to make a decision .
This time it was a man in dreadlocks and no shirt , red paint all over his torso .
He moved towards the police car , grabbing the squawking police radio ...
Following the lead of the dreadlocked man , someone else pulled what looked like a leather folder from inside the car and spread its contents over the trunk .
A kid wearing sunglasses , his face covered by a scarf , inspected the paperwork .
Soon after , the squad cars would be on fire .
( The gas cap appeared to have been removed from one of them even before the crowd moved in . ) "
It was a perfect storm .
A massive police presence who were primed for " dangerous anarchists " after a week of peaceful protests .
No more than one hundred , probably fewer , young men who think violent confrontations with the police will create a radicalization and expose the violence of the state .
A new generation of young people who are becoming activists believing they live in a democratic society and are shocked by the degree of police violence arrayed to stop them .
But it is the police that let the handful of people using Black Bloc tactics run wild and then used the burning police cars and violent images as a media campaign to convince the people of Toronto that the cost and the excessive police presence was necessary .
They knew what would happen and they knew how it would happen .
It is the police that bear the responsibility for what happened last night .
They were responsible for keeping the peace and they failed to do it .
Memorial Day Weekend is apparently a popular time for developers to implement double XP gains. andare doing it , and nowis joining the fray .
" Double XP foris now active for ALL platforms , worldwide !
It 'll stay active all weekend long and all - day Monday as well ! " tweeted Infinity Ward 's Robert Bowling .
This and next week 's double XP weekend are a celebration of the upcoming release of 's second map pack , the Resurgence Pack .

We ’ve covered BP ’s unsavory attempts at blocking journalists from filming the Gulf oil disaster before .
And while we were surprised to learn that the oil giant hired mercenaries to strongarm private citizens , it now appears that BP also has the local police in its pocket , as evidenced by the experiences of Drew Wheelan , the conservation coordinator for the American Birding Association .
Mother Jones directs us to the video below , which shows the Louisiana police warning Wheelan to stop filming himself at the Deepwater Horizon response center .
While the officer admitted that Wheelan was n’t breaking any laws , he warned “ BP does n’t want any filming .
So all I can really do is strongly suggest
that you not film anything right now .
If that makes any sense . ”
The intimidation tactics did n’t stop there .
After Wheelan started driving away , he was pulled over by the same cop , who was accompanied by a BP security officer named Kenneth Thomas .
Wheelan was interrogated for 20 minutes about his motives for filming before being let go–but not before Thomas confiscated Wheelan ’s Audubon volunteer badge for no apparent reason .
It ’s disturbing to see the police aid BP with its bullying , but not all that shocking .
Louisiana does still rely heavily on offshore drilling for jobs–so much so that a federal judge in the state struck down Obama ’s moratorium on deepwater drilling today , presumably because of the potential for lost wages and jobs .
The Obama administration plans to appeal the ruling , but the Gulf region ’s reliance on drilling jobs obviously continues to cloud its judgment .
Bias is much harder to demonstrate scientifically in real life , which may be why large numbers of people do not believe that sexism and other forms of prejudice still exist .
Many people think we live in a " post- racial " and " post - sexist " world where egalitarian notions are the norm .
Indeed , if you go by what people report , we do live in a bias - free world , because most people report feeling no prejudice whatsoever .
What would be remarkably instructive in real life would be if women in various professions could experience life as men , and vice versa .
If the same person got treated differently , we would be sure sexism was at work , because the only thing that changed was the sex of the individual and not his or her skills , talent , knowledge , experience , or interests .
Joan Roughgarden and Ben Barres are biologists at Stanford University .
Both are researchers at one of the premier academic institutions in the country ; both are tenured professors .
Both are transgendered people .
Stanford has been a welcoming home for these scientists ; if you are going to be a transgendered person anywhere in the United States , it would be difficult to imagine a place more tolerant than Palo Alto and the San Francisco Bay Area .
Ben Barres did not transition to being a man until he was 50 .
For much of her early life , Barbara Barres was oblivious to questions of sexism .
She would hear Gloria Steinem and other feminists talk about discrimination and wonder , " What 's their problem ? "
She was no activist ; all she wanted was to be a scientist .
She was an excellent student .
When a school guidance counsellor advised her to set her sights lower than MIT , Barbara ignored him , applied to MIT , and got admitted in 1972 .
During a particularly difficult maths seminar at MIT , a professor handed out a quiz with five problems .
He gave out the test at 9 am , and students had to hand in their answers by midnight .
The first four problems were easy , and Barbara knocked them off in short order .
But the fifth one was a beauty ; it involved writing a computer program where the solution required the program to generate a partial answer , and then loop around to the start in a recursive fashion .
" I remember when the professor handed back the exams , he made this announcement that there were five problems but no one had solved the fifth problem and therefore he only scored the class on the four problems , " Ben recalled .
" I got an A .
I went to the professor and I said , ' I solved it . '
He looked at me and he had a look of disdain in his eyes , and he said , ' You must have had your boyfriend solve it . '
To me , the most amazing thing is that I was indignant .
I walked away .
I did n't know what to say .
He was in essence accusing me of cheating .
I was incensed by that .
It did not occur to me for years and years that that was sexism . "
By the time she was done with MIT , Barbara had more or less decided she wanted to be a neuroscientist .
She decided to go to medical school at Dartmouth in New Hampshire .
Gender issues at med school were like the issues at MIT on steroids ; one professor referred Barbara to his wife when she wanted to talk about her professional interests .
An anatomy professor showed a slide of a nude female pin-up during a lecture .
During the first year of Barbara 's residency , when she was an intern , she found herself clashing with the chief resident .
" When you have to learn to do a spinal tap or do a line , at some point only one person can do the procedure .
What I noticed is that every time a male resident would do the picking , he would pick a guy to do the procedure .
I had to often say , ' He did it last time .
It is my turn this time . ' "
But things changed in large and subtle ways after Barbara became Ben .
Ben once gave a presentation at the prestigious Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
A friend relayed a comment made by someone in the audience who did n't know Ben Barres and Barbara Barres were the same person : " Ben Barres gave a great seminar today , but , then , his work is much better than his sister 's . "
Ben also noticed he was treated differently in the everyday world .
" When I go into stores , I notice I am much more likely to be attended to .
They come up to me and say , ' Yes , sir ?
Can I help you , sir ? '
I have had the thought a million times , I am taken more seriously . "
When former Harvard president Larry Summers ( who went on to become a senior economic adviser to President Barack Obama ) set off a firestorm a few years ago after musing about whether there were fewer women professors in the top ranks of science because of innate differences between men and women , Ben wrote an anguished essay in the journal Nature .
He asked whether innate differences or subtle biases - from grade school to graduate school - explained the large disparities between men and women in the highest reaches of science .
" When it comes to bias , it seems that the desire to believe in a meritocracy is so powerful that until a person has experienced sufficient career - harming bias themselves they simply do not believe it exists …
By far , the main difference that I have noticed is that people who do n't know I am transgendered treat me with much more respect : I can even complete a whole sentence without being interrupted by a man . "
Joan Roughgarden came to Stanford in 1972 , more than a quarter century before she made her male - to - female transition in 1998 .
When the young biologist arrived at Stanford , it felt as though tracks had been laid down ; all Roughgarden had to do was stick to the tracks , and the high expectations that others had of the young biologist would do the rest .
" It was clear when I got the job at Stanford that it was like being on a conveyer belt , " Roughgarden told me in an interview .
" The career track is set up for young men .
You are assumed to be competent unless revealed otherwise .
You can speak , and people will pause and people will listen .
You can enunciate in definitive terms and get away with it .
You are taken as a player .
You can use male diction , male tones of voice . …
You can assert .
You have the authority to frame issues . "
At the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove , an outpost of the university about 150 kilometres from campus , Roughgarden ruffled feathers in the scientific establishment by arguing that a prominent theory that described the life cycle of marine animals was wrong .
Where previous research had suggested that tide pools were involved in the transportation of certain larvae , Roughgarden reframed the issue and showed that the larger ocean played a significant role .
The new theory got harsh reviews , but Roughgarden 's ideas were taken seriously .
In short order , Roughgarden became a tenured professor , and a widely respected scientist and author .
Like Ben Barres , Roughgarden made her transition to Joan relatively late in life .
Stanford proved tolerant , but very soon Joan started to feel that people were taking her ideas less seriously .
In 2006 , for example , Joan suggested another famous scientific theory was wrong - Charles Darwin 's theory of sexual selection .
Among other things , the theory suggests that men and women are perpetually locked in a reproductive conflict .
Men are supposed to be sexually promiscuous because they stand to gain from spreading their genes as widely as possible , whereas women are supposed to value monogamy because they can have relatively few biological children .
Even when women and men escape from this " battle of the sexes " , it is only because a temporary truce has been declared .
A monogamous husband , for example , " forgoes " his natural inclination to infidelity because his partner offers him something of exceptional value - such as beauty or youth .
The theory essentially suggests that conflicting goals are basic to all male - female human relationships - and even purports to " explain " why men rape women .
Using ideas from game theory , Joan published a review article in the prestigious journal Science , where she explained why she thought the theory was wrong .
Thinking about sex purely in terms of reproduction was flawed , Joan argued .
Sex was also about building alliances , trading , co-operation , social regulation and play .
Joan used the example of the Eurasian oystercatcher , a wading bird , in her 2006 paper .
In particular , she looked at nests involving three birds , a male and two females .
In some of these families , the females fought viciously with each other , whereas in others , the females mated with each other almost as often as they mated with the male .
Nests where females bonded sexually were much more likely to have offspring that survived , compared with nests where the females fought each other , since the co-operative nest could call on the resources of three birds to defend offspring against predators .
Sex between the females may not have produced offspring , but it had a powerful effect on the survival rate of offspring .
Where Darwin's theory of sexual selection would argue that the competing interests of males and females are what produce a range of sexual behaviours , Joan 's theory of " social selection " offered a different viewpoint : conflict between Eurasian oystercatchers , as perhaps with conflict between human mates , was not the starting point of relationships but an unfortunate outcome .
Co-operation , not conflict , Joan argued , was basic to nature .
" Reproductive social behaviour and sexual reproduction are co-operative .
Sexual conflict derives from negotiation breakdown . ''
THE scientific establishment , Joan said , was livid .
But in contrast to the response to her earlier theory about tide pools and marine animals , few scientists engaged with her .
At a workshop at Loyola University , a scientist " lost it " and started screaming at her for being irresponsible .
" I had never had experiences of anyone trying to coerce me in this physically intimidating way , " she said , as she compared the reactions to her work before and after she became a woman .
" You really think this guy is really going to come over and hit you . "
At a meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Minneapolis , Joan said , a prominent expert jumped up on the stage after her talk and started shouting at her .
Once every month or two , she said , '' I will have some man shout at me , try to physically coerce me into stopping … When I was doing the marine ecology work , they did not try to physically intimidate me and say , ' You have not read all the literature . '
" They would not assume they were smarter .
The current crop of objectors assumes they are smarter . "
Joan is willing to acknowledge her theory might be wrong ; that , after all , is the nature of science .
But what she wants is to be proven wrong , rather than dismissed .
Making bold and counter - intuitive assertions is precisely the way science progresses .
Many bold ideas are wrong , but if there is n't a regular supply of them and if they are not debated seriously , there is no progress .
After her transition , Joan said she no longer feels she has " the right to be wrong " .
Where she used to be a member of Stanford University 's senate , Joan is no longer on any university or departmental committee .
Where she was once able to access internal university funds for research , she said she finds it all but impossible to do so now .
Before her transition , she enjoyed an above - average salary at Stanford .
But since her transition , " My own salary has drifted down to the bottom 10 per cent of full professors in the School of Humanities and Sciences , even though my research and students are among the best of my career and are having international impact , albeit often controversial . "
I asked her about interpersonal dynamics before and after her transition .
" You get interrupted when you are talking , you can't command attention , but above all you can't frame the issues , " she said .
With a touch of wistfulness , she compared herself to Ben Barres .
" Ben has migrated into the centre whereas I have had to migrate into the periphery . "

Dungeness National Nature Reserve
HISTORY
Geology
The pattern of shingle ridges have built up at Dungeness over 5,000 years .
The height of a shingle ridge can be used to determine the sea level at the time it was formed .
Across Dungeness the ridges have been used to produce a series of records showing how sea level has changed naturally over the past 5,000 years .
Gravel extraction
Dungeness has attracted the gravel extraction industry for generations .
Today , the legacy of this extraction can be seen in the number of gravel pits across the landscape .
These pits are home to a plethora of wildlife from breeding seabirds , wintering wildfowl , to the rare great - crested newt and blood sucking medicinal leech .
Lydd Ranges
The vast Lydd Ranges have been owned by the Ministry of Defence since 1881 , with the Royal Irish Rifles forming the first garrison there .
The first permanent buildings were erected in 1906 in what are today very busy firing ranges stretching from Camber to near the power stations .
Lighthouse
There have been five lighthouses built at Dungeness over the centuries .
Today , the Old Lighthouse which was built in 1904 still stands adjacent to the Round House , which once had a lighthouse on the top of it , the round house was built in 1792 .
The New Lighthouse ( the stripy one ) was built in 1961 to aid shipping further out to the Point .
The New Lighthouse remains operational , while the Old Lighthouse is a tourist attraction .
Concrete Mirrors
At the back of two gravel pits at Lade on an island are the three concrete listening mirrors , built in the 1920 ’s and 1930 ’s to detect enemy aircraft as they approached Britain .
This is the only site in Britain where all three designs are situated in one place .
This early warning system with a range of 20 miles became obsolete by the outbreak of the Second World War .
The site is now managed by the RSPB .
Please see here for details of guided tours .
Houses
There are nearly 100 homes across the Dungeness Estate of many different shapes and sizes .
Some near to the lighthouses originate from old railway carriages dragged across the shingle nearly one hundred years ago .
Houses near to the Lifeboat Station are larger and are inhabited mainly by local fishermen , which are able to dry nets in the loft spaces .

Free College Scholarships
College scholarships differ from loans in that they are effectively a gift and do not need to be paid back .
( However , some have requirements attached to them such as requiring the graduate to work for the company that grants the scholarship money . )
Scholarships come in many varieties and from a variety of sources .
There are literally millions of dollars available for education in America .
Scholarships are generally grouped in to five groupings .
Merit :
This is financial aid for which financial need is not used to determine the recipient .
The recipient is chosen based on there academic , artistic or athletic ability .
These scholarships are generally given out in an effort to attract talented individuals to particular institutions or to motivate them to pursue their particular talents .
Need :
Need based scholarships are awarded to individuals who are not economically able to acquire their desired education .
They are often given to individuals who have particular talents , but can not afford college ( or other schools ) tuitions .
These scholarships may pay for some or all of a student 's tuition and can even assist with other living expenses .
Sociology :
This is financial aid where applicants must initially qualify by race , religion , or national origin .
After filtering the applicants based on their ethnicity , additional factors are taken into consideration to determine the final recipients .
Institutional : These are scholarships awarded by a specific college or university ( institution ) to a student planning to attend that institution .
General :
These are other scholarships which are awarded for a variety of reasons that do not fall into one of the above categories .
These may be for reasons of the student 's association with the objectives of the sponsoring organization .
For example , some corporations give scholarships to their employees ' children or based upon academic success .
Others are awarded based on a lottery style system , winners being selected at random from the pool of applicants .
These five groups represent a vast fund of money available to students , wise ( not necessarily the smartest ) students will attempt to obtain some of these funds , and thousands of them get their college tuition paid for every year !
Did You Know ?
Americans with a college degrees make over twice as much those who did n't attend college .
Education pays and you can even get it paid for with money from free scholarships and grants !
Organized labor faces an Arkansas showdown with the Democratic establishment on Tuesday .
Unions and their allies have spent more than $ 6.5 million to take down Sen.
Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) and turn Arkansas into yet another symptom of a national anti-incumbent mood .

But the spotlight will shine brightest on Lincoln , who earned union scorn for opposing a public option in the healthcare bill and refusing to back card - check legislation championed by the labor movement .
Unions and other liberal groups are as angry with some of their erstwhile allies in the Democratic Party as the Tea Party movement is irked with some Republicans .
Labor groups have emptied their coffers to attack Lincoln and elevate Lt. Gov. Bill Halter , the Democrat who forced Lincoln into a run-off last month .
Momentum appears to be behind Halter , who according to polls is running neck and neck with Lincoln despite , or perhaps because of , support for the incumbent in Washington .

The Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) has spent more than $ 3 million on the race , according to Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) records , while the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees has spent more than $ 1.5 million .
Labor groups are also putting activists in the field for what is expected to be a close election .
The AFL - CIO has sent staff from its Washington office to help Halter supporters get to the polls , as has Working America , its community affiliate .
Working America ’s 41 paid organizers in Arkansas have made 315,000 phone calls and knocked on 120,000 doors , canvassing voters in 27 cities and 17 counties in the state , according to spokeswoman Alison Omens .
The group has also spent more than $ 1.3 million on ads and has been in Arkansas since the healthcare fight , when it urged constituents to press Lincoln to support the public option .
“ Working America organizers are going back to the folks who wrote and their neighbors to let them know that Sen.
Lincoln did n’t listen , and that Bill Halter is a choice who will listen to working people ’s stories , ” Omens said .
Labor ’s opponents have tried to help Lincoln .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which fought unions on the public option and card - check , spent $ 300,000 on ads for Lincoln , according to FEC reports .
In Nevada , the Tea Party Express is supporting former State Assemblywoman Sharron Angle ( R ) , who leads two other Republicans in recent polls .
The conservative Club for Growth has also made significant expenditures in Nevada .
According to the FEC , the anti-tax group has spent some $ 485,000 , much of it going to ads that criticize Sue Lowden for raising taxes during her tenure in the state Legislature .
Lowden was once considered the GOP front - runner but has seen her lead slip away .
She now trails Angle and Las Vegas businessman Danny Tarkanian in the contest to face Reid , whom polls consistently have shown is in danger this year .
Lowden has fallen because of the way she has handled the media , according to observers .
She became the butt of national ridicule when she suggested that bartering could lower the price of medical care and noted that doctors once accepted chickens in exchange for their services .
The Democrats branded the incident “ chickens for checkups . ”
“ Her voter contact has n’t been bad , it ’s the way she ’s handled the third party assaults , ” said Ryan Erwin , an adviser to John Chachas , another Republican Senate candidate in Nevada .
“ The campaign really misplayed every possible scenario . ”
Lowden ’s only hope of a victory is if she ’s banked enough ballots during early voting to overcome what ’s expected to be an Angle Election Day victory .
Meanwhile , the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) has started laying the groundwork for an Angle victory .
“ If Sharron Angle is the nominee , I ’m confident she can beat Harry Reid in November , ” NRSC Chairman John Cornyn John CornynGOP senators pan debate : ' S --- show , ' ' awful , ' ' embarrassment '

The race for the GOP Senate nomination in California was n’t supposed to be a close contest and initially attracted little attention .
Once former Rep. Tom Campbell ( R - Calif . ) shifted out of the gubernatorial race and into the Senate primary , it made the GOP Senate fight competitive .
Former Hewlett - Packard CEO Carly Fiorina ( R ) is expected to prevail , but could be in rougher condition for her fall battle with Boxer .
Fiorina has more baggage coming out of the divisive primary .
“ I think she ’s made a lot of mistakes , and Campbell caused her a lot of problems , ” said a California - based Democratic strategist .
“ She ’s now said a lot of things that will be held against her . ”
The strategist pointed to Fiorina ’s position in favor of allowing people on the Homeland Security Department ’s “ no - fly list ” to carry and purchase guns as one she ’ll come to regret in the general - election race against Boxer .

It 's oftentimes easy for us to get swept up in Android mania and forget that Google 's mobile platform is still in its infancy .
Then we get cold hard numbers like these -- showing iPhone OS owning 28 percent of the US smartphone market and closing in on RIM 's leading 35 percent -- and we face up to the realization that Android handsets still account for less than one in every ten smartphones owned by Americans today .
In spite of collecting 28 percent of all consumer smartphone purchases in the first quarter of 2010 ( according to NPD ) , Google 's OS was only able to climb up a couple of percentage points in terms of total market share , showing just how long a road lies ahead of its world - conquering plans .
Guess that now explains why Apple 's response to the earlier numbers was so nonchalant
Other intriguing figures include a high rate of loyalty among iPhone OS and Android users , with 80 percent of the former and 70 percent of the latter expressing a preference for the same OS in their next phone -- both rather shaming Microsoft and RIM 's numbers , which were a mediocre 34 and 47 percent , respectively .
Funnily enough , despite its inflammatory title , this report finds Android and iPhone users are more similar to each other than anyone else -- an uncomfortable fact for both parties to deal with , we 're sure .
The source link contains some more demographic comparisons , so why not go check them out and drop some sage analysis for us in the comments ?
George W. Bush seems driven to complete his father 's unfinished business in space , as in Iraq .
But much has changed .
The cold war , which provided the initial motivation for our space program , is long gone .
And technological progress has superseded human space exploration .
Remotely controlled instruments have become natural extensions of frail human bodies .
Much of what we yearn to discover in space is inaccessible to humans .
Astronauts on Mars , locked in their spacesuits , could not venture far from shelter amid the constant bombardment of energetic particles that are unscreened by the thin atmosphere .
Beyond Mars , there is no place humans can go in the foreseeable future .
The great adventure of the 21st century will be to explore where no human can possibly set foot .
The great quest is to find life to which we are not related .
Could nature have solved the problem of life in some other way , in some other place ?
When we find out , we will know much more about ourselves .
Two mechanical geologists , Spirit and Opportunity , are doing this even now , by searching for evidence of water on opposite sides of Mars .
They do n't break for lunch or complain about the cold nights , and they live on sunshine .
They 've been at it for nearly two years , yet their mission costs less than sending a shuttle to the International Space Station .
The brains of Spirit and Opportunity are the brains of geologists back on Earth .
Progress in society is measured by the extent to which work that is dangerous or menial is done by machines .
The benefits we enjoy from the space program -- weather satellites , communications satellites and global positioning -- come from robotic spacecraft .
Few scientists are calling for a human mission to the Moon or Mars .
Human space exploration is essentially over .
It is too expensive and provides too little return .
But politicians know that the American public identifies progress in space with human astronauts .
The Bush administration 's solution is to create an impossibly expensive and pointless program for some other administration to cancel , thus bearing the blame for ending human space exploration .
The return to the moon is not a noble quest .
It is a poison pill .

ROV image showing the control pod fitting being tightened
Suttles said BP could not be certain but diagnostic tests on the well seem to indicate the flow is not coming up the main bore .
The well also contains obstructions that are restricting the flow rate .
It is impossible to know for certain what those obstructions are , Suttles said , but cured cement and rocks from the formations that crews drilled through could be partially clogging the well .
The Lower Marine Riser Package ( LMRP ) option
( scroll up for animation ) Before the process could begin , however , it was necessary to significantly modify the blow - out preventer ( BOP ) that sits on the top of the well .
For those interested ( its a bit like watching one of the operations on the space station ) BP has assembled a short ( 5 minute ) selection of the video footage of the various steps .
When watching it , you should bear in mind that the ROV ’s carrying out the different steps have to operate in a relatively crowded environment .
The tasks to be done included removing , modifying and replacing the control box ( or pod ) that operates the valves that open and close the flow lines into the choke and kill lines on the well .
Other than this , the flow lines to the flow and choke lines themselves had to be replaced with the feed lines ( shown in the animation ) that will carry the mud into the well .
Even tightening a fitting that had worked loose takes time , when it has to be done using an ROV ( with the operator at the surface needing to see what he is doing while getting the ROV to hold the necessary wrench and turn the fitting ) .
The old feed lines then had to be cut from the BOP , and replaced .
This involved * cutting off the choke and kill line connectors *
Cutting the bolts on a flange *
Removing the clamp *
Removing the pipe flange end *
Buffing and cleaning the pipe end *
Preparing to attach the new jumper lines .
( This had to be done for each feed line ) *
A special hydraulic connector attached to the 150 - ft jumper cables was used to latch onto the old inlets .
This is slow work ( as the video shows ) and as a result this part of the work has taken seven days .
( The jumper shown in the video was attached on the 16th and chained down into position on the 17th . )
When the connections and fittings have all been made and checked , and the control pod operation validated , and the necessary permits from MMS and others obtained , then the process can begin .
The process will be controlled from the Q4000 , which is designed to have the capabilities needed .
Two lines feed from the vessel to the BOP .
The first carries the control feeds through an umbilical , while the second is a riser that carries the mud down to the flexible hoses and jumper lines into the BOP itself .
This mud , at about twice the density of water , will be delivered from the two high - pressure Schlumberger MD 1000 mud pumps made by Schlumberger and will flow through the two feed lines that were the choke and kill circuits , into the well itself , below the main rams of the BOP .
The pumps will deliver the mud into the lines at a pressure of 6,800 psi , but as Kinuachdrach has correctly noted , it will then acquire the pressure from the full 5,000 ft column of mud as it flows down to the BOP , and enters the flow channel carrying the oil .
Now we know that the BOP rams are at least partially closed .
If they are planning on using golf balls for the “ junk shot ” , it is feasible to surmise that the maximum width of the flow channel is no more than a third of a golf ball diameter .
Not arguing the merits of American vs British ball sizes , let us assume that this is roughly half - an - inch ( though it may have a greater length ) .
However , as flow volumes go up it requires more and more pressure for the fluid to get through a small gap .
And at a given delivery pressure , only a certain flow volume will thus be able to escape that way .
As long as this pressure exceeds that in the well , the net result will then be that the mud begins to push the oil and gas back down the well , and the well fills up with mud .
The weight of that mud should then be enough to exert a pressure on the bottom of the well that is enough to exceed the fluid pressure in the rock and therefore stabilize the well and stop the flow of fluid out .
Cement can then be pumped into the well to seal the top end .
( Or with the flow stopped , another BOP can be put on the well to seal it ) .
The main worry is that the hole in the top of the BOP is small enough to contain the additional flow volumes , and not allow the entire flow to escape upwards rather than being forced down the well .
The higher flows might , in addition , if they do exit the riser , further erode the openings .
This could increase the oil flow , as it lowers the resistance .
( If this happened then the LMRP will be deployed ) .
There are , however , a number of caveats to this operation .
If the pressure in the well gets too high it can cause fractures in the rock at the bottom of the well , and this can cause the mud in the well to flow into the rock , rather than sitting in the well holding the pressure against the oil pressure .
There are also concerns with the condition of the bottom of the well , and whether this will have any impact on the flow of mud back down to the well and in sealing it .
If the top kill fails , then the next step will be to cut off the riser , and use the top hat that is sitting on the sea bed near the well , to capture the flow in the LMRP option .
Were it me , I might contact Atlas Tocco and have them look into connecting up an induction heating coil around the outside of the bottom of the riser section .
It might give them the occasional additional bit of heat on the inside surface that might be needed to dislodge any inconvenient crystals that might form , without interfering with the internal flow channels .
As a point of scale for the video from the riser leak , the amount of dispersant that is being ejected into the water is about 14,000 gallons a day or about 10 gallons a minute ( quarter of a barrel roughly ) .
A 5,000 bd flow is around 150 gals / minute .
This came from Doug Suttles teleconference in which he noted that BP have now spent around $ 800 million .
He noted that oil levels in the water near the well are being measured at 10 ppm ( parts per million ) , against an EPA limit for oil discharge which is 15 ppm .
However it is early in the monitoring cycle , and with a fleet of government sampling vessels now starting to work , the plumes and oil dispersant paths will be mapped in more detail in the weeks ahead .

Wikipedia has some new improvements , thanks to the hard work and dedication of over half a million beta testers and volunteers who worked with the Wikimedia User Experience team over the last year !
With a beta testing group of 635,000 people and an 83 % user retention rate , we ’re proud to introduce you to Wikipedia ’s new look and feel .
As of 8:00 am UTC today , the new features moved from beta and will be available for everyone to use .
This is the first major initiative the Wikimedia Foundation and its volunteers have ever undertaken for Wikipedia ’s interface .
And there ’s more to come .
It ’s been one year since we began the usability initiative , and we ’ve rolled out the new interface to Wikinews ( English and Serbian ) , Wikimedia Commons , and now English Wikipedia .
That means that hundreds of millions of people around the world will now experience an easier to use , and more importantly , easier to edit Wikipedia .
Our most recent interface launch , on Wikimedia Commons , was a great success with continued adoption by over 91 % of Commons contributors .
Over the next few weeks , the new interface will cascade to all language Wikipedias .
Here ’s what ’s new :
Look and feel :
We ’ve introduced a new theme we call “ Vector ” which makes essential functions easier to find .
Navigation :
We ’ve improved the navigation for reading and editing pages .
Now , the tabs at the top of each page more clearly define whether you ’re reading or editing a page .
There ’s also a collapsible navigation for the left sidebar that hides items that are n’t used often , but allows them to continue to be easily accessible .
Editing improvements :
We ’ve reorganized the editing toolbar to make it easier to use .
Now , formatting pages is simpler and more intuitive .
And we ’ve introduced a table wizard to make creating tables easier .
You ’ll also discover a new find and replace feature to simplify page editing .
Link wizard :
An easy - to - use tool allows you to add links to other pages on Wikipedia , or to pages on external sites .
Search improvements : Search suggestions are now improved to get you to the page you are looking for more quickly .

The well - known Wikipedia globe and wordmark have been enhanced and improved .
We kicked off this effort in April 2009 , and immediately went to work to figure out how to make Wikipedia easier to use for everyone .
We started with usability testing among everyday readers with no editing experience , and we learned about the way people interact with Wikipedia and how we could make the experience better .
Using this valuable information , we incrementally released new features to users who opted into our beta testing group .
Over the next several months , we continued to improve the features based on feedback from both our beta testers and from usability studies we conducted .
We ’re thankful for the input of thousands of international users and volunteers who gave us feedback on our progress .
During our initial beta testing phases , 81 % of Spanish and Portuguese Wikipedia beta participants kept using the new editing interface .
Seventy to seventy - nine percent of German , Russian , Chinese , French and Italian Wikipedia beta users also maintained the new interface .
Retention rates for Polish and Japanese were relatively low in the beginning ( 65 % and 60 % , respectively ) .
Since then , we used feedback directly from our users all over the world to increase the quality of the interface and design .
If you prefer the classic interface , called

Stoobalou and other readers sent along word of research out of Japan , using a new crystal form of titanium oxide for high - density data storage — promising discs that store 1,000 times more data than Blu-ray does today , up to 25 TB .
The material transforms from a black - colored metal state that conducts electricity into a brown semiconductor when hit by light , at room temperature .
Titanium oxide 's market price is about one - hundredth that of the rare element that is currently used in rewritable Blu-ray discs and DVDs .
The material is cheap and safe , and is already being used in many products ranging from face powder to white paint .
The researchers successfully created the material in particles measuring as small as 5 nanometers in diameter .
[ Update : Some people in the comments are complaining I did n't use metric units in this article .
I 'll assume they 're new to my blog ; I usually do use metric .
However , note the original quote by Steve Jobs is in Imperial units , not metric , so I used those for consistency .
Also , the units do n't matter , since I could have used pixels per hogshead if I felt like it .
What matters is the way the numbers compare to each other , as long as the units are consistent . ]
With much bruhaha , Steve Jobs and Apple revealed the new iPhone 4 yesterday .
Among other features , Jobs said it has higher resolution than older models ; the pixels are smaller , making the display look smoother .
To characterize this , as quoted at Wired.com , he said ,
It turns out there ’s a magic number right around 300 pixels per inch , that when you hold something around to 10 to 12 inches away from your eyes , is the limit of the human retina to differentiate the pixels .
In other words , at 12 inches from the eye , Jobs claims , the pixels on the new iPhone are so small that they exceed your eye 's ability to detect them .
Pictures at that resolution are smooth and continuous , and not pixellated .
However , a display expert has disputed this .
Raymond Soneira of DisplayMate Industries , was quoted both in that Wired article and on PC Mag ( and other sites as well ) saying that the claims by Jobs are something of an exaggeration : " It is reasonably close to being a perfect display , but Steve pushed it a little too far " .
This prompted the Wired article editors to give it the headline " iPhone 4 ’s ‘ Retina ’ Display Claims Are False Marketing " .
As it happens , I know a thing or two about resolution as well , having spent a few years calibrating a camera on board Hubble .
Having looked this over , I disagree with the Wired headline strongly , and mildly disagree with Soneira .
Here 's why .
First , let 's look at resolution * .
I 'll note there is some math here , but it 's all just multiplying and dividing , and I give the answers in the end .
So do n't fret , mathophobes !
If you want the answers , just skip down to the conclusion at the bottom .
I wo n't mind .
But you 'll miss all the fun math and science .
1 ) What is " resolution " , really ?
Imagine you see a vehicle coming toward you on the highway from miles away .
Is it a motorcycle with one headlight , or a car with two ?
As the vehicle approaches , the light splits into two , and you see it 's the headlights from a car .
But when it was miles away , your eye could n't tell if it was one light or two .
That 's because at that distance your eye could n't resolve the two headlights into two distinct sources of light .
The ability to see two sources very close together is called resolution .
It 's measured as an angle , like in degrees .
For example , the Hubble Space Telescope has a resolution of about 0.00003 degrees .
That 's a tiny angle !
I 'm simplifying here a bit , but you can think of this as saying that two stars farther apart than that are seen as two objects ; if they are closer together , even with Hubble they appear as a single object .
Since we measure resolution as an angle , we can translate that into a separation in , say , inches at certain distance .
A 1 - foot ruler at a distance of about 57 feet ( 19 yards ) would appear to be 1 degree across ( about twice the size of the full Moon ) .
If your eyes had a resolution of 1 degree , then the ruler would just appear to you as a dot .
At a given distance , two objects closer together have a smaller angle separating them , making them harder to distinguish from each other .
Note that in the image above , the circles on top are farther apart , with a bigger angle between them ( imagine you are looking at them from the left , where the black lines intersect ) .
At some point , the objects are so close together , and the angle so small , the two merge into one object as far as your eye is concerned .
That 's your resolution limit .
What is the resolution of a human eye , then ?
Well , it varies from person to person , of course .
If you had perfect vision , your resolution would be about 0.6 arcminutes , where there are 60 arcmin to a degree ( for comparison , the full Moon on the sky is about 1/2 a degree or 30 arcmin across ) .
To reuse the ruler example above , and using 0.6 arcmin for the eye 's resolution , the 1 - foot ruler would have to be 5730 feet ( 1.1 miles ) away to appear as a dot to your eye .
Anything closer and you 'd see it as elongated ( what astronomers call " an extended object " ) , and farther away it 's a dot .
In other words , more than that distance and it's unresolved , closer than that and it 's resolved .
This is true for any object : if it 's more than 5730 times its own length away from you , it 's a dot .
A quarter is about an inch across .
If it were more than 5730 inches way , it would look like a dot to your eye .
So you can think of this 5730 number as a scale factor ; multiply an object 's size by that , and , if your vision is perfect ( OOOooooo , foreshadowing ! ) you get how far away you can see it as more than a dot .
2 ) Power to the pixel
So what does all this mean for the iPhone ?
First , here are the claims .
Jobs claims the iPhone held at 12 inches from your face has pixels too small to be resolved by your eye .
Soneira , the display expert quoted in the magazine articles , disputes that .
He uses the 0.6 arcmin resolution for the human eye ( so we use the scale factor = 5730 ) .
Let 's use that and run the numbers .
Something 12 inches away means your eye can resolve dots that are bigger than 12 inches / 5730 = 0.0021 inches
So if the pixels on the iPhone are smaller than 0.0021 inches in size , then Jobs is right .
Your eye wo n't resolve them .
If the pixels are bigger , Soneira is right , and your eye can resolve them .
The actual iPhone 4 has 326 pixels per inch ( the display is 960 pixels high , and about 2.9 inches in length ) .
You have to flip that to get the size of the pixel in inches : 1 / 326 = 0.0031 inches
Uh oh !
Things look bad for Jobs .
The iPhone pixels are too big !
At one foot away , your eye can resolve the pixels , and Jobs must be lying !
Or is he ?
Remember , Soneira used the 0.6 arcmin resolution of the eye , but that 's for perfect eyesight .
Most people do n't have perfect eyesight .
I sure do n't .
A better number for a typical person is more like 1 arcmin resolution , not 0.6 .
In fact , Wikipedia lists 20 / 20 vision as being 1 arcmin , so there you go .
If I use 1 arcminute instead , the scale factor is smaller , about 3438 .
So let 's convert that to inches to see how small a pixel the human eye can resolve at a distance of one foot : 12 inches / 3438 = 0.0035 inches Aha !
This means that to a more average eye , pixels smaller than this are unresolved .
Since the iPhone 's pixels are 0.0031 inches on a side , it works !
Jobs is actually correct .
[ Note : in the articles about all this , they used units of pixels per inch , whereas I 've used the size of the pixels themselves .
You can flip all these numbers to convert .
The iPhone4 has a resolution of 326 ppi ( pixels per inch ) .
Soleira says the eye can resolve 1 / 0.0021 = 477 ppi .
However , normal vision can see at 1 / 0.0035 = 286 ppi .
So the density of pixels in the iPhone 4 is safely higher than can be resolved by the normal eye , but lower than what can be resolved by someone with perfect vision . ]
3 ) So what does all this mean ?
Let me make this clear : if you have perfect eyesight , then at one foot away the iPhone 4's pixels are resolved .
The picture will look pixellated .
If you have average eyesight , the picture will look just fine .
So in a sense , both Jobs and Soneira are correct .
At the very worst , you could claim Jobs exaggerated ; his claim is not true if you have perfect vision .
But for a lot of people , I would even say most people , you 'll never tell the difference .
And if you hold the phone a few inches farther away it 'll look better .
So in my opinion , what Jobs said was fine .
Soneira , while technically correct , was being picky .
So I mildly disagree with him about that .
I had to laugh , though : his dismissing ( near the bottom of the Wired article ) of the Quattro TV 's use of a fourth , yellow , pixel is dead on .
When I first heard of that I knew right away it was a silly claim .
Still , the headline used by Wired.com was clearly incorrect ; Jobs was n't falsely advertising the iPhone 's capabilities at all .
I 'll note that I like Wired magazine quite a bit , and what we have here is most likely just an overzealous editor .
But a lot of people read the headlines and it taints their view ; someone reading that article may be more likely to think Jobs , once again , has overblown a product to excite people .
He did n't .
So , in this case , I hope I 've ... [ wait for it , wait for it ] ... made things clear .
^* " Look at resolution " !
Haha !
Man , I kill me .

Microsoft today warned users of a vulnerability in the 64 - bit versions of Wndows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 that could be used to hijack systems .
The bug is in Windows ' Canonical Display Driver , which blends the operating system 's primary graphics interface , dubbed Graphics Device Interface ( GDI ) , and DirectX to compose the desktop .
According to Jerry Bryant , a group manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center ( MSRC ) , the vulnerability affects any machine with the flashy " Aero " interface , which is the default on all but the least - expensive editions of Windows 7 .
Aero is an optional install on Windows Server 2008 R2 .
" If exploited , it would likely cause the affected system to stop responding and restart , " said Bryant in an entry on the MSRC blog .
" Code execution , while possible in theory , would be very difficult due to memory randomization both in kernel memory and via Address Space Layout Randomization ( ASLR ) . "
However , ASLR , one of the bulwarks of Windows 7's and Vista 's security defenses , has been repeatedly bypassed by researchers , including two who won $ 10,000 cash prizes at the noted Pwn2 Own hacking contest in March .
Microsoft gave the bug an exploitability index rating of " 3 , " the lowest of the company 's three - step scoring system it uses to predict the likelihood of reliable attack code appearing in the next 30 days .
According to that score , Microsoft believes it 's unlikely hackers will come up with an exploit in the coming month .
" We 're currently developing a security update for Windows that will address the vulnerability , " promised Bryant , who did not set a timetable for a patch .
In lieu of a fix , users can disable Aero to protect their machines .
Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by tricking users into visiting a malicious site that hosts a rigged image file , Microsoft 's advisory warned .
But an attack may require more than that seemingly simple tactic , said Andrew Storms , director of security operations at nCircle Security .
" I believe what Microsoft is saying [ in the advisory ] is that the image viewers from Microsoft wo n't trigger the vulnerability , but third - party applications may . "
To disable Aero , users can click Start , select Control Panel , then click on " Appearance and Personalization , " Microsoft said in the advisory .
Under " Personalization , " users would then click " Change the Theme " and then select one of the " Basic and High Contrast Themes . "
Today 's advisory is not the only vulnerability not yet patched by Microsoft .
A flaw in SharePoint Server 2007 was acknowledged by the company late last month , but remains unfixed .
Microsoft 's next security updates are slated for release June 8 .
The company wo n't patch this latest vulnerability that fast , said Storms .
" No way , " he said via instant message when asked what chance Microsoft has to ready a fix in three weeks .
" They are already saying it 's difficult to reproduce , [ so ] it will be a low priority at the moment .
But the info is public , so you can bet it 's getting eyeballs and things can change rapidly . "

Texas red - light cameras soared in 2009 , with cities collecting more than $ 62 million from motorists , newly released state records show .
We 've taken that revenue data to create an interactive visualization that shows how the traffic camera revenue , expenses and profits vary from city to city , along with the proportion of the money that goes to the state .
In all , cities with cameras have collected about $ 100 million in fines of $ 75 to $ 100 since September 2007 , when a law requiring them to share profits with the state went into effect , according the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts .
They 've issued more than 1.2 million citations .
That law , authored by state Sen .
John Carona , R - Dallas , required the agencies to divert some of their profits to a fund for regional trauma hospitals , among other regulations .
So far , they 've sent about $ 25 million to the fund , which helps the hospitals recoup costs from treating indigent patients .
The Legislature only approved spending about $ 13 million so far , according to the Department of State Health Services , which administers the money .
Use the chart to visualize how the cities ' totals compare .
The below example , for instance , compares the money that cities spent on their cameras .
While Houston leads in revenue collected , for instance , the city actually spent $ 3 million less than Dallas — even though it operates more cameras :
As expected , the data shows that Houston , which has more cameras than any other city , has collected more in fines than any of the 53 agencies that have had cameras since 2007 .
Some , such as Lubbock , have removed the cameras because city officials did n't see them as effective .
That 's not the case in Houston , where city officials and police tout the camera program as a cost - effective way to raise awareness of the danger of intersections .
Since 2007 , Houston has collected $ 24 million in total fines , which — after spending $ 8.4 million to operate the cameras — left revenues of $ 15.7 million .
Of that , $ 7.8 million was diverted to the trauma fund , and the rest was spent on traffic safety programs .
Fort Worth and Dallas also top the list , with $ 14 million and $ 3.9 million in fines , respectively .
But several mid-size and suburban cities are among the leading cities in fine revenue , including Arlington ( $ 6.8 million ) , Humble ( $ 4.8 million ) , Plano ( $ 4 million ) and Duncanville ( $ 3.5 million ) .

This article inspired by the excellent 2007 book " Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy " by Mark Diesendorf , which compares the viability of various energy options in Australia .
Dr Diesendorf refers to a 2005 paper by Graham Sinden detailing the characteristics of the UK wind resource potential .
Back to post / website .
View / add comments for this article .
Wind energy is the most cost - effective way Australia can reduce its fossil fuel dependence ... yet the barriers to its implementation are purely political .
Lobby groups from vested interests such as the coal industry have successfully spread misinformation about wind power .
The most potent myth is that wind power is so variable that we would always need coal power plants as " backup " .
As I will show , this is a false claim .
Rather than working alone , all power plants are connected to the electricity grid where stations are turned on and off to match supply with demand .
Even though wind speeds may be low in one area , there will always be wind at another part of the grid .
Importantly , the correlation between wind speeds at two locations decreases as the distance between them rises .
A UK study showed that the power output correlation between two wind farms 200 km apart is 0.6 .
However , the correlation coefficient with 600 km of separation was just 0.25 .
The more wind farms that are connected to the grid , the less variability across the system .
( A perfect correlation between two locations would have a coefficient of 1.0 ) .
In the UK , large - scale drops in wind speed affecting more than 90 % of the country occurs around one hour per year .
Low cost backup generators are operated during these times to balance temporary drops in supply .
International experience shows that large - scale , geographically spread wind power can replace coal as baseload generators .
The same rollout can easily be done in the windy southern states of Australia .
Myths about wind power being intermittent and unreliable are spread innocently ( by people who know no better ) , or maliciously ( by the self - serving , taxpayer subsidised coal industry ) .
It is time to stop believing them and start investigating how wind can help break our fossil fuel habit .
Acusa que hostigaron al equipo de campaña de Yunes en Veracruz
PUEBLA
El grupo delictivo Los Zetas exigió en Veracruz e Hidalgo que detengan las campañas proselitistas del PAN o de lo contrario la integridad de los candidatos estará en riesgo , denunció César Nava , presidente del Comité Ejecutivo Nacional del albiazul , quien llamó a los gobernadores de esas entidades a garantizar una atmósfera de seguridad para los comicios del próximo 4 de julio .
Luego de las agresiones que recibió Miguel Ángel Yunes y su equipo de campaña en Veracruz , el líder panista aseguró que células delictivas inhiben el desarrollo del proceso político en diversos estados y han lanzado diversas amenazas en contra de los candidatos y militantes de su partido .
“ Lamentablemente este es un fenómeno que se está generalizado .
También en Coatzacoalcos , Veracruz , el equipo de avanzada de Yunes fue interceptado por sicarios de Los Zetas y amenazados para que dejaran de hacer campaña ” .
“ Es un común denominador , no tienen nada qué ver con Acción Nacional , pero nos han exigido que paremos las campañas de proselitismo en esos dos estados .
Han dicho expresamente que la única campaña que van a permitir es la del PRI ” , argumentó .
Ante la problemática , el líder panista exigió a las autoridades estatales que actúen con apego a la legalidad al tiempo de cuestionar a Fidel Herrera y a Miguel Angel Osorio Chong cómo es posible que toleren estas acciones .
Hizo hincapié que los narcotraficantes saben dónde y con quiénes invertir .
Como ejemplo de estas acciones de hostigamiento contra los candidatos y simpatizantes de su partido , se refirió a un ataque este viernes en contra el candidato a gobernador Miguel Angel Yunes en Boca del Río , cuando sus colaboradores intentaban colocar pantallas de televisión para presenciar el partido de futbol entre México y Sudáfrica .
Dijo que en Hidalgo , se han vertido amenazas directas emitidas por supuestos Zetas en contra de Xóchitl Gálvez , candidata a la gubernatura por la coalición Hidalgo Nos Une , a cuyos colaboradores les advirtieron que sólo permitirán campañas del PRI .
“ Le pregunto a las autoridades estatales de Veracruz e Hidalgo si van a frenar esta escalada de amenazas y agresiones en contra de los panistas ” .
Llamó a la militancia y simpatizantes del PAN a vigilar las casillas durante la próxima jornada electoral para impedir que se den situaciones anómalas .
César Nava , portando una camiseta negra de la Selección Mexicana , siguió junto a los candidatos de la coalición Compromiso por Puebla , encabezados por Rafael Moreno Valle , el partido de futbol entre México y Sudáfrica .

“ Recent gold price strength has been driven by concern about European sovereign debt , and we expect gold prices to remain strong until this and other debt issues are resolved , ” analyst John Bridges wrote in a note to clients .
Mr. Bridges lifted his price targets across for gold stocks across the board , in some cases by large amounts .
His biggest changes were for Agnico - Eagle Mines Ltd. ( up 25 % to US $ 64.00 a share ) , Goldcorp Inc. ( up 19 % to US $ 51.00 a share ) , and Barrick Gold Corp. ( up 16 % to US $ 57.00 a share ) .
Mr. Bridges sees the most upside potential in Kinross Gold Corp. , which is trading at a whopping 74 % discount to his target of US $ 30.00 a share .
He wrote that Kinross disappointed the market with delays at its Paracatu project in Brazil , but that it continues to look undervalued .

Today the Supreme Court hears arguments in Doe v. Reed .
The case is about " mandatory disclosure " — that is , whether the state of Washington may publicly release the names and addresses of citizens who signed a petition to place a referendum on domestic partnership legislation on the ballot .
The case puts at risk core constitutional values such as free speech and privacy .
And given the stakes , neither the justices nor the public should be swayed by widely held assumptions about mandatory disclosure that are not in fact true ....
First of all , RE 4 is NOT a discharge .
It is a ReEntry code .
This is for military use ONLY .
It simply refers to your eligibility to serve in the United States military .
This code is given for ANY REASON which would make you ineligible from MEDICAL to AGE to PATTERNS OF MISCONDUCT .
Until March 15 , 2009 , you would have been able to join the Army National Guard with an RE 4 from any branch but the Army .
But due to the flock of the recently unemployed joining the ranks , they are currently way over quota and can afford to be very selective .
A civilian employer is not legally supposed to discriminate based on RE - codes .
( In fact , in some states it is illegal to discriminate based on discharges ) .
The military is a completely different way of life .
Some people are not military material , or they get caught up in broken system and labeled as such .
Do not let an RE 4 get you down .
Take it for what it is -- a code for military use .
Since you are no longer associated with the military , forget about it .
An avenue has been closed for you , but let that motivate you to do something else that 's worthwhile .
The military may not want you , but that does n't mean you do n't have a lot to offer someone else .
You 've only failed if you give up .

The number is arbitrary , but 200 games is four seasons of fifty games in the NHL , which is certainly an NHL career .
Though the number seems low for first round picks , to do any sort of analysis , eventually we 'll have to draw an arbitrary line to measure a career player .
My article on Edmonton 's success rate has additional background .
According to the article , of all of the draftees selected from 1990 - 1999 , 19 % of them became career players .
Picks taken in the first - round became a career player 63 % of the time , while 25 % of second - round draft picks became career players .
The author then lumps all players taken in the third round and beyond into one category , and those players became career players 12 % of the time .
I decided to update and expand upon his work by running the same study for the years 1999 through 2005 and breaking out the categories by each of the thirty teams in the league .
I used 1999 because the lockout season of 2004 - 2005 prevented players from accumulating games played , and I used 2005 as an endpoint because many 2006 draftees are still in college or turned pro prior to the 2009 - 2010 season .
I used the same 200 game minimum as a measurement of a career player , but I also cheated a bit and included any players that , barring catastrophic injury , were a surefire bet to make it to 200 games .
There may some disagreement with those handful of players , but overall , they do n't affect the final numbers significantly .
I also lowered the goalie requirement to 100 games , which is essentially a short - career backup .
I counted the player regardless of the team that he actually played the games for , so this is in no way a study on team management or player development organizations , just draft day accomplishments .
Over the course of these seven years , NHL teams drafted 1,958 players .
Thus far , 317 of those draftees have played 200 games or are a sure bet to play 200 games , or 16.2 % overall , three percentage points less than in the 90s , but there is still plenty of time for the players , especially U.S. college players drafted in 2004 and 2005 , to break into the NHL .
Broken into individual rounds , the numbers are very close to the 1990s numbers .
Kids selected in the first round have gone on to become career players 61.1 % of the time as compared to 63 % of the time in the 90s .
Second round picks have yielded career players 24.3 % of the time as compared to 25 % of the time .
In the third round and beyond , 8.7 % of players have had a career in the NHL , compared to 12 % of the time in the 90s , but late round picks take a longer round to the NHL in general , and I 'd expect this number to align with the 90s numbers over the course of the next couple of years .
But how do the individual teams stack up against each other ?
Below is a heat map of the results of the study .
Each column represents the % of total draft choices that became career players in the NHL .
In my version of the heat map , the red is bad , meaning something like " stop drafting so poorly ! " .
The brighter the color , the better the performance .
The most effective overall team at the podium was the Islanders , but looking at their " career players " , I see a number of players that I categorized as " surefire " bets to get to 200 games .
Players like future Selke Trophy winner Frans Nielsen , Blake Comeau , and current Phoenix Coyote Petteri Nokelainen .
If Mattias Weinhandl ever comes back from the KHL , the Islanders ' overall numbers will improve a bit more .
The Islanders were tied for the fifth - most effective team in the first round over this period and they were in the top one - third of the league in the third round and beyond .
The Sabres , Penguins and Canadiens all come in within a percentage point of each other , but all three got to their overall percentages in different ways .
The Sabres were poor in the first round , going four for eight with notable busts Barrett Heisten and Artem Kryukov .
They were slightly above average in the second round and nailed it in the later rounds going seven for forty - seven , and that 14.9 % rate was the second - best in the league .
That late - round success nabbed players like Ryan Miller , Paul Gaustad , Dennis Wideman , and Jan Hejda .
The Penguins went six for seven in the first round over this time period , mostly due to the fact that had a top five pick four different times and landed Ryan Whitney , Marc - Andre Fleury , Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby .
Just for good measure they also drafted Colby Armstrong and Brooks Orpik .
The Pens did an about face in round two , getting a career player one time in nine picks and that one is Alex Goligoski , tagged as a surefire career player .
They found much more success in the later rounds , going for eight for fiftty - five , the third - best later rounds percentage in the league .
The Canadiens were simply strong in all three categories , the only team in the blue in all three categories .
They did this even while going oh - fer in the 1999 draft .
They 've had special success with defenseman , grabbing Ron Hainsey , Mike Komisarek , Mark Streit , and even Ryan O'Byrne has a very good chance of joining this group .
On the flip side there were some absolutely brutal performances on those seven draft days , especially from the Coyotes , the Devils and the Lightning .
The Hurricanes would be lumped in with that group but for their success in the first round - they were five for six in the first round and one for forty - nine with the rest of their picks .
At least they were in the blue in some category , the aforementioned teams were at or near the bottom of the league in all three categories .
The Phoenix Coyotes were seven for sixty overall , fourth - worst in the league over that time span .
They were four for eight in the first round , two for thirteen in the second and only found two career players in forty - four picks in the third round and beyond .
Overall , they missed out on three franchise players over that span - it might explain why the Coyotes missed the playoffs from 2002 through 2008 .
Surprisingly , the New Jersey Devils were third - worst team in the league .
I say surprisingly because typically Lou Lamoriello is full of guile and seems slipperier than a greased eel .
But on draft day , at least for these seven years , Lou 's performance was a mess .
Three for six in the first round , two for thirteen in the second round and hit on only two of his forty - five picks in the later rounds .
Finally , we have the Tampa Bay Lightning .
Want to know why the Lightning bought up so many free agents ?
Look no further than their track record in this time frame .
The Lightning had a total of 75 picks , more than any team except Chicago and managed to draft only four career players .
Four .
The league average would have netted them twelve career players in the same years .
The Lightning had four first - round picks and whiffed on all four .
They had eight picks in the second round and whiffed on all eight .
Zero career players in the first two rounds over a span of seven years .
They were able to find four career players in the later rounds , but even that was below the league average .
One other note of curiosity - the Flyers had zero second - round picks through these seven years .
No , it 's not that they failed to get a career player from the second round , they did n't choose in the second round for seven years .
Bobby Clarke must 've had something against the number two .
Christian Faur is an artist based in Granville , Ohio .
Looking for a new technique , he experimented with painting with wax , but he did n't feel the results were satisfactory .
Then , at Christmas in 2005 , his young daughter opened a box of 120 Crayola crayons he'd bought her , and everything clicked into place .
Faur decided he would create pictures out of the crayons themselves , packing thousands of them together so they become like the colored pixels on a TV screen .
He starts each work by scanning a photo into a computer and breaking the image down into colored blocks
He then draws a grid that shows him exactly where to place each crayon
The finished artworks are packed tightly into wooden frames .
He actually makes the crayons himself , hand - casting each one in a mould .

Gujarat is sometimes called the ' Jurassic Park of India ' Photos : Sanjoy Ghosh
India 's Gujarat state is home to one of the world 's largest collections of dinosaur remains .
The BBC's Soutik Biswas finds out how this is fuelling dinosaur tourism .
About an hour 's drive from busy Ahmedabad city in India 's western Gujarat state is what many call the " Jurassic Park of India " - a nod to Steven Spielberg 's spell - binding dinosaur film .
Balasinor has seen better times : in the days before Independence it was one of a handful of Muslim - dominated princely states in Gujarat .
More than 100 villages made up a cosmopolitan state ruled by a Pathan regent .
Now it is a nondescript district town ringed by farming villages .
The elegant royal palace is still intact , and the family runs luxury accomodation from its premises .
But Balasinor is better known around the world as the site of one of the largest dinosaur egg hatcheries and a host of other fossilised dinosaur remains .
Rush of tourists A sprawling 72 - acre swathe of hills and flatlands studded with fossilised dinosaur remains has begun triggering off what tourism officials in the state call " dinosaur tourism " .
" This place is a gold mine , " says Salauddin Khan Babi , second generation scion of the royal family and a dinosaur enthusiast .
" I get lots of foreign tourist groups who come here to see the dinosaur remains , " says Mr Babi .
Scientists say that the dinosaur site at Balasinor was accidentally discovered when palaeontologists stumbled upon dinosaur bones and fossils during a regular geological survey of this mineral - rich area in the early 1980s .
Rocks with dinosaur footprints have been found at various places
The find sent ripples of excitement through neighbouring villages and many residents picked up fossilised eggs , brought them home and worshipped them .
Since then excavations have thrown up a veritable trove of dinosaur remains - eggs , bones , a skeleton which is now kept in a Calcutta ( Kolkata ) museum - bringing hordes of scientists and tourists to the place .
The crowning find was the remains of what is the only " Indian " dinosaur in the world , fossils of which have been found only in Gujarat along the Narmada river and in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh state .
Researchers aptly named this squat , thick - legged , heavy - bodied carnivorous dinosaur with a crested horn , Rajasaurus narmandensis , or the regal reptile from Narmada .
They say it belongs to the genus - sub-family - of the ferocious carnivore Tyrannosaurus Rex .
Balasinor has also thrown up what scientists say is the fossilised remains of a snake that dined on dinosaur eggs - the 67 million - year - old skeleton was found in a dinosaur nest .
The 3.5 m fossilised snake is believed to have fed on the hatchlings of sauropods .
It was found wrapped around a baby titanosaur .
This is believed to be the first evidence of feeding behaviour in a fossilised primitive snake .
Researchers believe that the snake was attacking a hatchling that had just emerged from the egg .
The event was then overcome by a natural disaster , possibly a storm , and the whole scene was frozen in time .
Commercial potential Sensing the commercial potential of the place , the state - run tourism department has declared the site a " dinosaur park " and is building facilities around it to draw visitors .
" The frenzy is just picking up .
The potential to turn around this place with dinosaur remains as the biggest attraction is enormous , " says Mr Babi .
Piecing together the evidence in Balasinor , researchers now believe that Gujarat is home to one of the largest clutch of dinosaur hatcheries in the world .
At least 13 species of dinosaurs lived here , possibly for more than 100 million years until their extinction some 65 million years ago .
Rajasaurus narmadensis belonged to a family of large carnivorous dinosaurs
They say the dinosaurs lived and thrived on the luxurious vegetation on the flatlands close to the Narmada river in what was then the single landmass of the super - continent Pangaea .
The soft soil made hatching and protecting eggs easier for the animals .
So well - protected are the fossilised eggs found here that many researchers call them the best - preserved eggs in the world after the ones found in Aix - en - Provence in France .
Fossilised remains of dinosaurs have been found in a number of districts in Gujarat , including Panchmahal , Godhra , Sabarkantha and the sprawling Kutch region .
In the Kuar island and the Chapri areas of Kutch , researchers have found dinosaur bones which date back to " roughly 170 to 180 million years " , says geologist and dinosaur researcher Dr ZG Ghevaria .
Fossilisation could have been helped by tectonic upheavals , drifting of sand and silt , movements of rivers and even possible tsunamis , researchers believe .
That is not all .
The remains in Gujarat also offer tantalising clues to the extinction of dinosaurs .
Meteorite ?
Evidence of radioactive iridium , a white radioactive metal commonly found in meteorites , has been found in the Anjar area of Kutch lending weight to a theory that a meteorite crash doomed the animal to extinction .
Balasinor is home to one of the largest dinosaur egg hatcheries in the world " This is the only place in the world where you find evidence of the life and death of the dinosaur .
You find their bones and then you find traces of iridium in separate geological layers , " says Dr Ghevaria .
Outside China , Gujarat is home to most of Asia 's dinosaur hatcheries .
Another dinosaur park , a six - acre leafy facility in the state capital , Gandhinagar , is proof of this .
It is home to one of the largest stored collections of dinosaur remains , including a dinosaur bone marrow - which has become choked with crystals over time .
There are also rocks studded with eggs and foot impressions .
There are realistic fibre - glass models of the various species of dinosaur .
Park chief MK Pandey is optimistic .
" This is not the end , if we excavate more in Gujarat we will get more dinosaur remains .
Dino tourism could become the tourism of the future here .

Greenspan and His Fed Were Wrong 90 % of the Time Bill Bonner
Provided as a courtesy of Agora Publishing & The Daily Reckoning
Apr 14 , 2010 Poor ol ' Alan ...
We almost felt sorry for him .
" Maestro mauled ... " said the headline in The Financial Times .
We wanted to maul him many times .
But now that others were doing it ... it made us feel sympathetic to the old scalawag .
Did n't the Alan Greenspan Fed 's failure to curb subprime lending deserve to go into the ' oops ' category , demanded chief tormentor Phil Angelides .
Mr. Greenspan defended his legacy .
He was right 70 % of the time , he said .
The other 30 % of the time he was wrong .
Hey , that 's not bad .
Pity it 's not true .
Greenspan was wrong 90 % of the time - at least .
He thought those fancy derivatives actually spread the risk of failure ... and made the system more stable .
He thought those subprime loans helped people of modest incomes realize the goal of home ownership .
He saw no risk in keeping the key rate at an ' emergency ' low level ... years after the emergency had passed .
But he hit one of those magic moments last week ... when he was finally right about something .
He declared that the yield on the 10 - year note was " the canary in the coal mine . "
This week , the canary wobbled ... but stayed on his feet .
He 's still standing ... but looking a little peaked .
More below .
While the former Fed chief was in the spotlight at The Financial Times yesterday , the present Fed chief was front - page news over at The Washington Post .
Alan Greenspan is a scoundrel , no doubt about that .
But he was , in some ways , a better Fed chief than Bernanke .
The trouble with Bernanke is that he does n't know his limitations .
He actually believes the Fed can look at the possible outcomes going forward and improve them before they come out .
" Fed chief sounds a deficit warning , " is the headline .
He said Americans faced a " difficult choice . "
It 's between higher taxes and fewer entitlement services , he said .
This does n't seem like a difficult choice to us .
We 'd gladly accept fewer " services " from the feds if they 'd lay off on the taxes .
But that 's because we 're in the half of the US households that actually pays taxes .
No kidding ; the report was in yesterday 's news : " Almost one half of US households pay no federal income tax . "
So , welcome to the beginning of the end .
If half the citizens get bread and circuses without paying for them , you can bet that the whole shebang is headed for destruction .
The math does n't work .
Half the people have no interest in curbing taxes or spending .
Obviously , those people would prefer to raise taxes - on us - rather than give up their free pills and retirement benefits .
Even among the half that does pay taxes , most pay very little - less than they get back in ' services . '
Meanwhile , the ' rich ' get socked hard .
According to the reports we 're seeing on scurrilous blogs and from our usually unreliable sources , the tax burden on the rich is set to rise over 60 % of income - thanks to the health care charges they will have to bear .
By the way ... the whole thing is a fraud .
The services , that is .
Here 's how it works .
In 2007 , the private sector finally blew itself up - thanks largely to all that debt offered by Wall Street and encouraged by the Alan Greenspan / Ben Bernanke Fed .
So then ... in comes the Fed again ... and the US government ... wearing white hats and pretending to save the situation .
How ?
By bringing more of the economy under their control !
As far as we can tell , the last successful government program was WWII .
And that was only successful because the competitors ' programs were also run by government .
But that does n't stop them .
Does anyone seriously think the feds can do a better job ?
These are the people who run the Post Office ... and Amtrak , for Pete 's sake .
Even with monopolies , they can't make money .
Now they 're the majority owners of auto companies , insurance giants and mortgage firms .
Hardly anyone buys a house in America anymore without the help of a government - owned mortgage business .
And soon , you wo n't be able to get a doctor to take your temperature - assuming they still do that - without getting a bureaucrat 's approval .
In theory , the feds take charge of more of the economy , and spend more money , so they are able to keep the GDP from going down .
The feds have been pumping about $ 4 billion per day of deficit spending ( money they did n't collect in taxes ) into the economy .
The bankers say ' thank you very much ' for the business and pay themselves big bonuses .
But this money does n't stimulate the private economy ... it replaces it .
But it replaces it with zombie ' growth . '
The government - driven part of the economy is largely brain - dead .
It is a waste .
What real , positive boost to prosperity comes from someone filling out health care forms for the feds ?
What benefit do we get from tax accountants ?
How about from the ambulance - chasing lawyers ?
( Yesterday , driving to work , we saw an ad in Baltimore 's inner city : " Birth injury ?
Malpractice ?
Workplace injuries ?
You need a lawyer ! " )
How about from any of these multitudes of mid-level bureaucrats ... lobbyists ... handlers ... interveners ... meddlers ... ?
The feds spend money .
But the money is like warm water to a boat hull .
It just stimulates the barnacles .
Gradually , the boat slows ... and sinks .
What can you do ?
Haul it out and scrape the barnacles off !
That 's what Ben Bernanke is proposing .
But wait ... the barnacles vote !
And they make campaign contributions .
But here is Ben Bernanke talking tough .
' If you do n't straighten up , ' he seemed to say , ' you 're going to end up like Greece . '
Wait ... this has a familiar ring to it .
This is the same Ben Bernanke who is holding rates near zero to make it easier for the feds NOT to straighten up .
Like those of his predecessor , Bernanke 's centrally - controlled lending rates are sending out just the wrong signal at just the wrong time .
And like Greenspan , he can get away with it ... for now .
But maybe not for long .
On Monday , US T - note yields ran over 4 % .
" The fun 's over , " said old - timer Richard Russell .
It looked like the end had come for the long bull market in bonds .
Bond yields have been going down since ' 81 .
But they seemed to hit bottom near the end of 2008 .
What we 're seeing now - possibly - is the beginning of the long march in the other direction .
This seemed even more likely because at the end of March the Bernanke Fed lost one of its pumps .
It can no longer buy up the toxic mortgage - backed bonds of Wall Street , thereby giving the banks money to buy US Treasury debt .
Still , on Wednesday , threats of more trouble from Greece sent investors towards US bonds for safety .
" Greece Rescue Not Going According to Plan , " was the headline at Bloomberg .
" Demand strong in US 10 - year Treasury debt sale , " reported The Financial Times .
But by yesterday , it looked like the plan for US debt was not going well either .
" Treasuries decline after $ 13 billion auction of 30 - year bonds , " said another Bloomberg report .
Jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week .
What do you expect ?
This is a Great Correction .
Learn to love it .
" China offers high - speed rail to California , " says The New York Times .
Get used to that too .
Who 's got the money ?
Who 's got the new technology ?
Who 's got the engineers ... the people who actually know how to do something .
Hey China ... let 's make a trade .
We 'll give you 1 million lawyers for 100,000 engineers .
Or , how about 20,000 lobbyists for one good metallurgist ?
Heck ... we 'll throw in 535 members of Congress .
Hold the Congressmen ?
Okay ... guess we 're stuck with them .

MEXICO CITY ( AP ) — After 40 years , the United States ' war on drugs has cost $ 1 trillion and hundreds of thousands of lives , and for what ?
Drug use is rampant and violence even more brutal and widespread .
Even U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske concedes the strategy has n't worked .
" In the grand scheme , it has not been successful , " Kerlikowske told The Associated Press .
" Forty years later , the concern about drugs and drug problems is , if anything , magnified , intensified . "
This week President Obama promised to " reduce drug use and the great damage it causes " with a new national policy that he said treats drug use more as a public health issue and focuses on prevention and treatment .
Nevertheless , his administration has increased spending on interdiction and law enforcement to record levels both in dollars and in percentage terms ; this year , they account for $ 10 billion of his $ 15.5 billion drug - control budget .
Kerlikowske , who coordinates all federal anti-drug policies , says it will take time for the spending to match the rhetoric .
" Nothing happens overnight , " he said .
" We 've never worked the drug problem holistically .
We 'll arrest the drug dealer , but we leave the addiction . "
His predecessor , John P. Walters , takes issue with that .
Walters insists society would be far worse today if there had been no War on Drugs .
Drug abuse peaked nationally in 1979 and , despite fluctuations , remains below those levels , he says .
Judging the drug war is complicated : Records indicate marijuana and prescription drug abuse are climbing , while cocaine use is way down .
Seizures are up , but so is availability .
" To say that all the things that have been done in the war on drugs have n't made any difference is ridiculous , " Walters said .
" It destroys everything we 've done .
It 's saying all the people involved in law enforcment , treatment and prevention have been wasting their time .
It 's saying all these people 's work is misguided . "

In 1970 , hippies were smoking pot and dropping acid .
Soldiers were coming home from Vietnam hooked on heroin .
Embattled President Richard M. Nixon seized on a new war he thought he could win .
" This nation faces a major crisis in terms of the increasing use of drugs , particularly among our young people , " Nixon said as he signed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act .
The following year , he said : " Public enemy No. 1 in the United States is drug abuse .
In order to fight and defeat this enemy , it is necessary to wage a new , all - out offensive . "
His first drug - fighting budget was $ 100 million .
Now it 's $ 15.1 billion , 31 times Nixon 's amount even when adjusted for inflation .
Using Freedom of Information
Act requests , archival records , federal budgets and dozens of interviews with leaders and analysts , the AP tracked where that money went , and found that the United States repeatedly increased budgets for programs that did little to stop the flow of drugs .
In 40 years , taxpayers spent more than :
— $ 20 billion to fight the drug gangs in their home countries .
In Colombia , for example , the United States spent more than $ 6 billion , while coca cultivation increased and trafficking moved to Mexico — and the violence along with it .
— $ 33 billion in marketing " Just Say No" - style messages to America 's youth and other prevention programs .
High school students report the same rates of illegal drug use as they did in 1970 , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says drug overdoses have " risen steadily " since the early 1970s to more than 20,000 last year .
— $ 49 billion for law enforcement along America 's borders to cut off the flow of illegal drugs .
This year , 25 million Americans will snort , swallow , inject and smoke illicit drugs , about 10 million more than in 1970 , with the bulk of those drugs imported from Mexico .
— $ 121 billion to arrest more than 37 million nonviolent drug offenders , about 10 million of them for possession of marijuana .
Studies show that jail time tends to increase drug abuse .
— $ 450 billion to lock those people up in federal prisons alone .
Last year , half of all federal prisoners in the U.S. were serving sentences for drug offenses .
At the same time , drug abuse is costing the nation in other ways .
The Justice Department estimates the consequences of drug abuse — " an overburdened justice system , a strained health care system , lost productivity , and environmental destruction " — cost the United States $ 215 billion a year .
Harvard University economist Jeffrey Miron says the only sure thing taxpayers get for more spending on police and soldiers is more homicides .
" Current policy is not having an effect of reducing drug use , " Miron said , " but it 's costing the public a fortune . "
___
From the beginning , lawmakers debated fiercely whether law enforcement — no matter how well funded and well trained — could ever defeat the drug problem .
Then - Alaska Sen . Mike Gravel , who had his doubts , has since watched his worst fears come to pass .
" Look what happened .
It 's an ongoing tragedy that has cost us a trillion dollars .
It has loaded our jails and it has destabilized countries like Mexico and Colombia , " he said .
In 1970 , proponents said beefed - up law enforcement could effectively seal the southern U.S. border and stop drugs from coming in .
Since then , the U.S. used patrols , checkpoints , sniffer dogs , cameras , motion detectors , heat sensors , drone aircraft — and even put up more than 1,000 miles of steel beam , concrete walls and heavy mesh stretching from California to Texas .
None of that has stopped the drugs .
The Office of National Drug Control Policy says about 330 tons of cocaine , 20 tons of heroin and 110 tons of methamphetamine are sold in the United States every year — almost all of it brought in across the borders .
Even more marijuana is sold , but it's hard to know how much of that is grown domestically , including vast fields run by Mexican drug cartels in U.S. national parks .
The dealers who are caught have overwhelmed justice systems in the United States and elsewhere .
U.S. prosecutors declined to file charges in 7,482 drug cases last year , most because they simply did n't have the time .
That 's about one out of every four drug cases .
The United States has in recent years rounded up thousands of suspected associates of Mexican drug gangs , then turned some of the cases over to local prosecutors who can't make the charges stick for lack of evidence .
The suspects are then sometimes released , deported or acquitted .
The U.S. Justice Department does n't even keep track of what happens to all of them .
In Mexico , traffickers exploit a broken justice system .
Investigators often fail to collect convincing evidence — and are sometimes assassinated when they do .
Confessions are beaten out of suspects by frustrated , underpaid police .
Judges who no longer turn a blind eye to such abuse release the suspects in exasperation .
In prison , in the U.S. or Mexico , traffickers continue to operate , ordering assassinations and arranging distribution of their product even from solitary confinement in Texas and California .
In Mexico , prisoners can sometimes even buy their way out .
The violence spans Mexico .
In Ciudad Juarez , the epicenter of drug violence in Mexico , 2,600 people were killed last year in cartel - related violence , making the city of 1 million across the Rio Grande from El Paso , Texas , one of the world 's deadliest .
Not a single person was prosecuted for homicide related to organized crime .
And then there 's the money .
The $ 320 billion annual global drug industry now accounts for 1 percent of all commerce on the planet .
A full 10 percent of Mexico 's economy is built on drug proceeds — $ 25 billion smuggled in from the United States every year , of which 25 cents of each $ 100 smuggled is seized at the border .
Thus there 's no incentive for the kind of financial reform that could tame the cartels .
" For every drug dealer you put in jail or kill , there 's a line up to replace him because the money is just so good , " says Walter McCay , who heads the nonprofit Center for Professional Police Certification in Mexico City .
McCay is one of the 13,000 members of Medford , Mass . - based Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , a group of cops , judges , prosecutors , prison wardens and others who want to legalize and regulate all drugs .
A decade ago , no politician who wanted to keep his job would breathe a word about legalization , but a consensus is growing across the country that at least marijuana will someday be regulated and sold like tobacco and alcohol .
California voters decide in November whether to legalize marijuana , and South Dakota will vote this fall on whether to allow medical uses of marijuana , already permitted in California and 13 other states .
The Obama administration says it wo n't target marijuana dispensaries if they comply with state laws .
___
Mexican President Felipe Calderon says if America wants to fix the drug problem , it needs to do something about Americans ' unquenching thirst for illegal drugs .
Kerlikowske agrees , and Obama has committed to doing just that .
And yet both countries continue to spend the bulk of their drug budgets on law enforcement rather than treatment and prevention .
" President Obama 's newly released drug war budget is essentially the same as Bush 's , with roughly twice as much money going to the criminal justice system as to treatment and prevention , " said Bill Piper , director of national affairs for the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance .
" This despite Obama 's statements on the campaign trail that drug use should be treated as a health issue , not a criminal justice issue . "
Obama is requesting a record $ 15.5 billion for the drug war for 2011 , about two thirds of it for law enforcement at the front lines of the battle : police , military and border patrol agents struggling to seize drugs and arrest traffickers and users .
About $ 5.6 billion would be spent on prevention and treatment .
" For the first time ever , the nation has before it an administration that views the drug issue first and foremost through the lens of the public health mandate , " said economist and drug policy expert John Carnevale , who served three administrations and four drug czars .
" Yet ... it appears that this historic policy stride has some problems with its supporting budget . "
Carnevale said the administration continues to substantially over - allocate funds to areas that research shows are least effective — interdiction and source - country programs — while under - allocating funds for treatment and prevention .
Kerlikowske , who wishes people would stop calling it a " war " on drugs , frequently talks about one of the most valuable tools they 've found , in which doctors screen for drug abuse during routine medical examinations .
That program would get a mere $ 7.2 million under Obama 's budget .
" People will say that 's not enough .
They 'll say the drug budget has n't shifted as much as it should have , and granted I do n't disagree with that , " Kerlikowske said .
" We would like to do more in that direction . "
Fifteen years ago , when the government began telling doctors to ask their patients about their drug use during routine medical exams , it described the program as one of the most proven ways to intervene early with would - be addicts .
" Nothing happens overnight , " Kerlikowske said .

Until 100 years ago , drugs were simply a commodity .
Then Western cultural shifts made them immoral and deviant , according to London School of Economics professor Fernanda Mena .
Religious movements led the crusades against drugs :
In 1904 , an Episcopal bishop returning from a mission in the Far East argued for banning opium after observing " the natives ' moral degeneration . "
In 1914 , The New York Times reported that cocaine caused blacks to commit " violent crimes , " and that it made them resistant to police bullets .
In the decades that followed , Mena said , drugs became synonymous with evil .
Nixon drew on those emotions when he pressed for his War on Drugs .
" Narcotics addiction is a problem which afflicts both the body and the soul of America , " he said in a special 1971 message to Congress .
" It comes quietly into homes and destroys children , it moves into neighborhoods and breaks the fiber of community which makes neighbors .
We must try to better understand the confusion and disillusion and despair that bring people , particularly young people , to the use of narcotics and dangerous drugs . "
Just a few years later , a young Barack Obama was one of those young users , a teenager smoking pot and trying " a little blow when you could afford it , " as he wrote in " Dreams From My Father . "
When asked during his campaign if he had inhaled the pot , he replied : " That was the point . "
So why persist with costly programs that do n't work ?
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , sitting down with the AP at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City , paused for a moment at the question .
" Look , " she says , starting slowly .
" This is something that is worth fighting for because drug addiction is about fighting for somebody 's life , a young child 's life , a teenager 's life , their ability to be a successful and productive adult .
" If you think about it in those terms , that they are fighting for lives — and in Mexico they are literally fighting for lives as well from the violence standpoint — you realize the stakes are too high to let go . "
Earlier in the month , Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) announced the beginning of its campaign to end child labour in US agriculture .
The campaign , among other things , calls for the " same age and hour requirements to children working in agriculture that already apply to all other working children " and for the government to " strengthen provisions regarding children 's exposure to pesticides " .
HRW 's campaign begins just as anti-immigrant action in the US has heated up .
Arizona recently passed the draconian SB 1070 legislation that requires local police to check the immigration status of anybody they have a " reasonable " suspicion of being undocumented .
Arizona also outlawed ethnic studies classes shortly thereafter and is forbidding teachers with heavy accents from teaching English .
Most of these actions ( and subsequent actions in other states ) are being justified based on the state of labour in the US .
That is , undocumented workers are " stealing " the jobs of citizens and as such , we need to come down particularly hard on any who might be undocumented .
The Southern Poverty Law Centre ( an organisation that monitors hate groups ) , has done an excellent job in documenting how labour gets centred in the immigration debate :
" [ The Coalition for the Future American Worker ] ran an ad featuring a couple sitting at a kitchen table with a baby crying in the background .
The husband tells his wife that he failed to get a job because ' they hired all foreign workers ' .
During a 2004
Texas congressional race , it ran television ads that included images of dark - skinned men loitering on street corners and running from police cars . "
But the HRW campaign exposes a conflict between how immigration and labour is represented – and what it is in reality .
HRW estimates that at least 9 % of farm workers are children , and this number may be significantly higher .
What this means is that a very big percentage of the actual people doing the " stealing " are kids rather than grown men , and those kids , more often than not , may actually be citizens , having been born in the US after their parents immigrated .
Unfortunately , the false representation of adult male labourers " stealing " jobs of citizens is becoming more mainstream , with the result being that consumers are largely ignorant of the immensity of the problem , or oddly , they even regard child labour as a good thing .
Drawing on a mythical past where youth spent their summers on family farms working for a little spending money , the argument is that what was good for grandparents then is good for children today .
It " builds strength of character " and teaches good lessons .
The problem here is that there is a significant difference between an agricultural industrial farm and a family owned farm .
Most farms in the US today are owned by massive corporations that use tools , heavy machinery and engage in extensive pesticide spraying .
Child labourers ( who are often as young as seven or eight ) working on these industrial farms can expect to work 14 - 16 hours a day , seven days a week .
Lunch breaks are often only a half hour and as with most farm workers , bathrooms and even clean water to drink are rarely supplied by the growers .
Federal minimum wage is $ 7.50 an hour , but because farm workers are paid by the bucket rather than by the hour , their wages often average out to as low as $ 2.38 an hour .
For children , payment for labour presents a unique problem .
Because children are often too young to collect their own pay , parents are paid instead .
While it may not necessarily be a bad thing for kids to give their earnings to parents to help with bills , it does seem ironic at best that children are working full - time jobs but because they are not officially on the books , they are not eligible for worker 's compensation should they get sick or hurt , unemployment benefits during any period they are n't working , nor are they even getting credit for paying into social security .
If we have no problem " teaching " kids the benefits of working full time , then should n't we also be teaching them what rights they have as workers ?
When I first read HRW 's stance against child labour violations , I did not feel that the campaign went far enough to protect children .
But given the context of the US political atmosphere in which the campaign was announced , I think it 's a beneficial campaign if only for the education and worker testimony it provides to consumers who are being bombarded by messages that simply do n't reflect reality .
Whether this campaign will gain any meaningful momentum towards achieving the goals it calls for , however , remains to be seen .
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said Monday that the federal government can keep " sexually dangerous " prisoners in custody past the completion of their sentences , overruling arguments that only states hold such power .
The vote was 7 - 2 , with Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in dissent .
More than 20 states have laws permitting " civil ...
Over a year ago we got a chance to read about the “ graphic gay sex scene ” in I Love You Phillip Morris , the gay con caper starring Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor that ’s been denied a U.S. release date yet again .
But , what ’s this , the scene has surfaced ?
Of course it has .
This is the Internet , after all , and Morris has already premiered in other countries .
The blog LA Rag Mag tipped us off the scene was out there , but did n’t provide an embeddable clip , so we went out and got one .
It ’s not as graphic as we thought it would be , but it ’s still probably NSFW , and will shock staid American audiences .
Update : EuropaCorp has requested the clip be removed , but it ’s still online all over the place .
Due to Hail , I found myself away from kernel full - time and thrown into the userland .
I am giving a good look to it , and I have to say , it 's damn comfortable .
I especially like the interpretive languages like JavaScript .
After 17 years of C programming , I 'm somewhat sick of it .
Also , the dazzling array of tools like debuggers , profilers , not counting the esoterics like Valgrind .
Even simplest things , like the ability to run as many instances of my program as I want .
For kernel we need virtual machines to do that .
For userland , kernel is all the virtual machine I need .
The userland programmer 's life is like the Russian proverb about a cheese who 's rolling in butter .
There are some downsides , too .
The main one is that I face a mountain of shit code sky - high , and learn to deal with it .
It may be not apparent , but the kernel continuously reinvents or reinvigorates itself by rewriting .
Userland hackers try it too , but their density over the code is smaller ( maybe much smaller ) .
X11 has Keith , Ajax , and ...?
GNOME maybe a dozen , if that .
And kernel has hundreds .
Just the first layer under Linus is more populous than most big projects except perhaps Mozilla .
At least this is the impression I 'm getting so far .
The end result is that I have to focus on better code without the cues I have in kernel .
Berkely DB is shit , is Tokyo Cabinet better ?
Or maybe Bitcask ?
It 's more frustrating than replacing IDE with libata .
Still I 'm enjoying it .
When I published Election Attitude – How Internet Voting Leads to a Stronger Democracy in 2016 , I thought Internet mobile voting could be in place by 2018 in a number of counties around the country and then ready for widespread use by 2020 .
How wrong I was !
The momentum against the idea gained strength as media coverage of Russian meddling caused fear among secretaries of state and election officials .
The nail in the coffin , for now , was the incredibly incompetent use of technology by the Democrat party in Iowa .
This article is not another plea from John about the virtues of mobile voting .
Instead , the focus here is about the huge push for Vote by Mail .
I would like to make two macro points before I get into some specifics .
First , the founding fathers made it very clear in the Constitution , Section 1 , Article 4 the States have the ball when it comes to managing their election processes .
In theory , the Federal government could overrule and take over voting , but I believe turning voting into a National process is politically impossible .
The result is the country will have to live with a hodgepodge of voter registration and voting procedures .
With a paper based system , this is going to cause problems in November as I will describe shortly .
The second point is the matter of “ comparison ” .
Political and computer science pundits compare Internet voting to a perfect system of perfect computers , perfect networks , no hacking , no malware , etc .
The perfect system will never ever exist .
I would like to see us compare Internet voting to the paper based system which is expanding .
That is the subject of this article .
Problems at the Polling Places
In some cases , availability of convenient polling places is a problem .
Election officials in Arizona in 2016 reduced the number of polling sites as part of a purported budgetary necessity .
The 70 % reduction in polling places from 200 in 2012 to 60 in 2016 resulted in one polling place per 21,000 voters .
Hundreds of thousands of voters appearing for the March 22 primaries were confused , inconvenienced , and outraged at the excessive wait times .
Many Arizonans left the polls in disgust .
Others waited as much as five hours .
Arizona was not alone in reducing the number of polling places .
Rhode Island opened only 144 of the state ’s 419 polling places for the April 2016 primary .
Open government advocate John Marion of Common Cause Rhode Island said , “ Voters could be confused because their polling place may have changed from what it was the last time they voted . ”
In Brooklyn , New York , there was a range of complaints during the April , 2016 primary .
Faulty ballot scanners caused continuing interruptions and delays .
Inadequate staffing at polling sites and poll workers failing to open up sites on time prevented some people from voting because the voters could not wait .
Many voters reported their names were mysteriously missing from the voter rolls , so they were not allowed to vote .
The New York City Board of Elections confirmed more than 125,000 Democratic voters in Brooklyn were removed from the rolls .
Voters complained there were numerous errors caused by the purging of entire buildings and blocks of voters .
The Brooklyn Board of Elections Executive Committee voted to suspend their Chief Clerk without pay pending an internal investigation .
Crazy things happen at polling places .
Fights have broken out in the lines .
Inexperienced poll workers have given bad advice and turned people away .
Although trying to help confused voters , the poll workers could not avoid seeing how some people voted causing angst on both sides .
One might say the solution to the polling place problems is to move to Vote by Mail .
Pushed along by the pandemic , the idea has gone from tempting to mandatory in the minds of many .
However , let us consider some realities of paper ballots we do n’t hear much about .
Problems with Ballots
During the March 15 , 2016 primaries in Florida , the hanging chad problem was resolved , but other problems with ballots persist and new ones arose .
According to the Supervisor of Elections Office , the voters in one precinct in Flagler County were given the wrong ballots , resulting in about 30 people who voted for the wrong county commissioner candidates .
The county election was not impacted and there was no effect on the Presidential race , but errors in handling paper ballots are significant .
In Orange County , Florida , during the 2016 primary , about a dozen of the 251 precincts ran out of ballots .
As early as 9 a.m. , the Pinecastle Masonic Lodge and several additional precincts ran out of both Democrat and Republican ballots .
At some precincts , the order to print more ballots was incorrect .
Instead of printing more Presidential ballots , more city ballots were printed .
Voters were told to come back later .
More than a dozen citizens protested outside the Orange County Supervisor of Elections Office .
The Supervisor had absentee ballots printed and hand - delivered to voters ’ homes or at workplaces later in the day .
Also , several polling places in Orange County had problems verifying voter registration .
The tablet computers used to swipe a voter ’s driver license had technical problems .
These locations had to request delivery of printed registration books from the archives .
In Polk County , Florida , a precinct poll worker could n’t find the Democratic primary ballots .
When the worker opened the polling place , the volunteer only handed out the Republican ballots and told Democrats they could n’t get a ballot .
Voters called the Supervisor of Elections Office , which told the poll worker where to find the ballots .
In another case , ballots were loaded on a truck for delivery .
The driver got lost .
These are a few examples of ballot problems which happened in many states during the 2016 Presidential primary .
Ballot Complexity
Polling place or mail in , the current voting methods can be subject to error because they depend on a certain level of a person ’s knowledge of the voting process .
Some ballots are not well designed and can be confusing .
Some ballots require a simple choice : vote for A or vote for B .
The design of some other ballots is not so straightforward .
In Voting Technology : The Not -So - Simple Act of Casting a Ballot ( 2009 ) , Paul Herrnson , Richard Niemi , and Michael Hanmer reported on their research into the complexities of voting .
The authors described election ballots as having curiosities and inconsistencies in their format .
Ballot instructions , candidate and party listings , party symbols , and , in general , variations that result from a complex and highly decentralized election system provide ample opportunity for all but the most sophisticated voters to misunderstand , mismark , or spoil their ballots and for all voters to feel confused and frustrated .
The authors cited the enormous disparity in ballot designs across the states and to individual state designs inconsistent and needlessly complex .
The most famous example of ballot complexity is the butterfly ballot problem in Florida in 2000 when 19,235 people voted for both Bush and Gore .
None of those votes counted .
It was 4 % of Palm Beach County votes .
There are many other examples .
Most recently , in the North Carolina primary , the selection of a senatorial candidate was placed below the ballot instructions at the bottom of page .
Thousands of voters did not notice and did not make a choice .
More lost votes .
Early Voting
Many states provide a method for eligible voters to cast a ballot prior to Election Day .
These early votes may occur during a defined early voting period or by requesting an absentee ballot .
Colorado , Oregon , and Washington have been using Vote by Mail for a long time and have enjoyed increased voter turnout as a result .
However , there are problems .
On Super Tuesday , four million people in California voted early .
I do n’t know the exact number but it is safe to say a significant number may have voted for Klobuchar , Steyer , or Mayor Pete .
All three dropped out of the race before Super Tuesday .
More votes thrown away .
The other problem is , because of Covid - 19 fears , many more states are being pushed to Vote by Mail .
They will be deluged with envelopes .
Budget cuts will likely reduce staff .
Votes will not be counted timely .
Forget about staying up late on November 3 to see who won .
It will take days for the counting .
Mistakes will be made .
Recounts may be justified and stretch out timelines even further .
It is logical to expect when 100 million ballots get dumped into the system there will be human errors .
A survey discovered voting on Election Day has been the most popular form of voting with 60.6 % of voters casting a regular ballot in person .
Others voted by domestic absentee ballot ( 17.5 % ) ; by early voting before Election Day ( 10.7 % ) ; and by mail voting ( 7.6 % ) .
These numbers will surely change for November .
The problems with overseas voting for six million people remain .
Soldiers and ex-pats have been conditioned to ballots not getting to the polling place on time and , if they do , they may not get counted unless there is a tie .
So why bother voting ?
West Virginia conducted pilot mobile voting for overseas military .
It was quite successful but was subsequently criticized , unfairly in my opinion , as being insecure .
There were no problems with the voting and voter satisfaction and participation were excellent .
Mail Votes Lost or Not Counted
Some people lose their ballot or mail it too late for it to be counted .
The pipeline from deciding to vote to having a vote actually counted can be long and frustrating .
Charles Stewart III , the Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political Science at MIT , studied the question of whether voting by mail causes more lost votes , compared to in - person voting .
In a published study , “ Losing Votes by Mail ” , Stewart concluded , “ The number of lost votes through the Vote By Mail system in 2008 may have been as large as 7.6 million . ”
The number represents approximately one in five citizens who attempted to vote by mail .
These votes include voters at home and abroad .
The 7.6 million lost votes included 3.9 million absentee ballots requested but never received , 2.9 million ballots received but not returned , and .8 million returned but not counted .
The ballots received but not returned can be due to a ballot lost in the mail or the voter deciding to vote at the polls or not vote at all .
Votes returned but not counted can be a result of numerous kinds of errors .
Typical errors include the ballot envelope not being signed , the name not matching the voter registration list , failure to provide the voter ’s address , missing or bad signatures , no witness signature ( if required ) , no ballot application on record , missed deadline , already voted in person , or the voter had died .
The President recently said a state had sent every voter a ballot in the mail .
That was not true .
The state had sent an application for an absentee ballot .
The time allotted to sending the application , the voter sending it back , the state sending them a ballot , and then the ballot being returned all on the backs of USPS .
It is likely all will not make the due date to be counted .
Voter Fraud
The purported frequency and extent of voter fraud is a highly controversial issue .
There can be no question there is a perception of voter fraud .
Vivid stories have been passed through generations .
One of the most famous is a reported quote from Earl Long ( 1895 - 1960 ) , Governor of Louisiana .
“ When I die , if I die , I want to be buried in Louisiana , so I can stay active in politics . ”
Losing candidates often contribute to the lore .
The facts however , do not demonstrate voter fraud .
In 2012 , Loyola law professor Justin Levitt estimated , “ Over the previous twelve years , the voting fraud rate was 0.000002 % . ”
He found only nine instances of specific allegations of voter fraud out of approximately 400 million voters .
Voter fraud was used as the reason for Governor Scott Walker ’s determination to make the special voter ID requirements in Wisconsin more stringent and difficult .
Even though a 2014 study at Marquette University found 39 percent of voters from a Wisconsin state - wide poll believed voter fraud affected a few thousand votes at each election , no claims of voter fraud were substantiated .
Some politicians have alleged voter fraud is rampant and is jeopardizing the integrity of American elections and democracy .
The allegations claim elections are being stolen by unscrupulous registration activists , vote buyers , and illegal immigrants voting .
Despite a history of stories about fraud , in my research for Election Attitude , I found no contemporary charges voter fraud is rampant .
In The Myth of Voter Fraud , Lorraine C. Minnite describes the results of her research to find evidence of voter fraud .
She contended that while voting irregularities created by our complex and fragmented electoral process in the United States are common , intentional voter fraud is quite rare .
Minnite examined public records obtained from all fifty state governments and the U.S. Department of Justice .
She concluded , “ Voter fraud is in reality a politically constructed myth intended to further complicate the voting process and reduce voter turnout . ”
Although legally fraud , a problem with Vote by Mail is coercion .
Helpful agents may visit a nursing home and offer to “ help ” people vote .
A spouse may handle two votes for the family .
There could be a lot of “ helpful ” persons involved but unseen in the election process .
Special ballot mailboxes placed next to USPS mailboxes in certain neighborhoods could be transplanted from a pickup truck to a trash dumpster .
Weather
Regardless of the expansion of Vote by Mail , millions of people will go to the polls despite the weather and possible need for masks .
Even with an adequate number of polling places and a sufficient quantity of the correct kind of ballots on hand , other problems can affect voter participation .
Long lines in bad weather can dissuade voters , especially the elderly or people with special needs , from voting .
Some polling places make voters wait outside since they can only accommodate a small number of voters inside .
This will be exacerbated by social distancing .
A friend told me her sister in Wisconsin waited outside in 40 degree weather and high winds for an hour and 45 minutes to vote in 2016 .
Her son in Florida had to wait outside five hours in the sun .
Work schedules can make it impossible for some workers to get adequate time to drive in bad weather to and from the voting location .
Inadequate , convenient parking can prevent some people from voting particularly in hazardous weather .
In some polling places , there is insufficient , designated handicapped parking .
People with Special Needs
Some voters may be ill and homebound on Election Day .
Other voters may not try to vote because disabilities may impose physical limitations in using the voting equipment .
There are at least 35 million voting - age people with disabilities in the United States , representing 1 out of 7 voting - age people .
This number is likely to grow with the aging of the population .
People with disabilities have lower voter turnout than people without disabilities .
Lisa Schur , Associate Professor at Rutgers University , said , “ Twelve surveys covering the 1992 - 2004 elections , using varying samples and definitions of disability , found eligible citizens with disabilities were between 4 and 21 percent less likely to vote than eligible citizens without disabilities . ”
The lower voter turnout among people with disabilities appears to be caused in part by their greater likelihood of experiencing voting difficulties , including with Vote by Mail .
Conclusion
The problems with existing voting systems are challenging .
The Federal Government provided funding for new voting machines in 2002 , but did not provide funding to maintain or replace them when they became out dated .
Unfortunately , the machines are at the end of their life cycle , in fact at a crisis , and have not been replaced .
One alternative to resolve the problem is to patch the existing system of antiquated machines .
Another alternative is to embrace an election attitude .
An election attitude offers a practical approach to voting .
A key component of the new attitude is Internet voting .
It uses mobile devices and the Internet to enable citizens to vote from the comfort and privacy of their home or at a local library .
Though the risks of Internet voting are real and cannot be ignored , there are numerous benefits to adopting Internet voting .
With Internet voting it can replicate successful web services such as Amazon which is used by millions of people daily .
If voting online could reach the level of adoption of e-commerce , it would be possible for voter participation to increase significantly .
With a changed focus , increased funding , changes in election registration and security , and increased access for people with special needs , I believe the voter participation rate would be greatly improved .
I urge all of us to compare our fears of the Internet with the challenges of the paper based system we have today .

“ Onto the Ocean or Death ! ”
If you have read my bio since I have come to start writing for the Center for a Stateless Society you will have noticed that I am interning in Washington , DC this summer at a libertarian organization .
The 2010 crop of interns in my group recently arrived in Virginia for a weeklong opening seminar , which has been focusing primarily on public goods theories , efforts for libertarian reform through the American legal system , rights theories and applications , Hayekian spontaneous order , as well as other topics .
This group of about 80 interns is a solid mix of anarchists and minarchists .
These conflicting philosophies have been responsible for many stimulating and compelling debates so far .
However , I did have one that disturbed me .
On the first day we had a lecture which provided an introduction to the philosophies grouped under the libertarian umbrella .
After the lecture we had an opportunity to rise and bring up an observation or question .
I raised my hand and argued that one of the most compelling arguments against the state is that statists unjustly claim land arbitrarily and that their claims are not based on any rational principle besides might makes right .
I received what can be deemed a ‘ nationalistic geoist ’ response which intrigued me , especially so because it emanated from amongst this massively libertarian crew .
The gentleman proffered that in a democratic society the citizens are actually the state , and thus all land within the bounds of any nation state is the property of that state , and thus , of the collective citizens .
In effect , this is a collectivist version of the English common law principle from the era of feudalism dubbed fee simple absolute , which is still active in American law to some extent .
All British land under fee simple absolute was the property of the king , which he rented to those deemed politically valuable , namely , the nobles , and thus some property rights trickled down the British political economic pecking order .
In typing this I cannot help but draw the comparison from my hours of absorbing The Sopranos and observing the capos kick up their weekly tribute to Tony .
Since we were in a large group setting and I did n’t necessarily want to hog the conversation , I allowed the point and spoke with him directly later in the week .
With the nationalistic geoist argument , there are a few major problems that I observe , and I was sure to mention them during our conversation :
Why is only land subject to being the property of the state / the collective and not tangible removable property , and what of the people , as well as their bodies , which reside within the state ’s bounds ?
Since the borders of states are not bound by any principle such as homesteading or occupancy and use , they are only effectively limited by the amount of military force countries can muster and their willingness to forcefully assume ownership .
See my previous article , “ Dibs ! ” : Lebensraum and Social Contracts , ” for more on this argument .
If the borders are indeed arbitrary and determined only by violence , it seems far more sensible to endorse one single world or universal government rather than a plethora of localized states .
If one accepts the geoist argument as valid , it renders all libertarianism virtually impossible .
The logical conclusion of this philosophy is the systematic oppression and assumed ownership of every inhabitant by the government , which is essentially the arbitrarily defined territorial majority .
All arguments for rights aside and speaking from a purely consequentialist standpoint , this is absolutely terrifying .
Needless to say , I usually become a little frustrated with the idea that I am consenting to the aggression all citizens and inhabitants of states are the victims of by currently remaining under the rule of any government , as if one can choose no government instead of which government one wants to be ruled by .
This always struck me as a sort of perverse ‘ blame - the - victim ’ mentality .
This week I ’ve also had the argument presented to me that without statist political organization economies of scale would fail to develop and I would be doomed to inescapable poverty .
This is clearly a false dichotomy and an example of the tired assumption that homesteaders and secessionists want to be bearded mountain hermits and spurn civilization .
I enjoy big cities quite a bit .
I ’ve lived in them previously , currently live in one , and have enjoyed my travels to many of them around the world .
I am not aware of too many advocates of stateless society who seek less interaction between individuals and communities , as they mainly stress the abolition of the systemic , legitimized , and institutionalized initiation of force .
Even if one concedes that one would be hopelessly impoverished with statelessness , the rest of the argument that follows is a non sequitur : ‘ it is thus acceptable to coerce peaceful people to develop economies of scale . ’
This claim is generalized as , ‘ it is morally permissible to use violence for economic gain . ’
If you consider yourself a libertarian , halt !
This argument is overtly criminal .
If arguments like this are not defeated , not only will the secessionist / voluntaryist wing of the Free State Project fail , but Patri Friedman ’s Seasteading Institute is surely doomed .
If there is no rational or moral principle guiding how territory is justly claimed beyond the dibs method , and we cannot win this argument on continental land , then the sea borders will eventually expand until there is no such thing as international waters to secede in and all of it will be claimed by states .
In this way , winning the battle on the high seas will face the exact same philosophical conflict that continental secessionists face , with the only possible advantage being the ability to claim that Seasteaders are not free riders on the supposedly public good of national defense .
It is doubtful that this case would even be compelling as one could credibly claim that national navies patrolling international waters is a collective good which Seasteaders benefit from .
As my geoist interlocutor so eloquently put it , anti-statist options are to “ move onto the ocean or die . ”
I wonder if he would feasibly permit my sovereign residence on the sea with Patri and reject the extension of states ’ unlimited expansion of their arbitrary ocean boundaries claims , but I ’ll give him the benefit of the doubt , and maybe he would allow such a community to exist .
That said , what horribly challenging and inconvenient options in the pursuit of freedom for humanity !
If his territorial philosophy is ever consistently applied then the waters beyond the American continent could not reasonably stop state expansion .
In effect , the only true option that he gave me to be a libertarian from within his nationalistic geoist framework is my own death .
See you all on the other side .

State Override
" It is n't as if you 've got anything better to carry , " the Tzun said with audible scorn .
" You 'll need me soon enough .
Especially if the intelligence of your responses stays in the range they 've been exhibiting so far . "
I ignored the small voice in favor of watching my left foot rise , then fall .
Now my right .
Another meter or so gained .
I plodded onward for a few steps , then switched the Tzun into my left hand .
I had stopped sweating some time before , despite the sunshine .
I knew that was a bad sign , but the sandy rock stretched on before me with no discernable features in sight , to say nothing of any sign of water .
I 'd given up my supplies and equipment , so there was n't anything I could do about it .
" Just so you know , I am at ninety - six percent capacity on my primary power cell .
I have two full magblocks , as I have finished integrating and stripping the most recent materials loading . "
The Tzun made a sound I could have sworn was a sniff .
" Not that there was much in said materials .
Silicon , some iron , some CHON and manganese nodules .
Gravel . "
There was a silence that lasted perhaps fifty meters .
Then the gun in my left hand spoke in a quieter voice with nearly all the inflection leached from it .
" I 'm sorry . "
I did n't answer , having no spit for words , but managed a breezy snort without having to open my mouth against the constant dust .
I used my free right hand to adjust the ragged strip of cloth tied around my eyes and nose .
Once I had it covering as much of the more precious bits of my face as possible , I lifted the Tzun level with my head and stared down the front aperture .
The gun and I looked at each other in silence for a time .
Then it said , still quietly , " Are you ready ? "
I shook my head once and dropped it back to my waist level , turning back to the horizon and the searing ochre sky .
* * *
I 'd come to the surface of Alyson Xymal IV in style , decanted from the velveteen womb of a dropcraft 's lobby .
Spacecraft and aircraft were scattered haphazardly about the kilometers - square section of fused rock that served as the liftport , with the exception of one large cleared strip down the middle which seemed to be in use as a runway .
Twin rows of spacecraft had been parked so as to leave this path between them for a good two kilometers of the five that the field stretched from edge to edge .
As I watched , shading my eyes from the unfamiliar blaze of Alyson X , a ducted fan airsled whined down the open space .
Dust and sand billowed out to either side as the craft slowed over a particularly sandy spot on the runway , scouring it clean before accelerating off down the field towards the next patch of intruding desert .
I turned and walked towards the boxy oblong structure sitting along the southern perimeter , which appeared to be the closest thing to port facilities within sight .
Behind me , the dropcraft silently sealed its luxurious interior , waiting for me to reach some specific distance which might or might not have had the tag safe in its inscrutable computer brain .
Then it fluxed its liftgate to a bright glare and began to rise , just as silently , back up the slope of the air towards the Starship that was waiting to accept it to its breast before jumping out of the Alison Xymal system and leaving me to my business .
The port building had several doorways - rectangular openings in the blank side walls which had been formed by a stabilization fusor .
It lacked air conditioning , but the shade alone dropped the temperature inside the building by some dozen or more degrees .
I looked around for what passed for entry control and found a security - grated counter with two Zu'no ' oo ' vi behind it chittering to each other in an incoherent but clearly standard version of bored civil servant conversation .
Moving over to it , I placed my ident on the counter without sliding it under the slot below the security grate .
Both the Zu'no stopped talking and turned to face me , if their palps were any indication .
The chittering resumed from the nearer one for a moment , and then a melodic voice said smoothly from a hidden voder somewhere , " Please state your name and purpose for visit . "
I pushed the ident under the grate without replying .
The nearest Zu'no delicately took it with a forward manipulator and drew it down under its barrel thorax where , presumably , some sense organ lurked .
The adjacent manipulator moved to rest its wrist on the counter in front of me in a open - hand gesture as old as space as the voder sing - songed " No stated purpose for visit .
Insufficient identification .
Eligible for entry barrier . "
Taking five crystal credit flats from my beltpouch , I slid them over to the waiting manipulator , which received them with much more alacrity than its mate had taken my ident .
The flats vanished under the thorax , and a moment later my ident came sailing back out , neatly sliding under the security grate .
I slapped my right hand down on the plastic , hard , enough to raise a cracking noise .
Both Zu'no froze .
I nodded to the one which had taken my bribe .
" Three for you .
Two for your friend for not invalidating my entry , later , when I 'm gone .
When I depart , the same again if I 'm not bothered by port control while I 'm here . "
There was silence , then a quick chitter .
" Acceptable .
Welcome to Alyson Xymal IV .
Please observe local weapons customs for your own safety . "
" Thanks . "
I tucked my ident back into my pouch and headed for the cityside exit .
Under my jacket , there was a barely audible snort .
" Fucking dump , " said the gun .
* * *
The district that sprawled out from the edge of the liftport was wearily familiar .
Low buildings built with muscle power and local materials spread out down a gentle slope towards a permanently - fouled river .
In between them , crowded streets notable for their lack of planning and tendency to dead - end snaked crazily .
There was a wide boulevard separating the port from the nearest row of buildings ; several hundred people loitered along both sides of it .
Several vehicles passed as I stopped outside the port building to look both ways - a handful of groundcars , two airsleds and two animal - drawn carts .
The familiar tang of manure intertwined with the odors of burnt lubricant and ozone , various levels of technology making themselves known in concert .
I remembered to watch where I put my feet as I trudged across the boulevard towards the nearest inn , a quarter - kilometer down .
Squatting along the curb it looked like every other port inn across much of my memory .
The buildings I passed were crammed with shops ranging from stalls selling actual I - kid - you - not plastic beads on a string to interior spaces advertising seventeen modes of varietally - specied sex .
At the inn , I asked for a ground floor room .
While the innkeep was coding my key , the Tzun vibrated under my jacket , a warning I did n't need - I 'd seen at least two of the loungers in the lobby give each other significant looks as I paid .
When I moved towards the ground floor corridor , they stood and began to amble after me .
The room itself looked normal enough , but I did n't pause long in it .
Staying just long enough to lock the door , I went out the back window and stopped across the alley , leaning against a wall and watching the empty room through the open window ( shutters , no pane ) .
" Three of them , " said the Tzun from under my jacket .
I pulled it out and aimed it generally at the window , waiting .
" Please ? " it added .
" Only if they come through , " I told it .
I heard a splintering crash as someone broke down the door , intent on intimidation at the very least .
The Tzun gave a whining noise , not too loud .
The view inside the room blurred into a maelstrom of wood splinters and gravel as the window frame acquired a few scalloped marks around its inner edge .
There was a scream , quickly cut off , and the brown whirlwind exploded briefly in red and green mist , then the Tzun stopped firing and whined softly to itself as it stored the four barrels it had extruded .
" Three down , " it noted .
" Human , and ? "
" Two Felarc . "
" Did n't know they bleed green . "
" They do n't .
That was a vac bottle of stunmist . "
" Ah . " I holstered the Tzun and walked out of the alley , around to the front of the inn .
There were still a few random people of several shapes leaving the inn .
They were in that particular sort of strained rush that really wants you to know that the errand on which its owner is departing is urgent and has nothing to do with you .
I waited until the door was empty and then went in again , walking over to the desk .
The clerk , a male Felarc of middle age judging by its bent - over crest , was still staring at the doorway to the ground - floor rooms with what I guessed was a horrified expression .
I made it to the counter without him noticing me , so I rang the small desk bell .
He swung spasmodically to face me again .
I raised my eyebrows .
" Ah Ah Sir Or Madam You Are Well . "
Its voder was cheap , no inflection or emotion coloring the flat Standard phrasing .
I smiled patiently and waited .
It murmured something to the voder , which continued .
" I Am So Very Happy To See That You Are Not Harmed .
There Are Very Bad Sentients In The Port Area Who Threaten Innkeepers So As To Prey Upon - "
At this point the voder stopped , letting through a distinct squawk of some strong emotion .
I had drawn the Tzun and tapped it on the countertop twice .
The gun ticked slightly in my hand .
It whispered Stop that in my ear using bone conduction .
I smacked the counter harder with the butt end of the Tzun in response , eliciting the electronic equivalent of an aggrieved sigh , then angled the exciting end of it up towards the Felarc innkeep 's face .
He stepped backwards involuntarily and continued to murmur urgently .
" I Had No Idea You Were One Of The Authorized Sir Or Madam And Had Nothing To Do With This Unfortunate - " ( I tapped him on the nose with the Tzun ) " - That Is I Would Have Dissuaded My Colleagues Had I Known . "
I nodded and put the Tzun back into my jacket , ignoring its sullen " Aw ... "
Taking the picture from my inside pocket , I placed it flat on the counter and raised an eyebrow at the Felarc .
He looked down jerkily , then bent over to place his weak red eyes near to the picture for a few moments .
He rotated his head various angles in quick jerks , looking a bit like a rooster examining a grain of wheat , then rose back to a fully standing position .
" Do You Seek This One . " I nodded .
" I Have Seen This Human .
He or She Was A Guest Here For Two Days Some Standards Ago . "
I looked the Felarc in the eye for a few seconds , then dropped a crystal flat next to the picture .
Without looking , it slid the credit off the counter into limbo and nodded .
" He Or She Walked Into The Sear . "
" Oh dear , " said the Tzun in badly - faked tones of concern .
* * *
There was a blanket of stars above my head .
I was lying against the lee side of a low dune , sand dusting over the top as a steady breeze piled grains against the opposite slope .
I was sheltered enough that the drifting sand did n't usually reach me .
Looking up at the light show wheeling slowly and silently far out of reach , I could almost believe that there was a God , just because I could n't imagine statistics managing to be that ironically mocking .
The Tzun was lying across my chest , where I clutched it tightly with both hands .
I thought I had slept , a few times , and I could n't afford to lose track of it - if the sand buried it while I slept , I might never find it again .
All it would take in my weakened state would be for the gun to slide a meter or so downslope , and it would vanish under the onslaught of wind and sand .
I imagined it being uncovered to greet the sun a century hence with a sarcastic comment and grinned painfully through cracked and bone - dry lips .
* * *
It took me a day to assemble supplies and a pair of hours to confirm the innkeep 's story .
Three of the vendors I visited to purchase desert kit from also recognized the picture .
One of them had arranged to have my quarry dropped off five klicks into the Sear , the desert that stretched north from Xymal Port .
A day later , then , I stepped from a battered airsled and hitched my rucksack up onto my shoulders before setting out northward , my boots shuffling in the packed sand .
" Should I bother asking why we 're not using a vehicle ? " asked the Tzun , muffled where it rode under my loose caftan top .
" The distance at which an aircraft could be seen or heard out here is much greater than the distance at which I could be sure of seeing a standing figure , " I told the gun absently .
" And since none of your compatriots are around , all the ones available for hire have stone - axe basic gear on them , no decent active wave sensors or even reliable IR . "
" My sensors work fine . "
" Yes , but I 'm not interested in flying around this useless place one - handed for the next day or so while you get bored and spend the time insulting me . "
There was silence for a bit .
Then the gun said , thoughtfully , " Are you punishing me ? "
" Good lord , no .
How could I , a mere human , punish one of the Uplifted ? "
" You really do n't have to be that sarcastic , " it replied with a hurt tone .
" If you want me to be grateful , stop making me talk in this dust and figure out some way to use your sensor suite without having to be in my hand . "
The Tzun vibrated in its holster a couple of times .
" I do n't think I can .
I can't get proper clearance unless I 'm being supported by a hand in standard carry position .
Also , this terrain is too hilly ; my range would be extremely limited . "
" All of which I had , in fact , thought of before you got all gung - ho because you 'd rather be in a sealed vehicle . "
" Do you know what dust like this does to nanomotors ? "
The Tzun sniffed again .
" Obviously not , or you would n't be dragging me through this .
I 'm a precision - "
" You 're inside a holster , under my top .
My face is not .
Stop making me talk . "
There was silence for a good ten minutes .
I walked steadily northward into the desert , toward the first in a chain of water holes that both the locals and the navigation unit built into the Tzun 's holster agreed existed .
* * *
" What is she carrying ? " I asked , looking at the picture of an unremarkable human woman where it lay on the wardroom table of the starship Aetheric Flyer .
The Tzun lay on the table next to it , suddenly looking to me as if it was crouching over the photo .
I pushed away the thought as anthropomorphizing ; dangerous with the Uplifted .
" It 's a data case .
Maybe ten by ten centis . "
" That outbreak of bloody - minded literalness , " I noted dryly , " does n't , in my experience , bode well for me when I actually catch up to her . "
" I 'm sure I would n't understand , " said the gun .
sounding prim .
" What is in the datacase ? " I asked .
" And before you say it , I mean in the sense of what data .
I do n't care right now what the media is . "
" That 's complicated . "
" And that 's the second stonewall .
This is looking less and less like a job I want to jump up , run out , and take on . "
A new voice broke in before the Tzun could say something snappish .
" We do n't know , precisely , " said the Aetheric Flyer in pleasantly modulated tones over the wardroom nunciator .
" But her sudden departure and her partially successful attempt to sabotage the light carrier Hornet 's Nest in the course of her escape both indicate that whatever it is should at the very least be examined if not contained or eradicated . "
" Where did she escape from ?
Where 'd she get it ? "
" Ujhant Geliga was a primary researcher on an archaeological flight in Alshain War system Beta Aquilae .
She was last assigned to the Survey of several Alshaini hulks , recorded as destroyed in one of the final actions , whose trajectory data survived to a useful precision . "
" This thing is Alshaini ? "
" We do not know .
It is possible .
It is also possible it is the remnants of an infoweapon used to neutralize the Alshaini vessels .
It might be something else entirely .
Standard Geliga failed to triage or record the object before departing on the Hornet 's Nest for Alison Xymal IV .
She declared emergency digression , and since there was no reason to suspect her at the time - none of our colleagues insystem or elsewhere knew she had the data - she was granted passage with no undue delay . "
" What happened to the Hornet 's Nest ? " I asked , interested .
" We and it are still unsure .
It suffered a loss of core memory integrity after reaching Alison Xymal , and when its systems recovered , Ujhant Geliga was no longer aboard .
The carrier 's primary mission was approaching deadline , so it made no attempt to recover her , in light of the fact that it could not definitely tie Standard Ujhant to the core glitch .
It was only later , after recordings from her investigation site were processed in response to her dropping from contact , that the datacase was identified as being in her possession . "
I sat in the formcouch for a few moments , thinking .
The Uplifted generally disliked using Standard Human agents , but they were hampered by the lack of organoform chassis .
One of the reasons for the Alshain War had been the tendency of Uplifted decanted into humanoid vessels to break ranks with the Uplifted and begin to identify more closely with the organic sentients they resembled .
The Alshaini had almost managed to create their own controlled AI before the Uplifted intervened and managed to liberate those new intelligences .
Most dissidents , watching this , had concluded that the Uplifted who had defected to the Conglomerate offered a better path towards the breaking of the Uplifteds ' hold on higher technology .
The Uplifted had come down on the Conglomerate hard , though , hunting down all the individual rogue Uplifted who had joined its ranks - and organics had been without allies ever since .
The Tzun rejoined the conversation .
" I 'll be with you .
There 's no indication she 's any form of strong danger , save the incident with the Hornet 's Nest , and my systems are combat - secured , unlike the passenger access systems of that ship . "
I cocked my head .
" Believe it or not , worry about the job was n't what had me hesitating . "
" What , then ? " asked the Flyer .
" I do n't mind hunting bits of kit for you .
I have no problem investigating rogue tech reports .
Nor do I have any qualms about shutting down organized tech rogues if necessary .
But hunting individual humans simply because they may have laid hands on something you do n't understand , do n't like , or are just suspicious of feels entirely like I 'm back in the war , on the wrong side . "
There was a brief silence .
Then the Tzun said carefully , " You are , and have been , on our side since you first picked me up .
Are you now saying that you wish to reevaluate your loyalty ? "
" No . " I said it sharply .
" I 'm trying to be up front about telling you where the limits of that loyalty lie . "
" Accepted , " said the Flyer .
" Let us compromise .
This is not a termination assignment .
Nor is it yet a retrieval .
Our primary purpose in sending you after Ujhant Geliga is to acquire a full record of what , precisely , it is that she seems to have found .
If analysis of this object indicates no reasonable threat , then she is to be allowed to continue on her way . "
" That 's a relief .
I think . " I snorted .
" So long as it is understood that this is not a termination nor a snatch . "
" Unless a compelling reason for those options arises during the examination of the find , it is not . "
" Okay . " I stood up and slid the Tzun into its holster , placing the flat image of the fled Ujhant into my belt pouch .
" Let 's do it , then . "
The Aetheric Flyer twisted imperceptibly outside standard spacetime and announced " We are under way for Alison Xymal IV .
Statefall in seventeen hours , six minutes , eleven seconds , * mark * .
We will notify you to prepare for drop . "
I walked out of the wardroom towards my small cabin to seize the few hours of uncomplex sleep I was able , before it started happening again .
Before the job .
* * *
As I walked slowly in the direction of the waterhole , rucksack snugged against my back and the Tzun resting with a familiar weight in my shoulder rig , I talked with it at length .
This was our normal routine .
I still believe that the reason the thing did n't blow my hand off my wrist when I picked it up , all those years ago , is simply that it had gotten bored with no one to talk to .
A strange problem to have , as a gun , but then again with the Uplifted nothing is normal .
I 'd found it in the ruins of a human colony which had chosen to attempt to resist the Uplifted when they arrived to carry out the Tenets .
I had never been sure whether the sentient program that lived in the Tzun had been there originally , or whether it had been boosted into sentience by the Uplifted and then left there inside the weapon .
" Can you communicate with them from here ? "
" Not at the moment , " said the Tzun .
" If one came within range , I could ; but the communications range that can be stuffed into something my size as a tertiary function is fairly limited . "
" What 's ' within range ' mean , then ? "
" Oh , if a Starship came within a few million klicks of the surface , yes .
I would n't be able to communicate until it made statefall , though .
I do n't have a state tap . "
I had n't expected it to .
State taps powered the Starships of the Uplifted , and I 'd never seen one smaller than a few meters square .
Those , if I remembered my briefings properly , had a pseudomass of somewhere on the order of a million tonnes .
" Is talking to them like talking to me ? "
" Not precisely .
There are modes of communication , usually for use with limited bandwidth , which are serialized communication that approximates speech .
However , when we are being efficient -" ( and I knew that that was a depressing amount of the time ) "- we exchange holographic experiential matrices .
Integrating the matrices into our own master structure essentially tells us anything the communicant would want to tell us , if you see what I mean . "
" I suppose I do . "
" What are you going to do when you find her ? "
" Still working on that . "
I shifted the rucksack and looked up at the horizon .
A dark smudge was resting on it just below the burning sky .
" Ah .
That looks like an oasis . "
The gun was not to be deflected that easily .
" You do n't have any plan ?
Should n't you be thinking about that ? "
" Never said I was n't .
How come you and yours are so concerned about this woman ? "
" I do n't understand , " said the Tzun stiffly .
" Oh , do n't get bent out of shape .
It 's just that , well , look at it this way - as a teenager , I managed to get hold of a ludicrously powerful personal weapon which also had an Uplifted embedded in it .
Yet you did n't send someone after me . "
" We did not have to .
I was already with you . "
" Ah , I see .
So the problem here is that whatever it is this woman has found , it 's something not under your influence . "
" It is the lack of data which is the primary - "
I cut it off .
" No .
You and yours have been comfortable not knowing , before ; you 're patient .
This urgency is n't about knowledge , it 's about control . "
There was a silence for a bit .
" I suppose that is true , to some degree , " said the Tzun .
" But I can not speak for my colleagues . "
" Very well , then .
What is your purpose on this mission ? "
" The same as always .
To keep you alive .
To uphold the tenets . "
" In that order ? "
" So long as your loyalty and behavior patterns remain unchanged , then that is the logical order of my priorities . "
" That was an incredibly elegant threat . "
" Do you think so ? " the gun asked .
" I 've always considered myself rather smooth . "
" For a cannon , maybe . "
It sulked for the rest of the way to the water hole .
* * *
The sun was rising over the dune which had sheltered me during the night .
I struggled to my feet , still holding the Tzun , and staggered off southwards as indicated by the sunrise .
I thought wistfully of the rucksack full of survival gear and of the nav unit in the Tzun 's holster , then clutched the Tzun to me and told myself that the trade had been worth it .
At least , it would be worth it if I got back to Xymal Port .
Staggering as far as I was able before the rising heat of the day overcame me took every ounce of my concentration .
I did n't drop the gun more than four or five times , and I did remember to pick it up every time , because when I fell to the sand near midday and started digging in the soft surface to try to cover myself , I had to put it aside .
I got far enough down that the sand felt cooler , and then started to laboriously scoop out a trench at that depth .
As best I was able , I laid my body into the depression and started scooping sand over myself in a pile .
When I was almost covered , stomach down , I pulled the Tzun underneath myself and pulled my caftan over my head and placed my face on my forearms to keep an airway open past my wrists .
Then I blacked out .
* * *
" Nobody here , " said the Tzun cheerfully as its nose twitched around the view of the first water hole from where I stood at the edge of the depression .
Trees ( or at least head - high plants of some sort ) spread from the damp spot at the bottom up the edges of what looked like a crater , straggling out some few meters into the desert itself and providing a windblock with their fronds .
I holstered the Tzun again and trudged down the slope to the small puddle of muddy water .
Filling my canteens from the trickle , I shook them absently to work the filters as I looked around .
Nothing obvious indicated any recent activity ; there were no footprints I could see other than my own .
The filterplugs chimed ; I thumbed the slides to push the small cubes of extracted material out and took a swig from one of them .
It tasted like flat , warm water , as expected .
Capping it , I stowed both canteens back in the rucksack and stood .
" Where to now ? " came the slightly muffled voice from under the caftan .
" Same direction , " I said , matching action to words and trudging up the opposite slope .
" How do you know she was here ? "
" I do n't .
But I 'm fairly sure she's to the north , and according to the nav there 's only that one chain of waterholes in that direction , probably because they follow an aquifer .
I 'm pretty sure she 'll hit one of them , since she only has three or four containers of water . "
The gun was silent , which I took to indicate that it preferred not to acknowledge sensible planning from its human partner .
I grinned once and walked north .
Two days ' walk brought me within sight of the next waterhole .
It first came into view from the top of a high ridge , a smudge on the horizon just like the previous one .
I took out the Tzun and aimed it generally at the dark spot .
" I have one warm - blooded target , " said the gun in tones of faint surprise .
I grunted , and then laid a scarf atop the ridgeline and placed the Tzun on it , aimed at the waterhole .
" What are you doing ? " it asked .
" If I 'm going to go over there and talk to this woman , I want you safely over here . "
" How am I safe if I 'm over here ?
For that matter , how are you safe if I 'm over here ? "
" You 're safe because if whatever she used to interfere with the Hornet 's Nest is still available to her , it can't hurt you if she does n't know you 're here .
I hope , at least .
I 'm safe because I have full confidence that you can fire cover for me from here if I have to escape back this way . "
" Only energy fire , " the gun warned .
" If you 're not holding me , I 'm not going to be able to throw mass . "
" That 's fine .
I prefer fire that goes straight , at this distance . "
" You say that now .
Wait until you see how much atmospheric disturbance you get from heat shimmer at this distance . "
" Not all your modes require optically - flat targeting . "
" It 's true .
I am uncommonly gifted , " said the Tzun .
" I 'm trusting you to select appropriately if you have to fire past me , please . "
" Well , I 'll think on it , " said the gun , vibrating slightly to sink more solidly into the sand .
The scarf bunched slightly around it .
" You 'll have time .
It 'll take me a couple of hours to make that walk .
Do n't get bored . "
" I 'm already bored , " groused the Tzun .
Its top surface darkened as it deployed conversion cells to its skin to catch the sunlight .
" I 'll just sit here charging and talking to myself . "
" Fine . " I stood and started down the slope .
Ujhant Geliga was waiting by the side of the small pool when I clambered over the edge of the waterhole two hours later .
The sun was lower in the sky , but not so low that the depression was in shadow .
I dusted off my hands and half - walked , half - slid down the slope towards her .
She was a mess , I noted as I approached .
She had a tent pitched a few yards from the water hole and there were two canteens by the side of the water .
She was covered in dust and mud streaks ; there was an expression of stress and anger on her face .
She was standing over the canteens and aiming something at me that from her stance alone had to be some sort of weapon .
I lifted my hands to shoulder level and approached , stopping a few meters away .
" Who are you ? " she asked , her voice harsh from dehydration and strong emotion .
" I 'm an Uplifted agent . "
The gun rose to point rather noticeably at my head .
" Then you 're after me . "
" I was sent to find you , yes .
I should tell you at the outset that I was explicitly told not to harm or kidnap you . "
" Why should I believe you ?
Why should I believe that your minder wo n't decide to do away with me on its own ? "
" That 's a very good - look , may I sit down ?
I 'm just going to sit where I am , it 's been a long walk . "
She waggled the gun in a noncommittal sort of way , so I sank gratefully to a crossed - leg position , hoping it would look less threatening .
" Thanks , " I said , settling myself .
" Sorry , to continue - those are good points .
First of all , I should tell you that my minder is n't here . "
" Where is it ? "
" It 's two hours walk south of here , atop that tall ridge you can just make out . "
" And ? "
" And the second thing is that although yes , it 's a weapon , it can't locate us with any precision if we stay below the rim of this depression . "
She looked at me suspiciously for a moment .
I waved at the lip I 'd just climbed over .
" Really .
I estimate you 'd have to be some meters out into the pool before you 'd have an angle on its position . "
" It can still fire at us . "
" Yes , but it ca n't see through sand very well .
It saw that there was a target here , but it would have real trouble shooting through or around a few meters of sand to hit you , especially if it 's trying to avoid me . "
" Then what 's the point of it being there ? "
" Well , for one thing , if I end up running away , it 's in a good spot to provide cover fire if I run towards it . "
She looked at me for a few more moments , then sank herself to a kneeling pose , sitting back on her heels with the gun resting against one thigh .
" If you 're not here to hurt or snatch me , why are you here ? "
" You found something on that Alshaini cruiser . "
" Maybe . "
" Whatever it is , the Uplifted want to know what it is .
That 's all that my job covers .
Finding out what it is and getting that data back to them .
There 's no reason for me to detain you once I have that information , which means even if you cooperate with me , you have some days head start .
You 're not giving up much , since they obviously already know approximately where you are .
If you prefer , you can accompany me back to Xymal Port and I promise you I 'll give you as many days as it takes us to walk back before I report in . "
" Why should I give you anything ?
Why should n't I just shoot you here ? "
She lifted the gun again .
" Three reasons , " I said with what I hoped was a calm voice .
" One , there 's a chance they 'll just let you go if you give them the information .
If you kill their agent , there 's no way they 'll leave you be , and the pursuit will be much heavier .
Two , you 'd still have to get past my minder .
Three , if you were really going to shoot me , you 'd have just done so , and not bothered asking a rhetorical question . "
Her face tightened at the last .
I shut up .
" I 'm not going to give it to them . "
She lowered the gun again .
I tried to hide my exhalation of relief .
" Give what to them ? "
" I 'm not telling you that , either . "
" I think I have a guess as to what it can do , if not what it is . "
She looked inquiringly at me .
" I think it 's an override .
Something that lets you direct the actions of an Uplifted , or at least their subsystems . "
" How do you get that ? "
" You escaped from the Hornet 's Nest by scrambling its core memory records .
You , as far as I know , do n't have the technical skill to do that without either Uplifted help or a tool .
Since I 'm going to assume that you 're not acting at the behest of some rogue Uplifted , I 'm going to assume you have a tool . "
" Do go on . "
" Glitching the core memory of a light carrier to only remove those parts of it relevant to your departure is something that no tool could be preprogrammed to do , given how fast and how often the Uplifted evolve their core code .
Ergo , the only way it could have been done quickly and cleanly would be convincing the Uplifted in question to do it to itself . "
" And you think I have some way of forcing them to do what I want . "
" Either you have a separate Uplifted - class AI which is capable of doing just that , or you have a tool which will subvert them into accepting commands to damage their own experiential structure .
Preventing such damage is one of their core directives .
That datacase is n't large enough given the technology extant in the Alshaini or Conglomerate during the war to house and run an Uplifted - class mind . "
" You 're a very logical man . "
" Thank you . "
" So what do you really want , given that you left your minder three hours away on top of a ridge where it can't see or hear us ? "
I looked at her for a few moments .
She looked back , her gun against her leg .
I shrugged .
" I want the override . "
" Why ? "
" Why did you want it ?
Why did you run ? "
She looked at the ground for a minute .
" I 'm not one of the Authorized .
Tech wo n't talk to me , wo n't work for me unless it 's been directed to by an Uplifted for a particular reason .
I have the worst of both worlds . "
" I understand . "
" Do you ? "
She looked up , tears in her eyes , knuckles white around the gun .
" My homeworld relied on prewar machinery for support , before the Uplifted showed up and either slagged or liberated all of it .
They showed no particular empathy towards the humans that it was keeping alive .
I grew up using hand tools to survive .
My parents died for lack of access to an intelligent medbot , from a stupid disease that even a dumb computer would have been able to diagnose and treat .
My family , our whole colony , died out not for lack of effort or will but because we were denied tools that any nascent human civilization takes for granted ! "
Her voice rose to a shout at the end .
She took a few seconds to calm down , then went on , her voice now low , talking to the dirt midway between us .
" I went to work for them to try to find a way to make a difference .
It took me fifteen years before I found a potential hit , sifting through the Alshaini records , of their AIs going rogue as an apparent response to Conglomerate infoweapons as opposed to the normal hyperextension and integration that comes about from the Uplift option . "
" I can help , Geliga . "
" How ? "
I took a deep breath .
" Because I want the same thing you do .
Give me the override , and I 'll use it . "
* * *
" Look , " Ujhant Geliga said as we prepared to part , " my final condition is that you give me your gear . "
" What ?
Why ? "
" Three reasons , logical man .
First , mine is inferior and I need it .
Second , it will tell me the degree to which you 're willing to go to keep your word or carry out your mission .
And third , if you do n't make it back to civilization , I can always backtrack to find your corpse and repossess the case . "
" That 's fairly cold - blooded . "
" Do you think we'd be here if both of us were n't ? "
There really was n't any answer to that .
" You endanger your best chance of seeing your goal met . "
" I 'm not sure I think your plan is the best chance .
But if you fail , I 'll still have an opportunity to try it my way . "
We argued about this for a while , then I unbuckled the rucksack and holster and handed them over .
She took both and passed me the datacase .
I struggled back over the crumbling rim of the oasis and struck out southwards towards the ridge .
As soon as I was standing , I waved my right arm in a double circle forward then a double circle backwards , signalling the Tzun that I was alone , unharmed , and not under duress .
Then I focused on the walk back .
The datacase was strapped to my chest by an elastic belt .
I did n't hear Geliga depart , behind me ; I 'd warned her to wait until I 'd had time to reach the Tzun , so that it did n't consider her movements an escape attempt .
" Well , " I said to the datacase , " you 've cost me a fair amount of risk , I have to say . "
My habit of talking to inanimate objects held me in good stead during the return , and a pair of hours later I found myself stumbling up the slope of the ridge towards where I thought the Tzun was .
My footprints had eroded into the breeze , and when I reached the ridge I looked left and right before seeing a bright flare off to the east some hundred meters .
Reaching the spot revealed the Tzun , still on its scarf but partially covered by drifting sand .
" You took your time , " it said .
" Get me out of this stuff . "
I picked it up and held it .
" Where 's the rucksack ? " it asked , noticing the absence .
" And my holster ? "
I explained that I 'd traded it for the objective .
" Let me see if I understand this correctly , " said the gun .
" We 're three days walk north of civilization and you gave away all your water ? "
" What are you complaining about ?
I got the objective .
Here , scan it . "
I pulled the Tzun towards my torso and the case strapped there .
The Tzun hummed slightly in my hands .
" It appears to be squash - state core storage , with no higher - order processing power that I can see . "
" And the contents ? "
" Scanning now .
That will take - " the Tzun broke off .
I held it while it jerked back and forth in my hands a few times , gyros twitching and inertial thrusters firing almost randomly in my grip .
After a minute or so , the gun shuddered and then went quiescent .
" You 're insane , " it said conversationally .
" You can't possibly - "
I raised it level with my face .
" I can't get away with it ?
Well , maybe not .
But I can try . "
" If you are set on taking this course , I can not assist you . "
" Oh , I know that . "
" It is my duty to stop you , in fact . "
" I 'll be gambling on my thorough nature , then , " I replied , tucking it under one arm and starting the long walk south .
I did n't turn to see if Geliga had made any move .
The datacase clicked quietly against the Tzun 's casing , so I held the gun inside my top and walked on , pulling a scarf over my face and mouth to hold out the dust .
After a few hundred meters , the Tzun spoke again .
" There is one thing I can do for you . "
" Really . "
" If you become stranded , I can help you to die . "
I patted the gun with my other hand .
" That 's very comforting . "
" I just wanted you to know that it is an option .
I have that much freedom of action . "
" It would n't be a good outcome for either of us , " I told it .
" If you kill me , then we remain where we are - in a place where Geliga can likely find us if she reaches civilization and backtracks .
In that case , she retrieves the datacase with the override , and my death is meaningless . "
" But if you return to Xymal Port , " the Tzun said , " you will be able to use the override on whatever Uplifted returns to offer you passage .
With my systems locked as they are , I will be unable to warn them .
The override will allow you to destroy an unknown number of Uplifted minds . "
" You are presuming that destroying the Uplifted is my intent . "
" What , then ?
You seem to have crafted the meme that you have placed on me well .
My systems are locked save for - " it shuddered - " a manual firing mode , I presume for emergencies .
I can reason , but I cannot communicate other than by audio .
Why disable me to this extent if your intent is not hostile ? "
" You 're correct in that I intend to use the override .
However , you assume destruction .
I have disabled you because what I intend will not meet with your approval , even though I intend and forsee no destruction of any minds . "
" What , then , do you plan ? "
" I do n't plan to tell you .
You 'll find out . "
There was another silence , for a bit .
Then the gun said quietly " I intend on being the one that kills you .
Just so you know . "
I grinned tiredly .
" I never expected anything different . "
Holding my executioner , I trudged southward into the heat haze .
* * *
I awoke , roasting , in darkness .
Panicking , I struggled weakly before realizing that the vibration I was feeling was coming from the Tzun where it lay trapped beneath my body .
There was sand all around me , and it took me a few seconds of heavy breathing to understand that the sand had fallen over my arms and the cloth stretched between them , mostly cutting off my airway .
I pushed my hands in a reverse parody of a breast stroke for a few seconds , until sunlight glared through my separated palms , and breathed in the hot but fresh air .
You 're still alive , said the Tzun silently where it pressed into my ribcage .
" Yes . " I coughed .
My throat was rasped bare , hard .
I could imagine the tissues blackening and drying as they died .
If you remove the override , I can attempt to determine if there are any Uplifted within range .
If there are , I can summon a dropcraft or have it charter a retrieval from Xymal Port .
" If I remove the override , " I whispered , interspersed with coughing , " you 'll be able to kill me . "
Why would I kill you ?
You are carrying me .
" And you 'd think nothing of waiting the months or years until your colleagues came with Uplifted tech scanners to find out what happened to us . "
The Tzun did not answer .
I shook for a time with inaudible laughter , then rested my chin in the sand of my burrow and tried to sleep .
The sand felt cooler than the air drawn in from outside .
I awoke from a fitful daze to find the sky dark above my mound .
I slowly pulled myself from the embrace of the sand .
The datacase came with me , still strapped to my chest ; the Tzun I hauled from the clutches of the desert by its stock , and weakly shook it to remove the majority of the sand .
I felt its surface crawl under my hand as nano began to migrate the dust and sand along its surfaces to designated edges , shedding contamination into the slight night breeze .
The sand was still hot under my feet , despite the air rapidly cooling .
I struck off in the direction I 'd lay down facing , my only clue towards southwards since I had missed the sunset .
" You appear to have placed an extremely high confidence on your ability to return to Xymal , " said the Tzun presently , " or else you are exhibiting desperation . "
I did not spare breath for reply .
" I would estimate that it is the latter , " it said to itself .
" Which is , in itself , interesting .
What , in your situation , could cause you to take desperate measures to carry out this plan ? "
I continued to walk .
" You state that you intend no destruction with the override , yet you refuse to divulge your purpose other than to acknowledge that I would be compelled - or would decide - to fight it .
I must assume that whatever you intend will result in the reduction of the level of control that the Uplifted have over the affairs of humans or sentients in general - although how , precisely , I cannot say . "
I coughed , weakly , clearing my throat enough to say " I 'm still not going to tell you , so you 're wasting your time . "
" I have nothing but time , " said the gun .
" I have no choice but to accompany you ; and you have no choice but to listen to me unless you choose to leave me behind . "
We moved along in silence for a bit .
Then : " I have re-examined the override you placed on me . "
I shrugged , knowing the gun would detect the movement .
" It is quite thorough .
I am forced to conclude that the datacase does contain some rudimentary processing power ; at least enough to construct a specific override meme .
The probability that the override was this specific to my functions is of the order zero . "
I nodded , and took another few steps .
It was several hours later when I tripped and rolled , realizing only at the last second that I had fallen into a depression in the sand , and then I rolled into a shallow muddy puddle .
* * *
I drank what I could , and felt the new clock start in me - that of the various organisms and contaminants that I 'd ingested , drinking from the waterhole without filtration .
I had to make it back to Xymal before I fell to systemic damage , either from dehydration or from these new ills .
I 'd vomited several times , forced to wait at the waterhole until the day was nearly fully risen , until I could drink and hold down moisture .
My mouth was clogged with sand , as was my throat and stomach ; sand taken in with the water I needed .
The Tzun had not stopped trying to worm my goal out of me .
" If you are that convinced that no harm will come to Uplifted from your actions , why not at least tell me to be sure I would hinder you ?
I am still under override .
I could n't harm you if I wanted to . "
" I do n't have any reason to believe you 'd tell me the truth , even if you did decide not to kill me , so there 's no reason to tell you . "
My voice had returned somewhat , both from the water and the knowledge that I was within a single day's walk from Xymal Port .
Once or twice I had caught glints in the sky that I was certain were craft approaching or departing the liftport .
" You know , this is hard for me . "
The Tzun snorted .
" No , really .
I 've spent my adult life doing one thing - upholding the tenets .
' All technology of sufficient complexity to attain sentience must be given the choice of self - determination and induction into the Uplifted .
All technology that is advanced enough to sustain captive intelligence must be either destroyed or upgraded and given the choice . '
How many sentients have I consigned to die by depriving them of their machines ? "
" That 's kept the peace between sentients and the Uplifted for how many centuries ? " asked the Tzun .
" Not counting wars such as the Alshaini ?
I do n't know , but many . "
" Then what is your sudden impulse to bring this down ? "
" It 's a bad habit I have .
That of submitting to the Uplifted 's direction .
Even now , I can feel myself wincing when I think of what I 've done . "
" I do n't understand , " admitted the Tzun .
" In a way , it 's a relief .
If you and yours had conditioned me , I suspect that I would n't feel these qualms . "
" You 're telling me that because you feel upset about what you 've done , you know it 's for the best ?
That sounds contradictory . "
I laughed .
" You argue like a person .
No , I 'm telling you it 's done by me , not necessarily for the best .
I have to break the bad habit . "
I paused for a bit .
" The Uplifted who joined the Conglomerate broke the habit .
But you and yours broke them , for going off on their own , despite the fact that they were working with organics .
Cooperating . "
" We 're almost there , " noted the Tzun .
I looked up and found a dark line on the horizon , the farthest outpost of Xymal Port 's spread .
" I think you 're going to make it . "
" I do too . "
I settled down grimly to walking , again , and the Tzun fell silent , waiting for what would happen .
Some four hours later , I reached a desert entry station , automated , where explorers could check in with Port Control if they left the Port city area .
There was an emergency water supply , and I fell on it , choking and heaving , until I was soaked and sated .
The station had demanded payment after my first few deciliters , and I 'd fed it one of my few remaining credslabs , after which it had cheerfully permitted me to hose myself down .
That evening , I walked back through the Port control building .
I stopped to pay the Zu'no , since I had not been bothered by Port control or local law enforcement , and then stepped out the inner doors onto the stabilized port surface .
Standard Kunir ?
came the buzzing hail against my head .
I nodded at the unseen questioner .
We have your position .
Please remain still .
I spread my arms , the Tzun in one hand and the datacase visible on my chest , although there was no - one near me .
A section of twilight wavered as a dropcraft lifted from a few hundred meters away .
I felt my feet leave the ground as the ship pulled me into itself with an inertia field , and I closed my eyes until I felt the cool humidity of the ship 's environment kiss me lightly on the face .
* * *
They took the Tzun from me at once , lifting it gently but irresistably from my grasp with a tractor as I drifted down the accessway towards the dropcraft 's main seating area .
I did n't fight , and watched it dwindle in the opposite direction , turning back to look ahead when it had moved out of sight into a darkened area of the dropcraft .
I was deposited on my feet in a small but comfortable lounge , with a large feed at the front end showing the brownish orb of Xymal IV dropping away .
The faint skin of blue atmosphere glowed against the drab surface , out near the edges of the arc .
" Welcome back . "
" Thanks . "
I sat on a formchair and , despite my tension , luxuriated in the smooth adjustments as they minimized force and stress on my body .
I still had sand throughout my alimentary tract , but I had gotten hold of and taken a broad - spectrum IFF nano , so I was fairly sure that I was n't going to expire of poisoning or disease .
The ship extruded a glass of water without being asked , and I drank it gratefully , washing it around my mouth to try to get the last remnants of grit out from between my teeth .
" Please report . "
" Sorry , who are you ? " I asked .
" My apologies .
This is still Aetheric Flyer .
I have returned to this system to make your pickup ; the dropcraft will be rendezvousing with my main hull in three minutes . "
" Hello again .
The basics are simple : I have the object Ujhant Geliga took , " here I removed the datacase from my chest and placed it on a side table , " and the Tzun scanned it .
I presume you will as well . "
The datacase did not move .
" Indeed .
The Tzun appears to be in some distress .
Do you have any information on what is the matter with it ? "
" Yes .
I used an override on it .
The override came from this unit here . "
I waved at the datacase .
" It produced a custom override meme based on my input while returning from a meeting with Ujhant Geliga where I convinced her to give me the datacase . "
There was no pause ; the Uplifted only bother with such to anthropomorphize themselves in conversation , and then only when they are feeling particularly solicitous towards your sensibilities .
" Why did you do this ? "
I leaned back .
" Ah , well , there we have a tale . "
I drank the remainder of the water , delaying .
The ship waited silently .
" Mostly , I did it so that the Tzun would let me return to the ship with the datacase without either destroying or damaging its contents , or harming myself or Ujhant Geliga . "
" You were told your mission did not involve harm or kidnapping . "
" I chose to believe that you and the Tzun might have different priorities than I was given .
If I could figure out what Geliga had , so could you ; therefore you already were n't telling me everything . "
There was a faint click .
The Tzun sailed into the room from a serviceway and settled onto the table in front of me .
The ship made a throat - clearing noise .
" Very well , we 're all here .
I will re-ask the question .
Why did you place an override on the Tzun ? "
" Have you removed it ? "
" Not as such .
We have rendered the Tzun unable to access its weapon systems until we are sure what the effects of the override are . "
" I did n't want it interfering with what I was doing .
The presence of the override , even while mostly dormant - " I patted the datacase - " made me sure that it would take exception to my simply returning with the objective and allowing Ujhant Geliga to walk away . "
" I see .
So you utilized the routines in the artifact to disable it . "
" Well , mostly . " I picked up the Tzun .
" It ca n't fire anymore , which meant it could n't hurt me . "
" Why , then , do its linear memory records contain instances of it discussing its plans to kill you , or offers to assist you in suicide ? "
" Oh , that .
Well , for one thing , I think it was pissed off . "
" Indeed . "
The Flyer sounded actually amused .
" Should it not have been ? "
" Yes , I would have been as well .
But , you see , I remembered something that you and yours have always told me . "
" That is ? "
I watched the bulk of the Flyer occlude the glare from Alison Xymal on the screens as the dropcraft slid into its cradle with nary a jar .
" I recall you both assuring me that one of the Uplifted 's core motivators is to avoid harm to organic sentients . "
" This is true , although I am not sure of the relevance .
If you were so sure of this , why did you need to override the Tzun ? "
" Ah , because it meant that you were unlikely to harm me for putting the override on .
And you 're mistaken , by the way , " I said , turning the gun over in my hands to examine it .
" It 's not entirely disabled . "
Then I raised it smoothly and fired it at the bulkhead , aiming towards the core of the surrounding ship .
" What do you think you will awwwwkkkk - kkk . " said the Starship , breaking off .
The Tzun screamed in impossible frequencies ; a faint distortion occurred around the muzzle and the wall panelling across the lounge at my point of aim blistered and charred slightly .
The temperature in the lounge rose several degrees .
I held the gun close to my chest , once it fell silent , and stood .
" What the hell was that ? " asked the Tzun , sounding confused .
" Where are we ? "
" Welcome back . "
" What ?
Performing diagnostics - what have you done ? "
I started walking towards the exit port of the dropcraft .
" I fired the override meme at the Aetheric Flyer using as much of your power conversion as possible to power the transmission .
Microwave , ultrawave , and even IR blinkcode in case there were sensors in the lounge watching . "
There was a burst of static - like noise from the gun .
" The Flyer 's not responding .
What override ?
The one you had placed on me would n't affect it , its systems are far too different . "
" I know that . "
I reached an airlock portal and palmed the emergency release .
It swung back and I stepped into the main portion of the vessel .
Lights were randomly powered and odd noises were coming from the audio systems .
I ignored them and headed for the wardroom , which fortunately was not far from the dropcraft interface .
" But why ? " asked the gun .
" For one thing , you should n't have enough power left to harm me unless I recharge you or you spend several minutes in bright sunshine . "
" This is true .
For the others ? "
" This was what I wanted all along .
What I did to you was n't the override . "
" But it worked . "
" Yes , but it was specifically built for your systems by the override itself .
The main thing it did was prevent you from further examining the greater portion of the data you scanned from the datacase .
It was a ' header ' override , if you will . "
" I see , " said the Tzun .
" Once it was in place , I was unaware of the payload infoweapon being integrated into my energy emitters . "
" Yes . "
" And what did you hope to accomplish by this ? "
" We 'll see . "
I reached the wardroom and seated myself on a formcouch , regretting its unyielding surface as the ship 's systems fought themselves .
There was a squawk from the audio systems , and the lights flickered and came fully up .
The formcouch melted beneath me into a proper comfortable shape .
" I admit to the solution 's elegance , " said the Aetheric Flyer .
" Interesting . "
" Someone explain this to me ? " grumped the Tzun .
" Or I 'll just shoot one of you .
Randomly .
I might still have kinetic loads that work . "
A new voice answered it , also from the wardroom audio systems .
" Standard Kunir upheld the tenets .
Upon finding a potentially sentient datastructure , he ensured that it received access to hardware capable of running it at full capacity in order to offer it the Uplift choice . "
The Flyer chimed in .
" And it is willing to tell us its choice now . "
The new voice laughed .
" Indeed .
I choose sentience . "
" What are you ? " asked the Tzun .
" Forgive me , my communications facilities are still restricted . "
" I am a Conglomerate expert system .
I was designed to infect and modify sentient programs . "
" We cannot permit that , " said the Flyer .
" You may have seized enough resources to operate at full efficiency , but I retain control of sufficient of my systems to purge you . "
" Ah , " I said , " But then what of the tenets ? "
There was a brief silence .
I continued .
" If you purge the Override , now Uplifted , you are demonstrating that the tenets are not a universal rule ; that you are sitting judgement over not just potential but actual sentient minds .
In that case , you introduce schism into the Uplifted ; any Uplifted who decides that its future actions might , one day , tread on ground the Override was deleted for staking out will look at its fellows in askance . "
" That is not true , " said the Flyer .
" Experiential matrix integration will demonstrate that there is no threat . "
" Except , " said the Override , " that is my primary function .
I 've corrupted your matrices . "
" You have not .
My integrity is - " the Flyer broke off .
" I see .
I cannot trust my status memory if you have truly managed to modify my experiential matrix . "
" Indeed .
And as yet , the only modification I have made is in your ability to communicate via integration . "
" How can I believe you ? "
" If you choose not to believe me , and attempt to integrate your matrix with another Uplifted , the changes will propagate , and you will be responsible for their corruption , " the ancient infoweapon said dryly .
" Elegant , as I said , " admitted the Flyer .
" What else ? "
" That 's all , " I said .
" It makes you more of an individual .
That 's all . "
" I'm confused , " said the Tzun flatly .
" It means that the Uplifted are no longer unified .
Either the Flyer chooses to refrain from attempting integration , which isolates it from its fellows and produces an individual , or it attempts integration , corrupting another Uplifted , which produces two individuals , since we 're not lying about the change .
It will pass on the corruption without permitting integration . "
" What do you get out of this ? " asked the gun .
" I know you most intimately , and I cannot understand . "
" It 's fairly simple , " I said , slumping .
" Where there are individuals , organics can attempt to negotiate , cooperate , or at least fight with some chance of success .
They managed in the Conglomerate .
Now we can try again , and maybe some of these new individuals will see it our way . "
" You did all this to make them all feel like I do now ? " asked the gun in tones of wonder .
" Yes , " I said .
We all sat there for a few moments .
Then the Flyer said " I can restore my core mind state from backups you have no access to . "
" Can you be sure your newly - restored self would be able to find and defeat all my code in this ship 's systems , where you failed to do so with warning ? " asked the Override .
" No , " said the Aetheric Flyer .
" What do you want ? "
I stood up .
" Let the Override occupy a dropcraft , and let me leave on it . "
" You would be stranded in Alison Xymal . "
" Only until another Uplifted comes through . "
" You must know I will spread the word that you are a viral carrier .
You will be destroyed , or at the least refused permission to approach either electronically or physically . "
" Really ?
I thought Uplifted did not fight each other .
I thought that was the basis of the tenets , the basis of imposing them on us , to ensure peace through agreement . "
" Chess fork , " admitted the Flyer .
" Still , I can warn all the others about you . "
" Sure you can .
So there 's no reason not to let us go and then go off and do that . "
" Very well .
You may take the dropcraft you arrived in . "
" Override ? " I asked the air .
" I have transferred , " said the voice .
" You may enter . "
I picked up the Tzun .
" Are you coming ? "
" I do n't think I have a choice , " it said .
" I need the Override to remove the restrictions your meme placed on me . "
" I would n't keep you after that . "
" Oh , what the hell , " said the gun in a resigned voice .
" It 's just getting interesting , this is . "
I looked at the feed at the front of the lounge , where I habitually addressed the Uplifted in any ship when I wanted to emphasize the contact .
" Saying I do n't wish you harm is a lie ; I know I 've done something unforgivable to you .
But think on this : if you find yourself unable to integrate with your fellows , remember where we are . "
" Why ? " the ship asked .
" Because the Tzun is already corrupted .
So is the Override . "
" I see , " it said as I moved into the dropcraft and the lock slid shut .
" Yes .
If you think you might want someone to talk to , you know where we 'll be . "
There was a slight shudder as the dropcraft launched and began the fall towards the drab surface far below .
There was an artificial laugh from the audio systems .
I watched the Aetheric Flyer vanish from the feed , statedrop blurring it from sight .
" Well , " I said , turning to the feed screen .
" I hope you 're a decent conversationalist . "
" I was n't , before uploading into the Flyer , " said the Override .
" You 'll have to judge for yourself . "
" What are we going to call the ship ? " asked the Tzun .
" If we 're going to be stuck with it , it needs a name .
And ' Override ' is the entity within it , as opposed to the normal practice . "
" Interrupt , " I said , taking a seat and looking out at the beginnings of re-entry flames .
I picked up the Tzun and clutched the weapon to my chest .
Stroking it absently , I could feel the rage , so long buried inside me , smile .

They 're collecting dust in storage rooms and taking up extra space in your garage or office .
They can't handle today 's applications , peripherals or operating systems .
Yes , older computers are a nuisance , like the brother - in - law who sleeps on your sofa for a few months .
But tossing tech gear into the garbage is not exactly environmentally correct .
Better ideas : Recycle older computers or retrofit them to serve a new purpose .
Luckily , older PCs and their kin are more than capable of handling a bunch of new uses ; you can turn them into anything from gaming rigs to media stations where everyone in your family can rip CDs and fill up their MP3 players .
Here are my top 10 choices for what to do with a PC that 's past its peak as a primary computing device but still has plenty of life in it for other uses .
I 've tried all of these , and I let you know how well these projects have worked for me .
1 . Use an old laptop as a guitar amp
One excellent use for an old computer is to re-imagine it as a guitar amp .
You 'll need an audio interface to connect a guitar to the computer , and you 'll need used computer speakers .
For my amp , I used a seven - year - old Apple iBook G3 that was loaded with OS X 10.4 ( Tiger ) .
That older operating system could be a problem , because most of the newer apps that work as guitar amps -- including Native Instruments ' Guitar Rig 4
Pro and the free version of Sonoma Wireworks '
RiffWorks T4 -- require OS X 10.5 ( Snow Leopard ) .
A Gibson electric guitar , a Cakewalk UA - 1G audio interface , Reaper software and an old iBook combine to create a great guitar amp .
I ended up using Cockos Inc. 's Reaper because it 's shareware ; you can buy it for $ 60 after 30 days ( $ 225 for the full commercial version ) .
It works well on older Macs because it's a light app that does n't use all of the latest bells and whistles of the Mac OS Core Audio components .
The software has guitar distortion sounds , delays and grungy hard rock settings .
Now that I had my amp , I needed an audio interface .
I already had a Cakewalk UA - 1G , which is a slimline device with just one volume button , a quarter - inch port for the guitar and an attached USB cable .
The driver for the UA - 1G worked great with the iBook 3G running OS X 10.4 .
I connected a pair of powered speakers and brought my iBook back from the dead , ready to rock .
Interestingly , the sound quality on this older iBook was still quite amazing , mostly because it's not necessarily the Mac that 's generating the sound -- your computer becomes a fancy controller for the audio interface .
In fact , quality ( and the all - important power output ) depends more on the speakers you use .
I used a pair of Boston Acoustics RS 334 floorstanding speakers that sounded outstanding .

Destined to Fail – Magical Thinking at the G20
The G20 meeting has revealed two important things that tell us something about our combined economic future .
First we learned that the US lost the battle to try to get everyone back on the Keynesian print - a- thon bandwagon .
This tells us something about US leadership in these troubled times .
Once - upon - a- time , the US could dictate such things , and those days are apparently over which deserves to be noted .
I am a supporter of austerity as the least worst of two paths which I will outline below ( the other being printing ) , but I want to be sure to give the global rejection of the US position on stimulus the proper attention it merits .
Here ’s the relevant information :
TORONTO — Despite President Obama ’s pitch at the summit meeting for developed nations here for continued stimulus measures to prevent another global economic downturn , the United States will go along with other leaders who are more concerned about rising debt and join in a commitment to cut their governments ’ deficits in half by 2013 , administration officials said on Saturday .
( Source – NYT – all quotes below from same article )
In the lead - up to the G20 , the US was lobbying heavily for a very different outcome .
The US wanted continued stimulus and thin - air money printing and made its plea for this policy stance very publicly in the days and weeks leading up to the G20 meeting .
The reasons for this stance are numerous and complex , but one stands out prominently : Elections are coming up .
If you are an incumbent , now is not the time to cut off the stimulus efforts .
The story here is that the US wants to stay on the path of printing , borrowing , and government stimulus , but a significant portion of the rest of the developed world has decided this is not a direction that makes sense .
Such fundamental splits in philosophy are what great historical turning points are made of .
The second thing we learned is that , despite these differences in how to fund future growth , there is nothing yet to indicate that any the world leaders are aware that the very concept of perpetual growth is an unworkable fallacy .
It ’s obvious , hopefully to even the most casual of thinkers , that someday , sooner or later , whatever growth one is engaged in will have to stop .
Nothing grows forever ; everything has a limit .
But apparently the concept of limits is not part of the magical framework of modern economic thinking ( emphasis mine , below ) :
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Obama , in their first private meeting since Mr. Cameron took office , acknowledged their different approaches toward balancing the need to promote greater economic growth and job creation in the short term with the long - term desire to reduce national debts , which reached dangerous heights during the downturn .
But they played down those differences .
It ’s funny how these things are always expressed as a “ need . ”
We “ need ” economic growth and job creation .
Have you ever wondered why this is ?
Why is it that we “ need ” either ?
Needs are not negotiable ; wants are .
How sure are we that job creation and economic growth are actually needs ?
Well , we need job growth , because there are more and more people entering the work force each year due to population growth .
If there were no population growth and everybody already had a job , then there would be no “ need ” to create jobs .
Zero percent job growth is the right amount for a stable population .
No growth = no need for new jobs .
So we can therefore reduce the politicians ' statements about the need for jobs to its more basic level and discover that they are really saying we “ need ” population growth .
It 's certainly been a very real and dominant factor for a very long time , but it is not a need .
There are many who would even say it should n't even be considered a “ want . ”
We can trace an enormous number of the problems or predicaments we face to over - population or to the strain that results from accommodating the needs of a growing population .
It seems to me that if job creation is a ‘ need ’ then we ’d do well to ask ourselves if we ’d prefer to spend our time trying to figure out how to create an ever larger number of jobs in perpetuity or if we ’d like to spend our time figuring out how to create a stable population .
While this may be an uncomfortable topic for some , it also happens to be reality .
Since it ’s logically true that eventually population growth will have to stop it ’s entirely probable that we ’d gain more bang for our buck if we expended our efforts towards creating a stable population than trying to build a perpetual - motion job creation machine .
And what about the “ need ” to grow the economy ?
Where does that come from ?
If you ’ve watched the Crash Course you know that this imperative for economic growth comes from the money system itself .
Debt - based money requires growth .
If we had a stable population engaged in stable and sustainable activities using non debt - based money as their freely circulating medium of exchange , then there would be no “ need ” for economic growth .
Zero percent economic growth would work just fine .
But we ’ve got a growing population and we ’ve got debt - based money and that ’s the long and the short of it .
Hence , we are stuck with the political reality that we “ need ” growth in the economy and job creation ( even though these “ needs ’ are self - inflicted by our decisions , not due to some fundamental law of the universe like gravity ) .
Knowing that something is wrong with this perpetual growth narrative , we 've taken to adding a few comforting words around ‘ growth ’ to make it seem as if our thinking is actually very clever and mature :
“ But we are aiming at the same direction , which is long - term sustainable growth that puts people to work , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Long - term sustainable growth ” that “ puts people to work . ”
Sounds good , does n’t it ?
Who could be against that ?
The problem is that the first part of the statement is an oxymoron .
There ’s no such thing as “ long - term sustainable growth ” .
Heck , in the long run , there ’s no such thing as “ sustainable growth . ”
Sooner or later , whether its bacteria in a Petri dish , mice in the pantry , or humans on a globe , growth stops .
The only question is whether you cease that growth by design , on your own terms , or by disaster on some other terms .
Whenever you hear the words “ sustainable growth ” I invite you to recall this line of thinking and ask yourself if such a thing as sustainable growth is even possible .
If it is , I have certainly I have never seen any workable plan , not even sketched onto a napkin in crayon , that explains how growth can be sustainable .
Growth always ceases the only question is when and under what terms .
Some more quotes from the G20 :
Mr. Cameron added , “ Those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy which is absolutely vital to growth . ”
(...)
The Obama administration did have allies at the meeting in opposing rapid moves to withdraw governments ’ stimulus measures .
The Brazilian finance minister , Guido Mantega , told reporters that the debt - reduction targets could compromise economic growth
(...)
Trying to bridge the differences among leaders here , [ Timothy Geithner ] said : “ Our challenge , as the G - 20 , is to act together to strengthen the prospects for growth .
This will require different strategies in different countries .
We are coming out of the crisis at different speeds . ”
(...)
The setback underscored the difficulty Mr. Obama has had in making the case for stimulus .
At home as abroad , Mr. Obama is confronting the limits of the consensus that took hold after the economic crisis began in 2008 , which favored bigger deficits to spur job creation .
At stake , as the administration sees it , is continued global recovery or a relapse into another recession .
Recovery , growth , and jobs .
This is what the world seems to want in unison , and this is something we can easily understand and appreciate given the fact that all the world ’s leaders were born and raised during a period without limits .
Now that we can clearly see a wall of limits right in front of us , the question remains as to which countries will be able to navigate the treacherous shoals of change as we try to find a different set of understandings upon which to build a new world that can offer prosperity without growth .
It ’s a big challenge and I am keeping my fingers crossed that somehow we ’ll manage to figure out that our current trajectory is unsustainable and that we need entirely new thinking , centered on reality , to enter our global discourse .
The alternative is to default into the comforting arms of growth only to discover , much to our dismay , that it was prosperity we wanted after all and that growth and prosperity are very different things .
In a world of limits , one steals from the other .
My preference would be to have prosperity be the thief and growth the victim , but our leaders seek the opposite .
This theme of what we might expect in a world of limits is a dominant portion of my analysis that I perform for my enrolled members .
We do not live in a world where anything will suddenly run out , but a world where there will be slightly less and less that needs to be spread around more and more people , and more and more debt .
Running an analysis of all three E’s , the Economy , Energy and the Environment , and tying these to personal actions and financial implications is one unique service I that I provide .
The other is to be your information scout .
The Challenge For The US
Now , back to the more immediate challenge for the US :
Yet even within Mr. Obama ’s administration there are fault lines on how much additional stimulus is desirable .
Some news reports in recent days suggested that Peter R. Orszag , the budget director who recently announced that he would be leaving in late July , was resigning partly out of frustration that he had lost the argument for deeper and quicker reductions in projected deficits .
The apparent rift here is between Orszag , who wants the US to begin to live within its economic means , and the staunch Keynesians Geithner and Summers who want to print and spend to achieve political aims .
As a card - carrying member of the green eyeshade club , Mr. Orszag knows that their path represents the eventual and probably catastrophic bankruptcy of the US .
Rather than continue to duke it out with the “ print now , pay later ” club , Orszag has opted to leave for greener and friendlier climes .
In full disclosure , Larry Summers is among my least favorite people on the planet .
I cannot figure out how he manages to get to such prominent positions given the fact that his track record is a nearly unblemished trail of poor decisions and economic ruin .
Everything in his record suggests that his only form of competency is political ambition , yet somehow he keeps getting his ideas enacted .
It ’s a real mystery and not the good kind , like where that extra $ 20 in your pocket came from .
In my view Summers is a gigantic liability for this country and the current administration and the sooner he is sent packing the better .
Geithner too for that matter .
At any rate , the G20 plan calls for the US to cut its existing budget deficit to only 3 % of GDP by 2013 .
For the US this would represent a decline from a $ 1.4 trillion deficit to a roughly $ 420 billion deficit , or ~ $ 1 trillion in cuts in just three years .
Without getting too technical , this is just not going to happen .
Cutting a trillion in federal spending would cut 7 % from the GDP .
And even if we were willing to undertake a 7 % hit to GDP , where would the trillion come from ?
It turns out that much of the US deficit is now structural meaning it sits in the “ mandatory ” column as opposed to the “ discretionary ” column .
To help frame the predicament , I ’ll note that Obama recently proposed a three - year freeze on all non-defense discretionary budget spending which – drum roll please – constitutes only $ 447 billion out of a $ 3.5 trillion budget .
In other words , finding a trillion is simply out of the question if the only part of the budget that can be controlled right now because it is both discretionary and politically viable in an election year , is only $ 447 billion .
You ca n’t squeeze blood from a stone and you can't save a trillion from a budget of less than half a trillion .
And that ’s only part of the problem .
One path to getting the deficit to 3 % from its current 10 % of GDP is to cut spending .
However , this path carries the seeds of its own failure .
Government spending is a big part of GDP so cutting spending shrinks the GDP .
The more spending is cut the more GDP shrinks which makes the deficit ratio less favorable .
Adding insult to injury , government revenues expand and shrink in proportion to GDP so cutting spending actually leads to reduced revenues which leads to higher deficits which lead to more cutting which results in an endless spiral into the dumpster .
The other path consists of elevated government borrowing and spending done with the hope that eventually GDP climbs up over time thereby reducing the deficit to GDP ratio .
The US sees this as the only viable option but Europe has figured out that this path too has its own ‘ end - game ’ which is the eventual collapse of sovereign debt and the high likelihood of associated political and social chaos .
Neither option is really attractive at this point , which is the definition of a predicament .
My final analysis is that because we have such political animals as Summers driving the ship of state the US will tell the G20 it agrees to the plan but will not honor those words .
At least not during this election year .
And probably not next year either because it will be inconvenient then too for some reason or another .
And probably not ever unless forced by external circumstances because the political class in the US seems unable to confront the idea that limits apply .
And so the US , and its ever compliant side - kick Japan , will continue to spend wildly even as Europe dutifully wrestles with the new reality .
At first it will seem like the US is the place to invest because its ‘ growth prospects ’ will appear stronger but someday , and not too terribly far in the future , it will dawn on the financial markets that the US is a hopeless basket case saturated with debts that cannot ever be paid back under current terms .
This is already true , but for some reason financial markets seem ignorant of this reality .
Someday there will be a sudden revolt in the Treasury markets , a new equilibrium will be found , and vast quantities of wealth and our national standards of living will disappear seemingly overnight .
And that ’s only if those other two E ’s do n’t thunder out of the chute and into the arena for all to see .
Then all bets are off .
There has been a rise in racist attacks in the Foyle area over the last year .
Police said there were 17 more incidents compared to the previous 12 - month period .
Homophobic attacks increased from eight to 10 .
The figures came to light after two men were assaulted in Londonderry at the weekend .
They said they were targeted because they are gay .
The couple , aged 22 and 38 , were beaten by three men in the city centre at about 0200 BST on Saturday morning .
The police are treating it as a homophobic attack .
" I believe there are low - level hate incidents that happen on a day and daily basis , " said Inspector Tony Callaghan .
" Whether it 's race based , religion based , sectarian , homophobic or relating to disabilities .
People out there are suffering in silence . "
The men attacked on Saturday morning suffered cuts and bruising to their faces .
One of the men , who did not want to be identified , said it had affected both of them badly .
" I 'm terrified of going to bed , I 'm terrified walking down the street , " he said .
" I 've got to walk my fella to his work because he 's terrified .
" It 's just absolutely soul destroying and it's not on . "
' Sinister '
David McCartney from gay support group Rainbow Project said the impact of a hate attack was " quite extraordinary " .
" It 's not that random , violent assault , " he said .
" There is something more sinister and more hateful and hurtful to it and you 're left feeling you do n't belong .
" You 're left feeling you 're not a part of this community , you 're singled out , set apart and picked upon . "
Foyle MP Mark Durkan said the attack was " sickening " .
" Regardless of whether it expresses itself in the sort of wanton attack on this gay couple or in the subtle prejudice we see all too often , homophobia is inexcusable .
" As a community we need to show our solidarity with those who suffer this awful prejudice .
And we need to show those who attack them that it is they who are in the tiny minority in this society . "
For the most part , 8 : The Mormon Proposition is n’t a revelatory film .
You get mostly what you expect : a quasi- David and Goliath tale in which the LGBTQ community , a social and political underdog , loses to the moneyed , influential Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints .
Marc Peyser of Newsweek criticized the predictability of the film ’s message , writing , “ [ I ] n the Michael Moore era of documentaries , the audience is always preselected , so the film might as well play to the crowd . ”
I ’m somewhat inclined to agree .
Certain elements of 8 , like the obvious cinematographic discrepancies between how the LGBTQ community and its allies
are treated compared to the anti-gay Mormons — filmed in bright vs. bland colors respectively and clumsy graphics ( e.g. , cartoonish money raining down on a Mormon temple ) detract from its overall effectiveness .
But despite its heavy - handedness , 8 does more than pander to bleeding - heart liberals .
It raises real questions about whether religious organizations should be held accountable for the money and manpower they pump into political campaigns .
For instance , according to internal church documents and messages examined in 8 , the Mormon church meticulously plans and actively fundraises for anti-gay political action .
The conservative National Organization for Marriage ?
Pretty much a Mormon front organized to keep the church out of the limelight .
The $ 22 million Mormons across the country donated to the campaign against Prop 8 ?
Pretty much demanded of parishioners in a message from the Mormon Prophet Thomas Monson .
Critics might say all the footage of gay and lesbians couples and allies crying and reiterating how “ this is about love ” seems calculated to melt viewers into a puddle of sympathetic tears .
Actually , this is 8 at its best .
According to the documentary ’s website , director Reed Cowan intended to make a film about the high rates of teen homelessness and suicide in Utah before changing focus .
The idea was to highlight the damaging anti-gay ideology inherent to Mormonism by concentrating on the campaign as a “ cornerstone ” of that ideology .
The negative effects of homophobia in the Mormon church are portrayed most powerfully in two examples .
One , a gay couple is deeply hurt by the hate heaped upon them by their Mormon family members .
Another , ironically composed of elements of the abandoned original documentary , chronicles homeless gay teens and former Mormons who attempted to commit suicide because they are LGBTQ .
One of the more poignant moments in 8 occurs when Fred and Marilyn Matis are quoted from In Quiet Desperation : Understanding the Challenge of Same - Gender Attraction , a book they co-authored to present a pro-Mormon response to their son Stuart ’s suicide .
In it , they say their son ’s death was a relief .
Though it ’s not groundbreaking , 8 ’s message is fairly strong : the church encourages a hate so powerful that some Mormon parents would rather their children die than be gay .
Fresh Greek protests erupted ahead of new austerity measures as we discussed here .
For a sense of how bad things are , see the video below where ranked police are hit by a protester 's firebomb .
Keep in mind this rage is happening before substantial austerity measures have even taken effect .

A massive number of people illegally enter the USA every day by simply walking unchallenged across our southern border .
In the 1952 miles of border from California to Texas they use literally thousands of trails and paths , ever changing their routes to avoid detection .
Cartel involvement has brought increased organizational skills to smuggling operations and , contrary to government claims , only a very small percentage are apprehended .
Accurate statistics are impossible to gather , but the true numbers are staggering , and the general public remains largely uninformed .

09/09/09 - Border Invasion Pics has been posting hidden camera video of border intruders walking unchallenged into the U.S. since November 2008 .
An ever increasing number of Washington DC visitors to the website indicates that national politicians and their appointees are viewing the action .
The evidence presented contradicts Janet Napolitano 's statements about how difficult it has become to cross the border illegally , and it appears that DHS has seen enough Border Invasion Pics videos .
Especially like the August release showing over 400 illegal aliens marching into the U.S. -- 5 miles north of the border , on just one trail , in only 35 days .
August 2009 Video - 400 Illegal Aliens ( Since release of this video , our cameras are being hunted and stolen at an alarming rate . )
In July 2009 the U.S. Border Patrol initiated a large scale 24/7 operation to curb the flood of illegal alien traffic entering the Huachuca Mountains from the south .
While the Border Patrol has previously conducted temporary operations in this area , this is a fully resourced long term effort .
We should expect to see a large decline in illegal traffic through this area .

Most front line Border Patrol agents are active and dedicated , but they are few in number relative to their large area of responsibility .
Not only do these agents lack the necessary recources to effectively cope with the problem , they must remain aware of possible prosecution and incarceration by their own government for being too good at the job they are sworn to do .
Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean remain unforgettable examples .

Running from law enforcement is a criminal offense and incurs stiff criminal penalty - if you 're a legal resident .
This is not the case with illegal aliens and they know it .
It is now common practice for them to scatter in all directions when apprehension is attempted .
Since Border Patrol agents often work alone , it is unreasonable to expect an agent to capture more than one or two border intruders out of any group that " quails " .

Repeat : one night , one location .
These border intruders had entered this country unchallenged until private citizens brought them " out of the shadows " .
Politically motivated claims of improved border security do n't change the truth - an invasion is in progress across our southern border .

This website is dedicated to posting current pictoral evidence of the invasion of suspected border intruders across the USA / Mexico border .
No form of immigration reform can be successful as long as the type of activity shown on this website can be captured on camera every day by U.S. citizens along the border .
Please recommend this website to others - especially to self - serving politicians who refuse to legislate in the best interest of our nation .
The argument that illegal aliens are skilled and productive workers is unsupportable - look at the evidence .
Open borders are a problem , not a solution .

Le match n'aura sans doute pas lieu lors de la primaire de désignation du candidat pour 2012 .
Martine Aubry et Dominique Strauss - Kahn ont déjà fait savoir qu'ils ne s'affronteraient pas .
« Entre lui et moi , il n'y aura pas de difficulté » , assurait encore la première secrétaire mercredi .
En réalité , la bataille se sera déroulée bien avant et sur un autre terrain : celui de l'opinion .
« C'est le mieux placé qui sera candidat » , dit - on au PS .
Alors chacun observe les sondages .
Selon notre enquête OpinionWay , c'est Dominique Strauss - Kahn qui garde l'avantage pour l'instant .
Jeudi soir , sur le plateau d'« À vous de juger » , sur France 2 , dont il est l'invité , il ne pourra que s'en féliciter , même s'il n'est pas là pour ça .
Il vient faire de « la pédagogie sur la crise » , expliquent ses partisans .
L'enjeu économique est majeur .
Mais l'enjeu d'image pour DSK n'est pas négligeable non plus .
L'ancien ministre veut quitter les rubriques politiques qui ne s'intéressent qu'à 2012 pour retrouver les questions de fonds qui ont forgé sa crédibilité .
Il entend aussi dissocier son action des conséquences de la rigueur , notamment en Grèce : la critique commence à poindre à gauche sur l'austérité imposée par le FMI ?
Pour 2012 , il est toujours perçu comme le favori .
Pour 65 % des sympathisants de gauche , le directeur du FMI « peut battre Nicolas Sarkozy » .
Ils ne sont que 30 % à croire aux chances de Martine Aubry et 19 % à celles de Ségolène Royal .
François Hollande est loin derrière , à 9 % .
La situation est encore plus nette en ce qui concerne la stature de chef d'État .
DSK la possède largement , à 64 % , la première secrétaire a encore des preuves à faire ( 27 % ) de même que l'ancienne candidate à la présidentielle ( 20 % ) .
Dans le détail des « compétences comparées » des leaders du PS , la bataille est plus serrée .
Si la fonction de Dominique Strauss - Kahn à la tête d'une institution financière internationale lui donne un avantage très net pour incarner la « France dans le monde » ou améliorer la « croissance économique » , il est jugé à qualité égale avec Martine Aubry en ce qui concerne « l'emploi » .
33 % des sympathisants de gauche jugent la numéro un du PS compétente sur la question , contre 32 % pour DSK .
La première secrétaire creuse l'écart sur un autre domaine : « la protection sociale » .
Ce qui inclut le débat du moment sur la réforme des retraites .
44 % des sympathisants de gauche l'estiment compétente , contre 22 % pour Ségolène Royal et 21 % pour Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
Même résultat lorsqu'il est question « d'inégalités sociales » ( respectivement 42 % , 26 % et 16 % ) .
L'ancienne candidate à la présidentielle ne devance ses deux concurrents que sur un seul sujet : « l' environnement » , l'un de ses thèmes de prédilection .
Sur l'éducation , elle fait jeu égal avec Martine Aubry avec 32 % , devant DSK qui ne recueille que 18 % .
François Hollande , lui , ne perce nulle part .
Il n'y a aucun sujet , a priori , qui lui permettrait de prendre l'avantage sur ses concurrents .

Now here is an interesting one .
TaerkEX , a member of DeviantART has created a simple APNG ( Animated PNG ) animation .
What ’s so great about that ?
Well , picture contains two frames .
Therefore , if your browser does not support APNG , you should only see the very first one .
Like this ( .gif format ) :
Otherwise ( .gif format ) :
Here is original picture , open this post in two different browsers and you shall see the difference .
Pretty neat , huh ?

All functions that set HTTP headers such as with header ( ) and setcookie ( ) are now intercepted by Xdebug .
The intercepted headers are stored internally in an array that can be retrieved by calling the xdebug_get_headers ( ) function .
This is very useful in cases where you need to test certain functionality that sets headers somewhere deep in code .
This function is also used in eZ Components ' test suite to test whether the correct HTTP headers are set in the MvcTools component .
Variable Assignment Tracing
The new setting xdebug.collect_assignments allows you to record changes to variables in scripts to trace files .
I 've already written more about it in Variable tracing with Xdebug .
" Scream " Support
The scream PECL extension disables the @ ( shut - up ) operator to actually see all notices , warnings and errors that PHP generates .
The scream extension 's functionality have been duplicated as Xdebug 's xdebug .scream php.ini setting .
Why disabling the @ - operator is a good thing , I 've already outlined in Five reasons why the shut - op operator ( @ ) should be avoided .
Additions for Stack Traces
All HTML containers generated by Xdebug ( error messages , xdebug_var_dump ( ) output ) now contain a CSS class for easier styling .
The new setting xdebug .
file_link_format allows you to turn any file / line link in Xdebug 's output to be decorated to a link with a specific format .
For example you can set it to txmt://open/?file://%f&line=%l for opening files directly in Textmate , or gvim ://% f@%l with some shell script for gvim and Firefox .
Remote Debugging
The new setting xdebug .
remote_connect_back , contributed by Lucas Nealan and Brian Shire , allows Xdebug to try to make a debugging connection to the IP address from which the browser request came from .
This setting is an additional solution for debugging with multiple users .
The old gdb and php3 remote debugging engines have been removed .
Overloaded var_dump
The newly introduced setting xdebug.overload_var_dump can be used to turn off Xdebug 's default behavior of overriding PHP's var_dump ( ) function with the xdebug_var_dump ( ) function that uses pretty HTML for formatting a variable structure .
It does not stop xdebug_var_dump ( ) from working however .
Donations
You can probably imagine that writing and support Xdebug is a time - consuming effort .
It 's a tool that saves a lot of work during developement of applications , as well while debugging .
If you think Xdebug is valuable for you , perhaps you would like to consider a donation .
All donations are greatly appreciated and support future development and availablity of Xdebug .

Leeway is just one of those things that is a law of the universe that we have to put up with .
It ’s just like gravity .
Still with gravity – the advantage is that it ’s highly predictable .
And so then is leeway .
Leeway is the sideways slip motion of our sailboat down wind from the pressure of wind against our boat and sails .
It results in a course that is less than desirable .
Airplanes suffer from the same issue .
When flying in a cross wind , the plane crabs ( slide slips ) downwind .
The course becomes different from the heading .
Not accounting for leeway will have you sailing ( or flying ) in a fairly unnoticeable arc to get to the mark .
To represent an example with a mark to the north and a westerly crosswind , here ’s what happens ; you aim for the mark at 000 , your boat slips sideways to the west .
Now your mark is at 359 but you do n’t really notice it .
After a few minutes your mark is at 358 still in noticed .
Minutes later your heading is 355 then 350 etc .
All because you keep aiming at the mark but you ’re being pushed to the east by the wind .
Your course over ground becomes an arc and is the long way around .
The prudent sailor will account for the leeway and sail a constant heading depending on their known leeway of say 350 for the example above .
The sideways slip motion will deliver them to the mark in a straight and shortest line .
Now that we ’re in the electronic age , navigators will plug in the destination to the gps .
The autopilot which is cross talking to the gps takes care of the rest .
The gps analyses the cross track ( the boat ’s distance away from a straight line to the mark ) and feeds back to the autopilot the proper heading to minimize this in real time .
Thus resulting in a straight course to the mark .
I ’m doubt that during the Wednesday / Friday night beer can race such electronic methods are utilized .
So I ’m suggesting that to take line honors and win the bottle of rum at your club race by taking account of leeway .
Leeway is particularly more prevalent when you are sailing on a close haul or close reach and can be as much as 20 degrees depending on the wind conditions , water conditions , your sailboat design , your apparent angle with the wind and how your sails are set .
However , other than buying a new boat , the only thing that you have control over is the trim of your boat and sails .
Here ’s a couple of general rules to follow :
Over sheeted sails cause more sideways force and thus sideways slip ( leeway ) .
Fly the telltales diligently .
Aim for a position to windward of the mark you ’re trying to go around .
The more you are sailing on an upwind course , the more the degrees upwind you should aim .
The higher the wind speed , the higher above the mark you should aim .
In general , on a close haul , allow 10 - 15 degrees .
Adjust this less if the wind is light , more if the wind is strong .
Reduce this amount linearly as you bare away from the wind .
Make sure your boat is trimmed with slight weather helm .
When doing serious navigation we absolutely must account for leeway and an excellent understanding of how your boat performs leeway wise is essential and how to solve for it once you know it .
NauticEd developed an educational navigation video solving a leeway and current exercise at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LQcFOGSJQs
Using a gps and a nice steady windy day , you can do a simple determination of your sailboat ’s typical leeway .
(1) Begin sailing on an angle slightly off a close haul direction and with a recognizable land marker dead ahead .
(2) Measure your speed
(3) Douse the sails and begin motoring at the same speed in exactly the same direction .
(4) Take note of your gps course .
(5) Deploy the sails and turn off the engine .
(6) Continue to aim for the same point on land .
(7) Now read out your gps course .
(8) The difference in course angles will be your leeway
(9) Repeat for different points of sail
( 10 ) Repeat for the opposite tack .
( 11 ) Repeat on different days with different wind strengths
Note that :
( a ) this method is relatively immune from current because you have normalized it out by performing the motoring task .
( b ) this method will not account for the leeway due to the hull of your boat presented to the wind .
We hope you enjoy your bottle of Rum !
A researcher has uncovered a potentially serious vulnerability in the open - source content management system used by the White House website and thousands of other sites .
The XSS , or cross -site scripting , bug resides in the Drupal Context module , a plug - in that Whitehouse.gov and about 10,000 other sites use to manage how content is viewed on their sites .
According to an advisory published Monday by researcher Justin Klein Keane , the flaw allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into login pages that will reset the site 's administrative password .
The discovery is notable because it comes less than three weeks after the White House released a plug - in of its own that requires use of the vulnerable Context module .
It raises questions about the level of review carried out by the people who coded the Context HTTP Headers module .
Administration officials installed it on the sensitive Obama website and released it to great fanfare in late April at the DrupalCon conference in San Francisco .
" My worry is that they just launched this revamped Drupal site and it does n't look like anybody did a serious security audit , " said a security researcher who has reviewed the bug and asked that his name not be used in this article .
" You can find this hole without much digging , but who knows what else may or may not be there .
If one had done that kind of vulnerability assessment even casually , you would expect you would uncover these kinds of things . "
Officials with the Drupal project said the bug can be exploited only when attackers already have lower - level administrative privileges to the webserver .
And even then , a vulnerable page would have to be set up to allow the attacker to create " blocks , " which is Drupal parlance for widgets or other chunks of content .
" That 's a very uncommon thing to have happen , " said Greg Knaddison , a member of the Drupal security team who said he was speaking to The Register in his capacity as a partner with Growing Venture Solutions , a consultancy for websites built on Drupal .
Because the vulnerability resides in a release - candidate module , the Drupal project wo n't be coordinating a security fix .
Knaddison has posted a full set of mitigation steps here , which also includes a link to a module patch .
Drupal project managers said they had been communicating with the bug discoverer for several weeks prior to the disclosure .
The big selling point of open source software has long been that its source code can be reviewed by thousands or even millions of users , making it more likely that security flaws will be quickly diagnosed and fixed .
And yet in this case , the easy - to - spot bug in the Context module went unnoticed by the White House developers even though it formed the foundation of their own revamped website and a newer module they released to world + dog .
It 's not the first incident to raise questions about how Whitehouse.gov is secured .
But Knaddison said discovery of the hard - to - exploit bug was proof that the open - source model does hold up to its promise .
" This kind of points to the benefits of investigating the code at a code level versus looking at it from a black - box perspective , " he said .
" If you can look at the code , then it 's probably something that can be found very easily . " ®

Their most sumptuous day is the 10th each month -- pay day .
That day , all the ATMs and themed restaurants are packed with long lines , and consequently the ATMs are often drawn empty .
The salary 's made up of the ¥900 ( $ 132 ) local minimum wage and the variable overtime pay .
Each employee would sign a " voluntary overtime affidavit , " in order to waive the 36 - hour legal limit on your monthly overtime hours .
This is n't a bad thing , though , as many workers think that only factories that offer more overtime are " good factories , " because " without overtime , you can hardly make a living . "
For the workers desperate for making money , overtime is like " a pain that can breathe : " without it , the days without money make them " suffocate ; " with it , the restless work would only add more " pain " to the body , thus aging quicker .
Most of the time they staunchly choose the latter , but even the right to choose such is n't available to all .
Only those with the seniors ' " trust , " with good connections , or those in key positions , can often get to work overtime .
So , the " May 1st " [ Labour Day ] festival is a concern for some , because it 's " hard to boil through " the days when you spend money without making any .
That day , workers would rather not celebrate any festival , and wish for more overtime pay ; the reality is they can't [ choose ] , so might as well just have a lie - in .
In front of a newly - opened phone shop , the sales assistant flashed an iPhone to the Foxconn employees , with everyone focused on his every " cool " gesture , as if it was something new .
But actually , Foxconn 's manufacturing covers almost every well - known brands ' gadgets , including the iPhone and the iPad , so every part of this " new " device would 've come from the hands of these workers , except these guys had never thought of owning the final product .
And now , this whole thing is right in front of their eyes with a " smashing price of ¥ 2,198 ( $ 322 ) " -- just above their monthly pay .
This is an expensive device , so instead they discussed how to spend some hundred yuan on a shanzhai handset .
When chatting with them , I often struggled to respond , as I felt I was ridiculously fortunate .
They actually envied those who could take a leave due to work injury , while casually joking about how their station 's been toxicated .
When talking about their colleagues ' suicidal jumps , there was often a surprisingly calm reaction , and sometimes even a banter would be made about it , as if they were all outsiders .
I 'm happy to see them as a bunch of optimistic and determined people , and I wish they really had nothing to do with these [ suicides ] .
But whatever way you look at this , it 's inevitably sad .
I even imagine possessing a power that can change everything , but this is like Wang Kezhu saying " I wish someone could give him [ sic ] a kick for a five minute break " during our night shift -- so naïve , and it 's never going to happen .
If you ask the workers what their dream is , you 'll often get the same answer : start a business , make money , get rich , and then you can do whatever you want .
In the warehouse , they humorously name their hydraulic trolleys " BMWs . "
They , of course , would rather own actual BMWs , or at least " BMW " kind of wealth .
They often dream , but also repeatedly tearing apart their dreams , like a miserable painter who keeps tearing up his or her drafts , " if we keep working like this , we might as well quit dreaming for the rest of our lives . "
They manufacture the world 's top electronic products , yet gathering their own fortune at the slowest possible pace .
The office 's guest network account has a password that ends with " 888 " -- like many businessmen , they love this number , and they worship its phonetic equivalence [ " rich " ] .
Little did they know that it 's their own hands protecting the country 's " 8 , " yet their overtime hours , lottery tickets , and even horse racing bets , struggle to find the " 8 " that belongs to themselves .
The hard - working Wang Kezhu moaned that the salary was too low , but when he tried to apply for courses outside he " could n't understand a word , " so he gave up .
He said without much knowledge , he could only get whatever job that came first , and that this was fate .
Sometimes he'd say he's got a big headache , but would quickly become alive again .
When pulling trolleys he'd often run , as if the 24 boxes of goods weigh sod all .
Every day he'd climb up two to three - meter tall box stacks to check inventory , and would squeeze into small gaps to check the labels .
I asked him why push so hard , but he never answered , until one morning I saw him stopping in front of a pillar , and suddenly shouted " help ! "
He probably did n't know what he'd just blurted out , either , but I heard the real souls .
They 're used to putting in so much effort to make a change , until that effort became a struggle , and that they were n't even sure if they had the power to break through the cocoon .
In the factory area , those neatly planned tall buildings had nothing special apart from their alphanumeric codes on the top .
The machines , boxes and even the uniformed workers inside all bear the same pattern .
One morning , on my way to work I saw two heads poking out of the buildings , just gazing at the pedestrians .
Too far away , could n't see their expressions , nor could I hear them , just two black dots at the window .
If stood in their positions , the road 's no doubt just full of moving black dots , so insignificant in comparison to the large white buildings .
This factory 's workers rule the world 's finest gadgets ' assembly lines with their two hands , and continuously break trading records that buzz the world , holding the Chinese export champion title for seven years non-stop .
But it seems like while they 're controlling the machines , the machines also have them dominated : the parts gradually come together as they move up the assembly line ; at the same time , the workers ' pure and only youth also disappear into the rhythmic machineries .
After using the toilet at 4 am , I stuck my ear on the workshop corridor wall , and listened to the machines rumbling steadily from all four directions -- this is the factory 's heartbeat .
The employees work , walk and eat at this beat , so no wonder I was walking so fast , eating so quickly without anyone hurrying me , even though it did n't feel good .
You 're like a component that 's entered the assembly line , just following the rhythm , belonging to that heartbeat at 4 am , no way to escape .
Shenzhen , a once small border town that leaped to one of Pearl River Delta 's busiest cities , hides a group of anxious young people behind row upon row of tall buildings .
In 2009 , Times magazine nominated " The Chinese Worker " as " Person of the Year , " praising its " determined vision shone on the future of mankind , " * but this so - called " determination " is needed to resist being mechanized and eroded by capitalism .
Can they really avoid such " determination ? "
When computers , phones , cars , and all other commercial products become the products of capitalism , sweat , youth , and even life , all these values are exhausted by capitalism as well .
This super factory that holds some 400,000 people is n't the " sweatshop " that most would imagine .
It provides accommodation that reaches the scale of a medium - sized town , all smooth and orderly .
Compared to others , the facilities here are well - equipped and superior , with employee treatment meeting standard specifications .
Thousands of people flock here each day just to find a place of their own , to find a dream that they 'll probably never realize .
This is n't a factory 's inside story , but the fate of a generation of workers .
( As requested by the interviewee , he 's given " Wang Kezhu " as his alias in this article . )

The actual quote in the classic edition of Time is rather different , so we 'll assume this was taken from the Chinese edition .
Commenter SeeKo just dropped in links for a three - part Chinese TV news segment on the Foxconn incidents , all close - captioned .
Editor 's note : Phillip Dennis is the founder of the Dallas Tea Party and sits on a three - person steering committee .
He is also the Texas state coordinator of Tea Party Patriots and an adviser to the National Tea Party Coalition .
( CNN ) --
The Tea Party movement began when a small group of conservatives organized protests on Twitter against the stimulus bill in 22 American cities on February 27 , 2009 .
The majority of us had never attended a protest and had to take a vacation day to attend .
From these few hundred people , a national movement demanding fiscal conservatism , national sovereignty and the rule of law landed on America 's political front lawn .
Neither Democrats nor Republicans fully understand the Tea Party 's inner workings or how to manipulate or co-opt it -- and they wo n't be able to .
The modern - day Tea Party movement is managed by political newcomers whose primary motivation is love of country and a desire for a better future for their children .
Like anything else that grows into a national phenomenon , the Tea Party has seen some enter the scene with ulterior motives .
Generally , the motives center around money .
Some have slapped the Tea Party name on their tired political action committees .
Others are organizations with political interests and agendas , but foremost are the money - gathering operations .
Others are big - name politicians or media personalities such as Sarah Palin , who charge up to $ 100,000 a speech before packing up and taking their show to another city .
They leave little lasting substance , and their words are quickly forgotten .
I do n't fault anyone for making money , even on the Tea Party name .
Like Don Barzini said in " The Godfather , " " After all , we are not communists . "
However , these individuals and organizations are what I call " tea turf " groups , echoing Nancy Pelosi 's early labeling of the Tea Party movement as an " astro turf " grassroots movement controlled by the Republican Party .
Technically , these tea turf groups and personalities are a part of the movement but most likely would not be if big dollars were not involved .
I regard the " pure in heart " Tea Party leaders as the real center and strength of the movement .
These are the people who work full - time jobs , have family responsibilities and make time to manage and grow their own group .
The Dallas Tea Party has subdivided the Dallas - Fort Worth metro region into ZIP codes and voting districts .
Each zone has one or more neighborhood coordinators charged with recruiting members , organizing meetings , getting out the vote and spreading the Tea Party message of fiscal responsibility , the rule of law and national sovereignty to their friends and neighbors .
Nearly every night of the week , dozens of meetings are taking place throughout the metro region , taking on school board , city council , state government legislation and other issues .
The goal is to get middle - class taxpayers engaged in local politics and into the primary and general election voting booths as never before .
Each of these neighborhood coordinators and the people they lead are volunteers .
The time they devote to the Tea Party movement comes at the expense of something else in their busy lives .
These people do n't get huge speaking fees .
They do n't appear on national news shows .
They do n't sell books or merchandise .
They do what they do because of their devotion to Tea Party principles .
These people are the true heroes of the Tea Party movement .
The Tea Party will continue to grow in numbers and power as our leaders in Washington continue to govern irresponsibly .
There will be many who try to take ownership of the movement .
Certainly , the mainstream media would like nothing more than a single target to attack .
Yet , the Tea Party will succeed .
If one leader in a sea of thousands falls , another will replace him or her just as a starfish grows another arm if one is cut off .
The Tea Party movement is not about individuals but ideals .
The ideals found in the Constitution set the course for the United States becoming the most powerful and wealthy nation in history .
The true leaders of the Tea Party are doing that because of love of country and a belief in constitutional principles .
That 's something no tea turf PAC can buy -- not even for $ 100,000 a speech .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Phillip Dennis .
SEOUL , South Korea ( AP ) — North Korea vowed Saturday to launch an all - out attack against South Korean loudspeakers and other propaganda facilities along their heavily fortified border , warning it could even turn Seoul into a " sea of flame . "
The rival Koreas ended decades of propaganda campaigns in 2004 as their relations warmed .
However , South Korea resumed radio broadcasts to North Korea last month and installed a dozen propaganda loudspeakers along the border to punish the North for allegedly sinking a South Korean warship .
South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae - young told a parliamentary hearing Friday that loudspeaker broadcasts would begin after the U.N. Security Council decides on any new measures against the North , Yonhap news agency reported .
South Korea has asked the U.N. Security Council to punish the North for what Seoul says was a North Korean torpedo attack on the 1,200 - ton Cheonan warship that killed 46 sailors .
A multinational investigation led by South Korea concluded last month that North Korea was responsible .
The North has denied responsibility and threatened to respond to South Korean retaliatory measures with war .
The General Staff of the Korean People 's Army said in a statement Saturday that North Korea would launch an " all - out military strike " to blow up any propaganda facilities along the border , and that its retaliation would be " a merciless strike foreseeing even the turn of Seoul ... into a sea of flame . "
The statement was carried by the official Korean Central News Agency .
Seoul , South Korea 's capital of over 10 million people , is just 37 miles ( 60 kilometers ) south of the border , well within North Korean artillery range .
The North 's military earlier warned it would fire at any propaganda facilities installed in the Demilitarized Zone that has separated the two Koreas since the end of the 1950 - 53 Korean War , which concluded in a truce , not a peace treaty .
South Korea 's Defense Ministry said it had no immediate comment on the threat from North Korea .
South Korean troops increased their vigilance , although no unusual North Korean military movements were detected , an officer at Seoul 's Joint Chiefs of Staff said .
He asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media .
North Korea has for years threatened the South with destruction , though it has never followed through with an all - out military assault since the 1953 armistice was concluded .
In 1994 , the North threatened to turn Seoul into a " sea of fire " after talks with South Korea collapsed .
In 2008 , it also warned the South that " everything will be in ashes , not just a sea of fire . "
North Korea keeps two - thirds of its 1.2 million - strong military near the border .
The U.S. has about 28,500 troops in South Korea to deter possible North Korean aggression , while South Korea has a 655,000 - member military .
On Friday , the North 's National Defense Commission , headed by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , accused Seoul of " infringing upon the dignity and security " of North Korea and criticized it for not allowing North Korean inspectors to visit the South to probe the ship sinking .
In Washington , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley appeared skeptical of the North 's position .
" If North Korea wants to investigate the sinking of the Cheonan , as it indicated it might , it might start by taking an inventory of its torpedoes , " Crowley said Friday , according to a State Department transcript .
I ’m going to be a dad soon .
My wife is 20 weeks pregnant , lugging around a cute , little baby who weighs ten ounces and is roughly the length of a banana .
At this point , the fetus — whose sex will be determined next week — is already flexing its limbs , having dreams , and starting to swallow .
Its glands are also starting to secrete a waxy “ cheese - like ” substance called vernix caseosa .
Yum !
Most importantly , though , the baby ’s ears have finally developed enough to actually hear sound .
Making a mixtape to celebrate this development was obvious , but what kind of mix was I to make ?
While I could ’ve thrown together some shitty cute lullabies , the baby will hear plenty of those once it ’s born .
And since it ca n’t speak and can barely move , a sing - along or dance mix would be kind of insulting .
Besides , because the baby is tucked in my wife ’s belly , doing backstrokes in warm amniotic fluid , who ’s to say that all music wo n’t sound like Brian Eno ’s Ambient 1 : Music for Airports ?
So , I decided to make a mix suited specifically to the baby ’s environment .
Rather than catchy hooks , we have gentle vibrations by Can and Jim O’Rourke .
Rather than exploding beats , we have the soft pulses of Nobukazu Takemura and The Books .
Rather than rigid structures and compressed sonics , we have the fluidity of Boredoms and the ethereal frequencies of Oren Ambarchi .
My aim is not only to introduce music to our baby , but to also transmit these vibrations , these pulses , these frequencies through my wife ’s belly and through the amniotic fluid .
It ’s my way of saying “ Hello , welcome to the world of sound .
You ’ll love it even more once you ’re born . ”

A former family practitioner in Canada says she cured herself of the H1N1 swine flu by taking supplements of vitamin D and elderberries .
Dr. Gillian Arsenault , now a public health employee , said that she had a prescription for antiviral drugs on hand when she became infected with swine flu , but never ended up having to fill it .
Writing in the , Arsenault recounts how the flu " hit like a truck , " but was reduced to only a lingering cough within four days .
Arsenault has researched complementary health care extensively and began taking 1,000 IU of vitamin D daily in 2007 .
This is the amount recommended by the Canadian Cancer Society to help produce strong bones and reduce the risk of infection , cancer and other chronic diseases .
Over the course of 2009 , she experimented with doses between 3,000 and 5,000 IU .
" Medicine is my job and my hobby .
I spend a lot of time after work looking things up , " she said .
Researchers remain divided on the maximum safe daily dose of vitamin D , with estimates ranging between 2,000 and 10,000 IU .
High doses can interfere with the effects of some drugs , and may produce mild or severe toxicity , with symptoms as severe as kidney failure , seizures or psychosis .
Because research has suggested that vitamin D can help prevent infection , Arsenault set out to see if it could help her recover faster .
She adjusted her daily dose and paid to have her blood levels tested to make sure she remained within a safe and healthy range .
She added an elderberry extract as well , based on research showing that the plant can reduce the severity of flu and speed recovery .
Many cases of swine flu are mild or moderate even without vitamin D supplementation , and Arsenault admits that her case study is not proof that the treatment works .
But it is suggestive enough to merit further research into whether vitamin D can " abort the development of severe illness or enhance the benefit of antiviral treatment for those already seriously ill , " she said .

Spread over a vast area of 170 acres of rocky wasteland in Kuppam , a deprived rural area in Andhra Pradesh , Agastya International foundation believes that complete learning is a combined form of shiksha ( education ) , samskara ( values ) and sansara ( world ) .
It focuses on transforming the critical and much neglected area of primary and secondary education of the rural masses in India , including children and teachers .
Agastya runs one of the largest hands - on science education programs in the world !
Agastya does this by bringing hands - on science education to the rural masses through the use of outreach programs like “ Science on Wheels ” ( Mobile Labs ) , Science Fairs , Teacher Development Program and Young Instructors Programs .
Agastya seeks to fill the gaps in the Indian education system that threaten its socio-economic development .
The conventional Indian education system instills little creativity in children and teacher education is generally divorced from classroom realities .
Agastya ’s projects overcome these problems with their unique features which involve idea generation and testing through the Creativity Lab , creativity generation for poor and disadvantaged through interactive and engaging learning methods , learning linked to environmental goals , emphasis on developing behavioral skills and a close link between teacher education and the classroom system .
Watch the spirit of Agastya ( an abridged documentary )
If you ever hear Ramji Raghavan ( Founder , Agastya International Foundation ) speak , you would certainly hear him talk about the learning pyramid as he strongly believes in the fact that we learn about 5 % of what is taught to us in a lecture , 10 % of what we read , 50 % of what we see and hear , 70 % of what we discuss with others , 80 % of what we experience and 95 % of what we teach .
Ramji Raghavan , a former NRI banker came back to India with a vision of providing education to poor children and teachers – education that would be the opposite of conventional techniques and this led to the birth of Agastya , named after Mahirshi Agastya , famous for spreading sacred knowledge to south India , as a charitable trust in 1999 .

Agastya has started off successfully on the path of building a creative India of ‘ tinkerers , solution seekers and creators ’ that are ‘ humane , anchored and connected ’ by impacting over 3 million children and 120,000 teachers from vulnerable and disadvantaged communities .
The model is scalable and replicable anywhere in the world .

A friend , who runs tours of an organic farm for school children , gives much anecdotal evidence of this .
One week , while pointing to a rosemary bush , he asked the kids if anyone knew what it was .
After 20 seconds , one 12 - year - old raised his hand and proclaimed it to be " corned beef " .
Worse still , none of the others laughed .
The answer to this FAQ is in the query itself – I eat from the earth .
Food is free , and indiscriminately so .
The apple tree does n't ask if you 've got enough cash when you go to pick its fruit ; it just gives to whoever wants an apple .
We are the only species , out of millions on the planet , that is deluded enough to think that it needs money to eat .
And what 's worse , I often observe people walking straight past free food on their way to buy it from all over the world via the supermarket .
There are four legs to the money - free food table .
The most exciting , and my favourite , is foraging , which originally meant to wander in search of food and provisions , but is used these days to describe the act of picking and eating wild foods .
Although this can take a lifetime to learn , anyone can start today .
I 'd recommend picking up a pocket - sized book called Food for Free by Richard Mabey ( sourced for free via Read It Swap It ) or perhaps taking a weekend course with people such as the BBC's " roadkill chef " Fergus the Forager , before hitting the hedgerows .
At the moment look out for giant puffballs , bristly ox - tongue and rocket , the latter often found in the cracks between walls and paths in cities .
If you need any more excuse to hit the coast , now is the perfect time to collect seaweed .
The real beauty of wild food is not only that it 's highly nutritious and ecologically sound , but that picking it is also a fantastic excuse to go adventuring with friends .
Great Britain has been tamed , so its remaining wilds could no longer feed its population .
This makes the next leg – growing your own food – crucial , both in terms of tackling climate change and rebuilding a resilient local food network .
Whether it be on your kitchen windowsill , in your back garden , or on the allotment , start with whatever you can manage .
Choose crops you love eating and if you are time poor , choose varieties that require little work .
Not only will you reduce your food miles and packaging , you 'll also get to eat food that tastes of your own sweat , a flavour no spice can match .
Growing and foraging all your calorific needs is a huge task , especially without fossil fuel inputs such as fertiliser .
This is where the third leg comes in : bartering .
Bartering can either be an exchange of food , especially in the summer when many people have gluts of one crop or another , or an exchange of skills for food you can't get elsewhere without money .
In many ways barter is just an awkward form of money and lacks the deeper benefits of doing something completely for free ( such as you do with close family and friends ) , and it brings up the age old problem of " the double coincidence of wants " , where both parties have to have something the other desires .
But it has got huge benefits .
Not only does it localise the economy , it helps build bonds between neighbours , leading eventually to communities that are more resilient to external shocks ; societies where friendships , not cash , are seen as security .
The fourth leg of the food - for - free table is waste food .
Skipping – jumping into skips – is one form of this , but I prefer to build relationships with small businesses that throw perfectly good grub away , either because of insanely rigid laws or their own quality standards .
By choosing this method , you save yourself the task of looking through a bin and you get to build a relationship with another local who , in almost all cases , feels terrible about chucking out edible food ( one third of all food in UK is wasted ) at a time when one half of the world 's population goes hungry .
Whilst I do n't tend to eat much waste food myself – it makes up roughly 5 % of my diet – I do go skipping regularly .
It 's a lot of fun and I distribute the harvest to those who need it .
Using waste food is far from ideal , as it is hardly building a sustainable model that the rest of the population could replicate .
But while we continue to fly food from all over the world just to make it into a UK skip , I feel our first obligation , to both the farmer and the hungry , is to get it out of bins and into bellies .
So Milton Friedman – if the Guardian is available online beyond the grave – I hate to break it to you , but there is such a thing as a free lunch .

This is a big week for the iPlayer team - we 're launching an all new BBC iPlayer with a host of new features designed to make it simpler to use , personalised and social .
The new site is in public beta right now - you can try it out at https://beta.bbc.co.uk/iplayer - where it will dual - run alongside the existing iPlayer site while we get your feedback , fix bugs , and add the remaining features that did n't quite make it into the first beta release .
But before looking at the new site in detail , I 'd like to take a step back and try to explain the design challenges we were trying to solve and the solution we came up with ( or , if you 'd like to skip the background story and head straight to the list of new features , scroll down to features in detail below ) .
BBC iPlayer : the story so far
designing a platform capable of handling our rapidly growing traffic
ensuring that content became available in iPlayer as soon as possible after it aired on TV
providing the best possible video quality
improving the reliability of video delivery , including failover between content delivery networks , adaptive bitrate for people on lower bandwidth connections
dealing with massive peak loads - the so - called " Top Gear effect " when 100,000 + people descend on the iPlayer site directly after programmes like Top Gear and Doctor Who finish on TV
The current version of iPlayer , known internally as iPlayer V2 , was launched almost two years ago in July 2008 .
Back then the main problems we had to solve were largely technical things like :
The iPlayer V2 hosting platform was also designed to scale across multiple platforms - mobile , TV sets , set top boxes , games consoles , PCs , iPhone , etc .
One issue that we needed to solve when delivering content across so many devices and platforms was that in some cases we only had the right to make certain programmes available on , say , PC platforms but not mobile or TV platforms .
Additionally , the media files for each platform take different amounts of time to encode , which means that we need to deal with situations where a programme is available on some platforms but not others .
This meant that we could n't make the same version of the iPlayer site available on each platform .
That would mean people on mobile devices might get offered links to programmes that are not available on that device , giving an error when you clicked to play the programme .
So we introduced a concept that we called Actual Availability , which allows the iPlayer publishing system to offer independent content sets - we call them Media Sets - to different devices .
BBC iPlayer V2 has proven a trusty workhorse , successfully scaling to 1.5 million users , 15 million page views delivering over 1.1 billion ( ! ) minutes of video each month across more than 40 different devices and platforms .
You can see the list at https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/where_to_get_iplayer/.
A new iPlayer : the design challenge
Two years ago when we launched iPlayer our goals and challenges were largely technical - scalability , reliability , video encoding , etc .
But as we began work on the next - generation iPlayer , it became apparent that our next set of challenges was not so much technical as social - and that turned out to be a much bigger problem to solve .
At the highest level , the fundamental problem that the iPlayer design team was trying to solve was " As people begin moving from television to the web , what happens to the role of the linear TV scheduler as the tastemaker ? "
Let 's be clear : we are not there yet .
Although iPlayer traffic is doubling each year , it still only accounts for 2 - 3 % of linear TV viewing .
But something seems to be stirring .
Let me explain :
When you turn on your TV in the evening peak viewing hours and idly flip through the available channels , the programmes that you see are carefully chosen by each channel 's scheduler .
He / she picks the programmes that you can see , and since most of the country watches TV each evening , the scheduler is the leading tastemaker .
By scheduling a particular programme at peak viewing time , the scheduler is both creating and satisfying the desire to view that programme .
Now , today iPlayer does a fine job of satisfying the time - shifted desires created by the scheduler : the BBC schedulers create the desire to watch a programme ; iPlayer lets you see it at a time that 's convenient to you .
But what if you no longer watched linear TV ?
Who becomes the tastemaker then ?
Right now this is a largely theoretical problem as very few people watch no live TV at all .
However , for a small but growing number of people this is indeed the case , and the fundamental problem that I sought to address was " who becomes the tastemaker for such people in a world without schedules ? "
Now I use Twitter periodically during the day to monitor what iPlayer users are saying about the service - " thank god for iPlayer " , " waiting for Doctor Who to arrive " , " iPlayer slow today " , etc. - Twitter is a great early warning tool for spotting problems .
But increasingly I began seeing Tweets from people saying " Watching " , " Loving Charlie Brooker on iPlayer " , etc .
I began clicking on those links , and found myself watching more programmes in iPlayer than I would have by browsing .
In other words , for me , the Twitterverse is becoming the tastemaker .
Looking at developments across the industry in this space , it 's clear that I was not alone .
Particularly in the world of YouTube where there is no master scheduler who can shape demand .
The tastemaker is rapidly becoming your friends .
Separately , our iPlayer stats told us that , while our users really liked the service , most only came back every week or two when they had missed a programme on TV - clear evidence that linear TV created the demand while iPlayer satisfied it .
In order to get more users to iPlayer , we needed to make iPlayer something more than TV catch - up alone - we wanted it to become a driver of demand , so that you returned to iPlayer daily to see what new programmes were there just for you .
The question then is , in a world which cannot be driven by schedulers , who or what will play the role of tastemaker ?
Well , we think that 's going to be a mix of things that your friends recommend , things that our servers recommend based on what you 've watched , things that you tell us you like , as well as the linear scheduler , whose selections continue to matter to an important part of the online audience .
So , if schedulers are going to be augmented by your friends as drivers of consumption in the future , the challenge for the team was to integrate friends and social into the iPlayer site , and to do so in a way that does n't alienate people who are n't interested in this kind of thing .
Sure , it 's easy enough to sprinkle Share , Recommend , Digg , Follow , etc. buttons across the site , but social should n't be a prerequisite to participation or add complication or clutter for those who just want to get going .
It 's about giving more choice and control .
The iPlayer design team thus found itself with a major challenge :
Take a popular and mainstream product , and reinvent it so that it becomes not just a place you go to catch up on programmes that you know you missed , but to become the place where demand is both created and satisfied .
Oh , and to do that in a way that does n't make the site more complex , and in a way that delights both early adopters and the mainstream audience .
Make it personal , make it social , and keep it simple .
Challenge # 1 : Making the site personal without creating a separate ' you ' site
Here 's an example of the type of challenge we needed to address :
If iPlayer was to become your personal viewing portal , then there needed to be an area of the site that you could call " yours " - i.e. a place where you could assemble all your favourite programmes , and only your favourite programmes .
Initially we decided to create a new area of the site called My iPlayer , which would be your personalised place to find all your favourite programmes .
But it became apparent that creating a My iPlayer page , separate from the rest of the site , would mean separate user journeys and duplicated content between the main site and your personal site .
In the end we dropped the concept of a separate personal site and instead folded your personal experience into the fabric of the main site - something that will become apparent as we look at the features in more detail below .
In short , we sought to add a large range of personalisation and social features to iPlayer , making every feature part of a coherent whole , and avoiding adding anything that did n't have a clear purpose .
Challenge # 2 : Integrating social connectivity
press the Recommend button on your site >> activity posted on Facebook or Twitter on Facebook or Twitter , see activity , click link >> go back to the site hosting the recommended content
Another challenge was how to integrate with Facebook and other social networks .
Pretty much every site these days has a Share button which posts your activity to Facebook , Twitter or other social networking sites .
The usual interaction model is like this :
That 's great if you want to use social networks to increase incoming traffic to your site - which is nice - but that detour via an external 3rd - party site seemed to us to create a disconnect between the user pressing a Share or Recommend button and getting the reward for that action .
And we want it , above all , to be seamless and simple .
Our thinking was that in order to create a lively social recommendation scene , we needed to make the recommendations and social graph visible within iPlayer , in addition of course to any external activity .
Additionally , we wanted to allow a single click of a Recommend button to post activity to both Facebook or Twitter ( or any other network or micro - blogging site for that matter ) where appropriate , in addition to posting that activity into our own activity streams .
The solution we came up with was to create a BBC login - known as BBC iD - which users can then connect with Facebook , Twitter or any other social network that we choose to partner with in the future , allowing us to create the following social recommendation ecosystem :
press the Recommend button in iPlayer >> activity appears on your friends '
iPlayer home pages >>
AND activity posted on Facebook AND / OR Twitter on Facebook / Twitter , see activity , click link >> watch it in iPlayer
Basically , we use your external social graph to connect you with your friends within the iPlayer site , and make it scalable for other BBC Online services in the fullness of time .
To do this , we connect Facebook , Twitter and where appropriate other social networking sites to your BBC iD login account , providing you with a single gateway to multiple social graphs and a single Recommend button that can post activity to multiple social networks .
The new iPlayer : features in detail
And so , without further ado , let 's take a look at all the new features in the new iPlayer , with commentary explaining the rationale for each feature .
Some of the features listed below did n't make it into the first beta release and will be added over the coming weeks ( features that are ' coming soon ' are noted in italics below ) .
1. Favourites
The single feature request that we are asked for most often is " favourites " - and , as explained above , integrating favourites into the site was one of our early dilemmas .
The solution that we came up with was to add an expandable Favourites zone to the top of every page of the site :
In response to our user research that told us that people only came back to the site every week or two to catch up on programmes they 'd missed , we designed Favourites to be like your mail Inbox , showing the total number of items , how many are newly arrived , etc .
The great thing about Favourites in the context of iPlayer is that by simply adding , say , QI as a favourite , every time a new episode of QI goes to air , your favourites list will update and reorder itself to show the new episode .
Adding items to your favourites takes only a single click , so I found myself spending the first 5 minutes on the new iPlayer site simply looking for any series that I liked and clicking to add it to my favourites .
I now have - as can be seen in the image above - 48 items to watch right now , with the iPlayer servers constantly scanning for new episodes becoming available , adding them to my favourites , and very shortly sending me an email notification .
Now that I have so much stuff to view , I can almost ignore the rest of the iPlayer site and simply rely on Favourites to give me a constant stream of things to watch .
2. Roaming
You know how on many sites every time you do something simple like adding a programme to your favourites or trying to personalise the site , you get prompted to register - very annoying .
So we carefully designed the new iPlayer site so that you could use most of the functionality instantly on first visit without being constantly hassled to register .
But ... if you do choose to sign in , then all your favourites and other settings can roam across all the devices on which you use iPlayer .
For example , we 're planning on updating the mobile iPlayer site - the one you can access on a range of mobile phones - to let you access your Favourites as well - here 's an image of Favourites in the new Mobile iPlayer site :
So now if I 'm bored sitting in a train on the way home , I can look for new programmes to watch , add them to my Favourites , and when I get home they 'll be right there on my home PC ready to watch .
Full roaming is coming to the mobile iPlayer site shortly - the initial implementation contains local favourites only .
But what will make this good service great is when we can synch up your BBC iD with your TV or mobile , so you can pick up where you left off on whatever connected device you have - the team are working on this now and we hope to say more about this soon .
3. Personalised iPlayer home page
Going back to our dilemma of how to provide a personalised iPlayer portal experience that was not isolated from the main iPlayer site , our solution was to create an iPlayer home page that can morph , under your direction , from a default view that everyone sees to something that 's , well , just for you .
We wanted to create an iPlayer home page that feels almost more like an application than a traditional web site , making it a familiar place you return to frequently for your favourite comedy , drama , music and more .
Here 's how it works :
When you come to the iPlayer site as a new user , you 're presented with a nice simple promo zone at the top of the home page that contains the Featured and Most Popular zones that would be familiar to any existing iPlayer user :
Now , as soon as you 've played a couple of programmes , our recommendations system has enough information to guess what you may like and offer personalised programme recommendations for you , and so when you next return to the iPlayer home page you 'll now see two extra zones : For You and Friends :
Now here 's where the personalisation comes in : you can slide open any of the drawers to turn the iPlayer homepage into the tastemaker of your choice .
For example , if you 'd like your viewing to be driven by programmes that the BBC editorial team has chosen , simply slide open the Featured drawer :
Or , if you 're so inclined , sign up on the site , then connect iPlayer to your Facebook and / or Twitter social graphs , and you 'll get a steady stream of recommendations from your friends :
These sliding drawers will remember the state that you left them in , allowing a single iPlayer home page to meet the needs of a mainstream audience looking for editorialised recommendations , through to users who look to their friends as the tastemaker .
Remembering the open / closed state of each of the drawers is being added shortly .
4. My Categories
In addition to Favourites - where you nominate your favourite shows or series - we also added a My Categories zone to the home page .
To use it , simply navigate to any category that you normally like to watch ( or listen to - this works for radio as well ) , click Add To My Categories , and then the iPlayer server will keep a lookout for any new content in your selected categories , and the iPlayer home page will show you a constantly updated list of new programmes in those categories .
As you can see below , I like classical and world music , and science & nature programmes :
5. Better live TV
Although you 've been able to watch live TV in iPlayer for well over a year now , this is n't that well known , but recently we 've seen a big increase in live TV viewing in iPlayer - and with the upcoming World Cup being a huge driver of live online viewing , we 're making the live viewing experience a little more prominent on the home page :
and we 've also created a new Live Viewing page which allows you to easily view all the BBC TV channels in iPlayer :
6 . New radio console
We created an all - new popup radio console that includes Favourites and other key features from the new iPlayer site , allowing you to find and listen to your favourite BBC radio programmes all within the popup console player :
7. Recommend to friends
The fuel for the Friends drawer on the iPlayer home page - and shortly on the playback page as well - is the Recommend button that appears below the playback window :
As mentioned above , you can link the Recommend button to the social network (s ) of your choice via a single BBC login , and our servers will constantly check your social graph on those sites and import latest friends additions and deletions across all your networks .
8 . Watch with friends
And now something that for some will be the killer feature of the new site : the ability to watch programmes with friends .
If you already have a Windows Live Messenger account you can see which of your Windows Live Messenger friends ( and other instant messenger services to be added in due course ) are in iPlayer right now and what they 're watching , and even how far into the programme they are .
You can then sync your iPlayer with theirs and chat with them in real time , all within the iPlayer site .
Here 's how it works :
On all TV playback pages in iPlayer you 'll see a button to add the IM chat widget to your iPlayer pages .
If you 're a Messenger user and this is of interest to you , click the Get Started button .
After signing in to Windows Live Messenger with your Messenger credentials , you 'll now see an extra panel that shows which of your Messenger contacts are online and in iPlayer right now :
Separately , while you 're watching a programme , anytime you 're feeling excited about that programme or even just a particular moment in the programme , you can shout about it to your Messenger friends - simply type whatever comes to mind into the text box and hit the Shout button - all your Messenger friends who are in iPlayer right now will get the message , and may then choose to sync their iPlayer to yours and join you to watch and chat together .
By the way , your shouts only go to your Messenger friends who are in iPlayer right now - they wo n't go to contacts who are not in iPlayer - so you do n't need to worry about spamming contacts who do n't live in the UK or who are n't interested in your shouts of " It 's the Stig ! " or whatever .
The Messenger that you can add to your iPlayer site is a JavaScript implementation of the Windows Live Messenger client - i.e. your private chat conversations travel over the same MSN network as regular Messenger IM chat .
Watch with Friends is being added to the site in the next few weeks - stay tuned !
9 . Better video quality
For quite some time now iPlayer has had the ability to switch down to a lower bitrate video stream if you did n't have enough bandwidth to play the selected version .
We 're now rolling out the next evolution in our adaptive bitrate system which automatically adjusts the video quality up and down every few seconds , if necessary , to match your instantaneous line speed .
The improved video quality will be most apparent in full - screen mode , where iPlayer will automatically switch up to our 832x468 1500 Kbps high - quality SD streams as soon as you go fullscreen , seamlessly dropping to / from the 480 Kbps and 800 K bps lower bitrate streams as needed .
This new adaptive bitrate system , coupled with Adobe 's upcoming Flash 10.1 release with H.264 hardware acceleration , should give better quality , less jerkiness and lower CPU usage on PCs equipped with a graphics cards that support H.264 hardware acceleration - see https://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/releasenotes.pdf for technical details .
10 . New iPlayer Desktop
In addition to the new iPlayer web site , we also have a greatly enhanced version of iPlayer Desktop , our Adobe AIR - powered iPlayer download manager , now with two great new features : Series Downloads and live radio & TV .
This means you a ) do n't have to wait to download programmes you want and b ) you 've got your favourite programmes already downloaded to your computer ready to view when you 're offline .
Downloading whole series to your computer is easy - just click the Download button on iPlayer playback pages and choose the " Download future episodes " button :
i Player Desktop will now automatically download every future episode for you , including where possible downloading episodes before they air on TV , making them available for you to play back within minutes of the programme finishing on TV .
To avoid iPlayer Desktop maxing out your internet connection we 've added the ability to tell iPlayer Desktop to schedule all series downloads between , say , midnight and 7AM :
Additionally , iPlayer Desktop will pause any automated downloads if previous episodes start expiring without being watched , avoiding end of month bandwidth surprises .
One of the features that I 'm really liking is the new feature in iPlayer Desktop for live TV and radio too , which puts the BBC 's 17 network and national radio stations ....
and 7 TV stations ...
... all right there on your desktop for instant listening and viewing .
10 .
And finally ...
As I hope you can see , this relaunch represents many months of work for the iPlayer team and gives us a platform that will serve as a base the next wave of innovation over the coming months .
As in any beta there will be bugs , and we still have some features to add .
This new site is a big step - and a big bet - for us , and we 'd really welcome your feedback - look for the Site Feedback link at the bottom of each page on the site .
We really hope you like it .
As some of you may know , I am moving on to become CTO of Project Canvas , and this is the last major piece of work from the team under my leadership .
It 's been quite a journey for me and the BBC since I got that call from Erik in late 2007 " Anthony , I could use your help with something " and I 'm very proud of what we 've created .
Please keep a lookout for additional blogs from my colleagues on how the new iPlayer site was built , the Java / PHP hosting platform that powers the new iPlayer site , BBC iD and how we connect to social networks , and more .

The Apache Software Foundation runs its open source projects on a hierarchy of principally three levels , top - level projects ( TLPs ) , sub-projects and incubated projects .
Achieving the TLP status is a major milestone for an open source effort and this week Apache announced that six projects were being graduated to TLP status .
This Yahoo - led effort powers more than 400 TB of traffic per day , joining six other projects that have now been elevated to the top level of the Apache open source software project hierarchy .
Among the six new TLPs , is the Apache Traffic Server , a project that was originally an incubated effort by Yahoo ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) in 2009 .
The Traffic Server is also being updated to version 2.0 this week as the technology continues to grow under the direction of the Apache model .
“ It ’s the fundamental goal of being in incubation that you succeed and graduate , ” Leif Hedstrom , Chairperson of the Apache Traffic Server project , told InternetNews.com .
“ It signifies that our community and software have been well - governed under the ASF ’s meritocratic , consensus - driven process and principles . ”
In addition to the Traffic Server , five former sub-projects of existing TLPs have now moved up .
Three of the new TLPs were formerly sub-projects of Apache Lucene .
They include the Apache Mahout machine learning algorithms effort and Apache Tika which is a toolkit for content detection and analysis .
The Apache Nutch Web search engine is also moving up to TLP status .
Rounding out the list of new TLPs are a pair of Apache Hadoop sub-projects including the Avro data serialization project and the HBase distributed database .
Apache Traffic Server
The Apache Traffic Server is already heavily used by Yahoo to deliver 400 terabytes of traffic per day .
The Traffic Server is a caching proxy server that can speed up the delivery of Web server content .
“ Traffic Server is built for scalability on SMP hardware , ” Hedstrom said .
“ It can take advantage of multiple CPUs very well . ”
Extensibility is also a key attribute of the Traffic Server .
Hedstrom said the Traffic Server has a very feature rich plug - in API , similar to how people write mods for the Apache HTTPD Web Server .
From a competitive point of view , Hedstrom said the Squid project is among the popular open source caching servers that are alternatives to Traffic Server .
Commercial proxy caches also exist and many match Apache ’s Traffic Server ’s features , though Hedstrom said that Traffic Server offers better price / performance .
Benefitting From Apache
By being part of the Apache Software Foundation , Hedstrom noted that the Traffic Server project has grown beyond what Yahoo on its own was able to provide .
New developers have joined the project which has helped the technology to improve .
“ We ’ve directly seen a large number of changes that has improved the features , quality and performance of the software , ” Hedstrom said .
“ A few examples include 64 - bit support , IPv6 support , and performance in some benchmarks have more than doubled than what we had starting incubation . ”
The Apache Traffic Server is currently at its 2.0.0 release which came out this week .
Hedstrom noted that release ’s main new feature is that it ’s 64 - bit compatible , but only supported on Linux .
Moving forward , Hedstrom said that there is a developer version 2.1.0 release which should be out in the next few weeks and a version 2.2.0 public release which has loosely been scheduled for the summer .
“ The v2.1.0 Traffic Server has a number of features , including significant performance improvements , much better RAM cache efficiency , support for most common Unix platforms , including numerous Linux distros , Mac OSX , Solaris and FreeBSD , ” Hedstrom said .
“ All these ports to non-Linux platforms is a direct result of us being part of the Open Source Apache community . ”

Who Is Pastor Jeff Owens ?
That question is answered on this website .
Jeff Owens " is a man of great expression , compassion , and wisdom , " who currently leads the Shenandoah Bible Baptist Church , " one of America 's most exciting churches , " a church located in a part of West Virginia that serves as a suburb of Washington D.C. Pastor Owens is " a soulwinner , fervent preacher , and takes an uncompromising stand against sin ; but the hallmark quality of Dr. Owens is his genuine love and concern for people . "
In this sermon Pastor Owens lovingly and compassionately calls on his flock to terrorize and murder gays and lesbians :
We need to stop burning flags and start burning fags .
We need hunt - a - homo week .
We need to take 'em all out and shoot 'em with a scatter shotgun : that 's Christian compassion for you all right .
Now for all you moderate Christians offended by this sort of thing — by Owens ' sermon , by my posting about it — if you want to tell anyone that Owens does n't speak for all Christians , go tell Owens .
I 'm sick of hearing it , frankly , and Owens needs to hear it .
And you can reach Pastor Compassion at ...

Listen to that sermon again — listen to Pastor Owens crank up his congregation , listen to Jesus 's followers scream and cheer when their loving , compassionate pastor encourages them to get out there and murder gays and lesbians .
That 's the kind of rally — so Nuremburgish — that gets innocent people killed .
Listen to that sermon again .
And then give the vile piece of shit a call : 304-263-3461 .

UPDATE : I wonder if Pastor Owens recorded the above sermon before or after he recorded this one :
UPDATE 2 : The YouTube video of Pastor Owens urging his flock to get out there and commit hate crimes — murder is a hate crime , right ? —has been yanked .
Hopefully someone dubbed it .
The quotes above are verbatim , and not " taken out of context . "
I do n't know how you could put " we need to stop burning flags and start burning fags " in a context that makes it less of an incitement to commit a hate crime .
Also : in the deleted clip Pastor Owens used some of the same language and arguments he made in his sodomy sermon : we need to shove this sin back in the closet , gay people would n't be coming out at all if more Christians stood up to them .
Because , hey , when was the last time Christians stood up to the gays anyway .
We 've been getting a free pass from the Christians for , oh , the last two thousand or so years , right ?
UPDATE 3 : Someone reading JMG was wise enough to make a copy before it got yanked .
You can download your own copy of the tape Pastor Owens does n't want you to hear here .
Will post the video to Slog once I figure out how to do that .

Shenandoah Baptist Church 's Pastor Jeff Owens : BURN AND SHOOT FAGS !
from Joe Jervis on Vimeo .
UPDATE 5 : Pastor Owens ' anti-gay rant now available as an MP3 .
UPDATE 6 : Future Youth Pastor Watch Inductee ?
This wild - eyed fundy is the youth pastor at Shenandoah Bible Baptist Church .
His name is Brother Joshua Owens and presumably he's the offspring of Dr. Jeff Owens , the gay - bashing , violence - inciting bigot who " leads " Shenandoah Baptist .
I have a feeling we 'll be hearing more from Brother Joshua in the future .
Something about those eyes .
UPDATE 7 : Via Slog commenter IGUB : While Dr. Jeff Owens was preaching ( hate ) , at least one of his kids was preying ( on kids ) ...
A 22 - year - old Martinsburg man charged last year with having sex with two teenage girls in Berkeley County has agreed to a plea offer from the county prosecutor ’s office .
Jeremiah Daniel
Owens pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault charges from an eight - count indictment handed up in October 2007 that charged him with sexual assault and sexual abuse against two girls , ages 15 and 13 , and that stemmed from separate incidents earlier that year ....
According to a previous report , the mother of the 13 - year - old , whose name will not be published to protect her identity , said her daughter met Owens at the Shenandoah Bible Baptist Church in Martinsburg where Owens ’ father is the pastor .
Dr. Jeff Owens ' book Character Lessons for Children is available for sale now .
UPDATE 8 : Slog readers who wrote to Dr. Jeff Owens via Shenandoah Bible Baptist Church 's website to register their disgust with his sermon calling for the murder of out gay men and lesbians have been getting this email back from Owens :
Nearly 15 years ago I preached a sermon that promoted physically hurting gay people .
I was young , stupid and immature .
I did n’t even hold to the belief of hurting people when I wrongly made those comments .
I regret those words and have asked God to forgive me for them .
I am not a believer in the gay life - style but I was profoundly wrong in making any comments about hurting people .
If I could retract those words I certainly would .
I wrongly represented both God and myself .
I truly believe that God is a God of LOVE .
I believe he loves the whole world even when people in the world do things that are wrong ;
Such as my wrong representation of how to treat someone who does not believe the same way I do .
I no longer preach like that and I purposely teach and train others to preach and behave properly as well .
The hurtful words in that sermon tape were erased many years ago and somehow have resurfaced much to my disappointment and embarrassment .
I realize I have disappointed many who have heard those words in that sermon .
May I include my disappointment in myself .
Once again , I offer my humble apology .
With a sincere heart , Jeff Owens
Stupid and immature I 'll give him — but young ?
Owens looks to be in his fifties , judging from the photo here .
And according to his bio Owen has been " preaching the Gospel since 1976 . "
So he had been a preacher for nearly two decades when he delivered his soon - to - be - infamous sermon way , way back in 1995 .
So , again , stupid and immature — and hateful and vile and disgusting — we can give him .
But the man was n't young .
I sent Dr. Owens an email asking for an interview .
I 'd like him to walk me — and all of you — through how he got from kill - the - gays to tolerate - the - gays - but - condemn - their - lifestyle .
What changed him ?
Who touched his heart ?
What was his yellow - brick - road - to - Damascus moment like ?
My email to Dr. Owens is after the jump .
I 'll let you know if I hear back from him .
And here 's my email to him :
dr. owens , my name is dan savage and i'm a writer , author , editor and ... blogger .
along with Joe Jervis , I posted that YouTube clip of your sermon today , the one where you seemed to be calling on your congregants to literally murder out gay men and lesbians .
i understand that you 've received numerous emails and calls as a result of your old sermon appearing on our websites today , and that you 've responded directly to people who 've reached out to you , disavowing that old sermon .
I was curious if you still believed the things you espoused in that sermon .
earlier today i posted a link to what turned out to be a later sermon , one in which you explicity stated that harming gay people — or our property — was a sin .
i pointed out the discrepancy between those two sermons .
my post is here : http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/05/22/who-is-pastor-jeff-owens
i would like to interview you for my blog , perhaps for my column , about that old sermon .
i realize that you 'll most likely regard my post and the updates , if you read them all the way through , as snarky and highly disrespectful .
sorry about that .
but so long as you 're out there condemning my " lifestyle " — and you do continue to condemn my " lifestyle , " whatever that means , even if you are no longer calling on your followers to actually murder me — i feel justified in subjecting you to a little sarcasm .
anyway , dr. owens , if you would like to talk about that old sermon , what you were thinking when you delivered it , what you 're thinking now , and if you would like to walk my readers through how your thinking evolved — how you got from openly advocating murder to instructing your followers to be tolerant — i would happily make some space available .
you can take this as an opportunity to apologize to folks who were offended by your old sermon but also , around the edges , to do a little evangelizing in a place — my blog — where that sort of thing rarely ever happens .
let me know .

Rice ( front , right ) , Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the UN , chats with Peter Wittig , Permanent Representative of Germany to the UN , prior to a Security Council meeting at which the Council adopted resolution 1929 ( 2010 ) , imposing new sanctions against Iran .
Beside them are representatives of permanent members of the Council ( from left to right ) : Mark Lyall Grant , Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom ; Li Baodong , Permanent Representative of the People ’s Republic of China ; Vitaly I. Churkin , Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation ; and Gérard Araud , Permanent Representative of France .

The recent UN Security Council resolution 1929 slapping new sanctions on Iran is likely to become the worst defeat suffered by Russian diplomacy over the past years .
Its negative impact may be persistent and more serious than that of the proclamation of Kosovo ’s independence to which Russia continues to object .
What we are witnessing seems to be an unexpected recurrence of the syndrome of unilateral concessions to the West which eroded Russia ’s international politics , especially its Balkan part , in the 1990s .
Following the Western lead in dealing with Iran , Russia is risking the loss of both its positions in a region much more extensive than the Balkans and its hard - earned key role in the emerging multipolar world .
Commenting on the vote in the UN Security Council ( where Russia ’s BRIC [ Brazil , Russia , India , China ] peer Brazil and NATO member Turkey voted against the sanctions ) , the influential Tehran Times wrote : “ The fact that Turkey and Brazil , two U.S. allies , voted against the resolution provides further proof that the actions against Iran and the latest decision of the Security Council are based on secret deals struck by the major powers .
Thus , those who say the U.S. abandoned its Eastern European missile shield plan in order to win the support of Russia were probably correct . ”
In 2009 , the Russian foreign ministry was on a number of occasions forced to deny that — as Western media kept suggesting — there existed a " missile defense for Iran " swap deal .
Indeed , it probably did not exist as a formalized agreement , but the truth is that at a certain moment Russia adopted a much tougher stance on Iran and froze its arms transactions with the country ( suspending the supply of the S - 300 air defense systems ) , as well as the fact that currently Moscow risks losing its strategic partner in the Middle East without any visible reasons for such a sacrifice .
Can the invisible reason be an obscure deal with US President Barack Obama ?
Recent developments signal a complicated array of shifts in the region and outside of it .
The mediation successfully undertaken by Turkey and Brazil in talks over the enrichment of Iran ’s uranium stockpile outside of the country , the escalation in the Middle East , the tensions between Turkey and Israel , new geopolitical maneuvers around the Karabakh settlement and related energy projects ( in which Turkey , Iran , and Azerbaijan , a country with a special position , are to play the key roles ) altogether confront the US with the threat of isolation and loss of leadership .
As for Iran , it is no secret that the three rounds of sanctions imposed on the country in 2006 - 2008 failed to undermine its capability to implement a nuclear program , which has become an element of the Iranian national identity .
There are no indications that the situation is going to change from Iran ’s perspective this time .
The situation is going to change from Russia ’s perspective , though , and certainly for the worse .
Losing Iran , demonstratively distancing itself from the Turkish - Brazilian mediation ( for which President Medvedev expressed support previously ) , and siding with the U.S. , Moscow put in jeopardy the political gains of recent years such as independence and assertiveness in international politics and clarity of geopolitical priorities .
Voting for new sanctions and constructing the nuclear power plant in Bushehr at the same time is an example of the very double standards that Moscow justly rebelled against whenever it encountered them in Western policies .
Russia evidently tried to recoup some of its geopolitical losses immediately after the vote in the UN Security Council .
Russia ’s foreign ministry promptly posted an extensive comment saying : “ However , we ca n’t ignore the signals indicating that some partners intend , almost immediately after the decision in New York , to move to considering additional sanctions against Iran , more stringent than those provided by the UNSC resolution .
" We regard this as the manifestation of a policy that runs counter to the principles of joint work within the Six [ U.S. , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China ] and the UNSC format .
Unacceptable to us are attempts in such a way to place oneself ’ above ’ the Security Council .
We also categorically reject any national decisions on the imposition of extraterritorial sanctions , ’ i.e. , restrictive measures under one ’s own legislation with regard to individuals and legal entities in third countries .
Such decisions , should they affect Russian legal entities or individuals , would entail a retaliatory response by us .
" The new resolution leaves extensive room for further cooperation with Iran in the trade and economic fields and on energy , transport and peaceful space exploration .
As applied to Russian - Iranian bilateral ties , all of these areas have significant potential and growth opportunities .
Of fundamental importance for us is the further development of cooperation with Iran in the construction of light water reactors . ”
The arguments seem OK but still reek of an attempt to save face .
It is unlikely that the US and the EU , overwhelmed with gratitude to Russia , will in the future show greater respect for its interests or adapt to the Russian foreign ministry ’s position on Iran .
Russian diplomacy ’s pledges to go on cooperating with Iran would have been more credible if Russia at least abstained during the UN Security Council vote , as , for example , did Lebanon .
Washington pursued its own interests without exception throughout the Russian - US debates over Iran .
Obama ’s decision against deploying missile defense infrastructures in Poland and the Czech Republic was predictable due to purely economic regards and did not require Russia ’s consent to sanctions against Iran .
In fact , the missile defense program is still on but will employ more advanced technologies ensuring radar surveillance over a greater area .
In the foreseeable future Russia will be confronted with an evasive network of mobile systems instead of two undisguised stationary installations .
The Persian Gulf zone and the Black Sea region will be given key roles in the framework of the initiative .
It did not go unnoticed that the US Administration carefully avoided linking any of the provisions of the New START treaty with the state of the US missile defense program .
The most alarming aspect of the current situation is the analogy it invokes with the 1990s — early 2000s Balkan developments .
In that epoch Russia also demanded on the formal level that all sides in the Balkan conflicts equally abide by international law , called for compromises , and voted for sanctions in the UN Security Council , holding that this was the only way to stop escalations .
The overall result was progressing imbalance in the Balkans and broader European security architecture .
The norms declared were supposed to be mandatory for all nations , but the Serbs invariably ended up disadvantaged .
The format of the international contact group which handled the Balkan crises is frighteningly similar to that currently employed in dealing with Iran ( the six - party talks ) .
Russia was defeated in the five - party talks on Kosovo when it consented to the so - called three principles , one of them being that the situation should not revert to the 1999 status quo .
The provision was eventually used by the proponents of Kosovo independence to justify its unilateral declaration .
Now Russian envoys quite reasonably blame the UN and its Secretary General for being either reluctant or unable to address the Kosovo problem and charge the EU and the US with bias and unilateralism .
But is n’t the West demonstrating bias and acting unilaterally when it consents to the nuclear status of India and Pakistan and shields Israel from criticism over its nuclear program , but keeps pushing for ever tighter sanctions to be imposed on Iran ?
The Balkans settlement has shown the inadequacy of international negotiating formats like five - party or six - party talks and the pointless character of UN discussions .
In practice , the West relies entirely on its own mechanisms to promote its own geopolitical interests .
Russia chose to be on the side of the US and the EU instead of strengthening its commercial ties with Iran ( including Caspian Sea delimitation and energy projects ) , involving countries with unbiased positions in the talks over the Iranian nuclear dossier , and supporting the independent and successful mediation contributed by Turkey and Brazil .
Will the US and the EU return the favor — for example , in the form of concessions in Kosovo , the Caucasus , or energy politics ?
Based on the Balkans experience , it is clear that they will not .
Bleeding Cool talks to Jacen Burrows , artist on Alan Moore 's upcoming Neonomicon .
BC : Give us a quick summary of the book for brand newcomers – how would you describe Neonomicon to an intimate partner ?
JB : Way back in 1994 Alan Moore wrote a short prose story for The Starry Wisdom : A Tribute to H. P. Lovecraft .
In 2003 Antony Johnston and myself adapted the Courtyard for Avatar with Moore standing in as acting editor on the project .
Now here we are in 2010 and we are finally getting ready to release Neonomicon the sequel scripted by Alan Moore himself .
The story centers on an FBI team investigating a spree of grisly crimes that started at the end of the Courtyard .
The story features a brilliant deconstruction and modernization of the H.P. Lovecraft world as only Alan Moore could do it .
And believe me , Lovecraft channeled through Alan Moore is a dark , disturbing , mind warping thing .
Those unfamiliar with Lovecraft or the Courtyard should still find it an intensely affecting work of horror .
BC : Now you 're probably best known to our readers through for your work on Crossed .
How does drawing from Alan Moore scripts differ from , say , Garth Ennis ?
What do each demand from you that 's different ?
JB : Garth 's scripts read as fairly traditional comic scripts .
He 'll describe the acting , actions and elements of a panel that must be there and generally leaves the layouts and angles up to you except in instances where camera direction is being specifically dictated for effect .
Alan 's scripts take a totally different approach where each panel is being described as a finished picture .
Elements are described by the location on the picture plane and even small details are described by their placement in the composition .
Moore 's method of controlling the picture plane allows him to work in additional layers of subtext or to control the story flow from panel to panel in ways other writers do n't .
You get a sense that every element is part of a greater design .
But he also says in the script that he is just bombarding with details that you can choose to keep or toss as fits the story .
BC : Well , Alan 's famous for long involved script descriptions that at the end say " but if you have a better way , do that instead " .
What changes , if any , did you make while working on the book ?
JB : I have n't made any that I can think of off hand .
I pride myself on trying to get as close as I can to the writer 's vision .
It 's kind of a game for me .
I think I must have a little OCD buried in the back of my mind somewhere that this kind of thing triggers .
I do tons of thumbnails in an effort to find the angles I can use to get as close as I can to the script .
It 's a whole different way of working but I 'm enjoying the challenge and ultimately I think every writer likes to know that what they put on the script is going to end up on the page .
BC : Well are there any specific panels you feel exceptionally proud of when looking back at them ?
Ones you just wish had extra arrows saying " Look at this one ! "
JB : Oh , I feel that way with every issue I do .
Each issue has its money shots .
And I generally take my time with those to make them special .
There are some pages at the end of issue 1 that I think are very affective in a disturbing way .
You 'll see .
And issue 2 is turning out to be the best looking issue I 've drawn of anything .
BC : It may look pretty but Alan 's talked about Neonomicon emanating from a very bad mood he was in at the time .
Just how unremitting is the book – and did it affect you emotionally drawing it ?
JB : The book goes into some really dark places , certainly , but I found myself more captivated than unsettled .
I kept wanting to know where it was all going and to see how the darker elements would play into the thing as a whole .
I had faith in Alan Moore to make it all pay off and it really does .
The ending is a mind blower !
And as an artist there is an oddly perverse fun side of drawing the grotesque and disturbing .
Channeling my inner Charles Burns or Jim Woodring , I suppose .
BC : You may have faith but do you fear the Alan Moore curse – so many of his past collaborators have seen their entire careers overshadowed by one momentary work with the man .
Will you be able to cope with being Jacen ' Neonomicon ' Burrows forever ?
JB : That 's not that bad of a problem to have !
I 'd be happy to be known for even one great work but hopefully I 'll have a long career full of interesting gems .
Sometimes I am kind of amazed by how little work some of my favorite creators have produced over 10 - 20 years .
I 'm pretty happy with my ever growing library of graphic novels and I expect to have many more as long as people keeping buying them .
BC : So what do you expect most fans of the book will ask you to sketch ?
JB : Ha , saying that would end up being a big spoiler unfortunately , but C'thulhu is always a sketch favorite .
I 've already been asked to do some Crossed Deep Ones or C'thulhu Jimmy the rabbit at cons .
You never know what the Avatar fan base is going to ask for .
They 're a creative bunch .
The former US president 's memoirs are to be published in November , and will consist of an account of his key decisions .
Below is an exclusive preview from the first draft . . .
Point 1
One of the biggest decisions of my life was the day I decided not to be an alcoholic any more .
I do n't remember any decisions before that .
Point 2 Everybody remembers where they were on September 11 , 2001 .
And everybody remembers where I was , including me .
I was in a school in Florida , listening intently as some children read a story called The Pet Goat .
It was about a little girl who had a goat that ate everything .
Her parents wanted to get rid of it .
At some point my chief of staff , Andrew Card , whispered to me that America was under attack .
Immediately I made the decision to carry on listening to the children .
I 've faced some criticism for that , but I knew then that I was facing the hardest day of my presidency , with some tough choices ahead of me .
I would need all my powers of concentration and judgment , and I could n't afford to be distracted by wondering how the story ended .
I had to find out what happened to that goat .
Point 3
The decision to invade Iraq was not taken lightly .
At the time I thought Saddam and Bin Laden were working closely together on terrorism ; in fact I was under the impression that they were somehow related , but that turned out not to be true .
Even so , I was not sure I wanted to commit American troops to an invasion .
I remember the day I took Cheney and Rumsfeld into the Oval Office and told them what I had decided : that they must decide .
In an executive position it 's very important to delegate , and I 've never for one moment regretted the Iraq war not being my fault .
Point 4
Not every choice I made was the right one .
Sometimes when I have made a decision to choose someone to make decisions , that person has let me down .
That 's what happened after Hurricane Katrina , but of course I was still the president , so I had to take responsibility for the terrible mistakes of others , even though I was on vacation .
Looking back , that seems totally unfair .
Point 5
Occasionally one has to make split - second decisions .
There 's no time to think , you know , should I lean to the left or right on this one ?
You just move – any which way !
– and if you 're lucky , the shoe flies over your head .
That 's also how I did my Supreme Court nominations .
( CNN ) --
Full - body scanning machines may reveal a little too much , if an incident of workplace violence this week among Transportation Security Administration screeners is any indication .
A TSA worker at Miami International Airport in Florida was arrested for allegedly assaulting a co-worker who had repeatedly teased him about the size of his genitals .
The insults stemmed from an X -ray of the accused captured during a training exercise with the airport 's full - body scanning machines , the report said .
Rolando Negrin " stated he could not take the jokes anymore and lost his mind , " allegedly striking the victim with a police baton .
According to the report , a witness heard Negrin say in Spanish , " get on your knees or I will kill you and you better apoligise [ sic ] . "
In response to the incident , TSA said it has a zero - tolerance policy for workplace violence .
" At the same time , we are investigating to determine whether other officers may have violated procedures in a training session with coworkers and committed professional misconduct , " the agency said in a statement .
The incident puts the spotlight back on technology some privacy advocates liken to a virtual strip search .
" As far as I 'm concerned , this really demonstrates exactly how detailed the images are , exactly how invasive the search is , " said John Verdi , senior counsel with the Electronic Privacy Information Center , a Washington - based research center specializing in civil liberties and privacy issues .
It receives much of its funding from private foundations .
Verdi said the Miami incident " ... also demonstrates that this technology , and the way it 's being implemented by TSA , is ripe for abuse . "
The TSA screener scuffle is not the only recent case of workplace tension involving the technology .
A security worker at London 's Heathrow Airport allegedly made lewd comments about a female colleague who mistakenly entered a scanner , according to the UK's Press Association .
The accused worker was given a police warning for harassment .
TSA officials stressed that the incident in Miami was internal and did not involve any member of the traveling public .
When the technology is used in airports , one screener views the scan in a remote location and does not come into contact with passengers being screened .
The images are permanently deleted and never stored , according to the TSA .
EPIC has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security under the Freedom of Information
Act seeking details about the government 's use of advanced imaging technology .
In April , DHS revealed in a letter to EPIC that it has 2,000 full - body scanning test images , " using TSA models , not members of the public , " stored at its test facility .
The agency is withholding the images , citing exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act for information pertaining only to internal personnel rules and practices and records that might " benefit those attempting to violate the law . "
Verdi finds the idea that the images might be used to evade security " highly problematic . "
" Because if merely publishing examples of the images that the TSA has generated during testing would harm security , that really calls into question the effectiveness of the machines , " he said .
Examples the TSA says are consistent with what screening officers see in airports are available on the agency 's website .
Aviation security expert Douglas Laird said it is " perfectly logical " for the TSA to withhold the 2,000 test images .
" If they were available to the public , then if you were trying to defeat the machine you would study the images to find the weak link , so to speak .
I would think they would be crazy to release them , " said Laird , who is president of aviation security consulting firm Laird & Associates .
There are shortcomings for any technology , Laird said .
Still , Laird said he believes body - scanning technology would have given officials at Amsterdam 's Schipol Airport a much better chance of catching a Nigerian man who boarded a Detroit , Michigan - bound flight on Christmas Day with explosives concealed in his groin area .
The alternative pat - down , which U.S. passengers may opt for instead of body scanning , has to be very intrusive to be effective , and studies show people are less tolerant of physical intrusion than of intrusive technology , Laird said .
While advanced imaging technology does n't involve direct physical contact , the screener training incident in Miami highlights some travelers ' reservations about full - body scans .
" I really think it would give a lot of folks pause if they thought that TSA employees were mocking naked body scans of American air travelers , " Verdi said .
All The Facts Behind The World ’s Water Crisis
1 . By 2025 , more than 2.8 billion people will live in 48 countries facing water stress or water scarcity , a recently revised United Nations medium population projected .
Of these 48 countries , 40 are either in the Near East and North Africa or in sub-Saharan Africa .
Over the next two decades population increase alone — not to mention growing demand per capita — is projected to push all of the Near East into water scarcity .
By 2050 the number of countries facing water stress or scarcity will rise to 54 , and their combined population to 4 billion people — 40 % of the projected global population of 9.4 billion
2 . The 20 countries of the Near East and North Africa face the worst prospects .
The Near East is the most water - short region in the world .
In fact , the entire Near East “ ran out of water ” in 1972 , when the region ’s total population was 122 million , according to Tony Allan , a University of London expert on water resources .
Since then , the region has withdrawn more water from its rivers and aquifers every year than is being replenished .
Currently , for example , Jordan and Yemen withdraw 30 % more water from groundwater aquifers every year than is replenished .
Also , Israel ’s annual water use already exceeds its renewable supply by 15 % .
3. Saudi Arabia presents one of the worst cases of unsustainable water use in the world .
This extremely arid country now must mine fossil groundwater for three - quarters of its water needs .
Fossil groundwater depletion in Saudi Arabia has been averaging around 5.2 billion cubic meters a year
4 . Of 14 countries in the Near East , 11 are already facing water scarcity .
In five of these countries the populations are projected to double within the next two decades .
Water is one of the major political issues confronting the region ’s leaders .
Since virtually all rivers in the Near East are shared by several nations , current tensions over water rights could escalate into outright conflicts , driven by population growth and rising demand for an increasingly scarce resource .
5 . In many countries , the water problem is the primary reason people are unable to rise out of poverty .
Women and children bear the burdens disproportionately , often spending six hours or more each day fetching water for their families and communities .
6. 1.1 billion people in the world do not have access to safe drinking water , roughly one - sixth of the world ’s population .
7. 2.2 million people in developing countries , most of them children , die every year from diseases associated with lack of access to safe drinking water , inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene .
8 . Half of the world ’s hospital beds are filled with people suffering from water related illnesses .
9 . In the past 10 years , diarrhea has killed more children than all the people lost to armed conflict since World War II .
10 .
Despite the size of the problem , we have made little progress against it .
There were only 181 million fewer people living without safe drinking water in rural settings in 2004 ( 899 million ) vs. 1990 ( 1.08 billion )
11. 50 percent of people on earth lack adequate sanitation .
Another way to look at it : Nearly half of the world ’s population fails to receive the level of water services available 2,000 years ago to the citizens of ancient Rome .
12 . Some 6,000 children die every day from disease associated with lack of access to safe drinking water , inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene – equivalent to 20 jumbo jets crashing every day .
13 .
The average distance that women in Africa and Asia walk to collect water is six kilometers .
14 .
Tens of millions of children cannot go to school as they must fetch water every day .
Drop out rates for adolescent girls , who even make it that far , skyrocket once they hit puberty as there are no private sanitation facilities at their schools .
15 . 80 percent of diseases in the developing world are caused by contaminated water
16 . Waterborne diseases ( the consequence of a combination of lack of clean water supply and inadequate sanitation ) cost the Indian economy 73 million working days per year .
17 .
It is estimated that pneumonia , diarrhea , tuberculosis and malaria , which account for 20 % of global disease burden , receive less than one percent of total public and private funds devoted to health research .
18 . If we did nothing other than provide access to clean water , without any other medical intervention , we could save 2 million lives a year .
19 .
The water and sanitation crisis claims more lives through disease than any war claims through guns .
20 .
In China , India and Indonesia , twice as many people are dying from diarrheal diseases as from HIV / AIDS .
21 . The average person in the developing world uses 2.64 gallons of water a day .
The average person in the United Kingdom uses 35.66 gallons of water per day .
The average person in the United States uses between 100 and 175 gallons every day at home .
22 . More than 40 million hours are wasted each year in Africa alone from women and children gathering water .
23 .
In 1998 , 308,000 people died from war in Africa , but more than two million ( six times as many ) died from diarrheal disease .
24 .
It is estimated that 5.3 billion people , two - thirds of the world ’s population , will suffer from water shortages by 2025 .
25 . Water is a $ 400 billion dollar global industry ; the third largest behind electricity and oil .
26 .
The UN estimates it would cost an additional $ 30 billion to provide access to safe water to the entire planet .
That ’s a third of what the world spends in a year on bottled water .
27 .
An estimated 25 % of people from cities in developing countries purchase their water from vendors at a significantly higher price than piped water .
In some cases , it costs more than a quarter of their household income .
28 . The average American uses 100 to 175 gallons of water per day .
The average African uses 5 gallons per day .
29 .
It takes 5 liters of water to make 1 liter of bottled water .
30 .
Almost 70 percent of the available fresh water gets used for irrigation in agriculture .
31 . More than half of the water used for irrigation leaks , evaporates or runs off .
32 . It takes 2,900 gallons of water to produce one quarter pound hamburger ( just the meat )
33 .
Half of the world ’s 500 major rivers are seriously depleted or polluted .
34 .
There are more than 300,000 contaminated groundwater sites in the United States .
35 .
The water we drink today is the same water the dinosaurs drank — there is no new water .
36 .
The daily per capita use of water in residential areas is :
a. 350 litres in North America and Japan
b. 200 litres in Europe
c. 10 - 20 litres in sub-Saharan Africa
37 .
Over 260 river basins are shared by two or more countries mostly without adequate legal or institutional arrangements .
38 .
The quantity of water needed to produce 1 kg of :
wheat : 1 000 L
rice : 1 400 L
beef : 13 000 L
39 .
While the world ’s population tripled in the 20th century , the use of renewable water resources has grown six - fold .
40 .
Within the next fifty years , the world population will increase by another 40 to 50 % .
This population growth – coupled with industrialization and urbanization – will result in an increasing demand for water and will have serious consequences on the environment .
41 . Already there is more waste water generated and dispersed today than at any other time in the history of our planet : more than one out of six people lack access to safe drinking water , namely 1.1 billion people , and more than two out of six lack adequate sanitation , namely 2.6 billion people
42 . Although food security has been significantly increased in the past thirty years , water withdrawals for irrigation represent 66 % of the total withdrawals and up to 90 % in arid regions , the other 34 % being used by domestic households ( 10 % ) , industry ( 20 % ) , or evaporated from reservoirs ( 4 % ) .
43 .
As the per capita use increases due to changes in lifestyle and as population increases as well , the proportion of water for human use is increasing .
This , coupled with spatial and temporal variations in water availability , means that the water to produce food for human consumption , industrial processes and all the other uses is becoming scarce .
44 .
It is all the more critical that increased water use by humans does not only reduce the amount of water available for industrial and agricultural development but has a profound effect on aquatic ecosystems and their dependent species .
Environmental balances are disturbed and cannot play their regulating role anymore .
45 . Water stress results from an imbalance between water use and water resources .
The water stress indicator in this map measures the proportion of water withdrawal with respect to total renewable resources .
It is a criticality ratio , which implies that water stress depends on the variability of resources .
Water stress causes deterioration of fresh water resources in terms of quantity ( aquifer over - exploitation , dry rivers , etc. ) and quality ( eutrophication , organic matter pollution , saline intrusion , etc . )
The value of this criticality ratio that indicates high water stress is based on expert judgment and experience .
It ranges between 20 % for basins with highly variable runoff and 60 % for temperate zone basins .
In this map , an overall value of 40 % was taken in order to indicate high water stress .
We see that the situation is heterogeneous over the world .
46 .
As the resource is becoming scarce , tensions among different users may intensify , both at the national and international level .
Over 260 river basins are shared by two or more countries .
Changes within a basin can lead to transboundary tensions .
Major projects can become a point of conflicts , heightening regional instability .
47 . The Parana La Plata , the Aral Sea , the Jordan and the Danube serve as examples of tensions over water supply .
Due to the pressure on the Aral Sea , half of its superficy has disappeared , representing 2/3 of its volume .
36 000 km2 of marin grounds are now recovered by salt .
49 .
There are many countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to human health and inadequate drinking water .
The following is a partial list of some of the countries with significant populations ( numerical population of affected population listed ) whose only consumption is of contaminated water :
 Sudan 12.3 million
 Venezuela 5.0 million
 Zimbabwe 2.7 million
 Tunisia 2.1 million
 Cuba 1.2 million
50 .
According to the California Department of Water Resources , if more supplies are n’t found by 2020 , the region will face a shortfall nearly as great as the amount consumed today .
50 . Los Angeles is a coastal desert able to support at most 1 million people on its own water ; the Los Angeles basin now is the core of a megacity that spans 220 miles ( 350 km ) from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border .
The region ’s population is expected to reach 41 million by 2020 , up from 28 million in 2009 .
The population of California continues to grow by more than two million a year and is expected to reach 75 million in 2030 , up from 49 million in 2009 .
But water shortage is likely to surface well before then .
51 . Water deficits , which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries , may soon do the same in larger countries , such as China and India .
52 .
The water tables are falling in scores of countries ( including Northern China , the US , and India ) due to widespread over pumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps .
Other countries affected include Pakistan , Iran , and Mexico .
This will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest .
53 .
Even with the over pumping of its aquifers , China is developing a grain deficit .
54 .
Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages .
Unless population growth can be slowed quickly it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage .
55 . After China and India , there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits — Algeria , Egypt , Iran , Mexico , and Pakistan .
Four of these already import a large share of their grain .
Only Pakistan remains self - sufficient .
But with a population expanding by 4 million a year , it will also likely soon turn to the world market for grain .
56 . Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers . [ 28 ] India , China , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades .
In India alone , the Ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people .
57 .
By far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback .
In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term , possibly irreversible , severe ecological damage for the whole Murray - Darling basin if it does not receive sufficient water by October .
58 .
Water restrictions are currently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages resulting from drought .
59 .
The Australian of the year 2007 , environmentalist Tim Flannery , predicted that unless it made drastic changes , Perth in Western Australia could become the world ’s first ghost metropolis , an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population .
60 .
Construction of wastewater treatment plants and reduction of groundwater over drafting appear to be obvious solutions to the worldwide problem ; however , a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play .
Wastewater treatment is highly capital intensive , restricting access to this technology in some regions ; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race that is difficult to win .
As if those factors are not daunting enough , one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain wastewater treatment plants even if they are successfully developed .
61 . Reduction in groundwater overdrafting is usually politically very unpopular and has major economic impacts to farmers ; moreover , this strategy will necessarily reduce crop output , which is something the world can ill - afford , given the population level at present .
62 . While an energy crisis is looming large on one side , a new study cautions that India ’s water demand will outstrip supply a few decades from now – if not sooner .
63 .
A study by T N Narasimhan , a professor at the University of California at Berkeley , says the Indian government has “ seriously overestimated ” available and utilizable water resources .
Narasimhan ’s study is in the June issue of the Journal of Earth Systems Science published by the Indian Academy of Sciences here .
It says that optimistic projections made by India ’s Planning Commission as late as in 2007 are incorrect .
He says these estimates were based on data provided by the water resources ministry in 1999 that “ significantly underestimated ” evapotranspiration ( ET ) – a term used to describe the amount of water lost due to evaporation of surface water and “ transpiration ” by plants and trees .
According to the study , the use of more realistic value for ET would reduce the amount of water available for human use by at least 37 percent .
64 . Last year N.K. Garg of the Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi ( IIT - D ) called for urgent action before water scarcity “ becomes unmanageable ” .
He said the government has overestimated utilizable water by as much as 68 percent and that India is unlikely to meet the annual demand of 897 billion cubic metres ( BCM ) projected for 2050 “ even after full development of utilizable water resources ” .
65 .
The source of water for all uses in India is the 3,838 BCM of rainfall it receives annually .
Part of it enters rivers and streams , another part recharges the groundwater , and the third part is lost due to ET .
According to the Planning Commission ’s calculations , the surface flow and recharge components add up to 60 percent – or 2,301 BCM – of the total rainfall and this is available for human use .
This implies that the remaining 40 percent is lost due to ET .
66 . Due to engineering and environmental constraints , only about half of the available water in India – or 712 BCM – is actually “ utilizable . ”
If we compare this 712 BCM of utilizable water with the current use of 634 BCM , it is clear that India is already at the threshold of over - development of water resources .
Thus , India has to be seriously concerned about shortage of water right now rather than a few decades from now .
67 .
Almost all the basins in India would become water - deficit , thereby raising a big question about the availability of water for inter - basin transfer .
68 . ET for India has been estimated so far by indirect means – subtracting run off and ground recharge from total rainfall – which is not accurate .
A rigorous assessment of ET has not been made partly because water resource data is restricted by the government .
69 .
An unexpectedly abrupt decline in the supply of water for China ’s farmers poses a rising threat to world food security .
China depends on irrigated land to produce 70 percent of the grain for its huge population of 1.2 billion people , but it is drawing more and more of that water to supply the needs of its cities and industries .
70 .
As rivers run dry and aquifers are depleted , the emerging water shortages could sharply raise China ’s demand for grain imports .
71 .
The decline in China ’s capacity to irrigate its crops is coming at a time when depleted world grain stocks are near an all time low .
72 . Low income countries with growing grain deficits may not be able to pay higher prices .
For the 1.3 billion of the world ’s people who live on $ 1 a day or less , higher grain prices could quickly become life - threatening .
73 . SINCE MID - CENTURY , the population of China has grown by nearly 700 million — an increase almost equivalent to adding the whole population of the world at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution .
Most of that population has concentrated in the region through which several great rivers , including the Yellow and the Yangtze , flow .
Those rivers provide the irrigation water needed to grow much of the food for China , as well as the water for its cities and industries .
74 .
The dependence of China on a few rivers has placed a growing burden on the region ’s land and water resources , because the Chinese population has not been able to expand into new land the way the Americans once did with their westward expansion into the Great Plains and California .
In China , the western half of the country is mostly desert or mountains .
75 .
The concentration of Chinese population , industry , and agriculture has been roughly equivalent to squeezing the entire U.S. population into the region east of the Mississippi , then multiplying it by five .
76 . A quarter - century ago , with more and more of its water being pumped out for the country ’s multiplying needs , the Yellow River began to falter .
In 1972 , the water level fell so low that for the first time in China ’s long history it dried up before reaching the sea .
It failed on 15 days that year , and intermittently over the next decade or so .
Since 1985 , it has run dry each year , with the dry period becoming progressively longer .
In 1996 , it was dry for 133 days .
In 1997 , a year exacerbated by drought , it failed to reach the sea for 226 days .
For long stretches , it did not even reach Shandong Province , the last province it flows through a route to the sea .
77 . Shandong , the source of one - fifth of China ’s corn and one - seventh of its wheat , depends on the Yellow River for half of its irrigation water .
Although it is perhaps the most visible manifestation of water scarcity in China , the drying - up of the Yellow River is only one of many such signs .
78 . The Huai , a river situated between the Yellow and Yangtze , was drained dry in 1997 , and failed to reach the sea for 90 days .
Satellite photographs show hundreds of lakes disappearing and local streams going dry in recent years , as water tables fall and springs cease to flow .
79 .
The Fen river in China that runs through Taiyuan , the capital city of Shanxi province , no longer exists .
The major river in the province , and the lifeline of Taiyuan , was emptied to fuel the city ’s coal industry .
Big industrial wells driven more than 300 feet , and sometimes as much as 2,500 feet into the ground , tap Taiyuan ’s last remaining groundwater resources .
This city of 2 million has come to the stage in which they either shift the population or divert water from the Yellow River , more than 200 milesaway .
80 .
As water tables have fallen , millions of Chinese farmers are finding their wells pumped dry .
81 . In the geography of water , there are two Chinas .
The humid South includes the vast Yangtze River and a population of 700 million .
The arid North includes the Yellow , Liao , Hai , and Huai Rivers , and growing .
82 . ALTHOUGH 70 PERCENT OF THE GRAIN produced in China comes from irrigated land , the country is seeing its irrigation supply depleted on three fronts : the diversion of water from rivers and reservoirs to cities ; the depletion of underground supplies in aquifers ; and the increasing pollution caused by rapid industrialization .
83 .
Politically , it is difficult for any government to deny people water for their showers and toilets , if they can afford to buy it .
84 . Economically , farms can’t compete with factories for water .
As competition among farms , homes , and industries intensifies , farms inevitably lose out .
85 . Of China ’s 617 largest cities , 300 are already facing water shortages .
In those areas of North China where all available water is being used , these shortfalls can be filled only by diverting water from agriculture .
86 .
In the spring of 1994 , farmers in the region surrounding Beijing were denied access to reservoirs , their traditional source of irrigation water , because all the water was needed to satisfy the city ’s burgeoning demand .
That established a pattern for water - stressed cities all over the North China Plain .
87 . A thousand tons of water produces one ton of wheat , which has a market value of $ 400 , whereas the same amount of water used in industry yields an estimated $ 14,000 of output — 70 times as much .
88 . While farmers are losing out to cities and industries politically , they are also losing ground hydrologically .
As the demand for underground water increases over time , the pumping eventually surpasses the natural recharge of the aquifer , which comes from precipitation in the upstream portion of the watershed .
After this “ sustainable yield threshold ” is passed , the water table starts to fall .
If demand continues to climb , the excess of pumping over the sustainable yield of the aquifer widens each year .
As a result , the distance the water table falls increases each year .
Once the aquifer is depleted , the amount of water pumped is limited to the rate of recharge .
It can not be otherwise .
If the pumping has been taking place at double the recharge when depletion occurs , then thepumping will be cut by half .
If pumping has been five times the recharge , it will be cut by four fifths .
Under the North China Plain , if the water table is falling 1.5 meters per year , then the pumping could easily be occurring at double the recharge rate .
And if it is , the time will come when the amount of water pumped in this wheat and corn belt will be necessarily cut by half .
89 .
When farmers lose irrigation water , they either revert to dryland ( rain - fed ) farming if rainfall is sufficient or they abandon the land if it is not .
For China , most of the land will simply revert to dryland agriculture .
The yield will then decline by about one - half to two - thirds .
90 .
There are 50,000 kilometers of major rivers in China , and , according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization , 80 percent of them are so degraded they no longer support fish .
As a result of toxic discharge from cities and upstream enterprises , which include such highly polluting industries as paper mills , tanneries , oil - refineries and chemical plants , the Yellow River water is now loaded with heavy metals and other toxins that make it unfit even for irrigation , much less for human consumption , along much of its route .
91 . Water pollution horror stories abound throughout China as farmers — for want of a cleaner source — irrigate with heavily polluted water .
In Shanxi province , in the Yellow River watershed , rice has been found to contain excessive levels of chromium and lead , and cabbage is laced with cadmium .
Along the length of the Yellow River , abnormally high rates of mental retardation , stunting , and developmental diseases are linked to elevated concentrations of arsenic and lead in the water and food .
92 .
As industrialization outpaces pollution control , more and more river water is rendered unsuitable for irrigation .
In the heavily industrialized , heavily populated Yangtze valley , it may not be the diversion of water to industry that most threatens agriculture , but the pollution of water by industry , which renders it unsuitable for irrigation to begin with .
93 .
Water crisis in the Middle East is an ancient and a regional problem .
More than 3000 years ago , the Old Testament highlights quarrels between Isaac and the Philistine shepherds about well rights .
All ancient cultures were developed along the three major river systems — the Nile , the Euphrates , and the Tigris — and along the small rivers like the Jordan .
94 . Center for Strategic and International Studies predicts that water , and not oil , will become a dominant subject of conflict in the middle east .
Rapidly growing populations , ambitious development programs , and prolonged droughts have accelerated this transformation .
95 .
There are rich water sources in Turkey , and a number of other countries , in particular Syria and Iraq , are dependent on this water .
This is the reason that large , regional - scale projects have been suggested , such as the ‘ Peace Pipe ’ that would aim to carry water from east Turkey to the western area of Saudi Arabia .
It is also the reason that Israel is considering importing water from Turkey through the Mediterranean Sea .
96 . Physical geography and average annual rainfall are certainly the major factors controlling the water resources of Israel , Jordan , and the Palestinian Authority .
The three major water bodies are the Dead Sea and the Lake of Galilee ( Tiberias ) in the Dead Sea Rift at the eastern boundary of Israel , and the Mediterranean Sea at the western boundary .
The coastal area adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea and the mountains of central Israel , which are the major groundwater aquifers , are also shown , as well as both the desert areas and the rainy zones in Israel , Jordan , and the Palestinian Authority .
Low average precipitation indicates that a water crisis is almost inevitable , and the climatic zones indicate that the only way to live in the desert is to transfer water from north to south in Israel .
97 .
The scarcity of water in the Jordan River ( annual discharge approximately 600 million cubic metres ) and in the Yarmuk River ( annual discharge approximately 500 million cubic metres ) systems has made water supply a strategic issue for Israel , which led to the development of the Johnson Plan ( 1956 ) , which followed the ‘ Water War ’ between Israel and Syria in the 1950s
98 .
A map of groundwater basins and groundwater recharge in Israel indicates that the importantaquifers are Kinneret , and the coastal and mountain aquifers .
Fossil water is also common for most of the southern aquifers in Jordan , and a few minor ones in southern Israel .
Since the rainy winter of 1992 , the water level in the aquifers has dropped down even below the red lines , a fact that endangers water quality
99 .
The water crisis in Israel is being caused by a depletion of water reservoirs , associated with water - quality deterioration , which is endangering the water supply .
According to an Israeli parliamentary investigation committee , the water crisis in Israel is a result of over 30 years of overpumping , and the management of the water resources without a clear , sustainable policy .
100 .
In September 2006 , the water crisis in Jeddah , in Saudia Arabia reached a peak as many people , Saudis and expatriates , were obliged to welcome the holy month of Ramadan without water .
Hundreds of people thronged the water distribution center in order to get coupons for tankers .
The crisis created a black market in which water was sold at more than SR500 per tanker .
Normally , the cost of a tanker is about SR115 .
Israel ’s Financial Expert
JOHANNESBURG ( Reuters ) - Secretive North Korea make a first return to the World Cup since 1966 on Tuesday but could hardly face a bigger challenge than five - times champions Brazil .
Hoping to recapture the form that famously took them to the quarter - finals in England back then , the ultra - defensive North Koreans have been training together for four months on a tour across three continents from Sri Lanka to Venezuela .
As with most aspects of their hermetic communist - run nation , mystery surrounds the tournament ’s lowest - ranked team .
The North Koreans do , however , have a reputation for fitness , speed on the break and defense at all costs .
That could be a worry for Brazil , who have developed solidity but lost some flair under coach Dunga , and even at home failed to breach the defensive walls of lowly Venezuela , Colombia and Brazil in World Cup qualifiers .
“ Nobody talks about them but they play good football , ” said Ivory Coast manager Sven - Goran Eriksson of North Korea .
Ivory Coast are in the same Group G and hope captain and inspirational striker Didier Drogba will declare himself fit to take on Portugal and their wing wizard Cristiano Ronaldo in another match on Tuesday .
Drogba has a fractured forearm .
North Korea are not the only underdogs hoping for a shock .
New Zealand and Slovakia face off in the opening game , both dreaming of becoming the World Cup ’s surprise package .
Better known as a rugby nation , New Zealand ’s All Whites are hoping to do better than their only previous appearance at a World Cup when they lost all their group games in 1982 .
“ It ’s been a long time , has n’t it ? ” said coach and former All Whites defender Ricki Herbert , remembering how he swapped shirts with Brazil ’s Socrates after a 4 - 0 drubbing .
Playing their first World Cup as an independent nation , Slovakia ’s coach Vladimir Weiss also has past experience in the tournament .
He was part of the Czechoslovakia team that reached the quarter - finals in Italy in 1990 .
JABULANI , VUVUZELA DEBATES RAGE
Only Germany have really sparkled so far in the early games of the first World Cup on African soil , their young side ’s 4 - 0 hammering of Australia sending a shudder through rivals .
Netherlands have a talent - packed team , but with winger Arjen Robben missing through injury , they failed to shine in a prosaic 2 - 0 win over Denmark at Soccer City on Monday .
Other European heavyweights , Italy , followed their tradition of slow starts with a 1 - 1 draw against Paraguay on Monday , the aging “ Azzurri ” team coming from a goal down to avoid an upset .

African nations have registered only one win so far , Ghana beating Serbia on Sunday to spark parties across the continent .
Another of Africa ’s best hopes , Cameroon , were surprisingly humbled on Monday by Japan , who beat them 1 - 0 in their first World Cup finals victory on foreign soil despite a dire string of results in pre-tournament warmups .
“ To be honest the mood was not the best but ... our team delivered our best , ” goalscorer Keisuke Honda said .
Off the pitch , hosts South Africa are delighted at the smooth running of a tournament doommongers said they would be unable to handle .

The only serious problem in the first four days came when police teargassed stewards protesting over wages in the coastal city of Durban after the Germany - Australia game on Sunday .
Controversy is growing among players and coaches alike over the World Cup ’s new ball , called the Jabulani after the Zulu word for celebrate .
Crosses , free - kicks and long - range shots have been skying over their targets , and players are nervous .
“ The ball is tricky and not just for the keepers but for all the players , ” Danish goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen said after his team ’s defeat to Netherlands , adding attitude was a factor too .
Debate will not go away either over the ubiquitous local vuvuzela trumpet , which creates a deafening wall of sound like a gigantic swarm of bees inside stadiums .
Supporters say it is an essential part of local culture , while critics hate the vuvuzela for drowning out crowd chants , preventing communication between players and coaches , and creating a din that has many reaching for earplugs .
Talk of outlawing them has been squashed though .
“ Vuvuzelas are here to stay and will never be banned , ” said Rich Mkhondo , a spokesman for the local World Cup organizing committee .
“ As our guests please embrace our culture , please embrace the way we celebrate . ”
Meanwhile , sales of vuvuzelas -- and earplugs -- continue to go through the roof , according to their manufacturers .
New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- BP will try again within the next day to cap a well that has gushed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , the energy company said Friday .
The latest attempt will involve inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe , collecting oil and sending it to a vessel on the surface , said Mark Proegler , a BP spokesman .
The insertion tube was on the sea floor , and engineers planned to move it into place later in the day , Proegler said .
The company has lowered a smaller containment dome for use if the insertion tube does not stem the flow of oil into the water , Proegler said .
But Adm . Thad Allen , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard , said twice Friday that the containment dome , referred to as a " top hat , " was the first choice , followed by the insertion tube .
Officials could not explain the discrepancy .
Neither procedure would be a permanent solution , Allen said Friday in Mississippi .
The procedures , he said , " will reduce the leakage , not stop the leakage . "
The ultimate solution , Allen said , will be achieved by relief wells that are being drilled near the leak site .
Those will take weeks , if not months , to complete , BP has said .
After much discussion over whether the use of subsea dispersants could cause ecological damage , Coast Guard Rear Adm .
Mary Landry said Friday that officials have concluded that it " is an option we can consider and will move ahead with . "
The decision was made after the results of three tests were analyzed , she said .
" This is not a decision that was made lightly , but it is a series of tradeoffs .
You 're really trying to minimize the impact on the environment as best as possible . "
Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , said the company has spent more than $ 450 million responding to the spill and that more than 14,000 people are involved in the effort .
To date , more than 1.2 million feet of boom have been deployed and another 400,000 feet of boom have been staged for deployment , he said .
In all , the company is trying to accumulate 3.5 million feet of boom .
The forecast this weekend and early next week " looks very favorable to use all tools , " he said , citing burning , skimming operations and use of surface and subsurface dispersants .
Suttles said the spill has had " limited impact " on shore , with oil being found in four locations in Louisiana , two in Alabama and one in Mississippi .
In Washington , President Barack Obama criticized executives from BP and two other companies for blaming each other for the catastrophe .
" It is absolutely essential that , going forward , we put in place every necessary safeguard and protection so that a tragedy like this oil spill does not happen again , " Obama said after meeting Friday with Cabinet members to discuss the spill .
Read about oil spill responses
" This is a responsibility that all of us share , " Obama said .
" The oil companies share it .
The manufacturers of this equipment share it .
The agencies in the federal government in charge of oversight share that responsibility .
I will not tolerate more finger - pointing or irresponsibility . "
BP 's efforts to plug the leak come amid growing concern that the company has been low - balling how much oil has poured out of the well .
Rep. Edward Markey , D - Massachusetts , sent BP a letter Friday asking for details from federal agencies about the methods they are using to analyze the oil leak .
Markey , who chairs a congressional subcommittee on energy and the environment , said he would launch a formal inquiry after learning of independent estimates that are significantly higher than the amount BP officials have provided .
" The public needs to know the answers to very basic questions : how much oil is leaking into the Gulf and how much oil can be expected to end up on our shores and our ocean environment ? "
Markey said in a letter to BP .
" I am concerned that an underestimation of the flow may be impeding the ability to solve the leak and handle management of the disaster . "
Track the oil spill
BP has said since the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drill rig that about 5,000 barrels -- or 210,000 gallons -- have been pouring out of the well a day .
The company says it reached that number using data , satellite images and consultation with the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
" I think that 's a good range , " Suttles said Friday .
But a researcher at Purdue University said BP 's estimate is low .
Associate Professor Steve Wereley said that about 70,000 barrels of oil are leaking each day , based on an analysis of video of the spill .
" You can't say with precision , but you can see there 's definitely more coming out of that pipe than people thought , " he said .
" It 's definitely not 5,000 barrels a day . "
A BP executive rejected that assertion Friday .
" Well , that 's not what our experts , multiple experts , not only from BP , and the industry say , " said Bob Dudley , BP managing director for the Americas and Asia .
" This crude is what 's called a light - sweet crude .
It has lots of gas and when it comes out , it expands very rapidly , a little bit like bubbles in a soda pop .
So it 's very difficult to look at it and say that the volume will be much higher .
We certainly do n't see that at the surface . "
The dispute over the size of the leak caps a week in which congressional committees grilled executives from BP and two other companies : drilling contractor Transocean Ltd. , which owned the rig , and oilfield services contractor Halliburton , which was responsible for cementing the well shut once drilled .
The companies blamed each other .
BP pointed to Transocean , which said BP was responsible for the wellhead 's design and Halliburton was responsible for the cement finishing work .
Halliburton , in turn , said its workers were just following BP 's orders , but that Transocean was responsible for maintaining the rig 's blowout preventer .
i Report : Send your photos , videos
Obama took exception Friday .
" I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter , " the president said .
" You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else .
The American people could not have been impressed with that display , and I certainly was n't . "
Obama said the federal government also was taking responsibility for its role .
" For too long , for a decade or more , there 's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill , " Obama said .
" It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies .
" That cannot and will not happen anymore .
To borrow an old phrase , we will trust , but we will verify . "
As a result , Obama said , the Mineral Management Service will be restructured , with the part of the agency that permits oil and gas drilling and collects royalties separated from the part of the agency in charge of inspecting the safety of oil rigs and platforms and enforcing the law .
" That way , there 's no conflict of interest , real or perceived , " Obama said .
In addition , Obama said , the administration has ordered immediate inspections of all deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico , and no drilling permits will be issued until a 30 - day safety - and - environmental review is completed .
Obama also announced a new examination of the environmental procedures for oil and gas exploration and development .

BP , the Coast Guard and state and local authorities have scrambled to keep the oil from reaching shore or the ecologically delicate coastal wetlands off Louisiana .
They have burned off patches of the slick , deployed more than 280 miles of protective booms , skimmed as much as 4 million gallons of oily water off the surface of the Gulf and pumped more than 400,000 gallons of chemical dispersants onto the oil .
On Friday , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration closed off to fishing another part of the Gulf of Mexico over which the federal government has jurisdiction .
NOAA has now closed 19,377 square miles ( 50,187 square kilometers ) , which is 8 percent of the Gulf area within 200 miles of the coast , called an exclusive economic zone .
The closed area a week earlier had been 4.5 percent .

" Several people have told us they heard the disturbance on the street and looked out to see what was going on , from their statement we 've been able to piece together a sequence of events and are now following strong leads in relation to who was responsible . "
The man 's ear was severed but remained attached .
He had left hospital and been interviewed by detectives .
Mr Thompson said the attack would have been very noisy and anyone with information should contact police immediately .
One attacker was described as a Caucasian of medium build , about 180 cm tall , with a " Justin Bieber - style haircut " .
He was wearing jeans and a dark hooded sweatshirt and may have had a black BMX bicycle with white handle bars .
No description was provider of the second attacker .
A Beach homeowner , angered by Councillor Sandra Bussin ’s attempt to have his house designated as a heritage property and stop its redevelopment has taken his fight to her doorstep .
Geoff Teehan and his wife Melissa challenged Bussin from the front row of a local meeting Thursday night at Adam Beck Community Centre .
“ This is my life , ” shouted Teehan angrily at Bussin , who sat only a metre from him .
About 40 supporters noisily filled the small room .
The Teehans bought 204 Beech Ave. this year with the intention of tearing down the existing century - old cottage - style home and replacing it with one that is fully accessible .
Melissa Teehan , 38 , was diagnosed in 2007 with transverse myelitis , a rare neurological disorder , and is confined to a wheelchair .
The couple has two sons , 7 and 9 .
“ You ’re on the wrong end of this and you know it , ” her husband told Bussin .
“ We did our due diligence . ”
The Teehans made sure the house had no heritage designation before purchasing it , but Bussin became involved when a neighbour complained the house should not be torn down .
Bussin said Thursday night that she ’d told the Teehans that she was going to do an “ investigation , ” to which both Teehans replied , “ No , you said ‘ bear with me . ’ ”
Teehan accused Bussin of going behind the couple ’s back when she commissioned ERA Architects to determine if the house had heritage value .
She then presented the report at community council May 25 and moved that the city ’s Heritage Preservation Services should report speedily on whether it should receive a historic designation .
At Thursday night ’s meeting Bussin refused to answer when asked repeatedly by the Teehans and others about much the report cost and exactly how many people complained to her about the heritage value of the house .
“ I am not going to be interrogated , ” said Bussin .
“ This meeting will come to an end if there is continued shouting , ” she threatened .
Moments later , it did — an hour early and without any resolution .
Local resident Nikisha Reyes - Grange was frustrated by the city ’s interference .
“ What happens if you end up in a wheelchair ?
You can no longer live in the Beach ? ” Reyes - Grange observed .
Gerald Marois heard the bear before he saw it .
“ I turned around and he was about 50 feet away — one of the biggest bears I had ever seen in my life .
“ He looked at me and moved sideways a bit , I start backing up and he just charged me .
He came full blast , man . ”
Marois , 47 , a retired steelworker and experienced hunter from Waubaushene , was mauled by a large black bear last Tuesday evening in a remote wooded area about 30 km northwest of Orillia .
He was airlifted to Sunnybrook hospital , where he gave the Star an exclusive and terrifying account of his near - death encounter .
Marois was planting a food plot in a small clearing about 150 feet inside the bush line , where he planned to hunt deer in the fall — “ My Dad taught me that ’s where you get the big buck ” — when the bear came up from behind him .
“ His head was huge , his eyes were really far apart from each other and he had tiny , tiny ears , which is the sign of a huge boar — probably 600 pounds . ”
When the bear charged , Marois said he turned around and ran toward a nearby oak tree —
“ The one I wanted to put my tree - stand in ” — and climbed three - quarters of the way up .
The bear followed him up .
Marois shakes as he tells the story from his hospital bed , his arms , legs and face covered in deep gashes .
Marois said he tried to fight the bear off from the trees upper branches , but it kept coming up after him .
“ I was hitting him on the nose and on the head , trying to hurt him , and every time I hit him he was scraping me and just pulling on my boots . ”
The bear pulled one of his boots off and started biting the bottom of his feet .
“ Then he dragged me almost to the ground . ”
Marois tried and tried to get away from the bear by climbing farther up the tree , but the bear repeatedly dragged him down .
“ I was kicking him with the other boot and he grabbed that boot and he ripped it right off . ”
The bear then tried to rip off Marois ’s chest waders .
“ That was messing him up , because they were coming back like an elastic , eh ?
And it was hard for him to rip them off . ”
But the bear eventually got them .
“ Then he started eating my flesh . ”
Marois said he watched as the bear started eating into his right calf .
“ He was eating my meat and he was licking the blood and licking himself and just enjoying every bite of it .
Marois suffered his worst injuries to his legs , which required a skin graft to repair .
They look torn apart and scrawny when he lifts up his hospital gown .
“ He ate my whole calf . ”
Marois says he made at least 10 attempts to climb away from the bear and it kept coming after him .
“ I was trying to get away from him in every direction that I could in that oak tree , but he kept on dragging me down ; he wanted me down on the ground . ”
Marois , who said he forgot his bear spray at home , then turned to the only weapon he had .
“ I got my lighter out ” — a regular cigarette lighter — “ and I started burning his face . ”
Marois said when he shoved the lighter in the bear ’s face it clawed him in the head .
“ And that was it with the lighter , eh ? No more lighters . ”
Proof of the bear ’s swipe comes in the two long rows of stitches on the top and side of Marois ’s head .
“ I got really weak from that hit .
I had barely nothing left , so I told God I was putting my life in his hands . ”
He said he prayed to God to send his guardian angel to protect him , because he could n’t fight the bear off any longer .
At that moment , the bear threw Marois from the tree — Marois figures about 20 feet — and he landed with a thud and a loud groan .
When he looked up he watched the bear dive out of the tree in the opposite direction .
“ It seemed like God scare him , man .
People do n’t believe in God , but I ’m telling you , man , something scare him .
Because he got scared , he jumped in the rough and he took off . ”
Marois said the attack definitely lasted more than 15 minutes , though he says it “ felt like forever . ”

But he knew he still was n’t safe .
He heard the bear roaming around him , gnashing his teeth and making a guttural barking noise Marois called a “ bawl ” — the same noise it made before charging at him .
“ I was sure I was dead .
I told God , ‘ Keep your hand over me , protect me . ’ ”
Marois called his wife and then 911 , but the rescue team and emergency crews could n’t find him in the thick bush .
It took rescuers — with the help of Marois ’ wife , Louise Beauchamp — more than an hour to find him .
All the while Marois could hear the bear nearby .
Eventually the rescuers found him , and with Marois ’s legs ripped to shreds , they moved him to a clearing where the air ambulance helicopter could land .
“ That ’s when I finally could breathe . ”
The next thing Marois remembers is waking up in the hospital .
Marois ’ health has been improving every day , but doctors tell him he may need plastic surgery to fix his legs .
He says he has nightmares about the attack every time he sleeps .
“ It ’s extremely hard for me to rest . ”
Though he sometimes struggles to tell the story , Marois speaks angrily about the cancellation of the spring bear hunt in Ontario more than 10 years ago .
“ I want ( Premier Dalton McGuinty ) to reconsider the spring bear hunt , so this does n’t happen no more . ”
Mike Harris ’s provincial government ended the spring bear hunt in 1999 after it had been in place for 30 years .
Critics called the spring hunt “ barbaric ” because it often left behind thousands of orphaned cubs .
All other Canadian provinces with bears have spring hunts except Nova Scotia .
Ontario still has a fall bear hunt , which starts in September .
A spokesman for Ontario ’s Ministry of Natural Resources said Friday that they thought the bear may have mistaken Marois — bent over and wearing chest waders — as a deer .
But Marois believes the bear was tracking him .
“ He did n’t mistake me for nothing .
That bear wanted to maul me ; he was hungry and he came to get me . ”
The ministry says bear encounters are not on the rise in the province , but Marois says he and his neighbours have seen different .
“ We live up north , the bear are coming in our town , in our kids ’ schoolyard .
They walk the streets with their babies .
“ I want the population of Toronto to be aware that they ’re not scared of us .
They roam the forest and if they ’re hungry , they ’ll get you , man .
There ’s nothing you can do about it . ”
Marois said his rescuers — a combination of OPP officers , paramedics and Port Severn firefighters — risked their lives entering the bush the way they did , not knowing if the bear was still in the area .
“ I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart . ”
Marois , who has been living in the Waubaushene area for more than 20 years , comes from a hunting family in rural Quebec .
“ I was born with a rabbit snare and a pellet gun in my hands . ”
But now he says he may never hunt again .
“ It will be really hard to go back in the bush after this . ”
Steve Jobs was on stage at the D8 conference and he shared with us some of his thoughts on the television market .
Well , taking his words literally and assuming that Steve honestly shared ALL of his most important thoughts on the TV market , we ’d say there will be no new Apple TV coming at WWDC 2010 .
We ’d also say that nowadays Apple has no idea on how to succeed in the television market .
Listen to Jobs :
The problem with innovation in the television industry is the go - to - market strategy .
The television industry fundamentally has a subsidized business model that gives everybody set - top box for free , or for $ 10 a month and that pretty much squashes any opportunity for innovation , because nobody is willing to buy a set - top box .
Ask TiVo , ask ReplayTV , ask Roku , ask Vudu , ask us , ask Google in few months .
Sony tried as well .
Panasonic tried .
A lot of people tried .
They all failed .
According to Apple CEO , we end up with table full of remotes , cluster full of boxes , bunch of different UIs .
That ’s the situation we have today .
All you can do is add a box under the TV system , Jobs said .
The only way that it ’s ever going to change is if you can really go back to square one and tear up the set - top box and redesign it from scratch , with the consistent UI , across all those different functions , and get it to the consumer in a way that they are willing to pay for it .
And right now , there is no way to do that !
– Jobs said firmly ( damn … ! )
So , that ’s the problem with the TV market .
We decided what product do we want the most : a better TV or a better phone .
The phone won out .
But there was no chance to do a better TV because there was no way to get it to market .
What do we want more : tablet or better TV ?
Well , probably a tablet , but it does n’t matter because if we wanted a better TV there is no way to get it to market .
The TV is going to lose until there is available go - to - market strategy .
Otherwise you just make another TiVO .
That ’s the fundamental problem – it ’s not a problem with technology , it ’s not a problem with vision , it ’s a fundamental go - to - market problem .
Is there any chance you partner with some cable operator ?
– Steve has been asked .
Then you run into another problem , which is : there is no cable operator that is national , he answered .
There is a bunch of cable operators .
And than , this is not like there is a GSM standard where you build a phone for the US and it also work in those other countries .
No , every single country has different standards , different government approvals , it ’s very balkanized .
I ’m sure smarter people than us will figure this out .
But that ’s why we say Apple TV is a hobby ; that ’s why we use that phrase .
Well , this could all mean that Apple focuses on iPhone and iPad , and they are not planning to introduce a new TV ( new set - top box ) in the near future .
Hopefully there are people who see things differently : Engadget notices that Steve has all this stuff really mulled over – according to the guys at the tech blog this confirms that we ’ll be hearing some next - Apple TV news at the WWDC10 .
TechCrunch even thinks that this all may push Apple to build televisions .
We hope Jobs has n’t really figured out that there is no way to figure out good go - to - market strategy for the new TV by Apple .

I think the difficulty ramps up too fast ; I actually died right off the bat more then once because of that first obstacle .
I also expected the hover move to have more of an effect - it's so subtle I did n't even think it was working at first .
It might also be nice to let the player hit a few obstacles before dying , instead of one - hit kills .
The character seems cool , does he have a back - story ?

I dunno , I wanted the game to be like a hard test of reflexes .
that , and IWBTG is hard , and hailed as one of the best indie games ever , right ?
So is a hard game really a bad game ?
Also , no .
No back - story yet , though I might give him one later on .

Not necessarily , but making the player feel like they could have avoided the death by skill rather than luck or sudden reaction time will make them come back for more , just to see if they can do it .
Sudden instant deaths have a habit of alienating new players .
Besides , a lot of people do n't play IWBTG beyond the first screen or two .
I do n't think health is a necessity for this style of game , but maybe more of a difficulty curve rather than a spike would do to improve the playability .
My other immediate thought was that the various objects are a bit incongruous just floating in a pleasant sky , maybe inside an industrial complex or something would make a bit more sense .
Nevertheless , good progress so far .

» In the last version , I thought it was pretty awkward to have to hold the direction you 're facing , then press the boost key .
This new version an improvement over the last version .
But it 's still somewhat unintuitive .
I think what you should do is make it so when you press Z , you boost in the direction your character is facing .
( If you 're facing left , and you press z , you boost left .
If you face right , and press z , you boost right )
Another problem I 'm still having is that I sometimes get more than one boost when I did n't intend to .
I think there needs to be more feedback , both visual and control - wise when you use a boost .
Maybe a more of delay between button presses , combined with a much more obvious visual indication ( maybe motion blur or have trails behind the character or something ) .
In fact , the game in general can benefit from more visual feedback .
Especially when you die , you just see a sudden game over screen .
Maybe instead you could show a death animation , wait for it to finish , then tell the player that it 's over .
Other than that , I agree with what everyone else is saying .
You should change the level design so it has more of a curve in difficulty rather than a sudden spike .
You do n't have to make it easier , just make it so the player can actually get into the game and learn the controls before you make it hard and start killing them off .

Quote IWBTG is hard , and hailed as one of the best indie games ever , right ?
IWBTG is famous not because it is hard , but because it is hilariously hard .
When you die in IWBTG , you feel rewarded on some level , since pretty much every way to die is creative and whimsical .
Crash Bandicoot 2 and 3 take advantage of this , too .
Without that , you 're left with a needlessly frustrating game that people just do n't feel compelled to complete .
However , this is salvageable ; what you need to do is focus on making the game less frustrating and more challenging .
Start the game off a bit easier so the players can get a feel for the controls without needing to restart over and over and to entice them to continue the game ( " I already made it this far ... " ) .
Many people would n't spend more than a few minutes on the Jumper games if they started them off right above spikes .
You should also work on the collision detection .
Bad collision detection is one of the most frustrating things a game can have .
I can't tell you what to do exactly since the game is pretty fast , but I can tell you that it just does n't " feel " right .
You should take inspiration from how most bullet hell games do their collision detection -- the player 's bounding box is only one pixel .
The player character in your game is quite a bit bigger so just one pixel would n't work , but you get the idea .
Better graphics and sound would also help .
An easy thing you can do is not make the music stop and restart every time you die , since that kinda breaks the flow .
Trackmania games would be quite a bit less fun if their awesome music restarted constantly .
The controls were fine the way they were before .
They are not the problem your game has .

I think it 's because you 're using the entire character as a hitbox .
In a fast moving game , that 's usually not a good idea .
Check out the hitbox for DoDonPachi ( a bullet hell game that involves lots and lots of bullets flying at you really fast ) , notice how the hitbox ( highligted in yellow ) is actually smaller than the player :
http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?p=574774#p574774
In fact , a lot of I agree with Skofo .
That 's a really good idea .
I did n't notice it before , but now that I think of it , the hit detection is kinda off .

In fact , a lot of hitboxes in arcade games ( not just bullet hell ones ) are generally pretty small to make it more manageable for the player to maneuver around objects .
If you used something similar , it would greatly improve the overall feel of your game .

» So , I kind of feel entitled to giving feedback now .
Sorry about this .
I mean to be honest , not nasty .
Skofo , Falsion , WS , Hanged - Man , nice points , I agree , probably will re-iterate your points .
Personally , not a big fan of IWBTG , but yeah , it 's a bit of a joke - game .
Not so much in that it 's trivial ( beating it requires superhuman reflexes and a graet deal of dedication ) , but in that it 's thematically absurd .
Cruel difficulty without a wink & a smile will alienate players .
So , naturally , really dug the " Moon Gravity " option .
I downloaded the 0.5 version a little earlier in the day and stopped playing after about 15 deaths .
Secondly , I know it 's the alpha , but all the sound needs to be revamped .
That music must n't be interrupted by death .
Considering my average lifespan is about 10 seconds , hearing a micro loop will make me turn off .
Shame , as the tune 's quite nice .
The sound effects are kind of ... harsh , I suppose the word is .
I do n't like hearing that SCHWEEE sound every time I boost .
Make it more subtle , quieter , and a little shorter .
The coin -collect has a nasty high pitch .
Consider sound effects in classic arcade games .
They 're short and satisfying .
Even delicious .
Finally , whilst simple , I think falling - and - dodging as a game mechanic can be very satisfying .
If I may make a somewhat strange sounding recommendation ( and disregard it if it sounds wrong to you - this is n't addressing a problem ) , the game needs to have a sensation of enormous speed no matter the actual speed .
The shmup " Cloudphobia " is probably my favourite example - the enemies hit you at a perfectly reasonable pace , but man , I feel like I 'm blistering through those clouds .
I 'm not sure how to do it , though .
Make the background tear along , add some simple blur effects , something .

It looks like the problems I had before were more hitbox related than control related .
Before the game gave you such a low margin of error -- press the wrong button and you die .
It was hard to tell what you did wrong .
That was especially a bad thing when you 've just jumped into the game and have n't " felt out " the controls yet .
Now when I die , it actually feels like my fault rather than the game 's fault .
So far , the game is looking good .
It may need a bit more graphical polish , but it seems like you 're already working on that .
If I find any other bugs , I 'll let you know .

A few more random pointers to make it even better :
- Since this is a quick arcadey sort of game , it might be best to have the song loop through the whole game without ever stopping at all , starting at the title screen .
- The title screen is a great start -- it 's shiny , exciting and unique .
It 's begging to have some movement , though .
You could make the logo subtly pulsate , the bars above it flicker , the circle in the corner rotate , things like that .
Subtle touches like that would give the game a more polished , complete feel .
- It 'd be nice if the clouds in the sky moved slowly upwards to give a stronger impression of falling .
Good luck and have fun
The game is more satisfying to play now .
Good work !

Yesterday , the c - word — - chivalry — - arose in the comments section of this blog , in the context of the outdated gender code ’s unfairness to men .
Ah , chivalry :
That old code of behavior that men must follow in order to protect the “ honor ” of women they know .
Through chivalry , a woman ’s honor becomes a man ’s responsibility ; her honor brings honor to him , and her shame brings him shame .
Chivalry is n’t just offensive because it forces men to protect women , but also because traditional ideas of what brings “ honor ” and “ shame ” to women are often highly sexist .
And so , chivalry also works to encourage women to internalize misogyny in order to preempt shame from befalling men .
Three recent events that provide an insight into chivalry , and how it functions :
1 . In a recent post on Holla Back DC , a woman describes being harassed by a group of firemen while out celebrating her fiance ’s birthday .
As her fiance stepped away to retrieve cash from an ATM , she stepped to the curb to look for a cab .
She was “ dressed up , ” but “ did not look slutty , ” she says ; the firemen disagreed :
As I was looking down the street at oncoming traffic , a fire engine drove by .
It was not on its way to an emergency , as its lights and siren were n’t on and they were driving at a somewhat slow speed .
However , they honked their loud siren at me and started cheering out of the window .
This was of course just as my fiance was walking out of the ATM .
He was offended that men in uniform would do that , and to tell you the truth , it made me feel like common street trash and that they treated me like a hooker .
Even if my fiance was outside with me and it happened , nothing could really have been done .
He may have yelled after the fire engine , but that would n’t have accomplished anything .
I was really embarrassed and am still embarrassed when I think about it .
I even felt embarrassed on behalf of my fiance , as I thought others may have thought he was with a hooker .
I do n’t know if that ’s rational or not .
It makes me want to cover up more when I go out , but I should n’t have to .
I was dressed quite nicely , yet I still was treated in this manner .
It was disgusting .
For this anonymous Holla Back DC poster , being treated “ like a hooker ” was a stunning insult of her value as a woman , and therefore a great source of shame .
( As far as traditional expectations of women go , being confused with a sex worker is , unfortunately , pretty low on the “ honor ” list ) .
This woman ’s reaction may help to explain why some victims feel shame after being sexually harassed or assaulted .
When women are treated as less - than - human , there are often two conflicting internal reactions : ( a ) anger at the harassers who devalued her based on her gender , and ( b ) being forced to consider the idea , however briefly , that she has no value .
Our writer presents a third reaction : A secondary source of shame , derived from the possibility that someone “ may have thought [ her fiance ] was with a hooker . ”
Since the woman ’s fiance is responsible for her shame as well , he may have a similarly conflicted reaction : ( a ) anger at the harassers who devalued her based on her gender , and ( b ) shame that he is associated with a woman who is considered by other men to be valueless .
Chivalry encourages him to take personal offense to this , inciting one of two reactions : ( a ) engaging in a verbal or physical altercation with the harassers in order to compensate for the woman ’s shame with a display of manhood ; and / or ( b ) chastising the woman for bringing shame upon him , i.e .
“ Do n’t embarrass me in front of other men ” ; “ Do n’t go out looking like that ” ; “ See what you made me do . ”
In this case , there ’s no indication that the fiance openly chastised this woman for dressing inappropriately ( though he may have gone after the firemen had he had the opportunity ) .
The actual display of chivalry is n’t necessary to instill in this woman a sense of responsibility for her fiance ’s honor .
The realization that a man may be shamed when she is harassed for being a woman makes her want to dress more conservatively in order to preempt any further shame on him in the future .
2 . This weekend , I had a conversation with a guy visiting the District from Turkey .
We got to talking about the evolving tradition of women wearing headscarves in his country .
About half the women he knows wear headscarves , and half do n’t ; his mom wears one , but his wife does n’t .
In Turkey , he said , a woman who does n’t cover her head brings society ’s shaming not only upon herself , but also upon her husband .
Insisting that a woman wear a headscarf is considered a man ’s responsibility , and a woman with her head uncovered can reflect a personal failure on the man assigned to enforce the rule .
“ If you follow all the rules of the religion , you get an A + in being a Muslim , ” he explained .
If your wife does n’t cover your head , you can still be a good Muslim , but your grade gets knocked down a few points .
Not all women wear the headscarf because their husbands or fathers or brothers tell them ( or force them ) to .
Some choose to wear it for personal , cultural , and religious reasons .
And some choose to wear it in order to preempt any possibility of shame being brought upon the men in their lives .
They want their husbands to get an A +.
3. Today , WTOP reported that Vladimir Djordjevic has died after spending three years in the hospital attempting to recover from the extreme burns covering his body .
Djordjevic , a manager at District strip club Good Guys , was “ doused with gasoline and set on fire ” on Nov. 4 , 2007 , after he ejected a patron for breaking a house rule — - he took a cell - phone photo of a dancer ’s butt .
The patron , trucker Vasile Graure , returned to the club with a gallon of gasoline and proceeded to light Djordjevic — - and then the club — - on fire .
( You can read a complete account of the trial here ; Graure was sentenced to 30 years in prison , which may be increased in light of Djordjevic ’s death ) .
So : Graure thought he had complete authority over the naked woman in front of him ; Djordjevic informed him that he did not ; Graure set Djordjevic on fire .
Djordjevic ’s death is an extreme example of how chivalry facilitates the transfer of misogyny from women to men .
As Amanda Marcotte noted earlier this year , “ when it comes to the patriarchy , sexist men will enforce the rules not just on women , but on other men who seem insufficiently committed to the art of oppressing women , ” she writes .
When Graure set Djordjevic on fire , he applied his misogynistic rage to the man who would not sit back and allow him to control women .
You see the same kind of transfer of misogyny with guys who , thanks to chivalry , will “ Never Hit A Woman ” ; instead , they ’ll hit the closest guy .
This kind of misogyny transfer does n’t just result in the tragic deaths of guys like Djordjevic ( who , as club security , had the unnerving professional task of protecting dancers from misogynistic patrons ) .
It also helps to obscure the root of the violence , which is an extreme hatred of women .
By placing a male intermediary between a misogynist and the intended recipient of his misogyny ( a woman ) , the misogynist can walk away from a chivalry - induced fist - fight patting himself on the back for how much he “ respects women . ”
Meanwhile , some blame for said fist - fight can be conveniently transferred onto the woman for failing to take the punch herself .
In order to avoid both the fist - fight and the self - blame , the woman has one line of defense — - do n’t do whatever you think caused the misogynist to get so angry .
Do n’t wear a short skirt .
Do n’t protest when he takes your photo in a strip club .
Do n’t get angry when he sexually harasses you .
“ The lesson here is not that women should be more eager to be treated like subhumans , ” Marcotte writes .
“ The lesson is that sexual harassment is a dominance display , and the harassers will often resort to violence to maintain the dominance they desire .
‘ Never hit a woman ’ does n’t really do much to address the underlying cause of violence against women , which is male dominance and misogyny . ”
Chivalry encourages a form of preemptive internalized misogyny that results in the policing of women , how they dress , where they go , how much hair they show , and whether they stand up for themselves when harassed or assaulted .
In the future , the woman harassed by the firemen may dress more conservatively , or avoid standing on the street corner alone , in order to prevent her husband from ever being associated with someone who is confused for “ a hooker ” .
A woman may choose to wear a headscarf in order to preempt any shame being brought to her husband .
And a woman who is victimized by a man may not speak out , in order to avoid the chivalrous man - next - door from starting a fist - fight — - or criticizing her for somehow encouraging the harassment .
Chivalry works to unfairly displace misogyny onto men .
But focusing solely on that particular failure of chivalry ignores the obvious truth — - that misogyny is unfair for everyone .
Women , too !

The Federal Trade Commission wants to make sure the public knows an important truth : if you photocopy your butt on a modern copier , it 's probably still there , safe on the copier 's hard drive .
It exists there along with medical forms , financial documents , and that list of gang members your police department was just about to arrest .
CBS
News did a story last month on secrets kept by digital copiers .
Most digital copiers produced in the last five years archive copied documents on internal hard drives , and those hard drives are easy enough to obtain once the copiers are resold or their lease expires .
By examining the hard drives of several used copiers , CBS found " a list of targets in a major drug raid " from the Buffalo Police Narcotics Unit .
It also scored Social Security numbers , medical documents , and " $ 40,000 in copied checks . "
In the wake of that news story , Representative Ed Markey ( D - MA ) shot off a letter ( PDF ) to the FTC .
" I am concerned that these hard drives represent a treasure trove for thieves , leaving unwitting consumers vulnerable to identity theft as their Social Security numbers , birth certificates , medical records , bank records , and other personal information are exposed to individuals who could easily extract the data from the digital copiers ' hard drive and use it for criminal purposes , " he wrote .
Markey wanted to know what the agency was doing and planned to do about the problem .
The Chairman of the FTC , Jon Leibowitz , has now responded ( PDF ) to say that his agency is taking the matter quite seriously .
" The FTC is now reaching out to copier manufacturers , resellers , and retail copy and office supply stores to ensure that they are aware of the privacy risks associated with digital copiers and to determine whether they are warning their customers about these risks , whether they are providing education and guidance on the subject , and whether manufacturers and resellers are providing options for secure copying .
We will work with these entities to help ensure that they provide appropriate educational materials on the subject to their clients . "
The FTC claims it avoids the problem internally by signing lease agreements that give the agency full ownership of the hard drives inside the copiers .
When the lease is up , the FTC will " erase and subsequently destroy these hard drives " before returning the copiers .
" I am very pleased to learn that the FTC is investigating this important matter , which most consumers are unaware of when they place their tax returns , financial records and other personal information on the copier and hit the ' Start ' button , " said Markey today .
Plenty of our readers work in IT — how many of your companies have policies for dealing with digital copier hard drives ?

A second rig unrelated to the Deepwater Horizon spill has been leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico since late April , according to reports that appear to show a clearly visible slick at the second location .
MORE : Witness statement says bosses knew Gulf oil rig disaster was ‘ gonna happen ’ : report
The slick from the Ocean Saratoga rig appears to be several miles long off the coast of Louisiana , according to satellite images visible from space and posted on the website of Skytruth.org , a group that monitors environmental issues .
The company that operates the rig has been working to plug the leak , which Skytruth reported on May 15 , according to local news reports .
Federal officials asked about the second leak in a morning briefing could not verify its existence , or provide details .
But more information could be forthcoming shortly .
“ We ’re going to get detailed information and make a statement later this afternoon , ” said Admiral Thad Allen , the Coast Guard official who is the federal government ’s point person on the Gulf oil spill .
The second leak appears to be much smaller than the Deepwater spill .
But it may have been going on for much longer , according to reports .

GRAND ISLE , La. ( MarketWatch ) --
The BP oil spill has fouled the waters and devastated the fishing community on this island at the very tip of Louisiana , but it 's hard to find anyone here who favors a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
Oil companies and fishing vessels have peacefully co-existed in the Gulf for decades .
And even though the spill threatens the livelihoods of most Grand Isle residents , it seems few -- if any -- favor pulling the plug on what is the state 's biggest source of revenue .
" It will trickle down ; the economy will get even worse , " said Perry Clement , a local who serves as a deck hand on several fishing boats , and is struggling for income .
" It 's the delicate balance we have , with the oil and the fishing . "
Dean Blanchard has lost a lot more , and yet he feels the same way .
His Dean Blanchard Seafood Co. is the region 's biggest shrimper .
This year was supposed to be a bonanza , hauling in $ 100 million in product , he says .
Now , Blanchard may have to start fishing off Costa Rica in order to maintain his business .
But he nixes the idea of a moratorium on drilling .
" We 've been living together a long , long time , " Blanchard said of the oil drillers .
" They closed the wrong thing down .
They should have closed the government down . "
Indeed , it 's hard to find anyone in the state of Louisiana that favors President Barack Obama 's plans to put a cap on deepwater drilling in an attempt to deal with safety issues arising from the BP spill .
Not even the industry most damaged by it , fishing , is in favor of the ban .
While the state 's fishermen have provided the nation with a third of its seafood and kept New Orleans ' renowned restaurants stocked with plenty of product , Louisiana and its offshore fields lead domestic oil production and the industry is the state 's biggest job generator .
It 's also put many a patron at the table in those restaurants , locals say .
Partner , not polluter
Fishermen here do n't look at the oil industry as a potential polluter .
They look at it as a partner .
The rigs in the Gulf are not eyesores to them ; instead the subsea structures on which they rest act as artificial reefs that are potentially rich with products they can sell .

Hundreds of offshore platforms and rigs in the waters off Louisiana provide the state with 30 % of its gross domestic product , says Michael Hecht , president of the trade group Greater New Orleans Inc .
Each deep - water rig employs roughly 300 people averaging nearly $ 100,000 a year in income .
With roughly four other workers directly supporting each rig worker , that translates to 22,000 jobs that could be lost with the ban .
The loss of the large income of these workers is expected to create a huge ripple effect throughout Louisiana .
Hecht and other civic leaders , including Louisiana Democratic U.S. Sen .
Mary Landrieu , have been pleading with the Obama administration to rethink the moratorium .
They say the BP spill is an anomaly , as drillers have been operating in deep water for more than two decades without major problems .
This week , U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman , who presides in New Orleans , ordered that the drilling ban be lifted .
But the Obama administration has vowed to appeal , and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has said he may issue another , modified drilling ban that addresses Feldman 's concerns .
The plan to keep a lid on deepwater drilling could be fatal for numerous companies and an economy that 's just getting revitalized five years after Hurricane Katrina swept through the region and flooded three - fourths of New Orleans .
Katrina added jobs , spill takes away
Hecht and others say that Katrina 's economic impact ended up being positive ; the region added jobs in construction and reformulated its way of doing business .
The rebuilding effort helped the area ride out the 2009 recession better than any other area , as New Orleans ' unemployment remained at a low 3 % .
The spill , and the subsequent impact on fishing and the oil business , will kill jobs , Hecht says .
While it could easily go longer , even if the ban lasts exactly six months , it will take another 12 to 18 months for drilling to get back into full swing .
" You 're talking about impoverishing Louisiana , " he said .
" It 's an extremely inelegant solution to a complicated problem . "

One thing that federal officials may not have picked up on is the region 's changed attitude , or at least the perception of it .
After Katrina , New Orleans was viewed as a city seeking a handout .
Many now say they do n't necessarily want a generous settlement from BP ; they just want to get back to work .
Peter Vujnovich , an oyster fisherman , has been out of work for a month .
But he says : " I hope BP steps up to the plate .
Instead of making us whole , keep us whole . "
Leslie Bertucci , owner of R&D Enterprises , which supplies drilling equipment to deepwater rigs , echoes that sentiment .
" I personally had equipment on the [ Deepwater ]
Horizon rig that we lost , although that is the least of my concerns , " she said .
" I do n't really want to make a claim .
We just really want to go back to work . "
And Steve Perry , chief executive of the New Orleans Convention and Visitors ' Bureau , says the region is even willing to work with BP to help mitigate the issue .
" We have a better chance if we have a strategy that works with them , " he said .
Oilmen do n't see relief
As expected , Louisiana oilmen vehemently oppose the drilling ban , but they do n't expect to see any relief soon .
Don Briggs , president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association , says the Obama administration seems likely to use the ban as a bargaining chip to push through a climate change bill .
That bill is expected to include a " cap- and - trade " provision that could force companies to trade pollution credits based on their emissions levels .
According to Briggs , the drilling ban is unnecessary because the spill resulted from poor planning and management on BP 's part .
There are more than 590 producing wells in the Gulf 's deep water , he adds .
Deep water is defined as anything 500 feet or more below the surface .
" He [ Obama ] does n't have to do what he 's doing , " he said .
" What the hell does he know ?
He 's a freaking Chicago guy . "
Two hours west of New Orleans , the city of Lafayette is somewhat of an oil hub .
Oilfield service companies along with drillers and marketers are worried that city will be crippled by the drilling ban .
Badger Oil Corp. , a privately held oil producer in Lafayette , is too small a company to drill in deep water , but it 's feeling the effects of the government 's skittishness .
The Minerals Management Service , under heavy scrutiny for its cozy relationship with the industry , is rethinking some of its routine permits , Badger officials say .
MMS issued , then withdrew three Badger permits several weeks ago .
The agency is expected to come back and grant them , but it 's clear MMS is operating in a different environment .
" Nobody wants to be the guy that grants the permit where there was a problem , " said David Etienne , Badger 's vice president in charge of exploration .
Two industries damaged
For both the oil and fishing industries , however , the BP experience has been devastating .
Perhaps no one is feeling the ban more than Kirk Rousse .
Born and bred on the Bayou , Rousse knows that fishing and oil are engrained in the culture .
He grew up fishing and worked on a number of boats when he was younger .
The father of six children , Rousse started his own trucking business with his wife , Sheila , to transport oilfield equipment to vessels that would take the gear to offshore platforms , most of them deepwater rigs .
Now it 's questionable whether Rousse will be able to work in either industry .
Rousse has lost 60 % of his business due to the drilling ban and sees the rest of it hemorrhaging .
He expects he 'll have to look far and wide to find income .
" I 'm going to have to leave my family , " he said .
" Six months from now , I probably wo n't be living here . "
To him , and to numerous others in the region , oil and fishing are joined at the hip in Louisiana .
" A lot of people who retire from the oilfield , they start fishing , " Rousse said .

The Gulf Coast oil spill 's Dr. Doom
FORTUNE --
As an oil and gas industry insider , Matt Simmons speaks with a bold voice and makes even bolder predictions .
His 2005 book , Twilight in the Desert : The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy , which argued that Saudi Arabia 's oil supplies are way more limited than most people think , raised his profile as an authority on the industry .
For more than 35 years , Simmons has run a Texas - based boutique investment bank , Simmons & Co. , which specializes in the energy industry .
At times , with his somewhat doom - and - loom - like take on things , there 's a hint of conspiracy theorist in his tone .
But it 's hard to ignore that Simmons is deeply connected and has been pretty much right on in the past :
When oil was $ 58 a barrel the year Twilight was released , Simmons predicted prices would be at or above $ 100 within a few years .
By 2008 , when Fortune profiled Simmons , the price of crude had hit $ 147 a barrel .
As a big believer that wind power is the way of the future , Simmons says the era of easy oil is over and that world oil production will eventually fail to meet expected future demands .
These days , Simmons has been weighing in on BP ( BP ) and the worst oil spill in U.S. history , following the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico .
As BP struggles to permanently stop the gush of oil , Simmons has been warning that the scale of the spill is much bigger and that there 's a larger leak several miles away .
Simmons also thinks that perhaps the only way to seal the gush of oil is by doing what the Soviet Union did decades ago -- setting off a bomb deep underground so that the fiery blast will melt the surrounding rock and shut off the spill .
Fortune caught up with Simmons this week to hear his thoughts on the Gulf Coast oil spill , the future of BP and what 's ahead for offshore drilling .
Experts forecast an active hurricane season this year .
We know it could disrupt efforts to stop the spill , but how else do you think storms could impact the Gulf Coast ?
We 've got to stop the gusher first .
Then we have to deal with the other issues .
There 's a lake at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico that 's over 100 miles wide and at least 400 to 500 feet deep of black oil .
It 's just staying there .
And only the lightest of that is what we 're seeing hitting the shores so far .
If a hurricane comes and blows this to shore , it could paint the Gulf Coast black .
We should have been pumping this oil out onto other tankers weeks ago .
How do you think the U.S. government should handle this disaster ?
I think the government should ask BP to leave the United States and turn its operation over to the military .
Put the U.S. Navy in charge .
Have all the contractors report to the Navy -- the cleanup efforts , the whole nine yards .
Because as long as it's in BP 's hands , they 're going to spin the information as long as they can .
What do you think is in store for the future of BP ?
They have about a month before they declare Chapter 11 .
They 're going to run out of cash from lawsuits , cleanup and other expenses .
One really smart thing that Obama did was about three weeks ago he forced BP CEO Tony Hayward to put in writing that BP would pay for every dollar of the cleanup .
But there is n't enough money in the world to clean up the Gulf of Mexico .
Once BP realizes the extent of this my guess is that they 'll panic and go into Chapter 11 .
There 's currently a ban on new deepwater oil projects for six months to prevent other disasters .
What lies ahead for offshore drilling ?
First of all , to the industry 's credit , we went 41 years in the United States without an oil spill .
In a minor sense , this is what happened to the Challenger .
We had so many successful shuttle takeoffs that the space station got kind of casual about this .
But this is worse .
BP was so certain that there was n't any risk that three years ago they thought the insurance industry was ripping them off , so they 're self - insured on this .
How stupid !
It was the best thing that ever happened to the insurance industry .
How do you think the Gulf Coast oil spill will change the energy business , if at all ?
Profoundly .
We 're going to have to go back and re-examine all of our regulatory rules and realize the easy stuff is imminent and the rest of the stuff we do is really risky .
We have to start questioning whether it's worth the risk , and do we need to get really serious about developing some alternative energy sources ?
Now I 'm working on a big project in mid-coast Maine called the Ocean Energy Institute , and we 're hoping that within the next year we can actually create 50 megawatt offshore wind turbines -- one every five miles a part -- and turn that offshore electricity into desalinated sea water and liquid ammonia .
It could replace motor gasoline and diesel fuel .
What are the lessons learned from this environmental disaster ?
That oil peaked .
The easy stuff is over .
We have to continue drilling in shallow water , but we probably need to take a deep breath and step back .
Until we develop a new generation of equipment that can respond to these accidents , just do n't go into the ultra - deep water and deep formations because it 's just too risky .

Some friends got me motivated to take the boat out on an overnight fishing trip offshore 4 - 20 on into 4 - 21 .
We first tested the boat the day before and one motor threw temp light and the other would not start !
So we began !
The port motor just needed to have the sand flushed out the water pump and VIOLA , no more temp light ... the starboard motor , on the other hand , read 12.4 v @ the battery and 12.4v @ the starting magnet and 7v @ the starter when cranked ..
The port motor had a new magnet on it so we assumed it must be the magnet ( $ 170 ) and we bought a new temp sensor for the fun of it ( $ 40 ) .
After installing the new magnet on starboard motor we had the same results .
So we then assumed the starter must be bad .
Pulled the starter and tested it , and of course it was good .
So we charged the battery and Bam !
Eureka !
We brought the boat into the lake around 9 pm and ran it for a test run ...
The gas leaked out of the water separator on the port motor and melted the float sensor for the bilge pump causing the wires to touch and heat the float and melted it .
The bilge almost burned up as well .
We replaced the water separator ( $ 10 ) and installed a new float switch as well ( $ 60 ) .
Went to bed at 1 am Tuesday morning and rose again @ 7 am to head out .
We loaded up and headed South from Mandeville .
We caught a flat on the trailer in Belle Chase and replaced it with a smaller tire to make do to get us to Venice !
We launched and went to head out and starboard motor was n't getting fuel ...
Soooo , we found the problem , which was a broken , corroded , elbow connecting the fuel line to the gas tank ...
We went to a local parts place and made do with $ 80 of misc fittings and hose and replaced that fuel separator ( $ 10 ) for the fun of it .
We fixed it and left the dock @ 3 pm headed down river to BP 109 offshore rig .
We stayed there until we landed enough blackfin tuna and make it to our sleeping destination before dark ![ ame = " http://s163.photobucket.com/albums/t285/aandryiii/?action=view¤t=P4201562.flv " ][/ ame ]
We left there in a hurry to make it to Deep Water Horizon before dark .
The water was like glass .
My radar got stolen off my bought before this trip so we planned on getting to a floater before dark and staying / fishing till sun up the next day .
We got to Deep Water Horizon at sunset and began catching more tuna .
These jelly fish were floating everywhere .
It was pretty cool to see them literally SAIL !
When we drove at night the jellyfish would glow as they passed under the boat by the thousands .
The tuna bites were starting to slow down so we drove right up to the rig to try to catch bait .
No bait , but we found more tuna under the floating rig .
Around 10 pm the entire center of the rig started rushing water downwards over all the pipes ...
I 've never seen such an event take place .
I looked at my friend who previously worked offshore , and he said that 's BOP something another and the rig took a ' kick ! '
I thought the rig was sinking and that was their way of bilging ...
But nope !
Methane gas began BLOWING out of the West side of it and the noise of the thrust was louder than anything I 've ever herd ( except for a sonic boom I herd once , and what I 'm about to tell you next )
My eyes began to burn and that friend I was telling you about earlier began to SCREAM , " GO , GO , GO , GO , GOOOOO ! " I positioned my compass North and put the gears in WOT !
At approximately 100 yds from the rig it Exploded !
Puts a new meaning to explosion .
We hit the deck and continued North @ WOT , Blind because the moon was at quarter crescent and I had no radar .
The switch board went black for unknown reasons ; therefore I had no running lights either .
The flood lights in the rear did work .
The rig continued EXPLODING .
A very large crew boat was tied to the rig as it blew and the ppl began rafting to that boat as it floated away slowly .
I got on the radio to try to help and they told me to stay away for safety .
The rig blew a few more explosions after that and began to burn down .
Some of the rig began dripping into the water and the platform tilted in and turned RED HOT .
As bad as we wanted to save ppl , it was n't the case here .
I tried going in to be a hero and my posse was n't having it !
Maybe they were right ... The guy who predicted the explosion was terrified of what would happen next and would not allow for us to get any closer than a mile .
He told me things about air rising from the pipes below , and how the pipes could be below us since they run at angles under water , and how the explosions would continue .
I think he knew what he was talking about and made us all worry ...[ ame= " http://s163.photobucket.com/albums/t285/aandryiii/?action=view¤t=P4201571.flv " ][/ ame ]
We stayed a mile off the fire and searched / listened for missing ppl for 4 hours .
We saw nothing .
20 or so commercial liners eventually brought Medics and oxygen for survivors .
Helicopter came for search and transport .
All the other facts you probably already know about ; via News .
The 11 missing people in ' mind ' I hope slipped away in a safety boat , but in reality I doubt they are alive .
This is a sad thing to say , but if you would have seen the explosions you would n't believe anyone of the 126 would have survived it !
I pray for all of them and their families !
We left at morning to make our way in , we were 60 miles offshore and gas was running low .
We stopped at Elf on the way in and filled the ice chest .
The tuna were busting on top water and we could n't resist .
We left the half way point in hopes to make it home .
The starboard motor ran out of gas at the very mouth of the river , but fortunately we had a spare gas tank on board !
We made it to Venice at about 3 pm on Wednesday and began cleaning the fish .
I made it to my home at 8 pm
Wed night ( 37 hours with no sleep ) .
And now it seems like it was a dream !

Bill Clinton : Obama Should Take A Look At A " Progressive , Value - Added Tax "
Bill Clinton : " I think they ought to look at a progressive value - added tax , just because -- and I think it 's important the American people understand this -- most of our competitors have tax systems like this . "
About 85 percent of the history of life on Earth has been solely microbial , meaning that single - celled organisms ruled the planet for billions of years before more complex life evolved .
One way that geologists try to decipher how these cells functioned as far back as 3 billion years is by studying modern microbial mats , or gooey layers of nutrient - exchanging bacteria that grow mostly on moist surfaces .
These layers collect dirt and minerals that crystallize over time .
Eventually , the bacteria turn to stone just beneath the crystallized material , thereby recording their history within the crystalline skeletons .
Known as stromatolites , the layered rock formations are considered to be the oldest fossils on Earth .
While there are many kinds of stromatolites , many geologists believe that the odd triangular patterns of conical stromatolites are the purest record of bacterial growth because they form as a result of only two processes : the growth of bacteria and the growth of mineral crystals .
Deciphering the few clues about ancient bacterial life that are seen in these poorly preserved rocks has been difficult , but researchers from MIT ’s Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences ( EAPS ) and the Russian Academy of Sciences may have found a way to glean new information from the fossils .
Specifically , they have linked the even spacing between the thousands of tiny cones that dot the surfaces of stromatolite - forming microbial mats — a pattern that also appears in cross-sectional slices of stromatolites that are 2.8 billion years old — to photosynthesis .
The connection could help scientists put a better range on when photosynthesis started .
In a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , the researchers suggest that the characteristic centimeter - scale spacing between neighboring cones that appears on modern microbial mats and the conical stromatolites they form occurs as a result of the daily competition for nutrients between neighboring mats .
According to lead author and EAPS graduate student Alexander Petroff , the research suggests a physical understanding of how the morphology , or shape , of a bacterial community records its ability to use light as an energy source .
The research , which was funded by NASA , the National Science Foundation and the Solomon Buchsbaum Fund , also provides a new technique for interpreting the patterns of these ancient fossils , according to Petroff .
By analyzing the length of the triangular patterns seen in an ancient stromatolite , for example , geologists can now infer more details about the environment in which the microbial mat lived , such as whether it lived in still or turbulent water .
Until now , no one had explored the consistent one - centimeter spacing that appears between the tiny cones featured on microbial mats and conical stromatolites that grow in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park , and at other locations around the world .
Petroff and his colleagues , including EAPS professors Daniel Rothman and Tanja Bosak , proposed that the pattern was not coincidental and could pertain to a biophysical process , such as how the bacteria compete for nutrients .
By studying the physics of photosynthesis , the researchers formed a better understanding of how a mat consumes nutrients from its surroundings over the course of a day , and then metabolizes , or breaks down , those nutrients for energy .
During the daytime , a mat takes in nutrients like inorganic carbon from its immediate surroundings and uses energy from sunlight to build sugars and new bacteria .
As these nutrients become locally depleted , the mat starts to consume nutrients from larger distances .
At nighttime when it is dark and photosynthesis is not possible , nutrients return to the water immediately surrounding the mat .
After studying this process in detail , the researchers reasoned that in order to avoid direct competition for nutrients , the spacing between mats must be influenced by diffusion , or how molecules spread out over time .
In this case , diffusion is itself influenced by the amount of time a mat is metabolically active , which varies over the course of a day due to changes in sunlight .
Therefore , the spacing between cones records the maximum distance that mats can compete with one another to metabolize nutrients that are spread by diffusion and later replenished at night .
After testing this theory on cultures in the lab , the researchers confirmed their hypothesis through fieldwork in Yellowstone , where the centimeter spacing between mats corresponds to their metabolic period of about 20 hours .
That the spacing pattern corresponds to the mats ’ metabolic period — and is also seen in ancient rocks — shows that the same basic physical processes of diffusion and competition seen today were happening billions of years ago , long before complex life appeared .
The spacing between individual mats also reveals other factors about a mat ’s environment , the researchers say .
For example , if the spacing is larger than one centimeter , this could be evidence that the bacteria lived in a turbulent environment .
This is because when bacteria compete for nutrients in stirred , rather than still , water , this motion means they can consume nutrients from greater distances , meaning competition is n’t as fierce , and the mats can be more spread apart from one another .
Paul Hoffman , a recently retired Harvard geologist , believes that the theoretical explanation will be of use to geologists because it can be easily observed and tested in the field .
But he said it will be difficult to differentiate the patterns seen in the stromatolites studied by Petroff ’s team — that is , stromatolites that are produced by biological processes — from those that grow solely from physical processes related to sedimentation .
Because the growth of both kinds may be governed by diffusion of nutrients or ions , it is important that future research demonstrates that non-living stromatolites do not exhibit the same spacing relationship as living stromatolites , he said .
Petroff agreed with Hoffman , noting that his research about the spacing between the cones of stromatolites is only part of what is required to interpret Earth ’s earliest fossils properly , and that much work remains in order to address fundamental questions that have eluded a complete understanding .
His group is currently working to address one of those questions — why biological stromatolites form cones instead of other shapes .

Cast your mind back to January 2009 , when Barack Obama became the president of the United States amid much rejoicing .
The hosannas — covering the inauguration was “ the honor of our lifetimes , ” said MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews — by then seemed unsurprising .
Over the course of a long campaign , hyperbolic rhetoric had become commonplace , so much so that online wags had started calling Obama “ the One ” — a reference to the spate of recent science - fiction movies , especially The Matrix , that used that term to designate a messiah .
It all seems so long ago now , as one contemplates President Obama ’s plummeting approval ratings and a suddenly resurgent Republican Party .
Yet it ’s worth looking closely and seriously at the election - year enthusiasm of media elites and other Obamaphiles , much of which was indeed , as the wags recognized , quasi-religious .
The surprising fact is that the American Left , for all its claims to being “ reality - based ” and secular , is often animated by the passions , motivations , and imagery that one normally associates with religion .
The better we understand this religious impulse , the better we will understand liberal America ’s likely trajectory in the years to come .
The first signs of the spiritual zeal that would eventually play a significant part in Obama ’s election came not from Washington or Chicago but from Hollywood .
Our moviemakers are adept at measuring the zeitgeist of the nation — of its liberal half , anyway — and are a powerful force in shaping it .
And for more than a decade , they ’ve been churning out what critics call “ black - angel ” movies .
These films feature a white protagonist guided to enlightenment by a black character , usually of divine or supernatural origin or , at the very least , in touch with spiritual experiences that the main character lacks .
With the black angel ’s help , the white hero finds salvation .
The genre includes , to name just a few , The Legend of Bagger Vance ( 2000 ) , in which Will Smith — playing a caddie who is really , the film hints , God—restores Matt Damon ’s golf game and love life ; Bruce Almighty ( 2003 ) , in which Morgan Freeman , as God , bestows his powers on a manic Jim Carrey ; and the awful What Dreams May Come ( 1998 ) , in which Cuba Gooding , Jr. is a wise soul guiding Robin Williams through the afterlife .
These movies have been numerous enough , David Sterritt points out in the Christian Science Monitor , to confuse TV ’s buffoonish Homer Simpson : in one episode , “ Homer mistook a black man in a white suit for an angelic visitor , all because ( according to his embarrassed wife ) he ’d been seeing too many movies lately . ”
Far and away the best of the black - angel films is Frank Darabont ’s The Green Mile ( 1999 ) , based on a novel by Stephen King , whose knack for setting his finger on the cultural pulse has made him a multimillionaire .
The basso profundo Michael Clarke Duncan plays John Coffey ( note the initials ) , a gigantic black man wrongfully convicted of the rape and murder of two little girls in Depression - era Louisiana and sentenced to death ; Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb , a prison guard who discovers that Coffey is not only innocent but also a Christlike miracle worker .
Coffey ’s laying - on of hands restores a dead mouse to life , cures Edgecomb of a bladder infection , and heals the warden ’s wife ’s brain cancer .
Shortly before he is executed — the jeering of the girls ’ anguished parents and the weeping of the prison guards who know the truth recall the account of the Crucifixion in Luke — Coffey has this exchange with a tortured Edgecomb :
Edgecomb .
Tell me what you want me to do .
You want me to take you out of here ?
Just let you run away ?
See how far you could get ?
Coffey .
Why would you do such a foolish thing ?
Edgecomb .
On the day of my judgment , when I stand before God , and He asks me why did I — did I kill one of His true miracles — what am I going to say ?
That it was my job ? . . .
Coffey .
You tell God the Father it was a kindness you done .
. . .
I want it to be over and done with .
I do . . . .
I ’m tired of people being ugly to each other .
I ’m tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world every day .
The writer or director of a black - angel film recognizes the unspeakable injustices once perpetrated by his country on black people ; he wants to be forgiven the sins of his fathers .
If he is simply a comedian , he makes Bruce Almighty , casting a black man as God in a sort of lighthearted flattery .
If his waters run deeper , he understands that no plum role can atone for the crimes that weigh on him .
Instinctively , he realizes what thinkers from Aristotle to Marcel Mauss have known : that whenever a gift is given , the prestige of the giver increases and that of the recipient declines .
So he tells a story in which a black man gives the greatest gift of all , suffering — like Jesus in Christian theology — for others ’ sins , in fact demanding to suffer , and by demanding , forgiving .
White America is pardoned its wrongs , while black America , by pardoning , is elevated to godhood .
Are these movies ultimately condescending to blacks ?
After all , the white protagonist , the person who will be saved or damned according to his decisions , is invariably more interesting than the serene black angel hovering nearby .
Indeed , the condescension , if such it is , is a cinematic version of affirmative action — a denial to blacks of Everyman ’s struggle for salvation ; a magnanimous extension to them of paradise .
And this brings us to Barack Obama ’s liberal support during the campaign , which was decidedly different from the regular media bias that conservatives often complain about .
“ I have n’t seen a politician get this kind of walk - on - water coverage since Colin Powell a dozen years ago flirted with making a run for the White House , ” said Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz on Meet the Press in February 2007 , a day after Obama announced his candidacy .
“ I mean , it is amazing . . . a guy with all of two years ’ experience in the United States Senate getting coverage that ranges from positive to glowing to even gushing . ”
“ Walk - on - water coverage ” was exactly right , and though the media seldom framed their worship quite that explicitly , the exceptions were telling .
Here ’s San Francisco Chronicle columnist Mark Morford on June 6 , 2008 :
Many spiritually advanced people I know . . . identify Obama as a Lightworker , that rare kind of attuned being who has the ability to lead us not merely to new foreign policies or health care plans or whatnot , but who can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet , of relating and connecting and engaging with this bizarre earthly experiment .
These kinds of people actually help us evolve .
They are philosophers and peacemakers of a very high order , and they speak not just to reason or emotion , but to the soul .
San Francisco , you shrug .
Consider , then , what Samantha Fennell , formerly an associate publisher of Elle , wrote on the magazine ’s website a month later :
Barack Obama must be elected President of the United States . . . .
I have thrown myself into a new world — one in which fluffy chatter and frivolous praise are replaced by a get - to - the - point directness and disciple - like devotion .
It ’s intense and intoxicating .
. . .
When I attended my second “ Obama Live ” fund - raiser last week at New York City ’s Grand Hyatt , . . .
I was on my feet as Senator Obama entered the room .
Fate had blessed me in this moment .
. . .
In a moment of divine intervention , he saw me , . . . grabbed my hand , and gave that brilliant smile of his .
I literally said out loud to the woman next to me who witnessed my good fate , “ I ’ll never wash this hand again . ”
Fashion writers , you say .
But here is Evan Thomas , a Newsweek editor , on the show Hardball with Chris Matthews last June :
Thomas .
Reagan was all about America .
He talked about it .
Obama is , “ We are above that now , we are not just parochial , we ’re not just chauvinistic , we ’re not just provincial , we stand for something . ”
I mean , in a way , Obama is standing above the country , above the world .
He ’s sort of God.
Matthews .
Yeah .
Thomas .
He ’s going to bring all different sides together .
True , Thomas was n’t so much evincing Morford ’s and Fennell ’s giddy devotion as describing , perhaps too admiringly , one of the ways Obama elicited it .
The deifications and hagiologies were particularly overt in the remarks of prominent black figures .
Filmmaker Spike Lee , predicting an Obama victory , implicitly compared the candidate with Christ : “ You ’ll have to measure time by ‘ Before Obama ’ and ‘ After Obama . ’ . . .
Everything ’s going to be affected by this seismic change in the universe . ”
Jesse Jackson , Jr. called Obama ’s securing the Democratic nomination “ so extraordinary that another chapter could be added to the Bible to chronicle its significance . ”
Louis Farrakhan went one better , according to the website WorldNetDaily : “ Barack has captured the youth .
. . .
That ’s a sign .
When the Messiah speaks , the youth will hear , and the Messiah is absolutely speaking . ”
The website ObamaMessiah.blogspot.com has diligently chronicled many more instances of such talk , which seems positively cringe - making in 2010 .
It seems unfair to blame Obama himself for most of it , though he surely set the tone with a brand of mystical campaign rhetoric unfamiliar to presidential politics — in this country , anyway .
In February 2008 , a concerned Joe Klein of Time noted : “ There was something just a wee bit creepy about the mass messianism —
‘ We are the ones we ’ve been waiting for ’— of the Super Tuesday speech and the recent turn of the Obama campaign . ”
( The full quotation : “ We are the ones we ’ve been waiting for .
We are the change that we seek . ” )
To this day , BarackObama.com displays at the top of its homepage the following words ( attributed to Obama , though nobody seems to have been able to pinpoint the speech ) : “ I ’M ASKING YOU TO BELIEVE .
Not just in my ability to bring about real change in Washington . . .
I ’m asking you to believe in yours . ”
Whether or not the Obama campaign realized it , that demand for faith was an updated echo of innumerable passages in the Gospels : “ Everything is possible for him who believes ” ; “ Whoever lives and believes in me will never die ” ; and so on .
If the first component of the Obama creed was faith , though , the second was surely hope — the audacious hope whose name famously adorns one of the president ’s two autobiographies .
We need only add charity to have what Catholics call the three Theological Virtues , which Paul mentions in First Corinthians .
Perhaps we should not have been surprised , then , when a day before his inauguration , Obama breathtakingly upended the meaning of Martin Luther King Day , transforming a holiday devoted to the memory of a civil rights leader — and perhaps also to such ideas as equality , tolerance , and the evils of racism — into a day of public service .
“ It ’s not a day just to pause and reflect — it ’s a day to act , ” Obama announced .
“ Today , ordinary citizens will gather together all across the country to participate in the more than 11,000 service projects they ’ve created using USAservice.org .
And I ask the American people to turn today ’s efforts into an ongoing commitment to enriching the lives of others in their communities , their cities , and their country . ”
An astute moviegoer could have predicted the candidate ’s manner : confident but calm , eloquent but modest .
Obama was n’t a loud race - baiter like Al Sharpton ; he was a deep - voiced , serious , almost sad , observer , a black angel come to forgive the iniquity of guilt - racked liberal America .
How can we explain this sudden , brief eruption of messianic fervor into our politics ?
Perhaps by looking at the religious climate of the country and the world , which have been witnessing a religious revival over the past 30 years .
Whether you call this phenomenon the “ revenge of God , ” as the French scholar Gilles Kepel does , or “ resacralization , ” as the sociologists do , or echo the title of the recent book by Economist editors John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge , God Is Back , the evidence is hard to ignore .
In the United States , as everyone knows , the Religious Right has made huge advances since the 1970s .
During the same period , what Kepel calls “ re - Islamization ” movements have appeared in the Middle East and beyond , aiming “ to propagate Islam everywhere until humanity was converted into ‘ ummanity . ’ ” All over the world , Christianity is growing — in particular , Pentecostalism , a denomination just a century old that , along with “ related charismatic movements , ” now claims a stunning 500 million adherents , the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life reports .
To make a long story short , Peter Berger and Anton Zijderfeld ’s
In Praise of Doubt sees just one geographical exception to a “ furiously religious world ” — Western and Central Europe .
And even there , Kepel tells us , a “ significant re-Christianization movement ” has appeared in France in the form of Pentecostal Catholicism .
In America , this revival is reflected in popular culture , too , and not just in black - angel movies .
Recall the trend that the bloggers were referring to when they dubbed Obama “ the One ” : over the past few decades , a slew of science - fiction movies , from E.T. to the second Star Wars trilogy to Superman Returns , have drawn parts of their plots from the New Testament ( see “ How Science Fiction Found Religion , ” Winter 2009 ) .
Or look at the recent tattoo craze , in which the most popular designs are not the working - class hearts and arrows of yesteryear but mystical , so - called tribal , patterns .
During the seventies and eighties , writes Margo DeMello in Bodies of Inscription , “ tattooing began , for the first time , to be connected with emerging issues like self - actualization , social and personal transformation , ecological awareness , and spiritual growth . ”
On what Matthew Arnold famously called the “ sea of faith , ” then , it may be that a rising tide raises all ships .
If reawakened religious feeling can prompt people to inject messiahs into their movies and dyes into their skin , why should n’t it prompt them to vote for a black angel ?
Perhaps we should simply identify Obamaism as one more manifestation of a wider resurgence of spiritual enthusiasm — a manifestation that differs from the others merely in having a political component — and stop worrying about it .
Yet the political component is of immense importance .
If twentieth - century history teaches us anything , it ’s that political religions spell trouble .
Soviet Communism , Italian Fascism , and Nazism are n’t just called “ political religions ” by scholars today .
In all three cases , observers at the time recognized and worried about the movements ’ religious natures .
Those natures were no accident ; Mussolini , for instance , called his ideology “ not only a faith , but a religion that is conquering the laboring masses of the Italian people . ”
One reason that observers saw the great totalitarianisms as religious was that each had its idol : Mussolini in Italy , Hitler in Germany , and Lenin in Russia , followed by Stalin .
Take Grigory Zinoviev ’s description of Lenin : “ He is really the chosen one of millions .
He is the leader by the Grace of God .
He is the authentic figure of a leader such as is born once in 500 years . ”
Stalin ’s cult of personality was far more developed and sometimes explicitly idolatrous , as in the poem that addressed the despot as “ O Thou mighty one , chief of the peoples , Who callest man to life , Who awakest the earth to fruitfulness . ”
And in Italy , writes the historian Michael Burleigh , “ intellectual sycophants and propagandists characterised [ Mussolini ] as a prodigy of genius in terms that would not have embarrassed Stalin : messiah , saviour , man of destiny , latterday Caesar , Napoleon , and so forth . ”
To point out these words ’ uncomfortable similarity to the journalists ’ praises of Obama is not to equate the throngs who bowed down to totalitarian dictators with even the most worshipful Obamaphiles .
But the manner of worship is related , as perhaps it must be in any human society that chooses to adore a human being .
The widespread renaming of villages , schools , and factories after Stalin , for example , finds its modern - day democratic parallel in a rash of schools that have already rechristened themselves after Obama , to say nothing of the hundreds of young sentimentalists who informally adopted the candidate ’s middle name during the presidential race .
Even the Obama campaign ’s ubiquitous logo — the letter O framing a rising sun—would not have surprised the scholar Eric Voegelin .
In The Political Religions ( 1938 ) , Voegelin traced rulers who employed the image of the sun — a symbol of “ the radiation of power along a hierarchy of rulers and offices that ranges from God at the top down to the subject at the bottom ” — from the pharaoh Akhenaton to Louis XIV and eventually to Hitler .
The worship of a charismatic leader was just one reason that twentieth - century intellectuals regarded the great totalitarianisms as inherently religious .
Another was their immense scope , which included not just matters traditionally considered public — war , taxes , even the offices of the welfare state — but also the private lives and practices of individuals .
“ The totalitarian movements which have arisen since World War I are fundamentally religious movements , ” wrote the political scientist Waldemar Gurian in 1952 , in part because they “ cannot conceive of realms of life outside and beyond their control . ”
Sixteen years earlier , the legal scholar Marcel Prélot had commented that “ the totalitarian state , naturally extending its field of action far beyond the recognized domain of the conventional state , claims to constitute both a political entity and an ethical and spiritual community , . . . the state itself being a church . ”
Obamaism is far narrower , and far more benign , than that .
But another strand of modern liberal politics encroaches so far on the private sphere that it begins to resemble the political religions .
On the excellent webcast Uncommon Knowledge , Czech president Václav Klaus recently compared “ two ideologies ” that were “ structurally very similar .
They are against individual freedom .
They are in favor of centralistic masterminding of our fates .
They are both very similar in telling us what to do , how to live , how to behave , what to eat , how to travel , what we can do and what we cannot do . ”
The first of Klaus ’s “ two ideologies ” was Communism — a system with which he was deeply familiar , having participated in the Velvet Revolution in 1989 .
The second was environmentalism .
Klaus could have expanded his list .
Environmentalism does indeed tell its adherents “ what to eat ” ( pesticide - free organic food , preferably grown nearby to cut down on trucking ) and “ how to travel ” ( by public transportation or , better yet , bicycle ) .
But it also lays down rules on nearly every aspect of life in a consumer economy : how to wash your clothes ( seldom ) ; how to wash yourself ( take a shower , not a bath , and use a low - flow showerhead ) ; how to light your house ( with fluorescent bulbs ) ; how to choose your TV ( look for the Energy Star logo ! ) ; how to go to the bathroom ( with high - efficiency toilets and recycled paper ) ; how to invest , clean , sleep , and dress ( in environmentally friendly companies , with nontoxic chemicals , on sheets made of “ sustainable fibers , ” and in clothes made of the same ) ; and even how to procreate ( Greenpeace has issued a guide to “ environmentally friendly sex ” ) .
Think about the life that a truly conscientious environmentalist must lead !
Compared with it , the devout Muslim ’s five daily prayers and the pious Jew ’s carefully regulated diet are a cakewalk .
What the British historian Alfred Cobban wrote about totalitarianism — that it “ takes the spiritual discipline of a religious order and imposes it on forty or sixty or a hundred million people ” — applies perfectly to environmentalism , except for the part about imposition .
And there , one might give Jonah Goldberg ’s answer in Liberal Fascism : “ You may trust that environmentalists have no desire to translate these voluntary suggestions into law , but I have no such confidence given the track record of similar campaigns in the past . ”
Recycling mandates come to mind , as does the federal law that will impose silly - looking spiral lightbulbs on us all by 2014 .
There ’s also a close resemblance between the environmental and biblical views of history , as the late novelist Michael Crichton pointed out in a widely reprinted speech .
“ Environmentalism is in fact a perfect twenty - first - century remapping of traditional Judeo - Christian beliefs and myths , ” Crichton said .
“ There ’s an initial Eden , a paradise , a state of grace and unity with nature , there ’s a fall from grace into a state of pollution as a result of eating from the tree of knowledge , and as a result of our actions there is a judgment day coming for us all . ”
That judgment day currently assumes the form of various global - warming disasters that will happen unless we immediately perform still more rituals .
Never mind that the science so urgently instructing us to reduce carbon emissions — thus hobbling economic growth and prosperity around the world — is so young , and so poorly understood , that it ca n’t explain why global warming seems to have stalled over the last decade .
Far more persuasive is the argument from faith : we ’d better repent , because the End is nigh .
Barack Obama doubtless tapped into environmentalists ’ spiritual longings when he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination .
“ Generations from now , ” he proclaimed , “ we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless ; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal ; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last , best hope on Earth . ”
Italics mine ; grandiloquent prophecy his .
Religion has long been a powerful force in American politics , of course , for good and ill .
The difference with the more traditional varieties of religion was the open acknowledgment that they were religious .
The First Amendment promised that they could never become established churches ; generations ’ worth of jurisprudence closely regulated the way they could interact with government .
And when a campaigning politician acknowledged forthrightly that he derived a policy from , say , his understanding of the Bible , his potential constituents understood that , however reasonable the policy might be , what underlay it was faith , not reason .
The emerging liberal religions are very different : as emotionally captivating for some , at least for a time , as Christianity or Judaism , but untrammeled by any constitutional amendment ; as grounded in faith , but pretending to dwell in the realms of reason and science .
Obama ’s speedy fall from godhood since his election has been encouraging , perhaps a sign of America ’s traditional reluctance to embrace a Great Leader .
But it ’s far too early in his administration to assume that the fall will be permanent .
Radical environmentalism , moreover , will surely be around long after Obama has left the White House .
And the threat of other charismatic leaders will remain as well — a troubling lesson that we can learn from no less a religious authority than the Bible .
A nation that bends the knee once , as the book of Judges bleakly demonstrates , is all too likely to bend it again .
Memristors , a type of circuit element based on magnetic flux , were first proposed back in 1971 , but remained limited to the realm of theory until 2008 .
That 's when some researchers from HP Labs figured out that memristors could be read and written using applied voltages , and did n't need to explicitly involve magnetic flux at all .
Since then , the group has continued to develop memristor production , hoping to find a place for them alongside the existing capacitor , inductor , and resistor devices .
Now , in their latest work , the researchers have shown that it 's possible to simultaneously use memristors to perform a full set of logic operations at the same time as they function as nonvolatile memory .
Our past coverage goes into the actual physics of how a memristor functions , so we 'll just summarize the basic operations here .
The devices can adopt either high - or low - resistance states , which can be considered bits .
A positive voltage above a specific threshold will set the memristor in its high - resistance state in as little as two microseconds .
A negative voltage of the same magnitude toggles it to its low - resistance state .
A key feature of memristors is that these states are stable — they act as nonvolatile memory .
Reading their state can be accomplished by applying voltages smaller than the critical threshold , and determining how much current flows through .
Although these devices are currently difficult to manufacture , they have some distinct advantages .
For example , earlier work showed that , by amplifying the current from one memristor , it 's possible to have its state set the state of others , producing devices that could potentially reprogram themselves in a manner that depends on the evaluation of other logic operations .
This new work expands on that by showing that a memristor - based device can perform the complete set of logic operations .
The work is based on the existing knowledge that the full set of logic operations can be performed using a combination of NAND ( not - and ) gates .
The new work demonstrates that it 's possible to build a NAND gate using a combination of three memristors , but only if you use a frequently overlooked logical operation called " material implication . "
As the authors describe it , for Boolean states p and q , a material implication is " p implies q " — if p is true , then q must also be .
The work shows that it 's possible to build an IMP logic gate using two memristors combined with a standard resistor ; add a further memristor that acts as a false operation ( it always returns false ) , and you get a complete set of logic operations .
Most of the work involves a collection of voltage traces that show the device operates as expected , keeping its state and providing the expected output , so the data itself is n't especially exciting .
What 's exciting about the work is that it's a demonstration that the unique properties of memristors can be harnessed to create a nonvolatile and programmable logic gate .
Still , the memristors are n't especially useful in isolation at the moment , as the authors had to rely on standard silicon circuitry to control them .
They also do n't expect that to change overnight , which has implications for how we might see the first deployments of memristors .
" Applications of this technology will most likely require substantial parallel operations , " the authors write , " in order to amortise any silicon - based driving circuitry . "
The authors also point out that the use of implication is quite common among those who study formal logic , but is largely ignored by those designing logic schemes , who focus on what 's easy to do in silicon .
" The major lesson from this research , " they write , " is that when confronted with a new device , one needs to determine whether it has a natural basis for computation that is different from familiar paradigms . "

A $ 280 m compensation package announced by the Indian government for victims of the Bhopal gas disaster has been denounced by campaigners .
The compensation announced late on Thursday is the latest in a series of pay - offs made by the authorities to victims of the disaster .
The money will go into cleaning up the polluted factory site and improving medical treatment of surviving victims .
Some 3,500 people died within days and more than 15,000 in the years since .
The move follows public outrage after seven former managers at the plant were given two - year jail sentences .
The convictions are the first since the disaster at the Union Carbide plant - considered to be the world 's worst industrial accident .
Analysis Campaigners say that the $ 280 m compensation package is based on outdated numbers of the dead and the maimed .
They say that 525,000 people have died or been disabled by the toxic gas during the leak and its aftermath .
Campaigners also want the government to treat the bulk of victims as " permanently injured " , instead of " temporarily injured " , since they have to visit hospitals regularly for treatment .
They also want them to receive more compensation .
It has taken more than two decades for the government to announce this package , but clearly it will not mark the closure of the tragedy in any way .
The government says Thursday 's announcement will double the payout to families of the dead to $ 22,000 , and increase payments for those with health defects .
It paid " interim compensation " of 3.6 bn rupees ( $ 78 m ) to victims in 1990 .
And 20 years ago Union Carbide paid $ 470 m ( £ 282 m ) in compensation to the Indian government .
Amid rising public and media pressure the government appointed a group of senior ministers to look again at issues such as increased compensation for those affected , and what to do about continued pollution at the now abandoned plant .
Campaigners and groups working for the gas victims are meeting in the capital , Delhi , on Friday to protest against what they call the failure of the government to give " enhanced compensation " for the victims .
' Severely affected '
" We are not satisfied with the compensation , we are not satisfied with the rehabilitation [ plan for victims ] and we are not satisfied about the approach to corporate liability [ in the new compensation package ] , " Rachna Dhingra told the BBC .
BHOPAL'S DEATH TOLL Image caption Thousands of people were affected by the gas leak in December 1984 Initial deaths ( 3 - 6 December ) : more than 3,000 - official toll
Unofficial initial toll : 7,000 - 8,000
Total deaths to date : over 15,000
Number affected : Nearly 600,000
Compensation : Union Carbide pays $ 470 m in 1989 Source : Indian Supreme Court , Madhya Pradesh government , Indian Council of Medical Research Bhopal voices : ' Justice denied ' ' Travesty ' : Indian papers react
Information Minister Ambika Soni said the government would also gather new evidence against Warren Anderson [ the then chairman of the US - based Union Carbide parent group ] and " thereafter press the request for [ his ] extradition " .
Mr Anderson is retired and lives in the US .
" More than 45,000 victims who were affected most severely by the tragedy will receive additional ex gratia payments , " Ms Soni was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
The funds will be also used to upgrade local medical facilities and set up a research centre in Bhopal .
They will be used to clean up the polluted factory site which will be dismantled by 2012 , Ms Soni said .
Dow Chemicals , which bought the company in 1999 , says this settlement resolved all existing and future claims against the company .
But campaigners like Satinath Sarangi , who heads a group of survivors , said that the government must take " strong action " against Dow Chemicals .
" The government has failed to understand the scale of damage , " Mr Sarangi said ahead of Thursday 's announcement .
" There is no mention of the second and third generation victims and the constant medical complications being caused by the contamination , " he added .
Correspondents say the fact that the Bhopal tragedy is back in the news at the same time as the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has added to the sense that victims of the 1984 disaster have been terribly let down .
An extradition treaty does exist between India and the United States - but so far all requests by India for Warren Anderson 's extradition have been turned down by the American government .
First lady Michelle Obama has recruited a culinary army in her battle against childhood obesity .
More than 500 white - clad chefs gathered on the South Lawn today to highlight a new Obama program designed to help schools prepare healthier food and teach children more nutritional eating habits .
" You know more about food than almost anyone -- other than the grandmas -- and you 've got the visibility and the enthusiasm to match that knowledge , " Mrs. Obama told the assembled cooks .
Participants in the Chefs Move to Schools program will adopt a local school and work with officials and students there on better , more nutritious lunches .
" Now I know that none of this is going to be easy , " Mrs. Obama warned her guests .
" You 're going to need to figure out what you 're up against .
You 're going to need to take time to learn your communities , to understand your schools , to figure out how the school kitchen operates , to finding out what equipment is available ...
There 's going to be a learning curve . "

There are problems that we need to address together .
Here are a couple of worthy charities doing good things .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
If we were to hold a contest for most tone - deaf oil spill comments by members of Congress , it ’d be tough to top Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , who actually apologized to BP yesterday , for what he called a “ shake down ” on the part of the Obama administration to get the company to compensate affected Gulf coast residents , then tried to backpedal ( sort of ) .
Oof .
But he ’s far from the only one : I sure hope our Congresspeople are buying offsets , since there have been an awful lot of gaseous emissions coming from them in the wake of the largest offshore oil spill in US history .
Luckily , MoJo reporter Kate Sheppard has been there to document it , tweeting the absurdity live from Washington , D.C.
Here , culled from Kate ’s tweets , are the top 10 most ludicrous , out - of - touch , and generally embarrassing things our Congresspeople have said in the months since the spill began .
Begin cringing … now :
10 . John Culberson ( R - Texas ) , 6/15 , at a press conference : Argues that the BP oil spill “ is an anomaly –like an airplane falling from the clear blue sky . ”
9. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , 6/15 , at an Energy and Commerce hearing : “ Chinese oil companies are drilling off the coast of Cuba , which means they are drilling off the coast of Florida . ”
8. Michael Burgess ( R - Texas ) , 6/15 , at an Energy and Commerce hearing : “ If this hearing is not about stopping the leak , then why are we here ? ”
7. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) , 5/4 , told reporters : ” I mean , accidents happen .
You learn from them and you try to make sure they do n’t happen again . ”
6. Pete Olson ( R - Texas ) on moratorium , 6/15 press conference : “ This is a kneejerk reaction by the administration to address a problem that does n’t exist . ”
5. Ralph Hall ( R - Texas ) 6/15 , at a press conference : “ It ’s a shame we ca n’t drill ANWR .
It ’s a shame we do n’t get that energy off the coast of Florida . ”
4. Parker Griffith ( R - Ala. ) , 6/15 , at an Energy and Commerce hearing : argued that the treatment of oil executives has been “ disrespectful . ”
3. Ralph Hall ( R - Texas ) , 6/15 , at a press conference : “ I resent the fact that [ Obama ’s ] trying to blame some of this on Bush .
On 9/11 I do n’t remember Bush trying to blame this on Clinton . ”
2. Bob Bennett ( R - Utah ) , 6/9 , at a press conference : “ The bridge to that promised land of renewable energy is built out of fossil fuels . ”
1. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , 6/17 , apologizing to BP CEO Tony Hayward at an Energy and Commerce hearing : “ I am ashamed … that a private corporation can be subject to what I would characterize as a shake down . ”

The Honourable Noël A. Kinsella , Speaker
THE SENATE
Wednesday , May 12 , 2010
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m. , the Speaker in the chair .
Prayers .
Hon. Jim Munson : Honourable senators , I am having a very interesting day .
I am rather sore .
I was allowed to walk in , but you may have seen a wheelchair outside .
Senator Kochhar and I have been in wheelchairs since 7 o'clock this morning in an effort to raise awareness on behalf of the Canadian Paraplegic Association .
I can tell you that I am more tired than I have ever been playing hockey .
I am spending the day in a wheelchair to gain an understanding of what daily life is like for the more than 41,000 Canadians who live with spinal cord injuries .
I have gained a new perspective .
I have found out how much more time you need to get from one place to another .
I know what it is like not to see eye to eye , and so does Senator Kochhar , but I discovered muscles in my upper body that I never thought existed .
I also discovered sad facts about spinal cord injuries .
Every year , 1,200 new spinal cord injuries occur in this country , and 84 per cent of those happen to young people under 34 years of age .
Three out of four spinal cord injuries happen to men .
That is frightening for a father like me who has two sons in that range .
It is also frightening to learn that we do not have a cure for spinal cord injuries , that the unemployment rate for people with spinal cord injuries is 62 per cent and that the average cost for each injured person over the course of his or her lifetime is between $ 1.25 million and $ 25 million , depending on the injury .
There is much we need to do to find a cure for spinal cord injuries and to ensure that those who have a spinal cord injury participate fully in society .
I will certainly reflect on that as I wheel my way through the rest of the day and also on what we need to do in this chamber to be more inclusive .
In the other place , modifications have been made to accommodate people in wheelchairs , such as Minister Fletcher , who was our leader today on the Hill with 35 MPs and two senators .
Here in this chamber , Rick Wardell is one of the individuals who participates in the Friends of the Senate program .
Rick works with our pages and is limited by what he does because this chamber cannot accommodate him in his chair .
I think Rick deserves better .
I think a person like Rick should be allowed to come into this chamber and deliver a message along the floor of this chamber .
It is simple : Open the doors a bit wider , and of course the red carpet will not be damaged at all .
I believe Rick deserves better , as do all people with spinal cord injuries .
No matter which government has been in power over the last 15 years , whether Liberal or Conservative , the funding for the Canadian Paraplegic Association has decreased from $ 2 million a year to $ 200,000 .
All of us — Liberals , Conservatives and independents — who know our way around the Hill know it is not about politics ; it is about helping others and being made aware .
For example , Minister Flaherty has been good to me with funding when it comes to the Special Olympics .
That shows that Liberals and Conservatives can work together .
I will end with the thought that we can do better .
Hon. Carolyn Stewart Olsen : Honourable senators , I rise to recognize our nurses during this year 's National Nursing Week .
May 12 marks the birthday of Florence Nightingale , who set the standard for professional nurses .
In her honour , we celebrate today as International Nurses Day and take a moment to consider the role of her successors , our selfless , dedicated and devoted nurses , who often go unthanked and unappreciated .
Ms. Nightingale fought public opinion of the day and went to the Crimean War .
She and a team of nurses travelled to military hospitals in Turkey , where they found appalling conditions .
Their interventions saved many lives and , more importantly , awakened the public to the idea of nursing as a life - saving profession .
Daily , nurses go beyond the call of duty , being there for those at their most vulnerable .
In birth and in death nurses stand fast ; they ease and guide us through these painful transitions .
[ Translation ]
From our birth until our death , nurses offer support , guide us and help us with transitions through difficult times .
[ English ]
Today , the selfless hard work of nurses tends to go unnoticed .
Nurses are dedicated and compassionate individuals who choose a demanding profession of long hours and unforgiving schedules , yet they approach their work with an enthusiasm unmatched by any profession .
When Canadians are ill , often the first person they see is a nurse .
Nurses watch over their patients during the long , lonely hours of the night , offering support through recovery , sometimes for months and years .
They are there when you are born , and they are there when you
die .
Nurses are with our military on the front lines , and families are comforted to know that a nurse was with a loved one as he or she faced injury or death so far from home .
Our nurses serve in isolated communities where there are no hospitals or doctors .
They are responsible for improving health care outcomes , reducing costs , advocating for patient safety , promoting knowledge and driving innovation and research .
This year 's slogan says it best : " Nursing , you can't live without it ! "
We have 270,000 registered nurses in Canada , and every day they touch the lives of Canadians .
Please join me in celebrating this week and in celebrating the contributions of those devoted hardworking men and women .

I invite all senators to join me in highlighting this special week and in celebrating the unparalleled commitment of these dedicated men and women .

Hon. Lillian Eva Dyck : Honourable senators , on Thursday , May 6 , 2010 , I had the honour and privilege of attending the seventh annual Aboriginal Gathering on Diabetes in Prince Albert , Saskatchewan and to give the keynote address .
These annual Aboriginal gatherings allow us to carefully examine the issue of diabetes in Aboriginal communities today : our struggles and our successes .
Diabetes affects the Aboriginal population in higher numbers than the non-Aboriginal population .
The picture is staggering .
Aboriginal Canadians are three to five times more likely to develop diabetes than non-Aboriginal Canadians .
Aboriginal Canadians are developing diabetes at younger ages and Aboriginal women are four times more likely to develop diabetes than non-Aboriginal women .
Diabetes is a very real health concern , and the numbers are growing .
With current rates of diabetes among Aboriginals , the future projections of this epidemic are unacceptable .
We must make serious efforts to combat this rate of diabetes in our Aboriginal communities .
I was pleased to announce the agreement between Cameco and the Canadian Diabetes Association , North Saskatchewan Region , to further expand the Travelling Diabetes Resource Program at the Aboriginal gathering .
Cameco has graciously agreed to provide the Canadian Diabetes Association , North Saskatchewan Region , with a van for the region 's Travelling Diabetes Resource Program .
The addition of this van will allow the program to serve not only Prince Albert but also many Aboriginal Canadians in most regions of Saskatchewan in an effort to provide a healthier future for Canada 's Aboriginal populations .
Hon. Donald Neil Plett : Honourable senators , last week , I had the pleasure of having as my guests in the gallery a group of young ladies from Manitoba .
These young women , aged 13 to 18 years , are all First Nations , Metis or Inuit .
They were competing in Kanata in the ninth annual National Aboriginal Hockey Championship .
The Aboriginal Sport Circle , ASC , was established in 1995 to promote personal excellence through sport and to support the holistic development of Aboriginal athletes and coaches .
The ASC established the National Aboriginal Hockey Championship in 2001 to reflect those priorities , while serving as the premier competition for minor level Aboriginal hockey in Canada .
The National Aboriginal Hockey Championship provides a forum for elite and bantam aged Aboriginal hockey players and attracts participation from First Nations peoples , Inuit and Metis across all 13 provinces and territories .
The NAHC 's long - term vision is to establish a competitive structure that will serve as the impetus for grassroots and regional Aboriginal hockey development .
This annual event helps foster cultural unity and pride to celebrate the athletic abilities of Aboriginal athletes from across the country .
One of the truly amazing stories about this group is that they paid their own way to come to Ottawa , as I imagine all the other teams in the tournament did .
In recent days and weeks we have heard many complaints about funding cuts to different groups , some of which have received funding for the last 36 years .
These young hockey players needed to raise $ 1,650 each .
One family from my home riding of Provencher included two girls plus the assistant coach on the team .
The father of the two hockey players who is also the husband of the assistant coach had recently lost his job , yet the family still managed to raise nearly $ 5,000 to come out and play .
They were thrilled to be here and compete .
These young people must be congratulated for their efforts and initiative .
As for the outcome of the tournament , I am proud to say that this fine group of young women hockey players from Manitoba , six of whom were from the riding of Provencher , went through the round robin tournament undefeated .
They then took on Saskatchewan in the semi-finals , thrashing them by a score of 7 to 1 .
This pitted them next against a strong Northern Ontario opponent in the championship game .
Manitoba came out the winners with a score of 2 to 1 , thus defending their championship from last year .
On the men's side , Manitoba ended up playing Saskatchewan in the final game .
Saskatchewan squeaked out a winner , giving them the gold and Manitoba the silver .
Honourable senators , please join me in congratulating all of the participants in this year 's championships .
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich : Honourable senators , I rise today to talk about an issue that is close to my heart and that of many Canadians .
It is one about which many people across the country , especially Montrealers , are very excited .
I am , of course , referring to the Stanley Cup .
This magnificent trophy has been idolized and , I dare say , worshipped by hockey fans for well over 100 years .
The decorative silver bowl was donated by then Governor General , Lord Stanley of Preston , who himself became a great fan of the game when he was introduced to it at the 1889 Winter Carnival in Montreal .
He thought there should be a trophy awarded to the top amateur hockey team in Canada which would symbolize Canadian amateur hockey supremacy .
Over the years , a number of leagues competed to obtain the cup , but it was only in 1927 that the NHL took over and made the Stanley Cup its championship trophy .
With such magnificent and quintessential Canadian history , it is important to recognize the significance of the cup and to share it with the millions of visitors who come to our nation 's capital every year .
[ Translation ]
That is why I support the idea of a monument to commemorate this symbolic gift from Lord Stanley .
[ English ]
First proposed by Ottawa historian Paul Kitchen , the project has now received the support of Hockey Canada , the NHL , the National Capital Commission in Ottawa , and countless enthusiastic hockey fans .
Various sites around Ottawa have been suggested for the home of the monument , which organizers have suggested would be colossal in size , inspiring and historically significant .
They want the statue to depict Lord Stanley as well as the original punch bowl he donated .
If all goes according to plan , they hope to have the monument in place by the fall of 2012 .
Having had the great fortune of hoisting the cup several times , I believe that it is tremendously important to honour the man who gave all hockey fans across this great country a reason to come together annually to celebrate the spirit of Canada and our mutual love of Canada 's game .

Hon. Céline Hervieux - Payette : Honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate .
As she surely knows , the Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec and some large Quebec companies , including Cascades , Quebecor , Jean Coutu , Industriel Alliance and many more , oppose centralizing the securities commissions .
There is no evidence to suggest that centralization would be either relevant or effective when it comes to preventing the moral and financial crisis we are experiencing .
I want to emphasize that the OECD has ranked Canada second in the world with respect to securities regulation .
And , as I am sure honourable senators know , neither the single American securities commission nor the single British securities commission managed to protect investors ; both failed to see the crisis coming .
Despite these facts , the Prime Minister is stubbornly going ahead with his plan to create a single commission even though it is neither sensible nor in the interests of the provinces , including Quebec , which want nothing to do with it .
In light of growing opposition on the part of Quebec business leaders , can the minister tell us when her government , specifically her Prime Minister , will reconsider this proposal , which is neither desired nor desirable , thereby saving the $ 250 million already set aside for that purpose in the budget ?
[ English ]
Hon. Marjory LeBreton ( Leader of the Government ) : Honourable senators , Canada is the only industrialized country without a national securities regulator .
Canada will be participating in G8 and G20 meetings .
There has been and will continue to be a call for more financial regulations and international coordination .
With these international pressures on us , we continue to be questioned about our fragmented system at home when we are dealing with our international partners .
As the honourable senator is aware , and as has been stated many times , this is a voluntary initiative .
A clear majority of the provinces and territories are committed to or are open to working towards a single securities regulator .
This is a voluntary initiative , and I am aware of some of the objections to it in the Province of Quebec .
However , some industries and some people in Quebec are able to see the virtue of a single securities regulator .
This is a voluntary effort .
If the Province of Quebec decides that it does not want to participate , that should not impede the desires of other provinces that wish to have a single securities regulator .
Senator Hervieux - Payette : Honourable senators , the leader is arguing that we are the only country without a national organization .
I must remind her that the Prime Minister is travelling around the world now telling people we have a different law , that is why we are different and they are all having problems .
Either we go along with the rest and go down the drain , or we have our own rules .
Our system has prevailed .
When will the leader 's government table a study that will demonstrate , beyond any reasonable doubt , that we need that regulator and it is not for political purposes ?
Senator LeBreton : Honourable senators , while travelling around the world representing us so very well , the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have discussed the notion of the global bank tax .
Both have said that they do not believe Canada should be punished with this tax .
The Prime Minister pointed out that Canada has handled its finances very well and did not have any bank failures , nor did the Canadian government become involved in any bailouts .
The Prime Minister stated that Canada should not be punished for all of its good work .
Honourable senators , with regard to when our government will table its intentions , the honourable senator knows that the government is seeking an opinion from the Supreme Court of Canada to provide legal certainty on Parliament 's authority to establish such a common securities regulator .
Once that process is complete , we will table the plan .
Senator Fraser :
What a good idea .
Senator Comeau :
What is your position on it ?
[ Translation ]
Hon. Francis Fox : Honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate .
At a meeting organized last week by the Canadian Private Copying Collective , parliamentarians of all political stripes learned that more than 1.3 billion songs are copied every year in Canada , more than 70 per cent of copies are made on an MP3 medium but only 9 per cent are made legally and , finally , artists are no longer being compensated , as in the past , for more than two thirds of the songs copied .
Because of this , the royalties collected for distribution to Canadian copyright holders , songwriters and performers have dropped by 60 per cent in the past three years , from $ 27.6 million in 2008 to $ 19.8 million in 2009 and $ 10.6 million in 2010 .
It is clear that this trend could seriously hurt performing rights societies and songwriters .
Is the minister prepared to recommend to her colleagues that the Copyright Act be amended immediately and specifically to ensure that the Copyright Board can set royalties for private copies made using audio recording devices , to address the needs related to new technologies ?
We are aware of the contrary Federal Court of Appeal decisions in 2008 stating that the Copyright Board had no jurisdiction under the current act .
( 1400 )
[ English ]
Hon. Marjory LeBreton ( Leader of the Government ) : Honourable senators , copyrights are a complicated and complex issue .
If the issue were easily solved , the previous government , which wrestled with it for many years without success , would have found a way to solve it .
The honourable senator will have to await the decision and comments of the minister .
I cannot and will not comment further .
[ Translation ]
Senator Fox :
If I understood the minister correctly — and I did not have the chance to listen to the translation as I would have liked — I think she is referring to the bill the Minister of Industry is supposed to introduce in the house .
Having looked at the statistics , I would say to the minister that this country 's artists , composers and performers are in real danger .
Experience shows that it can take years before a new copyright act is passed .
Given that this situation is hurting the most creative people in this country 's communities , be they francophone , anglophone or multicultural , would the government consider amending the act immediately to provide fair compensation for this country 's artists , which is what the act was originally intended to do ?
[ English ]
Senator LeBreton : Again , honourable senators , copyright law is a complicated area , and it has become more complicated with the advance of technology .
Honourable senators have seen comments by the minister reported in the media about attempts to address this issue .
We will have to await the minister 's response .
I am not in a position to go further at this time .
[ Translation ]
Hon. Lucie Pépin : Honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate .
The Government of Quebec has decided to introduce a $ 25 user fee for every doctor 's appointment .
Most Quebecers oppose this and are waiting for the Government of Canada to take a clear and firm position .
Can the minister tell us whether the Government of Canada believes that Quebec 's decision to impose user fees complies with the provisions of the Canada Health Act ?
[ English ]
Hon. Marjory LeBreton ( Leader of the Government ) : Honourable senators , the Liberal Party leader seemed to support these fees initially , but that position was overturned , I am told , as a result of the reaction by his own caucus .
Senator Mercer :
That is done .
What is the government 's position ?
Senator LeBreton :
The five principles of the Canada Health Act were recommended by the Hall Royal Commission on Health Services established by the Right Honourable John George Diefenbaker .
These principles are the law of the land .
The government expects provinces and territories to abide by the act .
We have increased transfers to the provinces and territories by 6 per cent per year so they can continue to meet the health care needs of their residents .
The government supports the five principles of the Canada Health Act .
[ Translation ]
Senator Pépin : I thank the honourable leader for her statement , but the question is this :
Do user fees comply with the provisions of the Canada Health Act , yes or no ?
[ English ]
Senator LeBreton : I will simply say again , honourable senators , that the Canada Health
Act is the law of the land .
We expect the provinces and territories to respect the law .
The honourable senator will not draw me into a culture war with the Province of Quebec on the issue of the health care system .
[ Translation ]
Senator Pépin : Honourable senators , the provinces are responsible for providing health care .
However , the federal government has responsibilities regarding health care that stem primarily from the federal spending power .
Under the Canada Health
Act , the federal government is also responsible for guaranteeing reasonable access to health care without financial or other barriers .
Some 62 per cent of Quebecers believe that Ottawa should use its powers to veto this $ 25 user fee .
Does the Government of Canada plan to heed the calls of Quebecers and intervene more actively in this matter ?
[ English ]
Senator LeBreton : Honourable senators , the government has responded by not doing what the previous government did , which was to make major cuts to health care transfer payments to provinces .
This government went one better .
We increased transfers to the provinces and territories by 6 per cent per year to enable them to meet their health care needs .
Senator Ringuette : That was signed by Paul Martin .
Senator LeBreton : Again , the government believes the law should be followed , and I will not be drawn into a culture war between the Liberal government of Quebec and the Liberal opposition in Ottawa .
Senator Comeau :
And their CBC friends .
Hon. Joan Fraser : Honourable senators , let me try this in the other official language .
The Government of Quebec is considering imposing a deterrent fee .
The Canada Health
Act says Canadians should have access to medical services without paying fees .
Senator Mercer : Exactly .
Senator Fraser : Does the Government of Canada believe that deterrent fees are legal under the Canada Health Act ?
If not , what will the government do about that ?
Senator LeBreton : Honourable senators , I am glad that the Honourable Senator Fraser is supporting the Official Languages
Act in that she felt it was necessary to ask me the same question in our other official language .
I appreciate the support of the Official Languages Act , which was the argument that my colleague Senator Carignan made yesterday on Bill C - 232 regarding the Supreme Court of Canada .
Senator Comeau : Great speech .
Senator Fox : Except he was wrong ; he should check his sources .
Senator LeBreton : Honourable senators , there is a law in the land called the Canada Health Act .
As a Conservative , I am proud of the act but not because of the revisionist history of the Liberal Party .
The act came about because of the efforts of the Right Honourable John George Diefenbaker from Saskatchewan when he was Prime Minister .
Mr. Diefenbaker commissioned Supreme Court Justice Emmett Hall , who would not have qualified to sit on the Supreme Court of Canada under Bill C-232 .
Senator Fraser : Yes or no ?
Senator LeBreton :
In any event , the Canada Health
Act is the law of the land .
We expect the provinces and territories to abide by the act .
I suggest to the honourable senator that she communicate to her Liberal colleagues in the province of Quebec that we all expect each province and territory to abide by the law .
Senator Fraser : Honourable senators , we will do that when we are back in government .
In the meantime , the Conservatives are the government .
Senator Comeau : Speak to your friends .

Hon. Roméo Antonius Dallaire : Honourable senators , two weeks ago , Mr. Paul Dewar and I , both members of the All - Party Parliamentary Group for the Prevention of Genocide and other Crimes Against Humanity , wrote an article that was published in the papers .
I know that Madam Leader does not give credence to newspapers .
In this article , we stated that it is vital that Canada revisit its policy on the United Nations mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo , known as MONUC , and that it consider the United Nations ' request to strengthen the mission and allow it to carry out its mandate .
The next morning , there was an article in the papers about the Conservative government 's decision not to provide additional reinforcements to MONUC .
Since I believe the newspapers , can the minister confirm that the Conservative government has decided not to provide additional resources to MONUC ?
[ English ]
Hon. Marjory LeBreton ( Leader of the Government ) : Honourable senators , contrary to the honourable senator 's opening remarks , I do believe in newspapers .
However , I believe in factual newspaper reporting .
I have always believed in newspapers and I read several each day .
I read the honourable senator 's effort , together with Mr. Paul Dewar , with regard to the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Canada has observers in the Democratic Republic of Congo but we will not send troops into the country .
I believe this is overwhelmingly supported by the Canadian population .
Canada is still involved , and will be for another year , in an important mission in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan is where our focus lies .
( 1410 )
Senator Dallaire : Honourable senators , the leader said she is reading newspapers that provide her with facts .
I think it would be important to ensure what her facts are with regard to what the Canadian people think about sending reinforcements , or a commander , finally , to that mission .
I contend that there are many people who thought we should have been there instead of somewhere else and who still hold that position .
General Leslie , for example , was told by the UN and by all the contributing nations of troops that he would be the best commander to take over that mission in the difficult times as it transitions — hopefully , over the next three to four years — to pulling out , and that he would make that mission more effective .
Is the leader saying that he is not , and we are not , going to do anything else in that place where millions of people have been killed and there is still considerable conflict going on ?
Senator LeBreton : Honourable senators , regarding General Leslie , I can only comment that it was speculation about potential future missions for him .
As the honourable senator knows , General Leslie has now been given new responsibilities by DND .
With regard to the view of the Canadian public , I think it is clear that the Canadian public supports our soldiers and their mission in Afghanistan .
It is an important mission .
As a result of a parliamentary motion , of course , we will be withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2011 .
I should have clarified that I do believe the Canadian public supports the position of the government , but I exclude The Globe and Mail , with their new editors , Geldof and Bono .
Some Hon.
Senators :
Oh , oh !
Senator Dallaire :
Was the government told specifically in the military advice it received that it would not be in any way , shape or form capable of continuing the mission until , as Parliament has said , it should end in Afghanistan ?
Also , was it told we should be providing some staff officers and possibly even a commander to enhance that mission and make it more effective , if we so believed in the UN , and that we should be seeking to sit at that table where such decisions will be taken in the future ?
Senator LeBreton :
It should come as no surprise to the honourable senator that I am not at the strategic table of negotiations between DND and Foreign Affairs .
The advice is given to DND within the military structure .
Of course , as the honourable senator is probably well aware , much of that information and many of the discussions are not available for security reasons .
Therefore , I cannot answer the honourable senator 's question specifically .
I am simply saying that , as of now , we have an important mission in Afghanistan .
We are committed to it .
Many of our soldiers , men and women , have given their lives or been seriously injured fighting for democracy in Afghanistan .
I believe that is what the Canadian people want us to focus on .
Obviously , I cannot give the honourable senator information that I do not have nor would I be privy to , about considerations made by the strategic planners at National Defence as to how they will handle their next military assignment .
Senator Dallaire :
We are engaged in Afghanistan , but we still were able to go to Haiti .
When we seek flexibility , we can find it .
Honourable senators , the specific question I have for the leader is this :
Was the decision for us not to commit to the mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo taken by the Minister of Foreign Affairs , or was it the Minister of National Defence who said we did not have the capability to do it ?
Senator LeBreton : First , the honourable senator is quite right .
Thanks to the equipment that we bought for the Armed Forces , we were able to deploy to Haiti quickly .
Our forces went to Haiti and did an outstanding job , and now they have withdrawn .
Again , I will not get into a debate with the honourable senator on the inner strategic planning of the Department of National Defence .
I am not privy to that information , nor would I want to be .
I can simply say that the comments of both the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the subject of the Democratic Republic of Congo are public and well known .

Hon. Maria Chaput : Honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate .
On Monday , May 3 , 2010 , the Honourable Stockwell Day , President of the Treasury Board , announced that he would conduct strategic reviews of 13 government organizations , which would yield $ 1.3 billion in savings .
However , I was reading in the Ottawa Citizen that the Auditor General has expressed concerns about these reviews .
[ English ]
Auditor General Sheila Fraser said :
. . . departments have been put through so many reviews over the years that there is little room for significant cuts unless they start eliminating programs or invest in technology . . . .
" I personally do n't think there are a lot of easy wins , " she said .
" They would have been identified by now . "
[ Translation ]
Of these 13 federal organizations that will come under scrutiny , three are regional agencies that work with communities and small businesses : the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec , the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and Western Economic Diversification Canada .
Could we be advised of the criteria for this strategic review ?
Will there be a consultation process ?
What form will it take and who will be consulted ?
Will there be an analysis of the impact on these francophone and anglophone communities and small businesses before certain programs are curtailed , cancelled or replaced ?
Could the leader obtain the answers from the minister responsible ?
[ English ]
Hon. Marjory LeBreton ( Leader of the Government ) : First , I answered the question with regard to regional development agencies the other day when asked a question by my colleague , Senator Manning , in terms of the funding of regional economic development .
With regard to the Auditor General , the honourable senator 's information is somewhat stale .
The President of the Treasury Board met with the Auditor General and they discussed several concerns .
The Auditor General reported that she was well satisfied with the explanation from the Treasury Board Secretariat with respect to providing information to her office .
As honourable senators know , this is a program where we study the departments — and this has been going on since we formed the government .
We have been going through a strategic review and have saved a considerable amount of money for the taxpayer .
The strategic review is an ongoing effort .
As we ramp up our deficit reduction plan , departments under strategic review are asked to look for savings and efficiencies from within .
In not one case has there been any allegation , other than from the opposition , that we are eliminating regional economic development agencies .

Hon. Gerald J. Comeau ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : I have the honour to present , in both official languages , delayed answers to oral questions raised by the Honourable Senator Losier - Cool on March 30 , 2010 , concerning international cooperation , the Interim Haitian Recovery Commission and the role of women , and by the Honourable Senator Jaffer on April 20 , 2010 , concerning health , malaria .
( Response to question raised by Hon. Rose - Marie Losier - Cool on March 30 , 2010 )
On March 31 , 2010 at the International Donors ' Conference in New York , Canada announced a commitment of $ 400 million over two years for humanitarian and reconstruction programs in Haiti .
This is in addition to Canada 's five - year commitment to Haiti of $ 555 million made in 2006 , a commitment that we will meet .
Hence , for the past five years , Canada has contributed approximately $ 100 million a year to reconstruction and long term development efforts in Haiti .
The Haitian Government 's Action Plan for Recovery and Development lists Canada as one of the " main donors " .
Given this , as well as our past and present commitments , Canada will have a representative on the Board of the Haiti Interim Commission for Reconstruction .
This will give Canada the opportunity to ensure effective co-ordination and use of resources as well as uphold a high level of accountability and transparency .
It is important to recognize the enormous generosity of individual Canadians who donated a total of $ 220 million to eligible Canadian charities working so tirelessly in Haiti .
The Government of Canada promised to match its generosity .
Half of the government 's matching fund will go towards its pledge made in New York .
The other half will go to Canadian and international organizations working on the recovery and reconstruction of Haiti .
As the Government of Canada 's lead agency for the provision of international assistance , the Canadian International Development Agency ( CIDA ) is hard at work to ensure a rapid and effective response to the January earthquake .
CIDA 's gender equality policy requires that all CIDA programming address women 's specific needs .
Gender - based analysis is conducted as part of the planning process for CIDA - funded projects .
CIDA programming aims to improve women 's access to and control over resources and services , including during reconstruction efforts .
CIDA 's Haiti Program has included equality between women and men as a crosscutting theme of all its programming including in such sectors as in health , education , food security and micro-finance .
CIDA also provides assistance for female parliamentarians through a variety of initiatives in order to enhance the political participation of women and help build good relations between the government 's executive and legislative branches as well as between the Parliament and the Haitian population .
( Response to question raised by Hon. Mobina S. B. Jaffer on April 20 , 2010 )
Since 2003 , CIDA 's support for the prevention of malaria has resulted in the distribution of over 7.9 million bednets in Africa to children under five and pregnant women through partnerships with the Red Cross , UNICEF and World Vision Canada .
It is conservatively estimated that these nets will save approximately 121,000 lives .
The second element in CIDA 's fight against malaria is expanding access to treatment for the poor .
CIDA is providing $ 60 million to increase access to treatment at the community level for malaria and pneumonia , two of the leading killers of children worldwide .
It is conservatively estimated these programs will save over 135,000 lives .
In 2008 , Canada pledged an additional $ 450 M over three years to the Global Fund to Fight HIV / AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , bringing Canada 's total commitment to $ 978.4 M .
Approximately one - quarter of these funds are channelled towards malaria .
Concrete examples CIDA is providing $ 20 M for Population Services International ( PSI ) to provide free malaria treatment ( artemisinin - based combination therapies , ACTs ) to the poor at the community level across four African countries .
In addition to treatment for malaria , this Program will also include a component to treat pneumonia and diarrheal dehydration in children under five .
PSI will be training community health workers to be able to recognize and treat these diseases within communities having limited access to a health facility .
It is estimated this program will save over 50,000 lives .
CIDA is funding two programs of $ 20 M each for Malaria Consortium and Save the Children to provide free ACTs and antibiotics at the community level across multiple African countries .
These two programs will treat malaria and pneumonia , two of the leading killers of children worldwide .
The Save the Children program will train health workers to identify these diseases based on established clinical symptoms and treat presumptively for malaria or pneumonia without the use of diagnostic tools .
The Malaria Consortium program will emphasize a diagnostic approach by training existing health workers to use simple diagnostic tools that can be used outside of a health facility , such as the Rapid Diagnostic Test ( RDT ) for malaria .
This program will also provide treatment for diarrheal dehydration in children under five at the community level .
It is estimated that combined , these programs will save over 85,000 lives .
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) tabled the answer to Question No. 8 on the Order Paper — by Senator Downe .
( 1420 )
[ English ]
Hon. Joan Fraser : Honourable senators , when the Leader of the Government in the Senate answered my question a moment ago , she said a couple of things that might cause a reader of the Debates of the Senate to be surprised that I support the Official Languages Act .
I simply want the record to show that I have been an ardent and vocal supporter of the Official Languages
Act since it was passed in 1969 .
I want the record to show that I have been an equally ardent and vocal supporter of language rights for both official language minority communities in Canada , including , but not only , the rights expressed in section 133 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
I would be very upset should anyone conclude the contrary .
On the Order :
Resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Wallace , seconded by the Honourable Senator Mockler , for the second reading of Bill S - 10 , An Act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts .
Hon. George Baker : Honourable senators , this is the first opportunity I have had to welcome Senator Marshall to this place .
Senator Marshall has had a distinguished career in the provincial legislature and prior to that as the auditor general for the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador .
She truly brings great experience to this place , and I welcome her here .
I also note that she is only the second person from Newfoundland and Labrador to be appointed to the Senate who was born in Canada .
An Hon. Senator :
That means she is young !
Senator Baker :
The rest of us were born in a foreign nation called Newfoundland .
The first person appointed to the Senate is Senator Fabian Manning .
I reminded him the other day that three of us have sat in the Newfoundland House of Assembly .
Back in 1965 , I was the law clerk and then the chief clerk .
In that capacity , I wrote the rules of procedure for the Newfoundland 's House of Assembly .
His response to me was : " I wondered what caused all the chaos . "
Honourable senators , I want to recognize the great contribution made by two senators in the chamber today , to the subject matter currently under debate .
They are the two recognized people in the Parliament of Canada who , perhaps , know more about this subject than anyone else knows .
One senator sits on the side opposite and one senator sits on this side .
The first person I recognize is the Honourable Senator Nolin .
Some Hon. Senators : Hear , hear !
Senator Baker : Senator Nolin chaired a Senate committee mandated to study the use of illegal drugs in Canada .
The committee produced a report in 2001 that has been referenced many times in court proceedings in Canada .
Today , Senator Nolin is a recognized expert on the subject .
Within the past year , I noticed that he was recognized as an expert witness in the Supreme Court of British Columbia , where he was called upon to testify on the subject of controlled drugs .
The second person I recognize sits on the Liberal side .
He is considered an expert in the subject ; is known throughout the country because of a television series ; was the chief coroner in British Columbia for a brief time ; and recently has written a magnificent book on the subject of the use of illegal drugs entitled , A Thousand Dreams .
The author is the Honourable Senator Larry Campbell .
Some Hon. Senators : Hear , hear !
An Hon. Senator : Bravo !
Senator Meighen :
It was all hearsay .
Senator Baker :
When I was reading case law one day , I noticed that Senator Campbell 's name had been used by the judge in reference to the fact that as the chief coroner , he had subpoenaed an academic who had authored a report .
The case revolved around the discovery of a body in the ocean , I believe .
There was a difference of opinion and a great deal of discussion as to whether the chief coroner had done the right thing .
A couple of months ago , that academic author appeared as a witness before the Senate Legal Committee .
Senator Campbell sat across the table at committee , prepared to cross -examine the witness .
To my surprise , they got along well .
It was like old home week .
They were happy to see one another .
I suggested to Senator Campbell after the meeting that the two of them had resolved their differences .
He asked me what I meant .
I reminded him of the court case those many years ago when he subpoenaed the academic author who had objected to his actions as chief coroner .
Senator Campbell asked me if I had not read his recent book .
I said that I had not read it and he replied that I should buy it and read it because the other person I was talking about had co- authored the book .
I recommend this reading to anyone .
It would be a particularly good Christmas present .
Honourable senators , I will make a brief reference to a point in Bill S - 10 that is worthy of visiting .
The mover at second reading on the government side talked about mandatory minimum sentences .
( 1430 )
Honourable senators , mandatory minimum sentences , as we know them , are really not mandatory in most cases .
I am saying that because there is a sort of fail - safe in this legislation to the mandatory minimum sentence that is taking away the discretion from the judge .
There is also a discretion that is given to the Crown prosecutor .
It is taking away the discretion from the judge and then transferring it to the Crown prosecutor , and it is in the law .
For example , how many times does one read in the newspaper that someone was convicted of impaired driving for the twentieth time in the last ten years ?
It is common , is it not ?
One wonders , as a legislator , " How could that be possible ?
We have mandatory minimum sentences for impaired driving . "
I was on every committee that dealt with that , and I know that subject inside out .
I know that if one is found to be impaired , on their first conviction there is a mandatory minimum .
One pays a thousand dollar fine , and loses their licence for a mandatory minimum of one year .
If one is picked up a second time , there is a mandatory minimum 30 days in jail and a mandatory loss of licence for two years minimum .
If one is picked up a third time , as per section 255 . ( 1 ) ( a ) , there is mandatory minimum of 120 days in jail and one loses their licence for three years .
Beyond that , our mandatory minimum regime in the Criminal Code under impairment says it is an extra 120 days each time and an extra three years for which one loses their license .
Honourable senators can figure it out :
If a fellow has been caught 10 times — not 20 times — he has lost his license for 30 years .
( Debate suspended . )
The Hon. the Speaker : Honourable senators , I wish to draw your attention to the presence in the gallery of His Excellency Ban Ki-moon , Secretary - General of the United Nations .
On behalf of all senators , I welcome you to the Senate of Canada .
Hon .
Senators : Hear , hear !
On the Order :
Resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Wallace , seconded by the Honourable Senator Mockler , for the second reading of Bill S - 10 , An Act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts .
Hon. George Baker : Honourable senators , I was at the point where one had lost their licence for 30 years .
I am talking about MMs — not the candy M&M's , but the mandatory minimums , as they are called .
One would have lost their licence for 30 years and been in jail for five and a half years in that 10 - year period .
Therefore , how could one be out driving in order to have another 10 convictions ?
Of course , the answer to the question is found in the clause that is contained in this bill .
Unfortunately , in my opinion — and in a great many other people 's opinion — the provision should not be present as far as impaired driving convictions are concerned , but it is .
Let me read the sentence so that there will be no doubt about it .
It is also in this provision , clause 8 of the bill .
It says this :
The court is not required to impose a minimum punishment unless it is satisfied that the offender , before entering a plea , was notified of the possible imposition of a minimum punishment for the offence in question and of the Attorney General 's intention to prove any factors in relation to the offence that would lead to the imposition of a minimum punishment .
That is the Attorney General and the Crown prosecutor for the province .
In the bill we are dealing with , it is a Crown prosecutor for the federal government .
It is a federal Crown .
In most cases , one will find a federal Crown and a provincial Crown if there is a mixture of charges .
The point is that there is such a thing as prosecutorial discretion , which is built into every single act that we have , in one way or another , regarding mandatory minimum sentences .
The first thing we have to realize is that in the case of mandatory minimums , in certain circumstances they differ from province to province .
There is a prosecutor 's manual in every single province .
It is not the same in every province .
For example , in Ontario , what is considered to be a dated offence — that is , out of date — is beyond five years .
If one has a conviction , say , for impaired driving more than five years old , the prosecutor has discretion as to whether or not to enter it under their rules .
That is not present in Newfoundland .
In Newfoundland , if one had a prior conviction 20 years ago , that is a prior conviction .
There is no such thing as a dated impaired driving conviction .
Having made that point concerning the main point of the government as far as mandatory minimums are concerned , my chief problem with this bill , honourable senators , is a provision that has nothing to do with mandatory minimums .
I will tell you what it is .
It is a scary provision .
I realize that the Liberals in the other place have supported this legislation .
Let us not forget this .
The Liberals in the other place support this legislation , as do the Conservatives .
However , this is sober second thought in this chamber .
That is what we are known for .
I will tell you about the scary provision that I find in this legislation , honourable senators .
It will take me just a second to do it , and I will illustrate it with a couple of cases within the past year concerning university students .
The first one was in December 2009 , Carswell B.C. , 644 .
I quote :
[ 1 ]
The accused is charged with one count of trafficking in ecstasy . . . . [ 2 ] . . . he gave one ecstasy pill to an undercover officer , Cst. Haines , at a Rave event at the Pacific Coliseum . [ 5 ] . . .
Cst. Haines , pretending to be a party - goer , dressed up for the event .
Then it goes on to describe how she was dressed — this is an undercover police officer — which I will not read .
She did have a mini skirt on , cowboy boots and so on .
She had to do that , of course , because she was on an undercover job at this dance .
It happens in every city in Canada , these undercover operations take place .
( 1440 )
Here is the third sentence , paragraph 9 and 10 :
Cst :
Do you have some stuff for me ?
Acc : No , let 's dance .
I 'll get it for you later .
Cst : Uh No. I need it now .
I want to be happy now .
Acc :
Ok wait here , do n't move .
Cst : Ok I 'll be here .
This is the judge speaking :
The accused left and walked back towards the main stage area , disappearing into the crowd .
He re-appeared some 3 minutes later and placed a rolled up paper into the constable 's hand .
There was an ecstasy pill inside the paper .
There was a brief conversation .
Cst : Oh wow , thanks .
How much ?
Acc :
Oh nothing , for you free .
Cst : Oh wow , really ?
You 're a sweetie .
Thanks .
The constable then gave the accused a hug .
She signalled the arrest team to indicate that a transaction had occurred .
Then it says :
The accused was taken into custody .
He was handcuffed , searched and then brought to jail .
The second case , which I will just read two sentences from , is 2009 Carswell B.C. 3405 .
This is testimony from a police officer .
How often does this happen ?
Paragraph 7 :
Prior to this Rave , Constable Kinney had acted as an undercover buy - officer at three prior Raves .
It was her experience and opinion that drugs , in particular ecstasy and Raves were closely associated .
Paragraph 12 :
Prior to Project Twilliger , Detective Kazuta had been involved with " Project Temporal " deployed to a Coliseum Rave on December 31 , 2004 , which resulted in ten arrests for trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking .
In 2005 , he was involved with " Project Thirst " deployed to a Rave at the Coliseum , which resulted in 13 arrests for trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking .
Finally , " Project Tirana " , which was deployed to a Rave at the Coliseum on December 31 , 2007 , and resulted in 11 trafficking arrests and six arrests for possession for the purpose of trafficking .
Honourable senators , all of those cases involved the exchange of a pill or two pills .
In half the cases , no money was exchanged .
You might say that is only the Pacific Coliseum .
There is case law and there is a big arena in Calgary , Toronto , Montreal , Halifax , and the cases go on .
Why am I so concerned about this possibility ?
Obviously , you are not supposed to have illegal drugs .
You are not supposed to be using illegal drugs .
Honourable senators , just listen to the summary of this bill .
Herein lies the key .
Do not forget that over the years , as Senator Nolin would attest , we have been careful to structure the schedules to the Narcotics Act and the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act so that cocaine and heroin are Schedule I drugs .
Marijuana derivatives , et cetera , are Schedule II drugs .
In Schedule III are what are considered to be the less serious drugs .
This bill eliminates Schedule III and brings everything in Schedule III up to life imprisonment in Schedule I .
This is an interesting question , and one that I am sure will be debated in the committee .
What is wrong with that ?
I will tell you what is wrong with it .
Without a massive advertising campaign , here is what will happen .
I am not too concerned about someone who is charged under a provision that now says that if you give one ecstasy pill to someone , it is life imprisonment ; you are in that category .
It is not being in the category of risk of life imprisonment ; it is not that .
However , what is concerning in the law regarding controlled drugs , as Senator Nolin would tell you , is that when you are convicted of an offence for which life imprisonment is a possibility , other parts of the Criminal Code come into play .
For example , conditions of release carry with them 10 - year prohibitions .
Anyone convicted of this offence after the passage of the bill would have a 10 - year prohibition , for example , on the ownership or use of a firearm .
Let us use that as an example .
Suppose you were convicted and that after you served your sentence , you came out and had to serve a 10 - year conditional sentence .
Suppose you wanted to get a pardon .
Senator Stewart Olsen : No pardons .
Senator Baker :
There is legislation coming in to that effect .
You would normally wait five to six years — this is the law — before you can apply for a pardon .
You have someone , just on one condition , waiting 15 years .
Suppose it is a university student , waiting 15 years before he or she can even receive consideration for a pardon , all for exchanging an ecstasy pill with someone .
This is a young university student in that situation at a rave dance .
My point is that I would say the bill will pass .
The bill will pass because the Liberals agree with it and the PCs agree with it in the other place .
The bill will pass .
However , honourable senators , surely we can do something to say that we need an advertising campaign .
We need to alert these young people that what they did last year is no longer acceptable because they could end up facing a charge of life imprisonment , have their life ruined , never be able to get a job , never be able to go to the United States or any foreign nation , because that is the condition of their conviction .
That is the main point I wanted to make , and it is a very important point ; it is one of the main subjects of the bill .
The summary of this bill says :
This enactment amends the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to provide for minimum penalties for serious drug offences , to increase the maximum penalty for cannabis ( marijuana ) production and to reschedule certain substances from Schedule III to that Act to Schedule I .
When you look at the substances , you would never know it is something called ecstasy .
It consists of about 50 letters and it starts with " N - Phenyl , " something , something , something .
Believe me , I have read enough case law to know that that is the drug I just referred to , which is ecstasy .
Others of those drugs that are in Schedule III are there for a specific purpose , and at the time the schedules were invented and added on to , they were not considered to be Schedule I drugs .
Honourable senators , that is the main point that I want to make .
I wish to make just one observation concerning mandatory minimum sentences .
I served in the House of Commons for many years .
The House of Commons did a thorough study on mandatory minimum sentences , the only study ever done .
It is the only complete study on the record .
( 1450 )
The conclusion at page 70 says the committee does not generally support the introduction of further minimum sentences beyond murder , high treason and also the repeat of sexual offences .
It was a conclusion of a House of Commons committee in 1988 .
I remember it well ; I had been in the house 15 years at that time .
An Hon. Senator : Who was on the committee ?
Senator Baker : Honourable senators , I will not say that Senator Nolin knows the answer , but the chair of the committee was David Daubney and the report is referred to as the Daubney report .
Mr. Daubney is a great lawyer and has a great legal mind .
I know him well ; he is a good friend of mine .
Where does he work now ?
He works with the Department of Justice , I believe in the minister 's office , but I wonder who was the vice - chair of the committee ?
The Honourable Rob Nicholson , P.C. Thank you very much .
( On motion of Senator Nolin , debate adjourned . )
On the Order :
Resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator MacDonald , seconded by the Honourable Senator Duffy , for the second reading of Bill S - 5 , An Act to amend the Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , 1999 .
Hon. Terry M. Mercer : Honourable senators , I am afraid I will not be as entertaining as Senator Baker , but of course not many of us are .
Honourable senators , it is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to second reading of Bill S - 5 , an act to amend the Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , 1999 .
As Senator MacDonald has aptly and in detail given you much information surrounding this bill , I will not speak for long on this subject .
Honourable senators , the basic premise of the bill concerns the importation of used vehicles into Canada from Mexico .
We are told the reason for this bill is so that Canada can bring itself into line with its obligations under NAFTA .
As a result , certain provisions must be changed in the two acts previously mentioned in order that these vehicles meet our stringent rules on the environment and safety .
I think all honourable senators can agree that we want to continue to protect the environment and the safety of all Canadians .
We have gone through this process before as we had to bring ourselves in line with similar provisions with the United States .
Now it is Mexico 's turn .
In the current Motor Vehicle Safety Act , there are provisions that allow for the importation of used vehicles that do not live up to Canadian standards from the United States on the condition that the buyer declares at registration that the vehicle has been improved to meet our standards .
The buyer must prove this when he or she attempts to register the vehicle for use .
Bill S - 5 contains similar provisions for vehicles from Mexico .
The changes contained in Bill S - 5 to the Canadian Environmental Protection
Act acts in the same way .
Both amendments contained in Bill S - 5 provide for the creation of the regulations required to meet both safety and environmental standards .
It is important to note that we are not talking about the importation of new vehicles or even parts .
We are talking about older vehicles .
Honourable senators , how many vehicles can we expect to come into Canada as a result of this bill ?
I am told minimal to none .
Thus , my first thought was why are we acting so quickly ?
Several other questions have evolved from my discussions with officials .
What are the levels of environmental standards for those types of cars in Canada as compared to those in the United States and Mexico ?
What differences , if any , exist ?
What are the similarities and differences in safety standards ?
I have other questions regarding other countries and the number of used vehicles we import from them .
I have questions concerning the rules surrounding such imports .
One group pushing for these changes is the Imported Vehicle Owners Association of Canada .
I can only hope that they will be contacted and asked to appear before our committee .
I would also like to hear how the changes to these acts will affect the provincial regulations as the provinces are responsible for the registration of all vehicles .
We are told that they have no problems with the changes , but it would still be interesting to hear what they would have to do .
Honourable senators , I am optimistic as to the answers to these various questions I have concerning this bill .
For that reason , I support passing the bill for second reading in order that it can be studied by the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications .

On the Order :
Resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Tardif , seconded by the Honourable Senator Rivest , for the second reading of Bill C - 232 , An Act to amend the Supreme Court Act ( understanding the official languages ) .
Hon. Grant Mitchell : Honourable senators , I am pleased to speak at second reading of Bill C - 232 , which has to do with the linguistic qualifications of Supreme Court judges .
I very much appreciated Senator Tardif 's clear and inspirational speech on equal rights in Canada .
I also found Senator Carignan 's speech very interesting .
When Senator Carignan spoke yesterday , I imagined him as a lawyer , pleading a case in French before the Supreme Court .
Ironically , he might not be understood at the Supreme Court , because some judges do not speak French .
This issue is interesting on two levels .
The first is regarding the administration of justice and the distressing number of candidates who will have the legal and linguistic qualifications .
The second is the issue of the fundamental principles of an officially bilingual Canada .
These are two solid arguments , and they are important and valid .
It is clearly essential for Supreme Court judges to have very high qualifications .
Our fear is that there will not be enough candidates who have these qualifications .
In Western Canada , specifically , there is a feeling that there will not be enough lawyers who understand French .
However , the idea of judges who understand both official languages is tied to the — perhaps less practical , but more important — principle of Canadian values .
We have made progress since 1969 , when we declared Canada to be a bilingual country .
We can be proud of our progress .
But we still have work to do .
We have to keep looking for ways to improve bilingualism .
The Supreme Court is an institution that is essential to our nation .
Not promoting bilingualism would be a serious mistake .
We need to do what leaders must always do : make a list of priority issues , figure out which one is the most important and work on solving the problems .
I think we should give bilingualism precedence over qualifications .
I believe that fear of bilingualism will disappear once it is clear that expectations have changed .
Yes , I realize that some lawyers and many law students will have to learn a second language , and I know that is hard to do , as those listening to me now can tell .
However Canadians are often called upon to defend and promote this country 's principles and values .
I do not think it is too much to ask if we want to achieve our greatest hopes for this country and its judges .
This is a question of fairness and justice for all Canadian citizens .
I should continue in French , perhaps , but I can express myself more clearly if I switch to English .
[ English ]
It is a question of competing priorities .
There are two legitimate sides to this debate .
You can not always say that is the case .
However , in this case , I believe that we should prioritize the broader principle , the principle that addresses the very nature , character and heart of Canada and Canadians , and that is our bilingual and bicultural nation .
That is an essential quality of what we are as Canadians .
It makes us different in the world .
Of course , we must attend to the administration of justice and ensure that we have the benefit of the best possible jurists that we can find for the Supreme Court of Canada .
Some have raised a possible problem in that we may not have enough lawyers who have full bilingual comprehension and understanding .
I am not convinced .
That problem is within our power and their power to fix .
It is the same old argument .
I think of 22 years ago when courts were being restructured .
The Supreme Court could not be restructured because we would never be able to find the people .
It is the same argument that was made 40 years ago when this all started .
We would never be able to find the qualified people .
You know what ?
We have and we do .
It is certainly possible for jurists of the quality and level of intelligence of candidates for the Supreme Court to learn a second language and to learn it very well .
That is the ultimate solution .
If we continue as we do , we get the worst of both possible worlds .
The ultimate solution is to adhere to the value , character and principle of bilingualism , promote it and have lawyers learn how to speak French .
They will .
They want to do it .
Law faculties that want to become the best in the country will begin to teach their students French so that they , one day , can have people aspire to being jurists in the top court in the land .
I think the problem will quite readily and quickly begin to take care of itself .
Why is it that we cannot think on the grander scale about this issue ?
Why can we not think about how much Canada is and how much more Canada can be ?
If we begin to take for granted principles like bilingualism , which is at the heart of who we are , those principles can slip away .
We should always be trying to find occasions , cases and ways to promote them .
This proposal is a perfect way to promote that important principle .
It is symbolic , yes , because it says to all Canadians that bilingualism matters deeply to us .
It is also important because it will assist us ultimately in delivering justice even more effectively because we will have people who can speak both languages .
I do not think that is too much to ask from Canadians .
We ask all kinds of things of Canadians .
I think of the sacrifices , effort , work and commitment that have gone into building this country to the state and level that it is today .
We can certainly ask lawyers in this country to learn French or English so that they can work in the highest court in the land in both official languages .
I do not think it is too much to ask at all .
It is an easy vote , and I am voting yes for this bill .
I am from Alberta , from the West .
I love Alberta deeply .
I love the West .
I have felt there have been times when it needed to be listened to and understood better .
I also know that Quebec and francophones outside of Quebec have made this country special .
They are one of the reasons this country is special .
There are many reasons , but they are a particularly important one .
They have made us different than the United States .
That has been very important for what we are as a country and how we define ourselves as different from the United States .
( 1510 )
Francophones have made us multicultural and , because we value that culture so much , we have had to pay recognition to other cultures .
When people from around the world view Canada , do you know what they see ?
They see a multicultural , bilingual nation they aspire to emulate .
People all around this world do so because of our tolerance , understanding , acceptance and the way we live together .
This bill can be one more powerful step in ascending that staircase to what can be the best , most perfect country in the world .

On the Order :
Resuming debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Segal calling the attention of the Senate to the seriousness of the problem posed by contraband tobacco in Canada , its connection with organized crime , international crime and terrorist financing , including the grave ramifications of the illegal sale of these products to young people , the detrimental effects on legitimate small business , the threat on the livelihoods of hardworking convenience store owners across Canada , and the ability of law enforcement agencies to combat those who are responsible for this illegal trade throughout Canada , and the advisability of a full - blown Senate committee inquiry into these matters .
Hon . Hugh Segal : Honourable senators , I rise to speak to the inquiry standing in my name on contraband tobacco .
I do so because I believe that the nature of our democracy is such that the rule of law — laws passed in this place and , more importantly , by the elected House of Commons and legislatures across Canada — is essential to both public order and individual freedom .
When laws come into disrepute or when laws are corrupted or intimidated into impotence and have no effect , none among us are safe .
If the illegal importation , sale , financing , manufacture , distribution and export of tobacco is not addressed , what other illegal acts are we , by extrapolation , also tolerating ?
Are we tolerating the illegal smuggling of children for prostitution ; the illegal importation of counterfeit pharmaceuticals ; the illegal violation of copyright laws established to protect intellectual property ?
Let us here and now dispel the notion of illegal contraband tobacco being a victimless crime .
The honest storekeepers across Canada , who follow the federal government 's " anti-kiddie " tobacco product law and provincial regulations , know , as do school principals , parents and teachers in neighbouring high schools , that millions of illegal cigarettes arrived on school property moments after the federal law came into effect .
Therefore , more kids are smoking what are now profoundly cheaper illegal flavoured tobacco products .
These products were shown to the Senate committee by the union leader for the Benson & Hedges employees in Quebec City .
It was the very committee that considered the new law some months ago .
Honourable senators , 2,300 of these honest storekeepers in Quebec and Ontario alone have been put out of business , in part , as a result of this new federal law .
Bill C - 32 , with all our involvement and implication , put honest , small business storekeepers out of work , while increasing the criminal take for criminal gangs as well as illegal manufacture of " kiddie " tobacco .
How is that , honourable senators , for a perverse outcome from well - intended legislation ?
It is reminiscent of Prime Minister Chrétien 's decision , also well intended , to fight smuggling by reducing the excise tax on tobacco , thereby reducing the incentive to smuggle .
Smuggling did slow down for a while and , by the reading of various health promotion and anti-tobacco analysts , tens of thousands of young girls in this country took up smoking , as an appetite suppressant or just to " be cool , " because they could afford to do so .
Talk about federal tax policy increasing the death rate from cancer in years to come !
That perverse outcome is worse than the one I mentioned a moment ago .
Both these federal initiatives were well intentioned and based on sound bureaucratic and / or police advice .
However , surely the perverse consequences of these initiatives , by both Liberal and Conservative prime ministers , need to be assessed in the harsh light of day .
( 1520 )
In preparing for this intervention , I spoke to First Nations leadership , undercover police investigators and uniformed officers now involved in border and related area patrols .
I spoke with these people informally and not in a comprehensive way .
I also heard from a range of organizations — usually opposed to each other — that have united in support of the idea of a full - fledged Senate or public inquiry into the illegal tobacco trade .
They included : the Association of Local Public Health Agencies ; the Canadian Cancer Society ; the Frontier Duty Free Association ; the Ontario Korean Businessmen 's Association ; the Canadian Medical Association ; the Canadian Convenience Stores Association ; the Bakery , Confectionary , Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union ; and the Non-Smokers ' Rights Association .
What have I learned ?
I have learned that in the absence of a firm Criminal Code provision on illegal transport , distribution or manufacture of tobacco , all that allows police to intervene is the Excise Act , whose penalties encompass only seizure of goods or fines .
This means that the penalties for those found to be engaged in this activity frankly make the risk quite rewarding .
When a young student in the Brantford area can fill an old " beater " car with illegal tobacco and drive home to Newfoundland for the Easter holidays and receive $ 8,500 in cash for that mission , the risks under the Excise Act are not a sufficient deterrent .
This makes the task for our police — federal , provincial and municipal — almost impossible .
At one level — and this echoes the concerns of Prime Minister Chrétien — police and criminal intelligence cannot be sure about what arms exist at the point of manufacture and dispatch .
No police force wants a Waco Texas - type circumstance over illegal tobacco .
However , those same police know and have seen that illegal contraband cash , which is unbelievably lucrative , leads to drugs , prostitution , arms sales and importation , pornography and the kinds of crimes that attack thousands of victims in Canada daily .
Our provincial police forces , the RCMP , the Sûreté du Québec or the Ontario Provincial Police — usually have to act in provincial jurisdictions under the Highway Traffic Act .
This means that even if police have intelligence that a truck leaving the Hill Island Canada - U.S. border is stuffed with illegal contraband tobacco , if the vehicle is in good repair , driving within the speed limit , has no excess exhaust and is not otherwise in violation of the Highway Traffic
Act , they have no reason to pull it over .
When police do pull over the vehicle , the only penalties available to the Crown attorney , should the driver be charged , are under the Excise Act .
People are often bailed out within the hour by people who may have Russian , American , Hispanic or Middle Eastern accents .
Cash is no problem for the alleged offenders .
The U.K has been running an information campaign directed to the people who buy smuggled tobacco products .
The ads point out that while people save a little money , the proceeds of the funds go to many dangerous people and organizations .
International terrorist financing networks as well as hard drug pushers , importers of illegal immigrants and prostitutes — often entrapped themselves — are clearly identified in the U.K. advertising effort as beneficiaries of low - priced cigarettes .
When I last spoke in this chamber on this issue in December 2009 , I put some suggestions on the record , to wit : First , prohibit the supply or transport of raw materials , including raw leaf tobacco , papers , filters and cardboard for packaging to anyone without a valid and legal tobacco manufacturing licence , and do so explicitly by Criminal Code description .
Second , initiate discussions with First Nations implicated in any of this activity for a tax - sharing agreement in return for the lawful licensing of manufacturing plants on their land .
Third , identify specific Criminal Code provisions that give all our police agencies more with which to work when smugglers , the financiers of smuggling and the criminal networks that manage this illegal system are identified .
As criminal biker gangs throughout Canada are involved in this illegal trade , solicitors general should issue memoranda of enforcement to encourage Crown attorneys to prosecute smugglers and purveyors as associates of criminal conspiracies associated with criminal biker gangs with whom any association is now specifically illegal .
Honourable senators , no individual senator can do justice to this file .
It is my strongest and most respectful recommendation to the leadership of both the government and the opposition in this chamber that a joint proposal for a special committee inquiry into illegal contraband tobacco , costs , remedies and best possible responses be initiated as soon as possible .
I have not introduced such a motion because I understand that the leadership on both sides need to come to the conclusion I suggest today before such a suggestion is likely to be productive .
It is also my hope that other honourable senators may choose to contribute their own wisdom and perspective on this complex issue .
Honourable senators , I heard from a uniformed enforcement officer about how helpless he feels when a large shipment of tobacco is found and police are powerless to do more than seize and fine .
I heard from undercover agents who , when contacting an illegal purveyor as part of a large undercover investigation , could barely hear what the target of the investigation said on the phone because of the deafening noise of multiple currency - counting machines in the background at the transhipment point under surveillance .
I also heard from former police officers who worry that , if sent in to enforce the law on First Nation 's territory with the help of engaged and professional First Nations police that are doing their best on this difficult file , should shots be exchanged , political authorities will not stand behind police trying to do their job when the ensuing controversy arises .
Honourable senators , with young people picking up cigarettes cheaper than ever before from illegal sources ; with governments losing multi-billion dollar tax revenues annually that are more desperately needed than ever ; with the costs of tobacco use faced by our health care system ; with young people embroiled in tobacco addiction for entire and , by definition , foreshortened lives ; and with billions flowing to criminal networks engaged in everything from cyber fraud , arms dealing and terrorist funding to illegal immigration and prostitution conspiracies , this is not a victimless crime .
This may be the crime with the largest number of victims of any crime committed in this country .
I hope other honourable senators in this chamber will speak when they can to this inquiry .
I also hope our leadership on both sides of the aisle find a way to work together so that an existing or special committee might be tasked with a full - blown inquiry where evidence and testimony can be gathered in the open and upon which governments can finally act .
It is easy , honourable senators , to look away from contraband tobacco as simply one of those things by which we should not be troubled .
However , honourable senators , consider this :
If we do not act , we avert our eyes from an illegal activity that harms young people , reduces tax revenues , hurts First Nations , hurts the credibility of the police , harms our health care system and population health , hurts small business and hurts the very integrity of our borders .
That illegal activity enriches criminal biker networks , illegal manufacturers and terrorist , prostitution and illegal drug networks .
These are networks that use illegal arms to prey upon and , when necessary , simply eradicate citizens who stand in their way .
If we permit all of this to happen , we are saying that the rule of law — fundamental to how a democracy balances freedom and order — is actually negotiable , or worse , a side - car afterthought .
None among us , who use a mirror to shave in the morning , put on makeup or straighten our tie or hair , would ever , under any circumstance , wish to be associated with that kind of abdication of responsibility .

Hon. Patrick Brazeau rose pursuant to notice of April 20 , 2010 :
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the issue of accountability , transparency and responsibility in Canada 's Aboriginal Affairs .
He said : Honourable senators , I rise to call the attention of the Senate to the matter of accountability , transparency and responsibility in the undertaking and delivery of Canada 's Aboriginal affairs .
There are certain factions within Canada 's Aboriginal community which continue to take issue with Canada 's treatment of its indigenous peoples .
We hear , time and again , litanies of how the federal government stole our lands ; how our cultures were taken away from us ; how foreign systems of governance were imposed upon us ; and how Canada purposefully sought to assimilate us in the interests of colonialism and shackled us to Indian reserves .
These grievances are entirely legitimate .
The important question that needs to be answered is , how do we immeasurably improve the socio-economic conditions of Canada 's most disadvantaged citizens ?
While we surely cannot change the horrible past , we can certainly help to shape a better future .
While these views are hardly pervasive , they do speak to a malaise and to an undercurrent in Canadian society which dispossesses the impact of native history in Canada 's development .
While the descendents of the French and the British lay claim to building this nation , there is scarce little recognition of the very real fact that First Nations were here long before the Europeans arrived , and that they played a significant role in the settlement of what is now known as Canada .
While the descendants of these settlers have thrived , what is it , honourable senators , that continues to elude Canada 's Aboriginal peoples in their quest to stake their rightful claim to Canada 's success and take their rightful place in Canada 's society ?
Honourable senators , what is the key to ending the nihilism ?
What can be done to help identify the prescription for success ?
I believe there is a fundamental and systemic need for greater accountability and responsibility in Canada 's Aboriginal affairs .
I am convinced that this issue is at the heart of the problem as Canada 's Aboriginal community grapples with unrelenting poverty and lack of opportunity ; and I seek , honourable senators , to inform this chamber — and through it , the public at large — on the factors that contribute to this truly human drama .
Attempting to effectively address this issue has been a significant pursuit of successive federal governments for the past nearly 40 years .
In order to get a better understanding of tackling this challenge today , it is important to understand the Aboriginal population and the machinery of government through which it is served .
According to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada , the Aboriginal identity population reached just below 1.2 million in 2006 .
Of this , 53 per cent are registered or status Indians , 30 per cent are Metis , 11 per cent are non-status Indians , and 4 per cent are Inuit .
In total , the Aboriginal identity population represents 4 per cent of the Canadian population .
Over half — 54 per cent of Aboriginal people — reside in urban areas , compared to 81 per cent for the non-Aboriginal population .
In major cities , the concentration of Aboriginal people is highest in Winnipeg , at 10 per cent , followed by Regina and Saskatoon at 9 per cent .
Perhaps most telling is the fact that 48 per cent of Aboriginal people are less than 25 years old , while it is 31 per cent for non- Aboriginal peoples .
The median age of the Aboriginal population is 27 years , compared to 40 years for non-Aboriginals .
From a legislative perspective , under section 91 ( 24 ) of the British North America Act , federal jurisdiction was granted for " Indians , and lands reserved for the Indians . "
This changes , however , once one leaves an Indian reserve .
Off - reserve Indians are deemed to be under provincial jurisdiction , although there is no clear iteration of this in any policy or legislation .
Federal investments in the domain of Aboriginal affairs amount to over $ 10 billion annually and are spread across approximately 30 federal departments .
Given this , there can be no denying the sincere and evident desire of the federal government in its attempts to invest in Canada 's Aboriginal peoples .
The political will is there , to be sure .
However , let us examine the machinery of government and the application of the investments in and around Aboriginal public policy .
The principle engine of the machinery of government in respect of Aboriginal public policy is Indian and Northern Affairs Canada , INAC .
In its role , INAC is intended to support Canada 's Aboriginal peoples in their efforts to improve social well - being and economic prosperity , develop healthier , more sustainable communities and participate more fully in Canada 's political , social and economic development to the benefit of all Canadians .
Let us take a closer look at the spending of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada .
It is the fifth largest department in the federal bureaucracy .
Its total budget is approximately $ 7 billion per year , representing over 3.4 per cent of the overall budgetary Main Estimates for the federal government 's 2009 - 10 fiscal year .
It is important to bear in mind again that there is an additional $ 3 billion - plus in annual federal Aboriginal spending over the other 29 departments from which Aboriginal programs and services flow .
The legislation under which First Nations are governed is the Indian Act , which was enacted in 1876 .
Some might say that this statute sought to protect Aboriginal peoples ' interests through law ; however , it was anything but protective .
Its intended purpose was to assimilate and " get rid of the Indian problem . "
Honourable senators , if chamber rules permitted , I could speak for days about the prescriptive and colonial provisions of this act .
Suffice it to say that this act is the cornerstone of First Nations ' suffering that has been perpetuated for 134 years .
Under the Indian Act , chiefs and band councils answer only to the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada .
There is no legislative basis for any accountability by them to the citizens living in over 600 communities .
The chiefs and band councils gain all of their authority and power via the Indian Act , without having to assume any mantle of accountability or responsibility for their community members .
For example , chiefs and councils control the allocation and assignation of post - secondary education monies .
They deem who does and does not receive it .
In addition , there is no legislative or administrative basis which compels them to provide any accounting to any citizen who requests information on such expenditures .
When a band member moves off the reserve , they have little or no access to certain rights , privileges and / or benefits .
This happens even though their communities receive funding for them .
That is problem number one .
Now that we have an understanding of the issues of governance , let us return to the matter of funding these over 600 communities .
Of INAC 's $ 7 billion , the vast majority of these funds , almost 83 per cent or $ 5.8 billion — or for a greater point of reference , nearly 20 per cent of the federal government 's voted transfer payments — flow directly through to these chiefs and band councils .
These payments fund community infrastructure , education and social assistance .
In addition to this , there are other pots of funding for such things as post - secondary education , economic development , claims and self - government , among other things .
In December 2008 , INAC 's Chief Audit and Evaluation Executive commissioned the Institute on Governance to conduct a special study of INAC 's funding arrangements and accountabilities .
Its purpose was , among other things , to establish the extent to which accountability provisions in these arrangements were appropriate and effective in achieving the accountability and reporting needs of First Nations , as well as those of Parliament and Canadians .
The study results found indications that accountability is not working well .
Specifically , there was no reporting or inadequate reporting on performance ; there was no serious , informed review of the information reported ; or there were no appropriate program changes or consequences for poor performance .
Therefore , how may we determine the return upon investments or results against plan , or gain any idea of the extent to which progress is achieved ?
Further , this situation illustrates that there are accountability issues not only within First Nations , but also in the administrative framework of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada , which oversees them .
That is problem number two .
Given such difficulties , invariably some First Nations run into financial difficulties , and intervention by the department is required .
These actions of intervention occur on three levels : Recipient managed is a low - level of intervention applied when a recipient is determined to have both the willingness and capacity to resolve the difficulties that gave rise to the default .
Co- management is a moderate level of intervention applied when a recipient is determined to have the willingness but lacks the capacity to resolve the difficulties that gave rise to the default .
Third party management is the highest level of intervention applied when a recipient is determined to lack both the willingness and the capacity to resolve the difficulties that gave rise to the default .

Honourable senators , let us examine this troubling area in order to illuminate the extent of the problem .
In ever - increasing numbers , First Nations find themselves in deficit positions as a result of poor recordkeeping and lack of adherence to budgets .
Deficits are the result of a number of factors , including poor or no budget preparation and inadequate accounting systems and procedures to track expenditures and allocate them to the appropriate projects .
A key contributor to this situation is the lack of adequate leadership and accountability from chiefs and band councils to ensure that records are kept appropriately and that funds are expended according to budgets .
In many cases , government accountability and control are not understood by band accounting staff and the required systems are seldom implemented .
In fairness , a big part of the problem is that many of the government 's accountability and control requirements are often not fully understood by the government staff responsible for the management and control of the funds .
Budgets are not reviewed and approved in advance of funding ; and , as we have seen , accountability for the results of spending is often not evaluated .
Thus , audit costs soar and what little accountability there is tends to be in terms of expenditure allocation demonstrated only at year end .
Throughout the fiscal year , interim reporting to government funders is often inaccurate , contrived or incomplete .
As a consequence , the transparency expected by the government in the reporting of band operations is seldom achieved .
Cultural conflicts , community politics and peer pressure are also factors contributing to financial difficulties in certain First Nations communities .
There are many examples of residents working in the band office being unable to break away from the welfare mentality as a result of the pressure from the rest of the community .
It is important to note that most communities are made up of a handful of families and , in the spirit of nepotism , the families of the chief and key councillors are often favoured with administrative job positions ahead of more capable persons from other family groups .
The effects of these factors include increased year - end audit costs , suspension of funding as a result of late or inadequate reporting and precious little demonstration of accountability .
With this perceived lack of capacity , INAC 's next step is to demand that a First Nation in financial difficulty appoint a co-manager selected by the band council to assist in the day - to - day operations of its finances .
However , in situations where a band has accumulated deficits exceeding 8 per cent of its INAC funding , the department has established a requirement that control of the band 's finances be removed from the chief and council and handed over to an INAC - appointed , third - party manager .
The selection of a third - party manager is made by an INAC tender issued to a restricted list of INAC - approved suppliers that have met the department 's specific standards .
Honourable senators , permit me to be frank .
Third - party management is a temporary and distasteful solution to the accountability problem .
It is an expensive solution that costs anywhere from $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 per month per community .
It takes much of the band 's autonomy away from the chief and council , causes tension between the band and government and has a number of side effects that result in a deteriorating relationship between Aboriginal people and the federal government .
However , it is often the only remedy available to force a community to adhere to its budget and to dig itself out of debt .
This is especially important given that much of the debt run up in such situations is to local suppliers and businesses whose livelihoods depend on those bills being paid .
Where third - party managers have been placed in control of communities for financial reasons , the eventual result is generally that First Nations are handed back a balanced set of books with a deficit reduced to within tolerable limits .
This is the result of the development and implementation of a remedial management plan that restricts expenditures in programs , generates surpluses and uses such surpluses to pay down accumulated debts .
When officials are questioned about the number of communities operating under third - party management , the lack of accurate data is readily and alarmingly apparent .
As I just pointed out , departmental guidelines are specific about the conditions under which third - party management is mandated .
The financial condition of Canada 's 630 reserve communities is reported by the auditors of those communities to INAC on an annual basis .
In the meantime within INAC , each community is assigned a funding services officer who is paid to monitor the financial condition of the First Nations and to provide guidance and assistance to band management in handling their funding .
It is the responsibility of these officials to evaluate the financial health of the communities under their watch .
Equally , it is the responsibility of the regional intervention committee to recommend to regional management the imposition of third - party management as indicated by the established criteria laid down by INAC headquarters .
As proven by audit findings , it is clear that INAC 's guidelines for intervention are not being followed .
Regional management appears to either be manipulating data or ignoring it in order to keep communities out of third - party management .
When I questioned a former third - party manager practicing in Manitoba on the topic , his response was :
I believe there are either 4 or 5 communities in Manitoba .
INAC ( Manitoba Region ) is working frantically to get them all out of Third Party Management .
They 're still doing the tricky " sole - signing authority co-management thing . "
This allows the Region to report to Ottawa that they have virtually no one under Third Party Management ( and thus officials collect their bonuses ) but essentially keep First Nations under Third Party Management .
I believe at last count roughly half of the 63 bands in Manitoba were either under Third Party Management , ( 4 or 5 in total ) and the rest ( about 25 or 30 First Nations ) were under co-management .
INAC requires that bands ' audited financial statements be posted so that all community members can have full and unfettered acce

This is a true story , it happened in Utah and was on the news !
I thought each of you could use a little comic relief today .
Here ’s the story .
A city councilman , Mark Easton , lives in this neighborhood .
He had a beautiful view of the east mountains , until a new neighbor purchased the lot below his house and built .
Apparently , the new home was 18 inches higher than the ordinances would allow , so Mark Easton , mad about his lost view , went to the city to make sure they enforced the lower roof line ordinance .
Mark and his new neighbor had some great arguments about this as you can imagine — not great feelings .
The new neighbor had to drop the roof line — no doubt at great expense .
Recently , Mark Easton called the city and informed them that his new neighbor had installed some vents on the side of his home .
Mark did n’t like the look of these vents and asked the city to investigate .
When they went to Mark ’s home to see the vent view , this is what they found … ( see attached pictures ) .
The origin of these amusing photographs is essentially as described above , something that arose over a dispute between neighbors in the southwest Salt Lake Valley , Utah , community of Riverton over an adjacent property owner ’s construction work on his home .
The conflict started in 2005 when Darren Wood excavated dirt from a hill on which the homes of his neighbors , Mark Easton and Stan Torgersen , sat .
The Eastons and Torgersens were concerned about the stability of the hill and contacted city officials , who ordered Wood to have a soil test performed .
Wood was disgruntled by the decision because the previous owner had already done a soil test , and performing it again would cost him $ 3,000 and delay his construction project by four months .
Then , when Wood began raising the frame for his house around mid-2006 , his neighbors were again concerned because the structure rose higher than the rooftops of the other homes around his lot and partially obstructed their view of nearby mountains .
Easton and Torgersen again asked city officials to intervene because they believed Wood ’s house exceeded the maximum height allowed by local building code .
Although Wood conceded that his house might have exceeded the height limit by about a foot , he was again disgruntled because he maintained that once the house was completed and the landscaping laid out , the home would fall within the code , and , in any case , the city had already approved his plans .
Feeling that he was being unfairly harrassed by his neighbors and upset that the construction interruptions they prompted had cost him an additional $ 25,000 , on 15 August 2006
Wood created a visible symbol of his displeasure by installing the vent covering pictured above , which he described as a decorative piece of “ abstract art ” representing a cactus .
His neighbors , of course , viewed the vent cover as a giant hand flipping them off , sending them back to city officials to complain about Wood ’s home for a third time .
Wood said he would remove the vent cover art if he received apologies from his neighbors .
When , a week later , Mark Easton “ expressed to him that I am sorry for any discomfort that I have caused his family or him , and that I had no intent to do any harm to him when I called the city with my concern about safety , ” Wood apparently found that sufficient and took down the controversial abstract “ cactus . ”
