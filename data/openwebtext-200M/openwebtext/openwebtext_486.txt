The Healer and the War Criminal The Double Life of Radovan Karadzic
For over a decade former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was one of the world 's most wanted men .
But instead of going underground , he sought a very public life -- even giving a talk on TV -- until the new government in Belgrade finally put an end to his strange new life .
Von Renate Flottau
Boone Pickens may be a fine man , and has played a colorful and useful role on the American stage for decades .
But his " energy plan , " which he 's spending a fortune to promote on cable TV , is not a plan .
Asserting that something would be good to do is not " a plan . "
Saying how to do it is " a plan . "
By this standard , what the legendary oil man is devoting $ 58 million to pitch hardly amounts to a decent slogan .

Overall alcohol use — particularly consumption of beer — is declining in the US , according to a new study published in the August 2008 issue of The American Journal of Medicine .
Researchers examined 50 years of data and found several changes in alcohol intake but no change in alcohol use disorders .
Americans are drinking significantly less beer and more wine , while hard liquor use has remained fairly constant .
More people now report that they are non-drinkers .
People born later in the 20th century drink more moderately than older people .
As we age , our individual alcohol consumption goes down .
Researchers examined 8,000 records of the Framingham Heart Study , the longest population - based study of American adults ever conducted , to measure alcohol consumption over 50 years .
Because the Framingham study recruited subjects that were born before 1900 until 1959 , it gives insights into behavior and medical histories through most of the 20th Century .
Subjects , both from the original cohort and from the children of the original cohort , have been interviewed every 4 years , from 1948 until 2003 .
Since each individual was followed directly , a set of histories of lifetime alcohol use could be captured .
While heavy alcohol use is associated with numerous bad outcomes , moderate consumption has been linked to improved cardiovascular health and to improved morbidity and mortality in the elderly .
This study shows that , on the whole , the American population is moving in a healthier direction .
Despite more favorable patterns of drinking , risk of alcohol dependence did not show a decrease .
The proportion of people who developed alcohol - related disorders , such as alcoholic cardiomyopathy or alcoholic cirrhosis remained nearly constant across all age groups .
Writing in the article , Yuqing Zhang , DSc , Boston University School of Medicine , and his co-investigators state , “ The findings in this study may be considered encouraging in many ways : the average amount of alcohol has decreased in more recently born cohorts , the percentage of the population exhibiting ‘ moderate ’ alcohol intake has been increasing steadily , and the percentage reporting ‘ heavy ’ drinking has decreased over time …
While these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century , that also show that , at the same time , the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease , and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted . ”

Now Destroying Mountains Once Merely Raped
I spent a lot of time in Eastern Kentucky growing up , it ’s where my paternal grandparents , Aunt and cousins lived and where we spent vacations no matter where else in the country ( or elsewhere ) we were living at the time ( Navy brat ) .
I ’ve no more relatives there , the last of them died a decade ago and none of us siblings chose to live there for raising our own families or even retiring in our old age .
I do recall several very nasty UMW strikes in the mining region around Harlan , and I recall the black moonscape on the Green River near Paducah ’s western shipping point that stretched as far as the eye could see in all directions , the coal tailings having turned a lovely rolling greenscape into utterly depressing nothing .
I also recall learning to shoot my father ’s beautiful pearl - handled six - guns at the abandoned strip mine near Laurel , and one touristy adventure in a no longer operating underground mine where we rode through in one of those little coal rail cars as if it were an amusement park ride .
These days they do things a little differently , as the deep seams get harder to work ( and miners become more rare , having been decimated by Black Lung ) and the easy seams have all been stripped .
Now they ’re going for the mid-seams , the last of the stored coal , by simply blowing up the entire mountain to get to it .
It ’s called Mountaintop Removal mining , and it ’s utterly devastating the southern Appalachians in the traditional coal mining regions of Tennessee , Kentucky and West Virginia .
It ’s a horror even worse than Mister Peabody ’s tailings outside Paducah .
It ’s destroyed ~500 whole mountains so far , it ’s polluting mountain streams that contribute to the primary water supplies for millions of people downstream , and it ’s killing the abundant biodiversity these mountains are so very famous for .
Most of all , for those of us who dearly love these gorgeous mountains , it ’s very , very tragic .
Some of the mines are as big as the Island of Manhattan .
When growing up with strong ties to Kentucky , I learned from my Aunt – a state social worker – that King Coal was an “ economic boom ” to the people who traditionally made their means by doing things for themselves with what the mountains provided .
Yet what I saw was crushing poverty , Black Lung , and a hopeless generation of young people who could n’t wait to get as far away from their family ’s traditional homesteads as possible .
It ’s not like the miners and their families got any of the great wealth King Coal brought to the mining companies , their stockholders and the industrial consumers of the coal taken out of their ground .
When my family determined to move back to the land 16 years ago to see if we could re-invent self - sufficiency and commune with nature instead of a million - plus other humans in immediate proximity , we chose Western North Carolina instead of Kentucky .
Or Tennessee .
Or West Virginia , or even Virginia ( the most perfectly beautiful and well - maintained state in the union , IMO ) .
We chose it for being Appalachia and beautiful ( tourism is our largest industry ) , for more sophisticated residents and politics , for then - reasonable land prices , and for not being enslaved to King Coal .
But alas , this is the land of Duke Energy , and a thriving piedmont and coast full of large energy consumers .
Turns out that North Carolina is the # 1 consumer of coal mined by means of Mountaintop Removal .
Thus I was greatly pleased when the NC State Legislature introduced a bill in May of 2008 to ban the use of coal mined by this method within the borders of our beautiful state !
There will be a lengthy legislative fight over the bill , but hope in the very fact that we did get a law back in 1983 banning development on high ridge lines – thereby destroying the mountain views from which a majority of residents make their living .
Because the mountains are a gold mine simply for their beauty , there is strong incentive to keep them beautiful .
I realize that many or most of my readers do n’t live in these mountains , but any of us who love the land and work hard to make our way lightly on this earth should get to know about how desperate the corporate evil - doers are to squeeze ( and blast ) the very last drop of profit from the earth , not caring how much irrevocable damage they do to it in the process .
Educate yourself about the issue by perusing some of the great links below .
Write to your state and federal representatives about your concerns , talk to activists about how to ban the burning of this ill - gotten coal in your state , and support some of these efforts to save the mountains .
Please !
If there is no market for this coal , King Coal has no reason to destroy the mountains .

North American Model Parliament
The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America is dead , says Robert A. Pastor , the American University professor who for more than a decade has been a major proponent of building a North American Community .
" The new president will probably discard the SPP , " Pastor wrote in an article titled " The Future of North America , " published in the current July / August issue of the Council on Foreign Relations magazine Foreign Affairs .
The SPP , which critics contend is a step toward a North American Union , is an agreement to increase cooperation on security and economic issues signed by the leaders of the U.S. , Mexico and Canada in 2005 .
Despite having no authorization from Congress , the Bush administration launched extensive working - group activity to implement the agreement .
The working groups – ranging from e-commerce , to aviation policy , to borders and immigration – have counterparts in Mexico and Canada .
" The April summit meeting was probably the last hurrah for the SPP , " Pastor wrote , referring to the fourth annual SPP meeting held in April in New Orleans .
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
Pastor attributes the failure of SPP to its largely bureaucratic nature and the decision policy makers made to keep SPP largely below the radar of public opinion .
" The strategy of acting on technical issues in an incremental , bureaucratic way and keeping the issues away from public view has generated more suspicion than accomplishments , " Pastor admitted .
Pastor blames critics for the failure of the SPP , charging it has come under attack from both ends of the political spectrum .
" From the right have come attacks based on cultural anxieties of being overrun by Mexican immigrants and fears that cooperation with Canada and Mexico could lead down a slippery slope toward a North American Union , " he wrote .
" From the left came attacks based on economic fears of jobs lost due to unfair trading practices . "
" These two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk - show hosts on radio and television , " he continued .
" In the face of this criticism , the Bush administration was silent , and the Democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust - belt states , where unions and many working people have come to see NAFTA and globalization much as ( commentator Lou ) Dobbs does . "
Pastor denied he had ever urged the creation of a North American Union .
" Dobbs , among others , viewed a report by a 2005 Council on Foreign Relations task force ( which I chaired ) , ' Building a North American Community , ' as the manifesto of a conspiracy to subvert American sovereignty , " he asserted .
" Dobbs claimed that the CFR study proposed a North American Union , although it did not . "
RELATED : WikiLeaks : ' North American Initiative ' no ' theory '
Pastor has argued consistently for a " North American Community , " as suggested by the title of his 2001 book entitled " Toward a North American Community . "
In a commentary authored for WND , Pastor stressed , " I do not propose a North American Union ; I propose a North American Community . "
Pastor argued the two were different in that North American Community would involve " three sovereign governments that seek to strengthen bonds of cooperation . "
Noting that the European Community was a transitional state between the European Common Market and the European Union , Pastor conceded to WND that , " I do n't think a political union of North America is an inherently bad idea , nor do I think it is a good idea for right now . "
Despite the SPP setback , Pastor remains determined to advise a different approach to his continued goal of integrating the U.S. , Mexico and Canada into a North American Community .
" The three heads of state must also commit to building a new consciousness , a new way of thinking about one 's neighbors and about the continental agenda , " he said .
" Americans , Canadians and Mexicans can be nationals and North Americans at the same time . "
To correct the defects of the SPP bureaucratic closed - door process , Pastor 's CFR article recommended creating new North American institutions , including a North American Investment Fund of at least $ 20 billion a year " to connect central and southern Mexico to the United States with roads , ports , and communications . "
Sen .
John Cornyn , R - Texas , dropped his support for Senate bill 3622 in the 109th Congress when WND reported the North American Investment Fund proposed by the legislation would enact a key proposal Pastor has frequently made for advancing his North American Community agenda .
In his CFR article , Pastor also called for the continuation of annual North American heads - of - state summits and the appointment in the next administration of a national adviser for North American affairs , who would chair a cabinet - level committee to formulate a comprehensive plan for North America .
Pastor also encouraged creating a dozen university centers for North American studies " to educate a new generation of students to think North American . "
WND reported on the fourth annual North American Model Parliament held this year in Montreal , Canada , for 100 university students from the U.S. , Canada and Mexico .
The North American Model Parliament is sponsored by the North American Forum on Integration , on which Pastor serves as a board member .
Are you a representative of the media who would like to interview the author of this story ?
Let us know .
The two traditional symbols
of inevitability in this world are death and taxes , but I would like
to propose a third :
If women are the main victims of a policy built
around basic bigotry , then the common sense objections to bigotry usually
trotted out by ostensible liberals will fly out the window .
Witness
William " Lord " Saletan convincing himself yet again that he’s
a contrarian .
Why ?
Because he behaves in a way predictable for men like him — self - satisfied
sexists so convinced of their own liberal nature that they do n’t even
realize how sexist they can be — and rushes to defend pharmacists
who single out women for abuse in their pharmacies , refusing to fill
prescriptions for those patients doing deplorably female things like taking hormonal contraception .
My favorite part of his immoral defense
of the right for pharmacists to treat women with bigotry was when he excuses a pharmacist who
implies that a woman is a slut — or maybe even calls her a slut , because there ’s bound to be a point
when purse - lipped refusals to provide basic pharmacy services wo n’t be satisfying enough and the word will have to be uttered .
Speaketh Lord Saletan :
Humiliation ?
Sorry , but
part of true equality is brushing off people who do n’t respect you .
If the guy behind the counter wo n’t sell birth control , he ’s the one
who should be embarrassed , not you .
Walk out , and do n’t come back .
First class evidence that Lord
Saletan thinks bigotry towards sexually active women does n’t count
in the way other bigotries work .
Imagine suggesting to civil rights
activists that the only proper reaction to widespread humiliations like
water fountains , lunch counters , and bathrooms marked " whites only "
was to walk out and mutter about how the bigot should be the one humiliated —
even as you know the bigot is the one preening over how awesome he is
because he showed the members of the hated class who ’s boss .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

I like that part , but I also
like how he lies to make his point that the poor , poor pharmacists are
just religious rubes whose bigotry should be indulged by its targets .
He buys the false claim that anti-choice pharmacists are motivated by
the urban legend about birth control pills being abortions .
Well ,
yes , that ’s what they like to say because it sounds a little less
bigoted than , " Really , I think that women are inferior to men and
should be forced to become pregnant against their will as punishment
for being sexual and really just for being women . "
Lord Saletan
plays along with the lie :
Because some pro-lifers
view hormonal contraception as potentially lethal .
I do n’t share their
anxiety about this theoretical risk to an early embryo , particularly
when the alternative , in the event of pregnancy , is a high likelihood
of fetal killing .
From the original
article Saletan is referencing :
But anyone who wants
condoms , birth control pills or the Plan B emergency contraceptive
will be turned away .
Emphasis mine .
Anti-choicers
oppose abortion , birth control pills , and condoms because they all see
these as methods that sluts use to escape their fate ordained by God : Forced childbirth .
They come up with
lies about killing " babies " to sell this belief to the public , but
the fact of the matter is that they have n’t figured out a way yet
to convince anyone that condoms are " abortion , " and yet they still
wo n’t sell it at pharmacies .
Saletan wo n’t admit a fact that
appears in the first paragraph of the article because it destroys
his pro-bigot argument grounded in " religious freedom " for pharmacists .
Admitting that the bigoted pharmacists in question are using religion
as a shield to hide their blatant misogyny and bigotry towards people
who do n’t share their fundamentalist beliefs would destroy his argument .
Unfortunately , that ’s the
truth of it .
If a pharmacist refused to fill out a Viagra prescription
for a black man he saw walking around with his white wife , we would
have no problem seeing this behavior as bigotry , even if said pharmacist
claimed that Jesus told him to do it .
But if a pharmacist refuses
to sell birth control pills to a woman who is n’t wearing a wedding
band , somehow that ’s legitimate religious expression , even though
his rights are extending well past her nose .
If Muslim pharmacists
started refusing to fill out prescriptions for Christians because those
Christians do n’t share their beliefs , we would have no problem seeing
that the religious freedom pinched was that of the customer ’s , not
the pharmacists .
But if the victims are singled
out because of sexism , then somehow society can’t see the bigotry .
If the victims of religious bigotry are specifically women , we do n’t see them as the victims of religious intolerance
that they are .
But that is exactly what they are .
The pharmacists
see a prescription for birth control and feels that ’s good evidence
that the woman in question needs to be punished for having different
religious beliefs than theirs .
It ’s not much different from
a fundamentalist Christian who humiliated and ejects you from his restaurant
because he glimpses a business card in your wallet indicating that you ’re
an atheist .
Or a gas station attendant who refuses to serve someone
he suspects of being Muslim .
Look , Pharmacists For Life
does n’t even go to great pains to hide that this is about women and
hating women .
When the bloggers
at Feministing criticized them , for instance ,
Pharmacists For Life used a common misogynist term that suggests that the
belief that women are men ’s equals is comparable to a belief in fascism that led
to the genocide of 12 million people .
Is it about imaginary
babies or about punishing uppity women for thinking we ’re equal ?
A Los Angeles police officer assigned to the elite Metropolitan Division is under investigation for allegedly driving drunk , striking two pedestrians with his Hummer and then fleeing the scene , authorities said .
William J. Skett , an eight - year Los Angeles Police Department veteran , was arrested June 20 by Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputies at his home about 2:30 a.m. , an hour after the pedestrians were injured in a Saugus parking lot .
Witnesses saw the driver of the Hummer hit a woman and a man as he backed out of a parking space , sheriff ’s detectives said .
The driver got out of his vehicle , saw the victims lying injured on the ground and then abandoned his vehicle to get away from the scene , detectives said .

Attorney Ira Salzman , who is representing Skett , said “ the facts will show that William Skett did not do what he was accused of doing . ”
He declined to elaborate , saying he had not yet seen any police reports .
Authorities declined to identify the victims .
But a relative identified the woman as Susan Sims , 62 .
She suffered multiple broken ribs and collapsed lungs .
The 65 - year - old man received minor cuts and bruises , authorities said .

On the night of the incident , sheriff ’s deputies found the abandoned Hummer at the parking lot near Bouquet Canyon and Soledad Canyon roads .
They traced the vehicle to Skett , who had left his LAPD badge in it , authorities said .
Los Angeles Sheriff ’s Det. Jeff Maag said that when Skett was confronted by deputies at his house shortly after the incident , “ he refused to acknowledge he was the driver at the scene . ”
“ Deputies observed he had objective symptoms that he was under the influence of alcohol and he was arrested for drunk driving and felony hit - and - run , ” Maag said .
He added that deputies believe another person picked Skett up at the parking lot after he left the scene .

Sims ’ son , an Antelope Valley prosecutor , said he was outraged at the officer ’s alleged conduct .
“ If what has been told to me is true , this police officer is a coward and he is also a disgrace to the Police Department , ” Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Jon Hatemi said .
Sims , who had been in intensive care at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital , was released Tuesday .
“ She is doing better , ” Hatemi said .
“ She will probably be out of work for two or three months . ”
Skett is free on $ 50,000 bail .
He has been assigned to home - duty by the LAPD pending resolution of his case , police said .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A top Baha'i official has criticized Iran 's claim that the six imprisoned leaders of the religious minority were held for security reasons and not because of their faith .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government has been accused of trying to eliminate the Baha'i community .
Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations , called Iran 's assertion " utterly baseless . "
" The allegations are not new , and the Iranian government knows well that they are untrue , " Dugal said on Wednesday , quoted in a news release issued by the Baha 'i movement .
" The documented plan of the Iranian government has always been to destroy the Baha 'i community , and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan . "
Iranian government spokesman Gholam - Hossein Elham said the people were detained for " security issues " and not their faith , Iran 's Islamic Republic News Agency said .
Elham said on Tuesday that the Baha 'is were members of a group working together " against national interest . "
" The group is an organized establishment linked to foreigners , the Zionists in particular , " he said .
The arrests of the six last week and another Baha'i leader in March sparked sharp condemnation by the Baha 'is , the United States , Canada , the European Union and humanitarian groups .
The Baha 'is say the latest arrests are part of a pattern of religious persecution since 1979 , when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created in the predominantly Shiite nation .
The Baha 'is say they have been killed , jailed and " otherwise oppressed " only because of their religion .
" The best proof of this is the fact that , time and again , Baha 'is have been offered their freedom if they recant their Baha 'i beliefs and convert to Islam , an option few have taken , " Dugal said .
Dugal said Iran 's practice of connecting the group to Zionism , the underlying political philosophy of the Jewish state , was a " distortion " and an attempt to " stir animosity " among the Iranian public .
The Baha'i World Center , which the movement refers to as its " spiritual and administrative heart , " is in the Acre / Haifa area in northern Israel -- a location that predates the founding of the state of Israel since it was formed during the Ottoman Empire 's rule of Palestine .
The Baha 'is explain that their founder , Baha'u 'llah , " after a series of successive banishments from his native Persia , was exiled , with members of his family and a small band of his followers , to the Turkish penal colony of Acre in 1868 . "
Dugal said the Iranian actions were the " most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the Baha 'is as agents of foreign powers , whether of Russia , the United Kingdom , or the United States and now Israel all of which are completely baseless . "
Dugal said the government 's philosophies are based largely on the idea that there can be " no prophet following Mohammed " and that the faith " poses a theological challenge to this belief . "
They say Baha 'u ' llah is regarded by Baha 'is as " the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham , Moses , Buddha , Krishna , Zoroaster , Christ and Mohammed . "
The Baha 'is -- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- say they have 5 million members across the globe , and about 300,000 in Iran .

[ Update 7-11-08 . 10 more stupid uses for Windows posted ]
After all these years I am willing to admit that Microsoft has won the desktop and server wars .
Thanks to VMWare Windows is spreading throughout the datacenter .
And , of course , there is only one operating system to use if you are dependent on Microsoft apps like Outlook , Word , and Excel .
While I have joined the chorus of security folks who rail against the Microsoft Monoculture I still cannot believe some of the uses for Windows .
Some of them are just downright silly , some you may claim are criminally negligent .
So here is the Top Ten List of Worst Uses for Windows :
1 . To display a static green arrow over the open TSA security lanes at Detroit Metro .
I kid you not , at the main security checkpoint to get into Detroit Metro there are monitors over each metal detector .
The ONLY thing those monitors ever display is a big green arrow pointing down .
Oh , occasionally they display a blue screen with a Windows error notice .
2. Ticket scanner at Frankfurt airport
Another example of too much horse power for a simplified task .
In this case I saw a Windows boot up screen on the little laser scanner for checking people on to the plane .
Why not program some stripped down embedded system for that task ?
IT would be open source most likely and would not need to be updated every month .
3 . Gift certificate dispensing kiosk
I am responsible for this one .
Back before the turn of the century I needed to sell printed gift certificates from kiosks in downtown Birmingham , Michigan .
All I could find was a manufacturer in Seattle who charged me $ 10,000 a piece including the touch screen and beautiful purple stand .
The OS was Windows NT .
It meant that twice a week I had to deploy a technician ( me ) to each kiosk to reboot them because they would freeze up due to memory leaks .
Eventually the manufacturer came up with a fix .
I downloaded a script to each machine that would reboot it automatically every day at midnight .
It may be hard to comprehend today but Microsoft effectively trounced Sun , DEC , HP , and IBM in the enterprise with products that were so flawed that they needed to be rebooted every 24 hours .
( That 's scheduled downtime , not used in calculating five nines . )
4. Job application kiosk
Now we get into security .
A little retailer in the Boston area used stand alone kiosks for presenting job application forms .
Hackers found it convenient to compromise the Windows based machine and steal tens of millions of credit cards from the retailer .
Yes , it was TJX .
5 . Train engine controls
This one would apply just as well to any moving vehicle such as a ship , earth moving equipment , etc .
I was on an Amtrak train from San Jose to San Diego a couple of years ago .
As usual we had to pull off the main track to allow a freight train through .
After that the train would not start again .
We were told the engineer could not reboot the computer .
Now , I did not get confirmation that the train ran on Windows but it is telling that that would be anyone 's first assumption .
And products like this locomotive control system do run on Windows .
6. Building controls
Listen , we all have enough trouble with heat , water , cooling , and electrical outages .
Why make them worse with Windows ?
Luckily no one would ever rely on Windows to control elevators right ?
Think again .
Read the Elevator Management System product document from Otis .
Not only do you need Windows 2000 or XP for the Main Station but is accessed via a web browser from anywhere on the Internet !
Talk about a hacker 's dream .
7. Manufacturing controls
Now we are getting to lala land .
Imagine having your manufacturing plant rely on Windows .
If you are the plant manager how do you explain to your CEO that your plant is down because of a virus ?
But I am here to tell you that Windows on machine controllers is becoming standard .
Crazy , but the truth .
8. ATMs
I was once treated to an evening on Steve Forbe 's yacht by ISS .
It was an event for industry analysts and ISS ( now IBM ) took the opportunity to demonstrate the end point security they were working on .
One of the examples they showed us was a NEC ATM application .
I could not concentrate on their add - on solution because I was so astonished that NEC was deploying cash machines all over the world running Windows .
Who at the banks makes these decisions ?
Do n't the RFPs have a section in them labeled : " demonstration of hardened operating system " ?
I guess not at Citibank who it turns out succumbed to an attack on their network where account numbers and PIN codes were stolen .
9. SCADA Networks
Imagine taking the largest networks for electrical transmission , oil and gas pipe lines and even vast underground pipes for transporting gasoline , and controlling them via Windows .
Well it is happening .
SCADA , the protocol for controlling critical infrastructure has moved to IP and end point pumps , switches and management stations are all running Windows .
How many of those systems harbor Trojan horses today ?
How many are ready to experience memory leakage that forces an unscheduled re-boot and sets off an uncontrolled ripple throughout the critical infrastructure ?
Wait and see .
10 . Medical equipment
I really begin to doubt the intelligence of engineers today whenever I encounter a medical equipment manufacturer that has made the switch to Windows from Unix .
First of all , let me point out that the FDA requires a lengthy paper trail to be filed every time medical equipment like dialysis machines , imaging equipment , radiation therapy , and biological monitors are upgraded .
That includes being patched for bugs and security updates every patch Tuesday if they are running Windows .
You know what that means .
They are not updated .
Therefore they are vulnerable .
Critical life support systems throughout a hospital are vulnerable to viruses and worms .
They could fail because of the lack of foresight of the manufacturers .
People could lose their lives .
Updated 9-10 - 08 : 11 .
Running a major stock exchange .
On Monday , September 8 , 2008 the London Stock Exchange , run completely on Windows , experienced a Blue Screen of Death .
What more can I say ?
So , what 's my point ?
I believe that " Windows Everywhere " is a strategy that benefits only Microsoft .
Everyone else should pick the best overall solution for their application .
Need to run DNS ?
Why use a big hairy operating system like Windows for such a simple yet critical application ?
Look for stripped down hardened solutions for mission critical apps .
Use Windows for must - have office productivity suites , gaming if you have to , but do n't build Windows into your operations if you do not have to .
Are car manufacturers really considering Vista for autos ?
Is NASA putting Windows in the specifications for the STS replacement ?
I hope not but I have been surprised before .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Congress approved a massive housing market rescue bill on Saturday , offering emergency financing to mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and setting up a $ 300 - billion fund to help hundreds of thousands of troubled homeowners .
Approved by the Senate in a 72 - 13 vote , the election - year rescue bill was passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday .
President George W. Bush was expected to sign it promptly , amid doubts about how much it would help .
With foreclosures at record levels , home sales sluggish and property values down , America is in its deepest housing slump since the Great Depression .
Fears that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the largest U.S. mortgage companies , might collapse rattled global markets earlier this month and led the Bush administration to call for emergency measures to bolster investor confidence .
They recently lost billions of dollars on bad home loans and the stock market has whipsawed their share prices on uncertainty about whether they have enough capital .
Housing activists and scholars said this election - year bill will ease , but not end , the housing crisis .
“ We have a housing market going into cardiac arrest .
This bill is like CPR to stabilize the situation , ” said David Abromowitz , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , a think tank in Washington .
The National Community Reinvestment Coalition , an alliance of 600 community investment and development groups , estimated 2.5 million U.S. households will face foreclosure this year .
While Congress ’ legislation is welcome , the coalition said , it “ will likely have little effect on the foreclosure crisis gripping the financial markets and economy . ”
HELP FOR FANNIE , FREDDIE
As private finance has retreated from the mortgage sector , the importance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has grown , and they own or guarantee almost half the country ’s $ 12 trillion in outstanding home mortgage debt .
Under a provision put into the bill late in its development at the administration ’s urging , Fannie and Freddie could draw on a temporary line of U.S.
Treasury credit or the government could buy shares in them , if they ran into trouble .
Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison said the housing bill had positive aspects .
But she added , “ I am troubled by the inclusion of an unlimited U.S. Treasury credit line to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ” and possible government stock purchases .

The bill establishes a $ 300 - billion fund under the Federal Housing Administration to help distressed homeowners get more affordable , government - backed mortgages and get out from under exotic mortgages they cannot afford .
The success of the temporary fund will depend on lenders ’ willingness to accept losses on original loans to shift overstretched borrowers into new loans .
An estimated 400,000 families could be helped by the program .
But it would not take effect until October 1 and housing activists said it might not be in full operation until 2009 .

Connecticut Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd , who steered the bill through the Senate , said the FHA fund should need “ four months to get it up and running . ”
He said he would meet with agency officials to urge rapid implementation .
The bill sends about $ 4 billion in grants to communities to help them buy and repair foreclosed homes ; offers tax breaks to spur home - buying ; sets up the first national licensing system for mortgage brokers and loan officers ; and raises the limit on the size of mortgages that federal agencies can guarantee .
NEW REGULATOR
The bill also creates a new regulator for the shareholder - owned companies with sharper teeth than the existing one , including power over their capital levels and over their executive compensation and internal financial controls , and with Federal Reserve consultation .
Because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are chartered by Congress they are often referred to as government - sponsored enterprises , which also gives them an implied government guarantee .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , told reporters after the vote he expects the bill to be sent to the White House on Monday .
“ Because of the Democratic Congress ’ delays and the need for action now , President Bush will sign this bill when he receives it , despite our concerns with some provisions , including nearly $ 4 billion to help lenders , not the homeowners this legislation is intended to serve , ” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said .
Both presidential contenders Barack Obama and John McCain praised the Senate ’s passage of the housing bill .
Illinois Democratic Sen. Obama said in a statement that the bill was “ urgently needed ” and represented “ an important start to protecting homeowners and restoring stability to our housing market and our economy . ”
Sen. McCain , an Arizona Republican , “ believes that relief for struggling homeowners is overdue , applauds the passage of this legislation and urges the president to sign it quickly , ” said McCain spokesman Taylor Griffin in a statement .

let him pray .
Is any merry ?
let him sing psalms .
Is any sick among you ?
let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him . "
- James 5:13-15
Suspect your wife may be sleeping around ?
Your church elder has a great solution : give her holy water mixed with dirt from the floor and if she gets sick , she 's an adulteress
" Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man 's wife go aside , and commit a trespass against him , And a man lie with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be defiled , and [ there be ] no witness against her , neither she be taken [ with the manner ] ... Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest ... And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put [ it ] into the water :
And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which [ is ] the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
And the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , If no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness [ with another ] instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse :
And when he hath made her to drink the water , then it shall come to pass , [ that ] , if she be defiled , and have done trespass against her husband , that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , [ and become ] bitter , and her belly shall swell , and her thigh shall rot : and the woman shall be a curse among her people .
And if the woman be not defiled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed . "
- Numbers 5:11 -28
How to deal with Leprosy : Take two birds ; kill one , dip the live one in the dead one 's blood , sprinkle over the leper and voila !
" This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing :
He shall be brought unto the priest :
And the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ;
Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water :
As for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water :
And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field . "
- Leviticus 14:3-7
Are you wandering the desert suffering while your God is raining down fiery serpents killing your people ?
Ask God for help and he delivers :
Put a brass serpent on a pole and whoever looks at it will live !
" And the people spake against God , and against Moses , Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ?
for there is no bread , neither is there any water ; and our soul loatheth this light bread .
And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and much people of Israel died .
Therefore the people came to Moses , and said , We have sinned , for we have spoken against the LORD , and against thee ; pray unto the LORD , that he take away the serpents from us .
And Moses prayed for the people .
And the LORD said unto Moses , Make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass , that every one that is bitten , when he looketh upon it , shall live .
And Moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it came to pass , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he beheld the serpent of brass , he lived .
Numbers 21:5-10
Jesus says quite clearly , if you want to go to heaven and have a penis , you must cut it off !
" For there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake .
He that is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
Matthew 19:12
If it moves .. you can EAT IT !
" Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things . "
- Genesis 9:3
Consume any blood and you are cast out .
Jehovah 's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because of the Bible
" And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people . "
- Leviticus 17:10
A fundamental doctrine of the Jehovah ’s Witnesses teaches that the Bible prohibits consumption , storage and transfusion of blood , including in cases of emergency .
This doctrine was introduced in 1945 .
In 1964 , Jehovah ’s Witnesses were prohibited from obtaining transfusions for pets , from using fertilizer containing blood , and were even encouraged to write to dog food manufacturers to verify that their products were blood - free .
Later that year , Jehovah ’s Witnesses doctors and nurses were instructed to withhold blood transfusions from fellow Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
The reasoning behind this is that when one is n't able to eat , they are fed through an intravenous line .
Thus they consider accepting blood that way the same as having eaten it .
Which eating blood in the times of the bible probably was n't a very good idea .
If you marry a woman and talk bad about her , she has to prove she 's still a virgin .
If so , you pay 100 Sheckels ; if not , she gets stoned to death .
" If any man take a wife , and go in unto her , and hate her , And give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a maid :
Then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel 's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate :
And the damsel 's father shall say unto the elders , I gave my daughter unto this man to wife , and he hateth her ;
And , lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , I found not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter 's virginity .
And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him ;
And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver , and give them unto the father of the damsel , because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
But if this thing be true , and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel :
Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father 's house , and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die : because she hath wrought folly in Israel , to play the whore in her father 's house : so shalt thou put evil away from among you . "
- Deuteronomy 22:12-21
If a man sleeps with a married woman , or a virgin betrothed to another man , they both shall be put to death .
" If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city , and ye shall stone them with stones that they die ; the damsel , because she cried not , being in the city ; and the man , because he hath humbled his neighbour 's wife : so thou shalt put away evil from among you . "
- Deuteronomy 22:22-24
If you believe in God , you can speak in tongues , handle snakes and drink deadly poison without being hurt :
- Mark 16:17 - 18 :
And these signs shall follow them that believe ;
In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
They shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
What 's amusing is this is one of the Bible passages cited by the Pentecosts , Robert Tilton , Benny Hinn and other " holy rollers " who " speak in tongues " and claim to be faith healers .
How often do you see them drinking poison or handling dangerous snakes to prove their faith ?
- Luke 10:19 :
Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
Whatever you want , all you need to do is pray
- Matthew 21:22 :
" And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive . "
You must look at the world in terms of absolute extremes
God does not want you to think , because if you use your brain , you might realize not everything is in absolutes : good / evil , black / white .
Anything other than yes / no is evil .
- Matthew 5:36 - 37 :
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
But let your communication be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil .
Do not plan ahead
Worrying about things like global warming is a waste of time according to the bible .
Live for today !
- Matthew 6:34 :
So do not worry about tomorrow ; for tomorrow will care for itself .
Each day has enough trouble of its own .
Beating slaves is ok as long as you do n't kill them
- Exodus 21:20 - 21 :
If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result , he must be punished , but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two , since the slave is his property .
Take slaves from foreign lands , but also tourists in your town
- Leviticus 25:44-45 :
Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you ; from them you may buy slaves .
You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country , and they will become your property .
Have a stubborn son ?
Stone him to death !
- Deuteronomy 21:18 - 21 :
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him , his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town .
They shall say to the elders , " This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious .
He will not obey us .
He is a profligate and a drunkard . "
Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death .
You must purge the evil from among you .
All Israel will hear of it and be afraid .
Death to everyone who works on a Saturday !
- Exodus 35:1-2 :
Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them , " These are the things the LORD has commanded you to do :
For six days , work is to be done , but the seventh day shall be your holy day , a Sabbath of rest to the LORD .
Whoever does any work on it must be put to death .
Jesus flunked science class
All - knowing god does n't know much about botany
- Matthew 13:31 - 32 :
" the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which …is the least of all seeds , but when it is grown is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree . "
The problem is , the mustard seed is not the smallest seed ( many are smaller such as the Orchid seed ) and mustard does not grow into a tree .
We can do what we want as long as we have faith , deeds do n't matter
- Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God : Not of works , lest any man should boast . :

Jesus thought the world was flat
No amount of altitude would allow you to see all the kingdoms of the world unless the world was flat .

" Again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them . "
A hare does what ?
Wrong .
Hares do not " chew the cud " ( also misstated in Lev 11:6 ) , but does divide the hoof .
- Deuternomy 14:7 :
" ... as the camel , and the hare , and the coney : for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof . "
Birds walk on four legs ??
- Leviticus 11:20 - 21 :
" All fowls that creep , going upon all four , shall be an abomination unto you . "
God sucks at geometry too
- 1 Kings 7:23 :
" He made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about . "
Circumference = Pi( ) x Diameter , which means the line would have to have been over 31 cubits .
In order for this to be rounding , it would have had to overstate the amount to ensure that the line did " compass it round about . "

AP Goes After Bloggers For Posting Article Headlines And Snippets
from the you 're - going - to - lose , - badly dept
The use is not fair use simply because the work copied happened to be a news article and that the use is of the headline and the first few sentences only .
This is a misunderstanding of the doctrine of " fair use . "
AP considers taking the headline and lede of a story without a proper license to be an infringement of its copyrights , and additionally constitutes " hot news " misappropriation .

Last fall , the Associated Press claimed that it was ready to change to face the new internet world -- and that meant not just being a gatekeeper , but joining in the conversation .
As we noted at the time , though , AP execs said all that , only to immediately follow that up with plans that looked like it was trying to become a new type of gatekeeper .
It did n't help that the company had also just sued VeriSign 's Moreover division for linking to AP stories along with a title and a tiny excerpt .
That sort of thing is clearly fair use -- but the AP does n't seem to think so .
And , now , it 's expanding its target list .
Rather than just going after the big aggregators ( surprisingly , Google settled ) , it appears that the Associated Press is going after bloggers for merely posting a linked headline and a tiny snippet of text from the article .
In this case , Rogers Cadenhead informs us that the AP sent 7 DMCA takedown notices last week to his site , the Drudge Retort ( a site that mocks the Drudge Report ) .
In six cases , a blog post on the site quoted just a small snippet of text from an AP article ( between 33 and 79 words -- nowhere near the full length of the article ) .
In every case , they also contained links back to the original AP article .
Five of the six used a different headline than the original AP article .
The other complaint was about a comment to a blog post , which also included a very short snippet and a link .
On the face of it , it 's nearly impossible to see how this is n't fair use , even though an AP representative insists it 's not :
Hopefully , they wo n't send a takedown notice for quoting that .
This is pure bullying on the part of the Associated Press , and a clear overstepping of its legal rights .
It 's most certainlya sign that the organization has adapted to the internet age .
In fact , the most amazing thing is that these types of uses ( a snippet and a link ) clearlyto those AP articles .
This is a pure " shoot - self - in - the - foot " move by the Associated Press -- and if they have any sense of decency they should issue a very public apology .
In the meantime , since the Associated Press apparently no longer wants traffic , we 'll start looking for other sources when linking to stories .
I can't promise we wo n't link to any AP stories ( they 're everywhere ) , but given the opportunity we 'd prefer to link to a news organization that 's happy to accept our traffic , rather than one that might sue us for pointing people their way .
This is quite unfortunate , as there are many AP reporters who read this site , and with whom I have come to build a strong relationship .
I think they 're quite good reporters , and it 's too bad they work for such a short - sighted organization . :
Someone from the AP has posted a response in the comments .
It makes some claims that simply do not seem to represent reality , including trying to define what is and is not " the link - based culture of the Internet . "
It claims that it wo n't go after snippets -- but does n't explain why that 's exactly what it .
And then it responds to a blog post from Jeff Jarvis that I have not seen and did not reference .
If the AP seriously wants to respond , why not respond to what is actually happening or what we actually said , rather than someone else . :
I should also note that the comment from the AP includes what appears to be a bit of a sales pitch suggesting that bloggersAP articles .

Massachusetts is about the last place one would expect a tax revolt , but that 's what 's brewing in Beantown .
The state board of elections recently certified that citizen activists have gathered the 125,000 signatures required to qualify an initiative for the November ballot to eliminate the state income tax .
The Small Government
Act would repeal the 5.3 % income and wage tax , as well as the state capital gains tax , which reaches as high as 12 % .
The ballot initiative would replace the $ 12.5 billion in taxes with . . . nothing .
" One of the points here , " explains Carla Howell of the Committee for Small Government that is driving the referendum , " is to force the state legislators to start cutting the bloated state budget . "
The political shock of having no income tax would force the pols on Beacon Hill to make the difficult spending choices they now refuse to make .
The referendum may seem the longest of long shots in a state represented by some of Congress 's biggest spenders .
But the same initiative was on the ballot in 2002 , and though the political establishment roared with laughter through Election Day , the measure got 45 % of the vote .
This time pro-tax forces such as the Massachusetts Teachers Association are planning to spend millions of dollars warning of Armageddon .
They have cause to be worried .
A Fabrizio poll for Citizens for Limited Taxation discovered that the average Massachusetts voter believes that 41 cents of every state tax dollar are wasted .
Coincidentally , that 's the share of the state budget funded by the income tax .
One big drain is a pension program that doles out billions each year to double - dipping pensioners and state workers retiring at taxpayer expense in their late 40s or 50s .
Nine U.S. states have no income tax , including such economic climbers as Florida , Nevada , Tennessee and Texas .
These states are doing fine funding schools , hospitals and police without the income levy .
Over the past decade 330,000 Massachusetts residents have packed U - Haul trailers and left -- more than have even fled Michigan -- and many have gone to no -income - tax New Hampshire .
The move means ZBC will carry no more MDC campaign advertisements Zimbabwe 's public broadcaster ZBC has said it will no longer carry campaign adverts from the opposition party ahead of next week 's presidential election .
The Movement for Democratic Change said it would appeal against the decision .
Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa defended the move saying international coverage favoured the MDC and never reported the ruling Zanu - PF 's position .
Earlier , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern over the political violence in Zimbabwe .
Adding his voice to growing international concern , he said the violence in Zimbabwe could undermine the outcome of the 27 June run-off vote .
" Violence , intimidation and the arrest of opposition leaders are not conducive to credible elections , " he told the UN General Assembly in New York .
The MDC says 66 of its supporters have been killed and 25,000 forced to flee their homes in a state - sponsored campaign of violence .
Mbeki talks Correspondents say the ban on adverts will not make a great deal of difference , as news bulletins at the state - run ZBC have always favoured Mr Mugabe , only mentioning the opposition in negative terms .
There are no privately controlled radio or TV stations in Zimbabwe and only a few weekly newspapers , which most people cannot afford .
It is of utmost importance that the violence is stopped immediately
Ban Ki-Moon US
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is due to chair an informal UN Security Council meeting on Zimbabwe later on Thursday , in an attempt to maintain international political pressure .
On Wednesday , South African President Thabo Mbeki spent his 66th birthday continuing his efforts to mediate between President Robert Mugabe and the opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai .
He held separate talks with both presidential candidates as pressure mounted on Mr Mugabe to curtail political violence ahead of the poll , but released no statement on the talks .
The MDC has criticised Mr Mbeki 's policy of " quiet diplomacy " for failing to hold Mr Mugabe to account .
Official results show Mr Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , gained the most votes in the first round of the presidential election in March but did not pass the 50 % threshold for outright victory .
Haile Menkerios ( R ) discussed the political stand - off with Mr Mugabe A senior UN official , Haile Menkerios , earlier met President Mugabe to discuss the political stand - off and what the UN says is the increased suffering of an already vulnerable population .
The UN is prepared to pay to fund election monitors to oversee the run-off vote .
South Africa is opposed to the Security Council having too much involvement , the BBC's Laura Trevelyan reports from the UN .
Pretoria argues that it is not for the council to resolve disputed elections .
Growing urgency Earlier , an African poll observer warned that he would not endorse the vote if current levels of violence continued .
Marwick Khumalo , head of the Pan - African Parliamentary observers , told the BBC his team had received horrendous reports of attacks and that the political environment was not conducive to a free poll .
Thousands of opposition supporters have been beaten or worse
But with the vote just days away , there is a growing sense of urgency with political violence beginning to spread from the countryside to the towns , says the BBC's Peter Biles in Johannesburg .
Mr Mugabe has been waging a fierce campaign to extend his 28 - year rule since Mr Tsvangirai failed to win enough votes to score an outright victory in March 's disputed first round .
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga has called for an international peacekeeping force to be deployed in Zimbabwe to ensure a free and fair vote .
" It is time for the leaders of Africa to say to President Mugabe that the people of Zimbabwe deserve a free and fair election , " he said .
Rwanda 's President Paul Kagame has also criticised Mr Mugabe , asking why he bothers holding an election , if he says he will not respect the outcome , reports the Reuters news agency .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says he has spoken to the leader of South Africa 's governing African National Congress , Jacob Zuma , about the possibility of deploying 1,000 election observers from the ANC .
Western observers have been banned , as the government accuses them of being biased in favour of the opposition .
The government has also said it wants to reduce the number of local election monitors , after 50,000 asked for accreditation .

Landmark Genome Study Shows Complexity of Human ' Code '
Human Genome More Complicated Than Ever Realized , Scientists Say
In what is being hailed as a landmark in understanding the human genome , scientists from over 35 research centers around the world released a collaborative study Wednesday afternoon showing that our genetic makeup is much more complicated than previously thought .
The collaboration of researchers , known as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements — or ENCODE — consortium , looked at roughly 1 percent of the entire human genome , concluding that the 95 percent of the genome previously believed to be superfluous actually plays a major role in regulating how DNA expresses itself .
The study brings a new dimension to determining both the impact of human genetics in clinical medicine and how humans evolved differently from animals .
When researchers announced they had mapped the human genome in 2003 , they knew it was made up of over 3 billion base pairs of DNA .
However , only between 1.5 and 5 percent of that — encompassing the areas known as " genes " — was involved in actually making proteins .
The rest was termed " junk DNA . "
But researchers felt that the remaining part of the genome had to have a purpose .
In a paper released in the journal Nature , scientists say they have found that much of that so - called junk DNA is actually involved in regulating how genes build and maintain the body .
" Several years ago , we had completion of the Human Genome Project , but we did n't know what to do with 95 percent of the DNA we 'd found , " said John Greally of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine , who reviewed the study in the same issue of Nature .
" This is going to be a landmark . "
Greally likens the genes to musical instruments , and the regulatory regions of the genome found in this study to an orchestral score — the instructions necessary to make the whole symphony come together .
Genes With Accessories
While Greally said the study is an important milestone in understanding the human genome , the fact that the other parts of the DNA play a regulatory role is not surprising ; rather , it is something many scientists had expected .
He also said that this study begins to answer a question scientists have been asking for a while :
How do cells in the body operate differently when they all have the exact same DNA ?
" What we 've known for a long time ... is that every cell in the body has the same DNA , but every cell uses different genes , and that 's what defined them , " said Greally .
While the current study mapped 1 percent of the genome and took four years , scientists feel that the remaining 99 percent of the genome 's regulatory regions will be mapped within the next four to five years .
" It 's just a matter of money , " said Zhiping Weng , a biomedical engineering professor at Boston University , who was one of the study leaders .
She said the accelerating pace of technology for sequencing DNA , and the number of labs that will be interested in adding to the research , would speed up the remainder of the process .
" This is an enormous step forward , " said Charles DeLisi , director of bioinformatics at Boston University , who played a major role in the Human Genome Project , but was not involved in the research for this particular study .
DeLisi sees this paper as the start of a new direction in the study of the human genome , where we gain a broader understanding of how DNA really dictates human physiology .
" You 'll learn a lot well before this project is completed , " he said , referring to what he termed a continuum of medical advances that would take place as researchers learned more about how genetic defects contribute to various diseases like diabetes , heart disease and certain forms of cancer .
Clinicians would then have a more accurate way of diagnosing patients for their risk of developing specific diseases , DeLisi said .
Working in Harmony
One of the most important parts of this study , DeLisi said , is the fact that many research labs came together to work on it .
" We 're all working together to make this happen a lot more rapidly than it would otherwise happen , " he said .
" To me , that is exhilarating . "
Francis Collins , head of the National Human Genome Research Institute , and Michael Snyder of Yale University , echoed that sentiment at a press conference on the study Wednesday morning .
They indicated that having so many researchers working together so smoothly was key to completing this important work .
This level of collaboration will continue as scientists aim to complete the mapping of the human genome .
" One of the important results is that we can do this , " said Ewan Birney , head of genome annotation at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory 's European Bioinformatics Institute .
" We can gain this information genomewide . "
Evolving Understanding
Birney said that the genome research will take a number of different directions , leading to a variety of discoveries .
" Depending on your level of biological geekiness , you get excited about these stories at a different level , " said Birney .
For him , an important finding was how different human and animal DNA are .
As many as half of the functional parts of the genome varied between different mammals , said Birney , who has looked at genomes for mice , rats , hedgehogs , platypuses and baboons , among others .
Despite that diversity between humans and animals , Birney stresses that humans are still very alike from one person to the next .
" Not only are we incredibly similar , the only sensible way to view our genetics is as one population , " he said .
" We are far , far more similar to each other than we are different . "
While the new advance adds to the understanding of the genome , researchers point out that completing the mapping will take time .
The complexity of the genome , Collins said , is something he feels all the researchers are in awe of .
" We are intended to be complicated , " he said , " and we obviously are . "
More and more Facebook users are seeing a new feature in recent days called “ People You May Know . ”
People You May Know is based on social proximity – Facebook looks at your friends - of - friends and suggests people that you have the most mutual friends with .
So far , I ’ve found several friends through the feature – it ’s nice to glance at a new set of people every few minutes .
After last week ’s launch of more robust privacy controls , “ People You May Know ” marks the second new feature in several days that employs the notion of friends - of - friends .
Where else might FOF show up within Facebook sometime soon ?
( I hear graph traversal is a pretty difficult technical problem , so do n’t expect to see a “ shortest path ” feature a la the old days of Friendster any time soon 🙂 )
4/26/08 : Raleigh NC hosted a military parade to honor the troops .
The ~ 20 protesters offering a different perspective – mostly Veterans for Peace , received little or no coverage in the news .
One peaceful protester encountered harrassment and attacks in front of police , Raleigh dignitaries , and the general parade audience , including a young boy who swiped a sign saying “ jesus said : love your enemies ” while the crowd roared with amusement and approval .
Below find a few photos of the incident .

In response to a Freedom of Information Act Request submitted by Kevin Ryan , Mick Harrison and Paul Smith , the government has disclosed documents confirming that Pakistani ISI General Ahmed – the guy who wired $ 100,000 to lead hijacker Atta — met with a “ Senior Representative from the Joint Chiefs of Staff ” , Centcom Commander General Tommy Franks , the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , Wolfowitz , Feith , other PNAC members , and probably Intelligence Committee members Graham and Goss , and others in the week before 9/11 .
All credit goes to Kevin , Mick and Paul .
I ’m just reporting on their efforts .

Comment on this article
Do you sometimes wonder if you ’re on the wrong path through life – but ca n’t see any way to rework your footsteps and join a different one ?
After I graduated from University , I wrote in my journal :
“ It is exciting to have my whole life ahead of me and know that I could do pretty much anything I put my mind to .
It ’s daunting but exhilarating to stand at the summit of 16 years ’ full - time education and gaze out at the land around me .
I could go anywhere from here . ”
But I did n’t “ go anywhere ” .
I took a well trodden path by getting a job ( tech support ) in London , leaving home and renting accommodation .
The first couple of weeks were fun : I ’d worked in temporary office jobs as a student and enjoyed the environment , I was excited to be in London , I was learning a lot of new techy things at work .
But after a month , I wondered “ Is this all there is now ?
For the next 40 years of my life ? ”
And I stumbled across an article online : Steve Pavlina ’s 10 Reasons You Should Never Get a Job :
“ It ’s funny that when people reach a certain age , such as after graduating college , they assume it ’s time to go out and get a job .
But like many things the masses do , just because everyone does it does n’t mean it ’s a good idea . ”
Lessons learned : Just because “ everyone else ” is taking one route ( whether in their job , social life , eating habits or spending habits ) does n’t mean that you have to follow them .
Take the time to look for the beginnings of other paths , even ones which are hidden and rarely trodden .
The Wrong Path Narrows Quickly
Whilst the wrong path is easy to join , every step makes it harder to turn back .
Your “ wrong path ” might be overeating ( not only gaining more and more weight , but entrenching bad habits deeper and deeper ) , getting into debt ( which can spiral out of control ) , or abusing alcohol and drugs ( an incredibly hard path to break away from . )
After I ’d been working for about six months , my boyfriend moved to London ( he ’d be starting a university degree there in the Autumn ) and we joined together to rent a flat on a year - long contract .
We looked for what we could afford based on the assumption that he ’d get a temporary full - time job .
Unfortunately , finding work proved more difficult than either of us had guessed , and my savings dwindled from £ 5,000 to just £ 32 .
I was lucky enough to get a raise at work , though , which stopped us dipping into the red – and once my boyfriend ’s student grant came through , I started to save up again .
But , at this point , I was convinced I ’d need to stay in my job for at least the next three years , whilst he was studying .
Lessons learned : Lack of money is probably the biggest factor for many of us in sticking with the wrong path and not going after our dreams .
The Myth of the One True Path
Once you ’re well onto the wrong path , the other people you meet tell you it ’s the only path .
They may hate it and wish they were walking a different way , but they refuse to accept that other paths can actually be safer , more enjoyable and lead to better destinations .
I found that colleagues were often fed up with the humdrum Monday to Friday , 9 - 5 routine .
But whenever I mentioned that I was saving money ( usually to explain why I was bringing in lunch from home , or why I did n’t go out often ) , they were bewildered .
They could n’t understand why I would n’t just live paycheck - to - paycheck , like everyone else .
Lessons learned :
Be willing to ignore your peers .
You do n’t have to conform to whatever the “ norm ” is , especially if it ’ll take you further down a path you do n’t want to be on ( spending too much , eating / drinking in an unhealthy way , schmoozing or blagging your way up the corporate ladder … )
Rumors of Other Paths
Sometimes , people might wander across the path you ’re on , then head of into – as far as you can see – a bewildering maze of trees .
These people might be artists , freelancers , writers , part - time workers , full - time moms , charity volunteers , world travelers … the one thing they share in common is a certain glow , an inner joy .
As I traveled down the wrong path , I met some of these people .
Consultants who worked with my company .
Full - time authors at writing conventions .
I read and listened to freelancers , entrepreneurs , life coaches , and others , learning from their books , blogs and podcasts .
I realized that there really were other paths , not just this grey , endless one .
Lessons learned : Stay open to other possibilities .
Just because you ’ve never tried something – or perhaps never even heard of it – does n’t mean it ’s not real .
Escaping Your Path
One of the hardest things about being on the wrong path is that you ca n’t turn back .
There ’s no way to undo the weeks , months or years that have passed : they ’re gone .
Wishing that you ’d made different choices , or that you ’d had better advice , is a waste of time … you ca n’t change the past .
But you do n’t need to start again from the beginning of the path .
You can cut through the woods .
I saved up for eight months , replacing the whole £ 5000 that I ’d spent the previous summer .
I freelanced “ on the side ” for five months , earning enough money from writing to convince me I could do it for a living .
I also did some free work on websites , building up a small portfolio .
I worked the hardest I ever have in my life , and there were times when hacking through the forest seemed like far too much work – but the alternative was that long , grey path .
Lessons learned :
It ’ll be a struggle when you leave your path .
Whether you want to quit your job , lose 50 lbs , travel to every country in the world or earn a million dollars – the initial stage will be hard and frustrating at times .
Into the Sunlight
There will come a moment , one shining day , when you hack through the last of the tangled brambles to stand blinking in the sunlight .
Your feet are on your new path , which turns and twists through pleasant greenery , and the birdsong above brings an instant feeling of calm as soon as you step out into the light .
Thursday 31st July was my last day in technical support .
I finally started on the path I should have taken two years ago : writing , blogging and creating websites .
The slow , plodding pace of the old path is gone , and the new one is filled with diversions , resting places , and wonderful fellow travelers .
Lessons learned :
Do whatever it takes for you to get onto the right path – it ’s worth it .
Are you on the wrong path ?
What are you doing to fight your way back to the right one ?

Irate VMware customers were left unable to power up their virtual servers this morning because of a bug that killed their systems when the clock clicked round to 12 August .
The bug was sent out to customers in ESX 3.5 update 2 , VMware 's latest hypervisor , which went out on 27 July .
The version could have been downloaded and installed by thousands of customers since then .
Over the past 12 hours we ’ve received angry reports from businesses and individuals affected by the cock - up .
VMware told El Reg it was aware of the problem .
The firm ’s group product marketing manager Martin Niemer said : “ We are sending communication to all customers who have downloaded the software and we are aggressively working on a fix which should be within a short time frame . ”
He declined to comment on how many customers would have been hit by the embarrassing date blunder .
Niemer claimed that given it ’s only been two weeks since ESX 3.5 update 2 was made available for download , it was unlikely that many people would have installed it in a live production environment .
But the firm ’s forum suggests a different story .
Since the problem first came to light , VMware 's thread about the issue has been viewed more than 2,500 times .
We put that figure* to Niemer .
“ I can not tell you how many customers but it only affects people who have downloaded since 27 July , so you can imagine it ’s not a very big number of customers so far , ” he said , before somewhat contradicting himself with this statement : “ We know who they are and we ’re going to contact them . ”
Niemer was also unable to offer a time frame for when angry customers can expect to see a fix .
“ We can not give an exact time frame but it should be within a few days ... but I can not give an exact date right now . ”
We asked if the firm accepted that the bug was a major cock - up for VMware .
“ We ’ve identified the problem and we ’re working on the fix , and of course there ’s going to be a post - mortem to understand what happened , ” he said .
Niemer added that a work - around has been offered whereby customers should manually set the date of all ESX 3.5u2 hosts back to 10 August as a temporary fix .
However , he accepted that this was not exactly a satisfactory solution for all businesses .
Some users have complained that doing this would contradict legal requirements that they must have the correct timestamps on their system .
Reg reader Duncan said VMware 's FAIL represented a " fantastic bug for a company trying to embed itself into the modern computing world " .
While another reader , Eric , said the " time bomb " contained in the update was causing a lot of panic among businesses .
" Customers were fuming this morning having planned downtime for weeks .
VMware has a lot of answering to do on this and no doubt share price will take a hit again , " he said .
VMware said it will keep us up to date as to when a fix will be provided .
In the meantime , anyone who has downloaded the update but not installed it is best advised to leave it gathering dust . ®

To drive anywhere I pass a bunch of other wheres .
One of the wheres this time was my mothers house .
I got all the seats out of the bus !
Most of the bolts came right out , but I used and angle grinder on a few .
I do n’t know why I did n’t take any good pictures of the whole thing , but here is a picture I took after taking the first seat out :
It ’s pretty long , about seventeen feet of usable length , and maybe seven feet wide .
I ’m a dork , I did n’t measure for real ( I did the footstep thing ) .
I had been planning on a loft bed in the back , way up by the ceiling with most of the storage underneath , but now I see that there ’s an air conditioning unit in the way .
So I could put the bed way high up somewhere else , along the side in the back or something .
Or I could have a lower bed .
Like , one that I could sit up in .
That would be weird , but I might be able to get used to it .
I want to have a wood stove right next to the bed , a kitchen cabinet / counter opposite that , and most of the rest of it open space with bookshelves and stuff along the wall .
Open space and being able to stand up excites me a lot right now .
Also , there are pull up bars !!
But I want your guys ’ ideas .
The first bus around , I would n’t listen to anyones advice .
This time around I want it all , even the crazy way out there stuff .
I got to thinking , while pulling out those seats , that I may be the only person in the world with a 56 year old mother who is eager to come out and rip out seats with me .
Afterwards I helped her move a pile of cinder blocks , a big trailer , and a non-operating four wheeler because she is digging a big trench to insulate the ground next to her garage .
I ’m so grateful for having been raised by people who are n’t afraid of doing things and did n’t tolerate me not doing things .
I still remember the first time I became aware of this .
We had just moved to town , out in this neighborhood where everyone was building houses , and after we built our house my dad went out to trapline for the winter .
It was a cozy neighborhood , since we ’d all camped out while building houses together , and a neighbor lady was driving me home one day .
“ How does your mom get by without your dad ?
Does n’t she need help ? ” she asked me .
“ Um , with what ? ” I asked , thinking that my dad was n’t that much help when he was around , except that he was good at shooting bears through their eyeballs in the pitch black of night when you ca n’t see them .
“ Like , snow .
How did she get the snow off the roof ? ”
“ Oh , ” I explained , “ she used a ladder , and she climbed up to the top , cause if you start at the bottom the snow will knock you off .
And she tied herself to the stove pipe and knocked the snow down , and then the ladder fell down too but that was okay , she just jumped down in the snow . ”
“ That ’s amazing .
She must be a feminist . ”
Later , at home , I asked my mom what a feminist was and told her she must be one because she ’d shoveled off the roof .
“ Well ! ” my mother said , haughtily , “ I calculated it out and there were 8 tons of snow up on that roof !
It ’s 2×6 construction , it ca n’t handle that !
Am I supposed to have the roof cave in because there ’s not a man around ? ! ”
Then she sent me out to bring in fire wood .
It ’s taken years for me to understand what a gift this was .
Thanks mom .
TUSCALOOSA , ALA .
–Manuel Castillo drove through Alabama in a truck filled with onions and left with a $ 500 ticket for something he did n't think he was doing : speaking English poorly .
Castillo , who was stopped on his way back to California , said he knows federal law requires him to be able to converse in English with an officer but he thought his language skills were good enough to avoid a ticket .
Still , Castillo said he plans to pay the maximum fine of $ 500 rather than return to fight the ticket .
" It just does n't seem fair to be ticketed if I was n't doing anything dangerous on the road , " he said .
An Alabama state trooper thought Castillo , 50 , could n't speak English well enough to drive an 18 - wheeler when he was headed back to California from picking up onions in Glennville , Ga .
A driver for 20 years , Castillo was stopped in west Alabama for a routine inspection .
Castillo , who says he speaks English at roughly a Grade 3 level , said he understood when the trooper asked him where he was heading and to see his commercial driver 's licence and registration .
He said he responded in English , though he speaks with an accent .
Castillo was n't speeding , and the inspection and computer check turned up no offences , so he was surprised to get a ticket for being a " non-English - speaking driver . "
Federal law requires that anyone with a commercial driver 's licence speak English well enough to talk with police .
Authorities last year issued 25,230 tickets nationwide for violations .
Now the federal government is trying to tighten the English requirement , saying the change is needed for safety reasons .
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has proposed rules requiring anyone applying for a commercial driver 's licence to speak English during a road test or vehicle inspection .
Many of our tech - savvy friends — the kind of folks who nurse along the beowulf clusters our climate models run on — are scratching their heads over some cheeky shrieking that recently appeared in a WIRED magazine article on Rethinking What it Means to be Green .
Crank up the A/C ! Kill the Spotted Owl !
Keep the SUV !
What ’s all that supposed to be about ?
Let ’s take air conditioning for starters .
Basically WIRED took a look at the carbon footprint of New England heating vs. Arizona cooling and jumped to the conclusion that air conditioning was intrinsically more efficient than heating .
To see where they were led astray let ’s consider a house sitting where you need to cool it by 20 degrees to be comfortable .
The heat leaks into the house at a rate that is approximately proportional to this temperature difference , and the heat leaking in needs to be removed .
Now , in order to move that heat from inside to outside , energy has to be expended .
Given a fixed electric power usage ( in watts ) , a better air conditioner can remove more heat per day than a worse one , but every air conditioner needs to expend some energy to move the heat .
That ’s just thermodynamics .
Efficiency of air conditioners is measured by a SEER rating , which is the ratio of heat moved to the outside ( in BTU / hr ) to the electric power consumption ( in Watts ) .
A typical modern air conditioner has a SEER rating of 10 , We can convert this into nicer units by converting BTU / hr into Watts , which means dividing the SEER rating by 3.413 , which then gives us a Coefficient of Performance , in units of Watts of heat moved per Watt of electricity used .
For the aforementioned efficiency , we move heat at a rate of 2.92 Watts if we expend 1 Watt of electric energy .
An air conditioner is just a heat engine run in reverse : instead of making use of a temperature differential to use heat flow from hot to cold to do work , we expend mechanical work in order to move heat from a colder place to a hotter place .
Thus , an efficient heat engine is an inefficient air conditioner .
That ’s basically why the Coefficient of Performance gets smaller when the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors is greater — with bigger temperature difference heat engine cycles tend to get more efficient , which means that air conditioner cycles tend to get less efficient .
That ’s also where the “ S ” in SEER comes from .
It stands for “ Seasonal , ” and reflects the fact that efficiency must be averaged over the range of actual temperature differentials experienced in a “ typical ” climate .
Your mileage may vary .
This situation can be contrasted with heating .
If that same house were in an environment that were too cold instead of too warm , so that it had to be kept 20 degrees warmer than the environment , then the amount of heat leaking out of the house each day would be about the same as the amount leaking into the house in the previous case .
That heat loss needs to be replaced by burning fuel .
Now , generating heat is the only thing that can be done with 100 % efficiency .
Old furnaces lose a lot of heat up the chimney , but modern sealed - combustion burners – the kind that can use PVC pipes instead of a chimney — lose virtually nothing .
With a heat exchanger between the air intake and the exhaust , they could closely approach the ideal .
But still , in this case we are generating heat rather than just moving it , so it takes 1 watt of heat power from fuel burning to make up 1 watt of heat loss .
That would seem to make heating a factor of 2.92 less efficient than air conditioning .
But wait , the story does n’t stop there .
First , there ’s the fact that air conditioning almost invariably runs off of electricity , and the increased electricity demand is a big source of the pressure to build more coal - fired power plants .
A house can be heated by burning natural gas , and right there air conditioning becomes 1.8 times worse than heating , because natural gas emits only 55 % of the carbon of coal , per unit of heat energy produced .
And it gets even worse : Coal fired power plants are only 30 % efficient at converting heat into electricity , on average , so there you get another factor of 3.3 in carbon emissions per unit of energy transferred between the house and its environment .
Finally , figure in a typical electric line transmission loss of 7 % and you get another factor 1.075 .
Put it all together with the energy efficiency of the air conditioner itself and air conditioning comes in at a whopping 2.19 times less efficient than heating .
for a given amount of temperature difference between house and environment .
That means that so far as carbon emissions go , heating a house to 70 degrees when the outside temperature is 40 degrees is like cooling the same house to 70 degrees when the outside temperature is 83.7 degrees .
And that ’s still not the end of the story .
A house in need of air conditioning has other heat inputs besides the heat leaking in from outside , and all that extra heat needs to be gotten rid of as well .
For example , heat is a waste - product of all energy use going on in the house .
Four people produce 400W that needs to be gotten rid of , and then there ’s the heat from hot water , lighting , the TV , cooking and what have you — all the energy usage within the house , plus 100W of biological heat per person needs to be gotten rid of .
On top of that , you ’ve got direct radiative heating from the sun , both from the sunllight getting through windows and solar heating of the exterior surfaces of the house , some of which will leak in through the insulation .
Energy must be expended to remove all this heat .
In contrast , in the heating season waste heat is subtracted from the energy needed for home heating .
So , WIRED got the story egregiously wrong , and not just because they did the arithmetic wrong .
In their rush to be cute , they did n’t even make a half - baked attempt to do the arithmetic .
But what if they had been right and air conditioning really were intrinsically more efficient than heating .
Would that justify their conclusion that you can just " crank up the A/ C ? " without worry ?
No , of course not , because cranking up the A/C would still use additional energy and still lead to the emission of additional carbon .
For the conclusion to be justified , it would n’t be enough for A/C to be more efficient than heating ; it would have to be so much more efficient that the incremental energy usage from cranking it up were trivial .
WIRED did n’t even try to make that case .
If they had , they might have spotted their errors .
Is there any real conclusion that could have been drawn from more clear thinking about the heating vs. air conditioning issues danced around in the article ?
Yes , in fact .
The conclusion is that it makes a lot of sense to build houses in places where the environment requires neither much heating nor much cooling .
This is in fact why Los Angeles scores pretty well in carbon footprint per capita , despite all the driving ( as noted recently in The Economist . ) .
Another conclusion to be drawn from the carbon footprint of New England heating is that there are probably a lot of leaky homes up there heated by inefficient oil - fired furnaces .
Fixing that situation represents a huge untapped virtual energy source .
What ’s more , for a magazine that purports to be written by and for tech geeks , WIRED missed the biggest and most interesting part of the story : the same intrinsic efficiences of heat pumps can be run in reverse to give you the same economies for home heating as you get for air conditioning .
To do this effectively , you ’d have to run the heat pump off of natural gas rather than electricity ( or perhaps run it off of locally generated solar power or wind ) .
You ’d also have to deal with the fact that heat pumps become less efficient when working across large temperature gradients , but that ’s where geothermal heat storage systems come in , making use of the fact that the deep subsurface temperature remains near a nice 55 F all year around .
Now that would have been a nice story for a tech magazine to cover .
And by the way , the decrease in efficiency of heat pumps as the temperature differential increases has another implication that WIRED missed : not only does global warming increase the basic demand for air conditioning , with all the attendant pressures on electricity demand , but it exacerbates the situation by decreasing the efficiency of the entire installed base of air conditioners .
Now about that spotted owl .
This refers to a claim that industrial tree plantations take up carbon faster than old growth forests ;
Since spotted owls require the large trees found only in old - growth , the supposed implication is that if we want to soak up carbon we ought to damn the spotted owl and cut down all the old growth .
WIRED really committed serial stupidities on this one .
First of all , the article they cited in support of their claim was about carbon emissions from Canada ’s managed forests , not from old growth .
Now , it ’s true that a rapidly growing young tree takes carbon out of the atmosphere more rapidly than a mature forest which more slowly transfers carbon to long term storage in soil .
However , to figure out how much net carbon sequestration you get out of that young tree once it ’s chopped down , you need to figure what happens to it .
Lots of trees wind up in paper , carboard boxes , shipping palettes and other things that rapidly sit around decomposing or get burned off ( or worse , turn into methane in landfills ) .
Even the part that turns into houses has a relatively short residence time before being oxidized .
Anybody who has maintained an old Victorian house knows about the constant battle against rot , and the amount of wood that needs to be replaced even if ( knock wood ) the thing does n’t burn down or turn into a tear - down .
So , WIRED is totally off the mark there , unless , to use the colorful language of my colleague Dave Archer , they can get trees to " drop diamonds instead of leaves . "
Worse , they ignore the abundant literature indicating that old growth forests can be a net sink of carbon even in equilibrium , whereas the soil disturbance of clear cutting and industrial forestry can lead to large soil carbon releases .
A classic article in the genre is " Effects on carbon storage of conversion of old - growth forests to young forests " ( Harmon et al. Science 1990 ) .
They state " Simulations of carbon storage suggest that conversion of old - growth forests to young fast - growing forests will not decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in general , as has been suggested recently . " .
For more recent work , take a look at what Leighty et al .
( ECOSYSTEMS Volume : 9 Issue : 7 Pages : 1051 - 1065 . 2006 ) have to say about the Tongass : .
" The Tongass National Forest ( Tongass ) is the largest national forest and largest area of old - growth forest in the United States .
Spatial geographic information system data for the Tongass were combined with forest inventory data to estimate and map total carbon stock in the Tongass ; the result was 2.8 +/- 0.5 Pg C , or 8 % of the total carbon in the forests of the conterminous USA and 0.25 % of the carbon in global forest vegetation and soils .
Cumulative net carbon loss from the Tongass due to management of the forest for the period 1900 - 95 was estimated at 6.4- 17.2 Tg C.
Using our spatially explicit data for carbon stock and net flux , we modeled the potential effect of five management regimes on future net carbon flux .
Estimates of net carbon flux were sensitive to projections of the rate of carbon accumulation in second - growth forests and to the amount of carbon left in standing biomass after harvest .
Projections of net carbon flux in the Tongass range from 0.33 Tg C annual sequestration to 2.3 Tg C annual emission for the period 1995 - 2095 .
For the period 1995 - 2195 , net flux estimates range from 0.19 Tg C annual sequestration to 1.6 Tg C annual emission .
If all timber harvesting in the Tongass were halted from 1995 to 2095 , the economic value of the net carbon sequestered during the 100 - year hiatus , assuming $ 20 / Mg C , would be $ 4 to $ 7 million /y ( 1995 US dollars ) .
If a prohibition on logging were extended to 2195 , the annual economic value of the carbon sequestered would be largely unaffected ( $ 3 to $ 6 million / y ) .
The potential annual economic value of carbon sequestration with management maximizing carbon storage in the Tongass is comparable to revenue from annual timber sales historically authorized for the forest . "
So , it looks like that old Spotted Owl and its kindred old - growth denizens are in fact sitting not just on a nest , but on a treasure trove of carbon credits worth potentially more than the timber harvest .
And should you keep that SUV ?
This blurb in fact contains some useful advice , buried amidst some fuzzy reasoning and published over a witless tag line stating that " pound for pound " a Prius takes more energy to manufacture than a Hummer .
The apparent implication of that tag line is rebutted in the article itself , but why give the reader that as a 32 - point type take - home point when the WIRED editors do n’t even themselves believe it ’s an important statistic ?
This factoid refers to the energy used in the nickel component of Prius batteries , but it ’s irrelevant because " pound for pound " does n’t count if your point is moving 4 people from point A to point B .
What transport value do you get from transporting four people plus the weight of the Hummer ?
Now , the rest of the fuzziness in the logic is a bit more subtle .
The author notes quite rightly that there is a very significant carbon emission from manufacturing a car , which is indeed more for a Prius ( at least for the moment ) than it is for comparable sized non-hybrids ..
Thus , if you are faced with ditching your existing car ( whatever it may be ) and buying a Prius , you need to consider how much you drive per year and see how long it takes to " pay back " the carbon emission from manufacturing the Prius .
So far so good .
But this is more a statement about the transition to more efficient cars , and how to deal with mistakes of the past , rather than a statement about what is intrinsically desirable in the fleet .
As far as carbon emissions go , we ’d still be better off if everybody who needed a car were in a Prius , except maybe for people who drive very little per year — who should then be into shared hybrids via iGO or ZipCars , Maybe if you drive very little and live out in a rural area where there are not going to be any shared cars , getting a compact non-Hybrid might make sense .
There must be at least a dozen or two people out there in that category , I guess .
The rest of the advice WIRED gives makes even less sense .
They say that if you want to be green , you ought to buy a used Civic or something like that , not a Prius .
That ’s because the used car already has the manufacturing carbon emissions " written down " ( or , I guess at least the carbon guilt accrues to the original owner , not that the atmospheric radiative forcing is going to care much about that ) .
However , this advice , sensible - sounding though it is — ignores the fact that to make that used car available to you , the original owner almost certainly had to buy something else , and probably that was a new car , or at least a newer one .
So , for the scheme to work , you ’d have to buy your used Civic from somebody who was giving up driving altogether .
I no longer own a car myself , but I ’m sorry I was n’t able to participate in a scheme like this ; by the time I gave up our remaining car ten years ago , it was suitable only for the crusher , and in fact had to be towed there .
The real implication is that manufacturing costs count , so most people should buy a small , efficient hybrid and keep it until it runs into the ground .
The implication is also that durability of cars counts for nearly as much as gas mileage , since an efficient car that needs to be replaced every five years is n’t really all that efficient .

' Course Blackwell * did * lose in 2006 , which punches holes in the conspiracy theory .
Then again , maybe the Rethugs just let the Dems win in 2006 to make everyone think everything was hunky dory , so no one would ask questions when the Rethugs win the presidency in 2008 ?
Stay tuned ...

Not really , they 'll game anything that 's arguably within a span of the margin of error .
They 're not stupid , very smart analysts work that margin in whatever ways are available and Ken Blackwell 's chances were nowhere near enough to be arguably gamed in 2006 .
But they also may have accounted for the fact that their system had been outted that day and thought better of being caught openly in the act .
I suspect the first thought is the better explanation .

We learned this week that Connell may have been threatened by Karl Rove ...
That 's not the way the story was first presented at BradBlog .
But since this stale act has been getting exposed lately , perhaps BradBlog is adjusting .
Brad did nothing for Bev Harris , when she was getting smeared at the Democratic Underground .
This is enemy turf to you Bev Harris .
Brad has stabbed you in the back .
He is buddies with Brett Kimberlin .
Search engine that asswipe .
Their Velvet Revolution is tied in with Mike Rivero through Tinoire .
His moderator is a corrupt Tinoire clone .
Think about all this .
I 'd write more , but there is no real free speech here .
So save your stupid hypocritical lectures , Brad .
Perhaps this is a good time for your bullshit moderator to just delete or edit at his or her whim .
Nice facade you had going here .
The key word is had .
Brad Friedman is a fake progressive .
Do n't fall for it .
He is a gatekeeper and a strawman .
p.s. Do n't fall for Brad 's email tricks either .
He 'll tell you what you want to hear in private but will never address things in public .

My god I just noticed .
Your Right !
It 's STILL Presented that way .
Brad did nothing for Bev Harris , when she was getting smeared at the Democratic Underground .
This is enemy turf to you Bev Harris .
Brad has stabbed you in the back .
Not that Brad had any obligation to " do something for Bev Harris . "
What do you mean exactly ?
Show some url / thread or something .
Cause I remember getting laughed off , smeared myself back in the day on DU .
I had 202 posts before I left .
I can find only a few , since I can't search their website .
Why is that ?
Huh ?
Could it be that they do n't want my shit indexed because ( however misdirected I was back then ) it was the truth .
Could it be that I did n't agree with Andy ( before he died ) back then ?
Furthermore , I 've seen plenty of comment here from Bev Harris .
Right here on Bradblog .
He is buddies with Brett Kimberlin .
Search engine that asswipe .
Their Velvet Revolution is tied in with Mike Rivero through Tinoire .
His moderator is a corrupt Tinoire clone .
Think about all this .
Your the one saying it , why do n't you show what it is your talking about .
I ain't even asking for evidence , just a basic understanding of whatever the hell it is your ranting on about .
Cause I do n't get what it is your saying , seems to be several things .
You do n't like the moderator ?
( which has seemed fair enough to me , but I will get to that later ) I ain't no journalist , I am just a guy that does bands and music and a USAF veteran that hates these fucking " electronic vote tabulation devices " --- a term that I have coined after trying to get involved since 2004 .
A term that I use now to put the finger exactly on the problem that pissed me off the most .
A term that I present and use to anyone that I meet that does n't understand this crap .
A term that I use to technical folks so they can " home in " and quickly grasp exactly what I am saying .
In the early days I said voting machines , then electronic voting machines .
I have learned since then .
We no longer HAVE TIME to learn .
We have to get rid of this shit .
I have been friends with people I do n't agree with over the years .
Does that make me some kind of corrupt Rat Fucker ?
I 've aired bands that are republican , or have republican ideals , or message does that make me a Rat Fucker ?
Should I be smashing my U2 disks ?
Brad Friedman is a fake progressive .
Do n't fall for it .
He is a gatekeeper and a strawman .
I do n't recally Brad saying he was a progressive .
I do remember that a lot of what he does is progressive .
I do remember that he tries to stay neutral .
But how can anyone fully stay neutral ?
That 's a lot to chew .
There 's one reason that I like Brad , if that reason changes , I 'll leave this second .
That is that Brad hates these fucking electronic vote tabulation devices .
See I can relate to that .
There 's other reason 's also , old sysop 's tend to flock together .
On a technical level we can relate .
Do us a favor and show how he 's a " gatekeeper " or a " strawman . "
I 'd write more , but there is no real free speech here .
So save your stupid hypocritical lectures , Brad .
Perhaps this is a good time for your bullshit moderator to just delete or edit at his or her whim .
Nice facade you had going here .
The key word is had .
Oh do write more , I do want to hear what you have to say .
You say there 's no free speech here , but the TRUTH is that this is an OPEN SYSTEM .
Even my OWN blog is n't currently that OPEN in comparison .
The Bradblog is about as close to the NirvanaNet ™ Charter as you can get .
Just type the freaking captcha and your in .
Since back in the bbs days , I have taken a much more conservative approach to providing public access message boards , even though I had always wanted to remain 100 % open .
Look at the evolution of the temple of the screaming electron today .
You can't just post anything you want there anymore .
You HAVE to be able to edit today .
If not for spam alone .
You got some kind of thing that Brad wo n't let you post , lemme see it , it could be I will post the motherfucker on my own boards , if I think it 's true and Earth - shatteringly important .
Show me what your talking about , I believe in 100 % ( PEG ) Programming on public access and if I can't publish the fucker I sure as hell will try to point you in the right direction to people that CAN or will .
I quickly loaded your website and I see that your interested in " Chem Trails . "
I think your right about chem trails , but personally I can't do anything about chem trails , I can however try to regain control of my government and by proxy possibly get control of the aircraft that are spraying that shit .
But I have to solve how to get the fucking vote counted first .
See my personal belief is that ALL THESE FUCKING PROBLEMS are because of electronic vote tabulation devices .
That 's a radical opinion I guess cause it's what 's driven me off every fucking progressive website and landed me here at Bradblog .
So I got Bradblog , or my own blog left .
Brad gets more traffic and solid discussion than I do , if he was gone tomorrow , then it would be only me bitching on my own website .
I do n't agree with everyone here .
ASK EM .
They they do n't always agree with me .
( part of that is my short temper , I 'm working on that though . )
I got a band of idiots that fuck with my websites still to this day .
I hope you do n't consider me wacked for using iptables , and other scripts and methods to filter the Rat fucks out .
And it ai n't like I have a team working for me either .
I do all the shit .
In fact I do shit for other people on TOP of that .
Pretty much stretched as thin as I can get and yet not paid a single fucking penny .
So I hope you listen to what I said carefully .

Socrates , what is stale about this .
It just happened last week .
And Bev is quite capable of protecting herself , thank you .
I am thinking about all of this and I have concluded that you need some intensive anger management counseling .
If you think that your spewings change people 's minds you are sadly mistaken .
It does n't even make people angry , instead they feel sorry for you that you have chosen to slosh around in pig dung instead of , like Brad , helping to change the world .
In fact , maybe you could start your own blog and attract the type of people you cater to , like more haters and disparagers .
Your free speech clearly shows that you , my fellow American , have chosen to rely on hate , insult , inuendo , scandal , and outright lies to try to make a point that you do n't like Brad and the people he associates with .
OK , point made .
Who cares .
Oh I forgot , Karl Rove and his minions care , maybe you could apply for a job there , fits you well .

This is n't a personal attack against you Socrates .
I really do want to understand what your saying .
I have met Brad , and I trust what he 's saying , do I like it when I put my own foot in my mouth and get publicly proven wrong ?
No I do n't , but I suck it up when I do .
I have n't been wrong about my opinion and knowledge of electronic vote tabulation devices .
With that nobody can argue .
They might argue about the US Constitution with me .
But I ai n't a lawyer .
They might argue about the trickle down effect of electronic vote tabulation devices ..
e.g. it 's the corrupt candidates that are raping us .
They might be right ..
But you know what , it all has to start somewhere , and I hope that your not going anywhere .
Face down the questions you have and get answers .
Follow the rules because not everyone has the same ISP or TOS or policy .
They 're a lot more open than your thinking .
Look at all the crap they have put up with , with me !!
I am not sure I could handle it .
And I am being honest .
I am looking for direction too , but I also know some things in my heart about right and wrong .
And no unconstitutional law of the land is going to change what I know .
Or even what I swore an oath to in the USAF .
I hope other comments in this thread do n't make it to where your not welcome .
I still value your input and I share your frustration .
My life has turned to crap over the last few years .
Most people I know have given up .
They simply can not make a living and deal with it anymore .
So they decided to not deal with this crap and just go live their life .
I envy them .
I wish I could .
But I can't .
I chose a different road back in 1981 back when I raised my hand and took that god damned oath ..

If you take a hard look at Mike Connell by visiting the links provided in previous comments , it becomes more and more difficult to believe Connell was not involved , on any level , in the fraud .
Connell was a playah .
He goes way back and if he 's clean as a whistle , I 'll eat my whistle .
So , what gives here when " the spoon " says he has no evidence Connell was in on the fraud .
If Connell was truly threatened by Rove cause he knows where the shit is buried , we may have the biggest story since Watergate , in that this one may see the rats actually turning on each other .
Is it possible Connell is just " the unwitting tech guy " , a loyal scrub ?
I 'm not buying it .
Connell appears too deeply rooted in the shit since he was in College .
But if they got Connell to turn , then it 's best to keep him as clean as possible .
Either way , something just does n't fit .
These rodents do n't turn that easy .
Then again , if " the spoon " really does have the shit on them , ie heavy duty IT trails of unscrubbable techno poo , then the shit might really be hitting the fan .
Here 's my best guess : " The spoon " appears to be the kind of guy who does n't cast aspersions without facts to back aspersions up .
Sounds to me like " the spoon " has serious IT evidence fraud happened in the 2004 election , but no evidence Connell is guilty .
So it would n't be ethical or practical to cast aspersions on Connell .
If Connell is as smart as they say , then perhaps they will never be able to tie him to fraud .
Think about that one .
The question is , will he tie Rove and others to fraud ?
If Rove got freaked by " the spoon " ... who knows .
This story has legs .
We shall see .

Paladin-
Then again , if " the spoon " really does have the shit on them , ie heavy duty IT trails of unscrubbable techno poo , then the shit might really be hitting the fan .
While it would be great if they did have the " smoking gun " my experience with the stolen Mexican Presidential election tells me that the " techno poo " is pretty much incomprehensable to the general public and therefore of limited value .
For the Mexican election , election experts and statisticians ( some even from the U.S. ) poured over the numbers and showed how they were likely to have been manipulated , but the corporate press was doing it 's best " sore loser " pressure and the already installed politicos did their best to scuttle any substantial recount .
Did anyone else here pay attention to that election , or is everybody only interested in what happens to US ?
The mexican people were even " prepared " for a theft , seeing how AMLO was almost gamed out of even being on the ballot by the conservative oligarchy .
Activists were scattered throughout the country with their cell phone cams ready for the fraud and they still got away with it .
There was even some people on this board recently that advocated boycotting elections that use riggable electronic vote tabulating devices , like the Zapatistas did in Mexico , in the hopes that if the turnout is low enough , then the global community will see the election as a Fraud similar to the situation in Zimbabwe .
Well that wo n't work either as the MSM narrative will plow ahead with or without our votes .
As Phil @6 accurately states
We no longer HAVE TIME to learn .
We have to get rid of this shit .
So how do we get rid of this shit ?
Well I have an idea .
The only thing left IMO , for election integrity activist to be able to prove that the electronic vote tabulating devices are hackable and that recent elections have been stolen is to … ,
STEAL THE ELECTION FOR CYNTHIA MCKINNEY !!
Only “ stealing ” the election in such an absurd way that makes it obvious that the vote was hacked , will force the Corporate Media and the Public alike , to confront the seriousness of the issue at hand .
Seriously , can you imagine on election night , what the talking heads would do when the first results came in as 1 .
McKinney , 2 . Kucinich , 3 . Ron Paul , with Obama and McCain tied for 4th , , and continued that way for the rest of the night ?
They would shit their pants because they would know that McKinney cannot be allowed to win after the Dem / Repub .
hype , and that the only way not to seat her would be to admit that the vote was hacked .
All the ex-post - facto trying to " catch " them has n't worked , and as others have pointed out , even if you catch them doing shady shit , like voting machine " sleepovers , " once installed and sworn into office , it 's too late .
There should even be a prize for the hacker (s ) that can pull it off and then show how they did it .
Perhaps even , a website called “ StealitforCynthia.com ” or such where persons could organize the “ theft , ” and could generate buzz and get a few more people to actually vote for her .
Maybe even inject the meme into the media , satirically , that those last minute voters put McKinney over the top .
Ah… , it would almost be like a real stolen election , only better .
Feel free to spread this idea , as I hope Brad and Bev will use their connects to help make this happen .
Cheers !

Dear New Constitutional Convention ,
No offense , bro ... but I really do n't like your post above for the following reasons :
The first part is defeatist .
You seem to believe that , since Mexico could n't punish the fixers , we wo n't be able to punish them either .
No , I 'm not having that .
Every case is different and so is this .
For me , it 's down to " the spoon " .
I 'm fascinated by The Spoon 's involvement .
( more on " the spoon " shortly ) .
I listened to him discuss the facts of this case in that 8 part press conference with Arnebeck .
The spoon is everything Rove would NEVER want to face in court .
Rove is " the man " when it comes to spin and win , lie or die , cheat defeat ... but ROVE AINT AN IT GUY .
IT guys are the sharks , lions and GODS of their world and laymen who think they can talk their talk are going to end up swimming with the fishes .
Mike Connell is Rove 's IT guy .
The Spoon said that he 's worked with Connel , so Connel knows how bad ass the spoon is .
If Connell is afraid of the spoon , then Rove must know the spoon stepped in his " stinky IT poo " , and stinky IT poo is probably the only poo Rove can't a ) understand from a technical standoint
b ) clean from an illegal standpoint
Think about it .
If the IT poo really stinks and the spoon has smelled it , he knows who dealt it .
That would leave Rove with three options .
1 . Have Connell fall on his sword .
2. " Neutralize " the spoon .
3. Accept defeat
The spoon is the only thing in this case which gives me the kind of hope necessary to believe Rove could actually go down here .
let me repeat that with big bold letters " THE SPOON " IS THE ONLY THING IN THIS CASE WHICH GIVES ME THE KIND OF HOPE NECESSARY TO BELIEVE ROVE COULD ACTUALLY GO DOWN HERE ( The spoon is also a republican .
More on the spoon later . )
As for your second proposition , I 'll assume you 're just joking and not really suggesting anybody break the law and stoop to the level of that which is wrong with the USA today .
The joke is n't funny .

MUST READ PRIOR RAW STORY FEATURE ON " THE SPOON'S " PRESS CONFERENCE AND HIS ONGOING WORK EXPOSING ELECTRONIC TAMPERING OF ELECTIONS
This is an excellent piece written by Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 18 , 2008 READ ALL ABOUT IT
Some quotes : A leading cyber - security expert and former adviser to Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) says he has fresh evidence regarding election fraud on Diebold electronic voting machines during the 2002 Georgia gubernatorial and senatorial elections ...
Spoonamore is one of the most prominent cyber - security experts in the country .
He has appeared on CNN's Lou Dobbs and ABC's World News Tonight , and has security clearances from his work with the intelligence community and other government agencies , as well as the Department of Defense , and is one of the world ’s leading authorities on hacking and cyber- espionage ...
Spoonamore received the Diebold patch from a whistleblower close to the office of Cathy Cox , Georgia ’s then - Secretary of State .
In discussions with RAW STORY , the whistleblower --- who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation --- said that he became suspicious of Diebold 's actions in Georgia for two reasons .
The first red flag went up when the computer patch was installed in person by Diebold CEO Bob Urosevich , who flew in from Texas and applied it in just two counties , DeKalb and Fulton , both Democratic strongholds .
The source states that Cox was not privy to these changes until after the election and that she became particularly concerned over the patch being installed in just those two counties ...
Individuals close to Arnebeck 's office said Spoonamore confirmed that the patch included nothing to repair a clock problem .
Instead , he identified two parallel programs , both having the full software code and even the same audio instructions for the deaf .
Spoonamore said he could not understand the need for a second copy of the exact same program --- and without access to the machine for which the patch was designed , he could not learn more .
Instead , he said he took the evidence to the Cyber - Security Division of the Department of Justice and reported the series of events to authorities .
The Justice Department has not yet acted on his report ...
Spoonamore also confirmed he 's working with Connell on overseas election issues and that Connell is now working as John McCain 's IT developer ...
Sources close to Spoonamore said he was very concerned that he would lose his contracts as a result of coming forward and would take a " large financial hit . "
These sources added that , despite his concerns , Spoonamore felt obligated to reveal what he knows to the public .
" He felt he had no choice as an American citizen but to come forward , and he also knows the likely consequences of him doing so , " one source said ...

KEY POINTS TO CONSIDER : OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE AND ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE ASKED ARNEBECK FOR DIRECTION REGARDING WHO SHOULD BE INDICTED . and PRESIDENTIAL PARDON POWER IS NOT APPLICABLE IN OHIO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS
From reading the comments all over the web on this story , it 's obv most do not understand the gravity and depth to which this case has already been catapulted .
Arnebeck and the Ohio Attorney General 's Office are cooperating , and such cooperation has been presented to Judge Marbley in Arnebeck 's recent motion to lift the stay .
The following is taken from Arnebeck 's motion : " A central part of the settlement negotiations in this case was the possibility that the Attorney General 's Office , under power granted by House Bill 3 to investigate election fraud , would open such a criminal investigation ...
After being advised that the criminal division of the office of the Ohio Attorney General had been organized , counsel for plaintiffs made a formal and public referral of the evidence of criminal activity in the suppression of voters and tampering with votes that had occurred in the 2004 presidential election ...
Upon being advised in regard to the limited resources of the criminal division of the Ohio Attorney General 's office , and its preference that their involvement begin at the point where specific targets for indictment had been identified , plaintiff 's counsel advised the criminal division that plaintiffs would proceed with the civil case for the purpose of further developing the evidence in the case ... "
There 's much defeatist commentary going on that all of this will be swept under the table as per the Rove norm , but most of that fear is based on erroneous assumptions that the Dept. of Justice or FBI will simply look the other way to quash it all in a cover up .
Rejoice , the Feds have no standing to interfere with the criminal prosecution mentioned above .
What about a presidential pardon of the perps by Bush ?
While the underlying civil case has been brought in Federal Court , the Ohio AG and Secretary of State will be looking into the Criminal charges .
The most obvious charges are for Criminal Contempt as to the order issued by Ohio's Secretary of State to preserve the ballots .
But presidential pardons only extend to Federal crimes , not to state court convictions .
Under the Constitution , only federal criminal convictions , such as those obtained in the United States District Courts , may be pardoned by the President .
" Criminal contempt " carries a sentence for acts of " bad behavior " , just like any other crime , as opposed to traditional contempt where a witness refuses to testify and is held until they comply .
The criminal contempt sentence is ordered for a set term by a judge after the accused is found guilty by a jury .
In this case , the " bad behavior " involved the failure of various Ohio board of election officials who were subject to the Ohio Secretary of State 's order to preserve all ballots from the 2004 presidential election .
Now , " imagine " that Karl Rove organized the effort to have these ballots destroyed .
Rove would then be subject to criminal contempt charges in Ohio as well and the President would not have the power to pardon him .
Back to Arnebeck 's motion to lift the stay :
The suspected lead perpetrator of this conspiracy against the civil rights of the plaintiffs and against the rule of law in the United States is Karl Rove ...
Of course , the Ohio AG wo n't be limited to just contempt , all possible criminal activity involved with the 2004 election can be the subject of Ohio indictments / prosecutions as well as any attempts to cover up such criminal activity .
That includes obstruction of justice and perjury .

PMG -
In regard to pardons , I 'd also add that Cliff Arnebeck , in my interview with him on the PBC Show Friday ( audio posted here ) noted that Presidential pardons are not available for convictions in civil RICO cases , which Arnebeck is compiling .
More such notable tidbits were also dropped in that interview , as linked above .

Great clip .
I watched the whole documentary of course .
What bugs me about this thread is that there are people who still think that only close races can be gamed .
That simply is not so .
If there is a large voter turnout and 100 % of the voters vote for Obama in ' 08 , the machines can still say that McCain won .
Of course the exit polls would n't be able to find a single McCain voter , but nobody bothers about exit polls because the mass media says they are unreliable .
So McCain would be installed as President and the election fraud industry would spend the next four years writing books and articles and making documentary films about how nobody voted for McCain and the election was rigged , but would be unable to remove McCain from office unless Congress wanted to , and Congress usually does n't want to .
The other thing that I find strange watching this clip is how Bob Fitrakis , Greg Palast , and Brad Friedman are unequivocal about how the elections can be stolen , yet are still encouraging people to vote in 100 % faith - based elections .
I guess that 's so that they can collect evidence of yet another stolen presidential election to write more blog posts and articles and books about .
And they get to be in all those groovy documentary films .
But at least I 'm no longer alone in urging people to refrain from voting until and unless we get honest elections .
Check this out : Abstinence
It may seem un -American of me , but I do n't urge people to bet on fixed races , play in crooked card games , buy worthless stock , or vote in rigged elections .
Must be some kind of personality disorder .

This whole talk about prosecution may be null and void .
Watch this video which is a two minute " Cafferty Report " excerpt from Blitzer 's Situation Room earlier in the week , I do n't know which day .
In the house and senate legislation which will redefine hwo enemies are treated is a provision that gives immunity to Bush and all his administration from prosecution for war crimes .
I am cynical enough , with all of the avoidance of impeachment hearings from Democratic leadership , to believe that Nancy pelosi had a hand in writing this legislation as an underhand attempt to immunize herself also ( along with the rest of the complicit Democratic leadership . )
Cafferty has the cajones to call " bullshit " .
Also , this passage of this legislation would take the heat off of Obama for any criminal prosecution of Bush admin when he takes office .
How convenient .
How sickeningly shamefully convenient .

Does anyone know if this particular piece passed house and senate , and that the immunity provision is n't already in play ?

ARNEBECK INTERVIEWED BY VOTE RESCUE RADIO , July 25th , 2008 - CONTRADICTS PRIOR ASSERTION THAT OHIO ATTORNEY GENERAL IS " INTERESTED " IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
A closer examination of Arnebeck 's most recent statements , given during two separate radio interviews this past Friday , July 25th , indicate his backpedaling away from July 18th statements that the Ohio Secretary of State and the Ohio Attorney General 's office were interested in taking on a narrowly defined criminal investigation .
This story is too damn important for there to be contradictions of the following magnitude uttered by the lead counsel on this case .
God knows , I want to see that any criminal behavior is prosecuted .
( See my previous posts in this thread . )
But in our zeal for justice , we must be vigilant , whether as journalists , bloggers or simple commentators ( ie my words here ) , to present all of the facts , evidence and testimony relevant to propel the discussion forward , whether it helps or hinders our personal opinions and hopes .
If we do not present a fair and balanced account , we become part of the problem , part of the disease , the cancer of deception sweeping through the anatomy of our political system .
The comments Arnebeck made while being interviewed by Vote Rescue Radio this past Friday , July 25 , 2008 , with regard to possible interest by Ohio government officials in bringing criminal indictments , are significantly different than the ones he gave in the press conference on July 18th , 2008 .
Tune in to " part 1 " of the July 25th program .
At 34:48 , Arnebeck utters the quote which has me very confused and annoyed .
Arnebeck said :
We filed a case in August of 2006 alleging an ongoing Civil Rights conspiracy to deprive African American and young liberal college voters of their voting rights .
And in the 2006 election , democrats gained the Attorney General 's office , and Secretary of State 's office and Governor 's office which broke the many year monopoly that the Republican party had had over the Government in Ohio .
After that election , the Attorney General and the Secretary of State publicly indicated that they wanted to try to settle election cases that had been filed against their predecessors .
So we entered into settlement negotiations and that involved asking the court to stay the case pending those negotiations .
We reached a point where the Attorney General 's office did not want to commence a criminal investigation .
And we indicated that in that case , we wanted to resume our civil case , conduct discovery and complete on the civil side .
And if we got to the point where witnesses refused to answer on the grounds that the answer might incriminate them , uh , we would then , again , seek the assistance of the Attorney General to either grant immunity or precede with indictment .
That 's where we are today .
Now compare what Arnebeck said here with what he said at the July 18th press conference .
In that presser , he referenced a far more juicy fact pattern wherein the Ohio Attorney General 's office was ready to begin a criminal contempt investigation but , due to their " limited resources " , they would prefer to go after indictments of specifically defined targets as opposed to a broad sweeping grand jury investigation .
In the July 18th presser , Arnebeck also indicated that the Ohio officials , after reviewing the body of evidence , forwarded by Arnebeck , alleging criminal fraud in the 2004 election , asked Arnebneck , " Who do you want to indict ? "
In no way is that consistent with what he said to Vote Rescue Radio on July 25th , one week after the July 18th presser .
His Vote Rescue radio interview completely leaves out any mention that the Ohio Attorney General has shown interest in a criminal investigation .
During his interview on the Peter B. Collins radio show later that evening , Arnebeck , in response to accurately worded questions by Brad Friedman about the possibility of Ohio government officials prosecuting a criminal investigation , appeared to be backpedaling away from his prior July 18th statements .
During Brad 's questioning , concerning the missing ballots Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner ordered be preserved , the following Q & A took place : Brad : Now , Cliff , will that be dealt with by Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner ?
I did speak with her about this some time ago and she told me she was very concerned about some of these , in some cases , nonsensical excuses for the destruction of the ballots ...
Is it gonna be the Secretary of State who brings accountability here , or will that come through the law suit that you are continuing to work on ?
I know it was Judge Marbley who was the one who is the judge you 're dealing with and I know the judge who gave the order to retain those ballots .
So what would be the , sort of , the chain of custody for getting accountability from those counties prior to 2008 ?
Arnebeck :
Well , I think that 's a responsibility that we have as plaintiffs , we 're the ones that asked that the material be preserved and we will discharge our responsibility with , I expect , the Secretary of State being as interested as we are in hearing the answers to the follow up questions as to what went wrong ?
This is a far cry from Arnebeck 's July 18th statements which portray a far more engaged Ohio Secretary of State and Attorney General .
For example , see Velvet Revolution 's analysis of Arnebeck 's July 18th press conference : Arnebeck explained that part of the reason for the stay , at the time , was to allow the Ohio Attorney General to proceed first ...
Arnebeck said that the Attorney General 's office said they were ready to begin the investigation of the 2004 presidential election in Ohio , and Arnebeck said he submitted a great deal of material to them ...
About a month later , the Attorney General 's office contacted Arnebeck and asked him , " Who do you want to indict ? "
Arnebeck explained that the AG's " concept of looking at this from a criminal standpoint was not to convene a grand jury and cast the net broadly and use the grand jury process to investigate and narrow the focus into the question of who may have tampered with those votes .
But rather they wanted us to come to them with a more focused case . "
Arnebeck then informed the AG that they were going to file the motion to lift the stay so that the plaintiffs " could proceed with the civil case in order to collect discovery to do that " and create a more focused case .
Arnebeck 's latest interviews offer a much more toned down description of Ohio government officials ' attitude towards criminal prosecution here .
We need to know why .
If Arnebeck did not give an accurate portrayal of Secretary of State Brunner 's interest , and the Ohio Attorney General 's interest in seeking criminal indictments then Arnebeck needs to make a direct clarification about this .
And if his original statements were accurate , then we need to know why he 's backing off of them now .
But let 's also keep in mind that Arnebeck 's motion to lift the stay contains language supporting his July 18th statements about the Ohio Attorney General 's enthusiasm for a criminal investigation as to specifically defined targets .
This leads weight to the possibilty that , at least prior to July 18th , Ohio officials were expressing serious interest to Arnebeck in possibly seeking criminal indictments , since it would be very of stupid for Arnebeck to purposely mislead Judge Marbley , who , I 'm sure , would verify with the Ohio Attorney General any statements attributed to him by Arnebeck .
We need clarification as to why Arnebeck has toned down his language on this issue .
How about it , Brad ?

Voting in faith - based elections or violent revolution ?
Are you totally unaware that when the Irish government tried to bring in electronic voting machines , the Irish people simply refused to vote on them and they had to be warehoused ?
Are you totally unaware that it was an election boycott that finally discredited the Apartheid regime in South Africa , after which they could no longer claim to be democratically elected or have the support of their people ?
In order to demand honest elections , the demand has to be credible .
To say , " We demand honest elections and if we do n't get them we will continue to vote in rigged elections , " is not a credible demand .
To say , " We demand honest elections and we wo n't vote until we get them , " is a credible demand .
Why do you think a " Decider " and a totally unaccountable Congress bother to hold elections anyway ?
They want to keep pretending to the world that they are democratically elected and that they have the support of the American people for their violations of the Constition , erosion of civil rights , and wars of aggression .
All you do when you vote is give credence to their pretense .
Do n't vote --- it only encourages 'em !
If elections could change anything , they 'd be illegal .
And as the late , great George Carlin said , " If you vote , you can't complain . "
You gave away your mandate to whoever the machines elected , and many of us do not appreciate you throwing away our democracy in such a cavalier manner and criticizing us for refusing to do the same .
No in November
You may think that you 're doing something , but what you are doing is allowing a third presidential election in a row to be stolen just so that the election fraud industry can collect evidence of the theft and spend the next four years blogging about it , writing books , and making videos , while millions more innocents die in Afghanistan and Iraq .
What you are doing is collaborating in war crimes .
Are you proud of yourself for doing that ?

And by the way , Agent 99 , there are no " Abstinence Documentaries . "
About 50 % of the U.S. electorate does n't vote and the only time they were asked why not , in a Zogby poll commissioned by Paul Lehto , most said it was because they did not feel that anyone on the ballot would represent their interests .
It is a fact that half of all Americans do not feel represented , and the big money that rules this country does n't finance documentaries to publicize that fact .
It is in their fiscal interests to encourage people to vote in rigged elections and to ignore the half of the U.S. population that is enduring taxation without representation .
The election fraud industry , people like Brad , Greg Palast , Bob Fitrakis , and others , derive their livelihood from exposing stolen elections .
I 'm a low - income senior on Social Security and I do n't get a dime for what I write .
My sole interest in advocating an election boycott to discredit an illegitimate government is to attempt to ensure for my grandchildren the democracy that I myself do not have and which was supposed to be my birthright .
Remember the Creekside Declaration that Brad signed on to calling for citizen ownership of transparent participatory democracy ?
How does allowing a third presidential election in a row to be stolen , for the sole purpose of collecting evidence that a third presidential election in a row was stolen , further that goal ?
It does n't .

I rarely visit 911 Blogger anymore because a bunch of people making their living on our misery can regularly be found there .
I even get sick of the election integrity " activists " for making more noise than headway .
MY POINT IS THAT YOUR SHIT ABOUT BOYCOTTING THE VOTE ISN'T AN IOTA DIFFERENT .
Do n't give me this crap about there not being Abstinence documentaries .
There were n't election fraud documentaries before decent , bodhisattva , dedicated people started working on the problem .
ALL ACTIVISM TURNS INTO IDENTITY POLITICS WITH TOO MUCH INEFFECTIVENESS THE LONGER IT TAKES TO FIX THE PROBLEM .
I happen to know that Brad breaks his butt trying to get legislators and litigators to FIX this .
He may have been so sleep - deprived he missed a couple opportunities to be more effective over the years , but he keeps DOING things that would have been effective if criminals were n't running our country .
Besides his continued insistence that he 's a citizen journalist , reporting this stuff so WE can do something about it , is meaningful too .
Your idea is completely ill - conceived , deserves to be dismissed out of hand , and I 'm not following your stupid links until you can explain how not making them steal our votes to get what they want is better than making them steal our votes to get what they want .

I do n't speak for Greg or Bob , but for my part , I object to your notion on the grounds that , among other things , it 's completely wrong in virtually every word .
How does allowing a third presidential election in a row to be stolen , for the sole purpose of collecting evidence that a third presidential election in a row was stolen , further that goal ?
If that 's what you think is accomplished by voting this year , no wonder you do n't care to vote .

Brad ,
In the July 18th presser , Arnebeck made a big deal about the Ohio AG allegedly being interested in going forward with criminal indictments based upon Arnebeck 's presentation of evidence .
Arnebeck clearly indictaed the AG was interested in seeking indictments once the field of possible defendants was narrowed down by further discovery in the civil case .
But Arneback 's interview with Vote Rescue radio does n't include language to that effectt .
Nobody listening to that interview would think the AG was
considering any criminal action .
" We reached a point where the Attorney General 's office did not want to commence a criminal investigation . "
That 's light years away from what Arnebeck said on July 18th .
According to Arnebeck , the only activity left on the table for the AG to get involved would be if a witness in the civil case , should the stay be lifted , refused to testify by taking the 5th amendment : " And we indicated that in that case , we wanted to resume our civil case , conduct discovery and complete on the civil side .
And if we got to the point where witnesses refused to answer on the grounds that the answer might incriminate them , uh , we would then , again , seek the assistance of the Attorney General to either grant immunity or precede with indictment .
That 's where we are today . "
You 're telling me you do n't see a shift in policy here ?
Arnebeck says nothing about the Ohio AG being interested in bringing criminal contempt charges or any criminal charges at all .
Later that night , when you asked Arnebeck about who 's responsibility it was , plaintiffs or the Secretary of State , to seek justice for the ballots going missing , he said it was plaintiff 's responsibility , and he never mentioned the AG or SOS having any interest in seeking indictments .
First , I do n't agree with him at all that it 's plaintiff 's responsibility to seek justice as to the ballots having gone missing .
The ballots were the subject of an official order by the Secretary of State .
The ballots are gone .
This involves blatant disregard for an official order .
It 's prima facie contempt and it's up to the government to enforce that order , not plaintiffs .
THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING ITS OWN ORDERS .
Plaintiffs have paid a fee , filed a case and are entitled to prove their case .
They asked that evidence be preserved .
The Secretary fo State ORDERED the evidence be preserved .
THE EVIDENCE WAS NOT PRESERVED .
What kind of kangaroo court is this where plaintiff 's must find a way to nring the culprits to justice for breaking the law ?
There 's nothing in these radio interviews which indicates the Government is taking any further action to seek criminal indictments .
But the July 18th presser included multiple statements that the AG was very interested in seeking specific indictments based upon evidence already presented .
Why was this language left out of the radio interviews ?
It 's a fair question .

Paladin @ 16 , sorry if you misunderstood what I was getting at , but I was n't joking .
Let me address your second critisizm first and work backwords .
As for your second proposition , I 'll assume you 're just joking and not really suggesting anybody break the law and stoop to the level of that which is wrong with the USA today .
The joke is n't funny .
The people that steal elections for real , due so with the intent of siezing office .
It 's not stooping to any level if the intention is not actually to hold the office , but rather to point out the lack of integrity of the system .
That was the point of choosing McKinney , but I realize now that was perhaps too subtle , so how about as an alternative , stealing the election for the Ficus tree that Michael Moore was trying to get elected .
That would sure razz O'Lielly and Limbaugh if the results came in on election night came in with the Ficus ahead of Obama and McCain .
I feel it 's the only thing that will force the public to confront the problem and dump the machines and start looking at the evidence of past stolen elections .
To address your first critisism , that I 'm defeatist because of what happened in Mexico , well that was just one example of the international struggle for election justice , but it's not the sole basis for my concluding that we should steal the election for McKinney the Ficus .
I 'm not a defeatist , but a realist because I 've been paying attention to history , including this Blog and and Bev's , and the media in general .
I 've also chronicalled prohibition laws in this country , especially in regards to cannabis , which had me acknowleding the fascist tilt of the Government well before the False Flag 9/11 .
I 'm a realist because admit that treason and warcrimes have been overlooked by our government for political reasons long before the Cheney administration .
In the face of a criminal government , it is a strategical error to dismiss out of hand , tactics that are " illegal . "
Should ill people not use medical cannabis simply because to due so would be to violate federal law ?
If the criminal government set up cages called " Free Speach Zones , " should people refrain from speaking their mind outside of them ?
Would you have advised Rosa Parks and her fellow activist against conducting their bus protest because it was " illegal ? "
I am reminded of the words of MLK
It is a sad fact that because of comfort , complacency , a morbid fear of communism , and our proneness to adjust to injustice , the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch antirevolutionaries .
Stealing the election for the Ficus would force the country to IMMEDIATELY recognize the work of " spoon " and Brad and Bev and others , help to get rid of the riggable machines , and due so without sitting another " unelected " President .
That is , of course you still do n't get it and would actually try to swear into office a Ficus .

PMG - I did n't get the sense from the original info from the press conference ( I was on the road at the time , so did n't hear it directly , but edited Steve Heller 's piece on it ) that Arnebeck indicated indictments were imminent , as you suggest .
It might be his reference to prior discussions with the OH AG concerning who should be indicted , that gave you that impression .
That seems to have been , from my understanding , what was asked previously when the AG was leading the investigation .
Sense I get from speaking directly with Arnebeck and Fitrakis ( behind the scenes , as well as in the radio interview you referred to ) is that it was because the AG failed to do the investigation they were supposed to do that now the plaintiff attorneys wish to take the task back from the , and seek clearance from the court ( lift of stay ) to do so .
Apologies if I 'm still misunderstanding , but I still do not see a contradiction or backing off from Arnebeck , following the presser .

I wo n't vote until I can vote in honest elections .
You 're the one giving up and saying that , well , if you can't have honest elections this year , you 'll vote anyway and maybe try to prevent the fourth and fifth presidential elections in 2012 and 2016 from being stolen , but you 've given up on 2008 and will vote however they allow you to in November .

And why do you think that encouraging others to vote in 100 % faith - based elections and let the election fairy tell them who won , is virtuous ?
Brad responded : I presume you 're talking to someone else .
I do n't believe it's " virtuous " .
I 'll fight for your right to not vote , if you wish to , as much as I 'll fight to make sure those who do wish to vote get to , and get to see that their vote is counted accurately as cast .
Well , since you describe not voting in rigged elections as " idiotic " and " ridiculous " how can you blame me for assuming that you believe that voting in rigged elections is smart and sensible ?
And exactly how to you intend to see that votes cast in faith - based elections are counted accurately by the election fairy ?
Brad wrote : Encouraging people not to vote is idiotic and will serve no purpose other than to make it easier for bad guys to rule the day .
The bad guys ALREADY rule the day , Brad .
They own the voting machine companies .
And they 've stacked the courts and the Justice Department .
When you prove that an election was stolen there is no place to take your proof except right here on your own blog because Mukasey is n't going to prosecute even if Bush allowed Pelosi to let Conyers ask him to .
I wrote :
Are you totally unaware that when the Irish government tried to bring in electronic voting machines , the Irish people simply refused to vote on them and they had to be warehoused ?
Brad replied : Yes .
I am .
As I believe I 've already told you via email , your Irish anecdote is wholly without substance .
Sorry , it did n't happen the way you seem to believe it did .
Not even close .
Well , that 's what Catherine Ansbro had told me .
But there is no way that you will get honest elections by continuing to demonstrate your willingness to vote in rigged elections .
I wrote :
In order to demand honest elections , the demand has to be credible .
Brad replied : Right .
And it 's our job to make it so .
( Or , in your case , apparently , your job to simply give up and let the bad guys win without a fight . )
So what is your credible demand ?
I wrote :
To say , " We demand honest elections and we wo n't vote until we get them , " is a credible demand .
Brad replied : " Credible " ?
Or idiotic .
When you offer evidence that your brilliant scheme will have any effect on anything at all ( other than to make it easier for bad guys to own the day ) let me know .
Brad , since you know that by continuing to vote in rigged elections you are making it easier for the bad guys to own the day , as they have for the past seven years , why do you think that continuing to vote in what your yourself called 100 % faith - based elections is such a brilliant idea ?
I wrote :
The election fraud industry , people like Brad , Greg Palast , Bob Fitrakis , and others , derive their livelihood from exposing stolen elections .
Brad replied : I do n't speak for Greg or Bob , but for my part , I object to your notion on the grounds that , among other things , it 's completely wrong in virtually every word .
Then what other possible reason is there for you all to be encouraging people to continue to vote in rigged elections which will continue to let the bad guys rule the day as they have for the past seven years ?
I wrote :
How does allowing a third presidential election in a row to be stolen , for the sole purpose of collecting evidence that a third presidential election in a row was stolen , further that goal ?
Brad replied :
If that 's what you think is accomplished by voting this year , no wonder you do n't care to vote .
Fortunately , most folks here seem to know better , as based on actual reality , versus the unsupported nonsense you are posting here .
You left out the goal that I was asking you about .
You signed on to the Creekside Declaration .
It calls for citizen - owned transparent participatory democracy .
I asked how continuing to vote in faith - based elections furthers that goal .
You had said that you were going to judge your action by that standard .
You did not respond to the question .
You also left out the demand that YOU make , which is , " We demand honest , transparent elections or else we will continue to vote in faith - based elections . "
THAT is not a credible demand .
I remember when you called me a fool for saying that Bowen had n't decertified the voting machines .
Well , she had n't .
It is n't just the faith - based election process .
Even if Bush and Cheney were impeached and tried for war crimes , even if first Pelosi and then Obama became President , the bad guys will still rule the day , if by bad guys you mean those guilty of torture , wars of aggression , and crimes against humanity .
The war crimes have been funded until 2010 , so no matter who becomes President , the genocides in Afghanistan and Iraq will continue unabated .
If by " bad guys " you are n't referring to war criminals guilty of crimes against humanity , just who do you mean by bad guys ?
According to the Nuremberg Principles , wars of aggression are the worst crimes against humanity .
Was the Nuremberg Tribunal wrong .
Are there worse crimes than that ?
Do we need to vote for war criminals because otherwise there might be somebody in power who could do something worse than vote for and fund crimes against humanity ?
Who are these bad guys and what is it that I 'm supposed to be worried about that is worse than crimes against humanity ?
Believe me , Brad , if there are people worse than war criminals and crimes worse than wars of aggression , I 'd do anything in my power to try to prevent them .
It is n't just the faith - based elections ---
I wo n't vote for war criminals or give my mandate to a government guilty of crimes against humanity that had already funded them until 2010 and is committed to them no matter who becomes President or who is in Congress .
What is it that you think it is so important to vote against that you 'd even risk voting in a 100 % faith - based election to try to do it ?
Tell me , because if there is something that important , I 'll vote too .
Who are the bad guys who might take power ?
Obama and McCain both voted to fund the war crimes until 2010 no matter which of them becomes President .
They do n't seem to care , so why do you ?
Could you for once refrain from ridicule and just answer a simple question ?
Who are the bad guys and what is it they might do that is worse than what the bad guys in power are already doing ?
In 2000 were told told that if we did n't vote for Gore , the bad guys would win .
So we voted for Gore and the bad guys won .
In 2004 we were told that if we did n't vote for Kerry , the bad guys would win .
So we voted for Kerry and the bad guys won .
What has changed since then ?
Did we get rid of the voting machines ?
No .
Did we get rid of the corrupt elections officials ?
No .
Did we bar the mainstream media from announcing the " results " ?
No .
Did we change the composition of the Supreme Court ?
No .
We did change the composition of Congress , but it has n't changed the way they vote .
If there are any good guys on the ballot , in a two - party system without proportional representation , they can't win anyway .

Both partieis have both voted for crimes against humanity .
Both parties have funded crimes against humanity .
Both parties are committed to continuing the crimes against humanity .
The Republicans support the crimes against humanity fervently .
The Democrats claim to support the crimes against humanity only reluctantly ( they say that if Bush or Ralph Nader had n't held a gun to their heads and forced them to vote for crimes against humanity , they might not have done so , at least not after learning they were based on lies ) , but they say that since we are already deeply entrenched in crimes against humanity , we can't stop committing crimes against humanity now .
Perhaps some time in the future they might consider it .
To talk to a Republican is like talking to somebody who is bashing an infant 's skull against a wall and smiling .
To talk to a Democrat is like talking to somebody who is bashing an infant 's skull against a wall and telling you to go away and stop bothering them because the Republicans made them do it or Ralph Nader made them do it , and in any event , since they 're already doing it , they can't stop now , so shut up and go away , and if you 'll just shut up and go away and remember to vote for them , they might consider someday stopping what they 're doing -- long after the infant 's skull is shattered and it is dead , of course .
Only it is millions of infants , not just one .
" There are no good guys .
There are no bad guys .
There 's only you and me and we just disagree . "

But if Ken Blackwell is as corrupt and nefarious as this clip implies , why did he LOSE his race for Governor of Ohio ?
Could n't he have just flipped the result ?
I do n't care for black - box votes , myself .
But the Blackwell loss ( which is n't mentioned in the clip ) is evidence against the thesis .
STRONG evidence , IMHO .

AN investigation has been launched into claims that cheeky cops are said to have left a fridge - magnet calling card after smashing into the wrong house .
Officers hunting a criminal recalled to prison for breaching his release conditions broke into the home of a couple in Oldham .
The family came home to find a hole in their back door , police in the yard , and fridge magnets rearranged to spell " OLDHAM TASK FORCE CALLED " .
Police bosses have launched an investigation .
Aaron West , his partner Leeanne Baker , and their two - year - old son Leighton had only moved into the rented house in Letham Street , Hathershaw , 11 days earlier .
Mr West , 20 , said : " It 's pathetic and childish .
I want a written apology .
" We came back from shopping to find the back door smashed in and on the kitchen work top .
" The police here did n't tell us much , so I went to the station to ask why .
" But when I told the desk sergeant I did n't know who they were looking for , they just were n't interested .
" When I came home I noticed the fridge magnets had been rearranged and said : `OLDHAM TASK FORCE CALLED '.
" These are for children , they 're not for the police to leave a message they 've raided your house .
" It makes me feel they 're treating me like some sort of scruff , basically something on the bottom of their shoe and they 're laughing at me .
" I do n't find it a laughing matter when my two - year - old son is in bed with a wooden door that can easily be pulled off every night . "
Mr West said he has only slept for about four hours since the raid .
His partner , Leeanne , wears hearing aids and is afraid to be in the house on her own in case she does n't hear someone breaking in through the boarded up door .
" My son ca n't play in the back garden and I 've had to write to the chief constable to ask for a new door .
I want a written apology so I can show it to my neighbours .
" I only moved into the street 11 days ago , because it 's a quiet area , so I 've had to go round to my neighbours and explain I 'm not an idiot or a criminal .
" The back door boarded up makes it look like a crack house .
" I work for a living .
We try hard to keep our heads above water with the baby and everything , so I do n't want to be treated like a scruff who hangs about on the streets all day . "
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said : " Acting on the basis of intelligence , officers entered the house as part of a search for a wanted man who had been recalled to prison .
The wanted man was not there but was later found and arrested at a nearby address .
" As regards the alleged use of fridge magnets , we are currently looking into this aspect of the incident .
An inspector will now visit the man 's house to discuss this with him . "

Members of the House Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law did n’t even wait until the 10 a.m. mark to declare former presidential adviser Karl Rove a no- show this morning .
The committee had subpoenaed Rove to appear to discuss the politicization of the Justice Department and allegations of selective prosecution of former Alabama governor Don Siegelman .
But Rove , through his lawyer , asserted that “ as a close advisor to the President , ” he is “ immune from compelled Congressional testimony . ”
Committee Chairwoman Linda Sanchez ( D - Calif. ) was having none of that , saying , “ I hereby rule that Mr. Rove ’s claims of immunity are not legally valid , and his refusal to comply with the subpoena and appear at this hearing to answer questions cannot be properly justified . ”
In her official statement , she pointed out that if Rove wants to assert executive privilege , he still has to show up and do it before the committee , not in some lame letter from his lawyer .
Sanchez observed that the Judiciary Committee has already seen a parade of witnesses from the White House who have not made this argument , most notably , David Addington , Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff , who , while clearly hostile , did actually make the trip up the Hill to testify recently on the administration ’s torture and interrogation policies .
Scott McClellan , the former press secretary , even testified without a subpoena !
Rove ’s arrogance has clearly irked Sanchez , who disparaged him for failing to cite a single court precedent that would back up his claim to absolute immunity from testifying .
Quoting the Supreme Court , Sanchez said , “ [ n ] o man in this country is so high that he is above the law , ” and “ [ a ]ll the officers of the government , from the highest to the lowest , are creatures of the law and are bound to obey it . ”
Sanchez based her ruling on the quintessential Supreme Court decision on executive privilege , United States v. Nixon , which found that executive privilege is a limited one .
The Nixon reference is apt : Sanchez notes that the Bush White House ’s assertion of secrecy goes well beyond Nixon ’s .
While Nixon attempted to prevent his White House Counsel John Dean and other White House from testifying before Congress , he eventually relented , she notes .
Sanchez is particularly galled that the Justice Department and Rove are claiming he has immunity even though he is now a private citizen , which makes his claims all the more extraordinary .
Not a single argument made by the Justice Department , Sanchez writes , applies to Newsweek columnists or Fox News commentators ; there is absolutely no precedent to extending immunity to former government officials .
Still , Rove has been down this road before , with the Senate , asserting that he is immune from testimony because he says so .
As he did last fall , White House Counsel Fred Fielding also sent a letter to Rove ’s lawyer yesterday explaining that the White House has advised Rove not to testify based on the Justice Department ’s determination that he does n’t have to go .
Of course , the Justice Department is a dubious source of advice these days , given that the attorney general is facing his own subpoena from the Judiciary Committee .
Michael Mukasey has repeatedly ignored requests from Sanchez and Rep. John Conyers to turn over documents related to the Siegelman prosecution and other oversight matters , so it clearly has a bias when it comes to deciding whether Rove ought to testify .
But the department ’s opinion on the subpoena were apparently enough to fend off Senator Patrick Leahey , who caved last fall on any attempts to force Rove to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Members of the House may not be so sanguine .
Conyers and Sanchez have already asked a federal court to enforce a subpoena from the committee ignored by former White House counsel Harriet Miers , a move they took after the Justice Department refused to enforce the subpoena .
There ’s no reason to think that they wo n’t do the same for Rove .
If he persists in ignoring them , one day he may have to pen his columns from a jail cell .
Yes , Cuil is pants .
Though its founders insist they 're building a Google killer , the results turned up by this new - age search engine are even more ridiculous than its name .
Which is still pronounced " Cool . "
Quantum computing queries have been known to reveal random pornography ( NSFW ) - even when " safe search " is turned on .
And as countless Reg readers will tell you , that 's just a start .
But there 's reason to forgive the company 's epic ineptitude .
Cuil is the helpless victim of outlandish Silicon Valley social norms that force net startups into wasting their venture capital on strawberries and muffins while giving employees free rein to work as little as they like .
Ireland - based Sunday Times columnist Sarah Carey is an old college friend of Cuil CEO Tom Costello , and the Palo Alto , California - based startup recently hired her as its " Strategist to the CEO " - even though she sees Silicon Valley as some sort of Stepford Wives - like alternate universe .
The strategic mother of two describes her first descent into the Valley 's heart of darkness in a recent column posted to her personal website .
" I stay in a hotel in Palo Alto and walk around to the office each morning , slowly adjusting to the fact that I am supposed to smile and greet fellow pedestrians and joggers , " she writes .
" The tree - lined streets are perfumed with flowers and weirdly quiet .
They have so much space here that buildings are low rise , mostly only two - storey and the noise of their huge cars is lost into the atmosphere . "
At one point , she even suspected that much of Palo Alto 's native population had been kidnapped and sent north in boxes .
" The serenity is catching – I become conscious of my foot fall .
People speak quietly , even the children .
It ’s beautiful , but surreal .
You ca n’t help wondering if all the loud , crazy people have been rounded up and shipped into San Francisco . "
But what amazed her most was the way Tom Costello and the Cuil kids spent their $ 33 million in venture capital .
" Lunch is ordered in every single day , " she writes .
" Huge fridges burst with snacks and drinks .
Bowls of strawberries and muffins lie around the rest area .
" The company pays for a personal trainer and gym membership for everyone .
A doctor calls round each Friday , after the weekly barbeque , to see if everyone ’s in good health .
Employees drift in an out at times that suit themselves . "
In an attempt to earn her keep as Strategist to the CEO , she warned her college classmate that he was heading down the road to ruin .
But he explained that in the Valley , that path is unavoidable .
" When I observed this [ strawberry and muffin ] behaviour first I was appalled and took my CEO friend aside , " Carey says .
" This was disastrous !
His company would never succeed if he wasted money like this and did n’t crack the whip .
He laughed .
This is the way it works out here .
You have to be nice to people . "
And in the end , even Sarah Carey was sucked into the Valley 's swirling vortex of profligacy .
" Well , if that was the case , he could be nice to me , " she says .
" I was n’t going to fly home in the back of the plane .
I summoned up the audacity to ask for business class travel and was granted it without hesitation .
Knowing the cost of the ticket was over € 2000 , which is about $ 5 million given the current exchange rate , I had to walk around for 15 minutes afterwards chanting ' I ’m worth it .
I ’m worth it .
I ’m worth it . ' "
Yes , she convinced herself .
When you 're in the Valley , you can't help but give in .
So forgive Cuil for launching a shite search engine .
And forgive them for calling it Cuil . ®
An upcoming WiiWare game based on that most hallowed and cherished of American pastimes – beer pong – has raised the ire of Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal .
" The video game rating board is under the influence – rating frat party video drinking games suitable for minors , " Blumenthal 's office said in a press release sent to GamePolitics .
Alcohol use as depicted in a game of beer pong is only enough to garner a game a Teen rating .
But even this is no longer included in the game :
The publisher , JV Games , has actually pulled the alcoholic content , renaming the game Pong Toss .
It 's apparently been re-rated with an E .
In response to Blumenthal 's comments , Entertainment Software Ratings Board Eliot Mizrachi said in a statement : " Pong Toss involves nothing more than players tossing virtual ping - pong balls into plastic cups , which hardly qualifies it for our most restrictive rating of AO ( Adults Only 18 + ) . "
And ESRB president Patricia
Vance went even further in a letter to Blumenthal , noting the demonstrable fact that calling for public scrutiny of games that nobody would ever actually buy anyways is only going to make more people buy them :
" Our concern is that a greater number of consumers ( including the age group about which you are most concerned ) will be made aware of this game and resolve to play it as a result of publicized statements of advocacy groups and others .
Ironically , this is likely to result in more rather than less consumers being drawn to this game , particularly those very minors all of us seek to protect . "
I do n't know .
On the one hand , if the game is making explicit references to people getting drunk while slamming entire cupfuls of beer , that sounds to me like a Mature rating .
But with all the booze yanked out , what 's to protest ?

Barack Obama has faced complaints from Democrats questioning whether his campaign is hitting back hard enough .
Vacation over , Obama in fighting form
ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. - Barack Obama has emerged from a weeklong family vacation with a little bit of a cold , but also with a more confrontational campaign strategy .
It includes going public with new attacks and trying to turn Republican attacks — and even John McCain 's own jokes — back at McCain .
Obama , who in recent weeks has faced complaints from Democrats questioning whether his campaign is hitting back hard enough , in the last couple of days has come out with guns blazing , mocking Republican attacks and confidently predicting he 'll be able to beat them back .

His campaign brushes off suggestions that he 's shifted tack heading into the next week 's Democratic convention in Denver .
But the campaign itself has gone public with the kind of detailed opposition research attacks it had previously been pushing behind the scenes , including one suggesting that McCain has a " woman problem " and another linking the presumptive GOP nominee to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
The result is an aggressive strategy that seems to court conflict and taunt McCain .
On Sunday at a Reno , Nev. , town hall , Obama suggested that McCain 's recent decision to push for offshore drilling was driven by polls .
The next day , Obama noted to 1,800 supporters gathered in a high school gym that McCain could be indirectly linked to a new independent attack book by the author of " Unfit for Command , " which questioned the military service of Sen.
John F. Kerry , the 2004 Democratic nominee .
" This may not be directly affiliated with the campaign , " Obama said , " but you know suddenly , magically , you 've got the same guy who wrote " Unfit for Command " — he comes out with a book saying I 'm a nut , and you know , people are questioning my patriotism .
John McCain himself personally said I 'd rather lose the war so I can win an election . "
Obama on Monday also began seizing on an apparent joke McCain made in a joint forum at an evangelical California megachurch over the weekend to suggest McCain is out of touch on the economy .
The pastor of the church , Rick Warren , in asking McCain a tax - related question , said , " Where do you move from middle class to rich ? "
After talking about how money can't buy happiness , McCain said , " So , I think if you 're just talking about income , how about $ 5 million ? "
But Obama , citing the answer in Albuquerque , said , " This explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to people making more than $ 2.5 million .
I guess they 're middle class . "
McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds accused Obama of unveiling " a hysterical litany of political attacks " to make up for " being upstaged " at the church event .
Though Obama told donors at a San Francisco fundraiser Sunday night that the electoral landscape favors him — and audaciously predicted , " I will win .
Do n't worry about that " — he has taken to warning supporters to brace for an onslaught of vicious attacks , which he has sought to link to McCain .
" Look , you know , we should n't be surprised , " he told the crowd at the Albuquerque high school .
" They 've been doing this every election .
They did it to John Kerry .
They did it to Gore .
They tried to do it to Clinton , they tried .
They did it to Dukakis .
That 's what they do .
That 's their politics .
They do n't know how to govern , but they know how to run a negative campaign . "
But , he said , " it 's not going to work this time .
It 's not going to work because there 's too much at stake , and you know there 's too much at stake . "
Early in the day , he told a small gathering of supporters at an Albuquerque library : " We 're going to have to hit back and we 're going to have to fight hard and we 're going to have to work hard . "
Sniffling periodically during the event , he told the crowd , " The only thing about daughters is that when you hang out with them a lot and they get a cold , somehow they end up passing it off to you . "
“ At a certain point the school system becomes no longer viable , ” said Grant Oliphant , the new president of the Pittsburgh Foundation , which is overseeing a program that provides college scholarships worth up to $ 40,000 for any student who has attended the city ’s public schools since the ninth grade and graduates from high school with a grade point average of at least 2.0 .
“ The notion is to create an incentive to stay in school and graduate , ” Mr. Oliphant said .
“ The second aspect is economic preservation  to create an incentive for people to keep their kids in school or move here with their kids  to keep enough taxpayers in town . ”
Since 1980 , the city ’s population has plunged from 423,000 to about 312,000 .
Since 2000 alone , the metropolitan area has lost 60,000 people .
While natural decrease occurred in many Southern cities that were magnets for retirees , the overall population was replenished by the influx of younger migrants .
But in Pittsburgh and other places outside the South , not only has the population aged in place , but also , to a lesser extent , the very old  often disabled and widowed  have returned to spend their last years with children and grandchildren and avail themselves of better medical treatment and transportation .
“ You think of this as a rural or small - city phenomenon , ” said Gordon F. De Jong , a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh .
“ Here ’s a large metropolitan area where it ’s happening . ”
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
Some 43 years after a Beatles concert was -- according to popular belief -- banned by Israel , Paul McCartney has announced he 'll perform there in September .
Paul McCartney says he 's looking forward to playing a concert in Israel next month .
The show , which will be held September 25 in Tel Aviv , had been rumored for months .
Promoters are saying it will be one of the biggest concerts ever held in Israel , and they hope it will encourage other top stars to come to Israel .
A web site offering tickets for the concert put prices at 1,500 shekels and 490 shekels or between $ 426.86 and $ 139.44 U.S. dollars .
Israelis " will finally get the chance to experience a night of music and history they have been waiting decades for , " a news release on McCartney 's Web site announced Wednesday .
Two plane loads of equipment will be arriving with around 100 McCartney production people .
The concert will cost around $ 10 million to produce and the organizers said they are hoping to make a profit .
In the mid-1960s , when the Fab Four from Liverpool , England , ruled the music charts , a concert in Israel was proposed .
It never happened .
The long - told story maintained that Beatlemania was deemed too potentially injurious to Israel 's youth .
A more recent theory , however , blamed the ban on a tiff between competing concert promoters .
Whatever the reason , Israelis never got to experience The Beatles live .
Earlier this year , Israel 's ambassador to Britain , Ron Prosor , visited Liverpool and apologized to The Beatles for the " misunderstanding . "
In a letter Prosor wrote : " There is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you , who shaped the minds of the generation , to come to Israel and perform . "
McCartney and Ringo Starr are the only surviving Beatles .
John Lennon was slain by a deranged gunman in 1980 ; George Harrison died of cancer in 2001 .
McCartney is billing the Tel Aviv show his " Friendship First " concert .
" I 've heard so many great things about Tel Aviv and Israel , but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another , " McCartney said in the news release .
" We are planning to have a great time and a great evening .
We can't wait to get out there and rock . "

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran said it had put a dummy satellite into orbit on a home - grown rocket for the first time on Sunday -- a move likely to increase Western concerns about its nuclear ambitions .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The long - range ballistic technology used to put satellites into space can also be used for launching weapons , although Iran says it has no plans to do so .
“ The Safir ( Ambassador ) satellite carrier was launched today and for the first time we successfully launched a dummy satellite into orbit , ” Reza Taghizadeh , head of the Iranian Aerospace Organisation , told state television .
Iran , embroiled in a standoff with the West over its nuclear ambitions , caused international concern in February by testing another domestically made rocket as part of its satellite program , the Explorer 1 .
Iran said at the time it needed two more similar launches before putting a domestically made satellite into orbit .
France and Russia both said that test raised the suspicion that Iran was seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
Washington , has accused Iran of aiming to equip missiles with nuclear warheads , called it ‘ unfortunate ’ .
It cites Iran ’s missile potential , among others , as the reason why it needs to install an anti-missile defense system in eastern Europe .
Iran already claims to have missiles with a range of 2,000 km ( 1,250 miles ) , meaning it could hit Israel or U.S. military bases in the Gulf .
The West accuses Iran of trying to obtain nuclear arms under cover of a civilian program .
Iran , the world ’s fourth largest oil producer , insists it needs nuclear technology to generate electricity .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was present at Iran ’s space centre and read out the launch countdown , state television reported .
It said he had “ congratulated the Iranian nation on the great achievement ” .
Iranian television showed the rocket on its desert launch pad , but did not show the actual lift - off .
Few details were available about the rocket or its payload .
Western experts say Iran rarely provides enough details for them to determine the extent of its technological advances , but that much Iranian technology consists of modifications of equipment supplied by China , North Korea and others .
The U.N. Security Council has imposed three rounds of sanctions on Iran for defying demands that it suspend its uranium enrichment program .
Ahmadinejad insisted international sanctions had made Iran even stronger , IRNA reported .
“ Sanctions have not isolated us .
Instead , we have become more independent , ” he said after the launch .
Linux Users on NBC's Olympics Videos : We Don't Get No Respect
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 08 , 2008
Where is Rodney Dangerfield when we need him ?
There are some heated messages flying around in the Ubuntu forums because NBC has announced that it will offer its online video coverage of the Beijing Olympics to Internet Explorer and Firefox users on the Mac and Windows , but not to Linux browser users .
" This means the considerable amount of online video available to other users is out of reach of the Linux crowd , " writes one forum poster .
" You wonder why they 'd want to kiss off 2 % - 3 % of the desktops , " writes another .
Would it really be so difficult to offer video to users of Firefox on Linux ?
As our sister blog NewTeeVee notes , the Olympics have kicked off , and online users are looking at their options for watching video coverage .
NewTeeVee also has an excellent post on torrent and pirate sites that will be offering up video .
Nevertheless , NBC 's official stance is to support Internet Explorer and Firefox for Windows and the Mac , but there is no Linux support .
This seems absolutely foolish .
How hard is it cater to users of Firefox on Linux ?
In addition to the Ubuntu forum thread above featuring disgruntled Linux users , there is also this one , where users are attributing this to a conspiracy between " M $ " and NBC .
So far , nobody in the Linux community appears to have a workaround here , but some users are already experimenting with using WINE , which allows Linux users to reach out to Windows applications .
I 'm betting that somebody will post a workaround .
In the meantime , here is NBC 's posted policy :

I am , as you might have guessed , a big fan of dynamic typing .
Yet , two prominent systems I 've designed , the Axiom object database and the Asynchronous Messaging Protocol ( AMP ) have required systems for explicit declarations of types : at a glance , static typing .
Have I gone crazy ?
Am I pining for my glory days as a Java programmer ?
What 's wrong with me ?
I believe the economics of in - memory and on - the - wire data structures are very , very different .
In - memory structures are cheap to create and cheap to fix if you got their structure wrong .
Static typing to ensure their correctness is wasted effort .
On the other hand , while on - the - wire data structures ( data structures which you exchange with other programs ) can be equally cheap to create , they can bemore expensive to maintain .
When you have an in - memory data structure , it 's remarkably flexible .
It is , almost by definition , going to be thrown away , so you can afford to change how it will be represented in subsequent runs of your program .
So , when your compiler complains at you for getting the static type declarations wrong , it 's just wasting your time .
You have to write unit tests anyway , and static typing makes unit testing harder .
What if you want a test that fakes just the methodon an interface which also requires , and , so you can quickly test a caller ofand move on ?
Astatic type system will just figure that out for you , but it probably needs to analyze your whole program to do it .
Most " statically typed " languages — such as the ones that actually exist — will force you to write a huge mess of extra code which does n't actuallyanything , just so all your round pegs can pretend to fit into square holes well enough to get your job done .
But I do n't have to convince , dear reader .
I 'm sure the audience of this blog is already deeply religious on this issue , and they 've got my religion .
I 'm just trying to make sure you understand I 'm not insane when I get to this next part .
The most important thing that I said about in - memory data structures , above , is that you throw them away .
It 's important enough that I 'll repeat it a third time , for emphasis : .
As it so happens , the inverse is the most important property of an on - the - wire data structure .
You can't throw it away .
You have to live with it .
Oh , sure , you told your customers that they allto upgrade to protocol version 3.5 , but they 're still using 3.2 .
Unless you 're Blizzard Entertainment , you can't tell them to download the new version every six weeks or go to hell .
Even if you can do that ( and statistically speaking , you probably are n't Blizzard Entertainment ) you have to keep the old versions of theprotocol around so that when version 4.0 comes out all the laggards who have n't even run your program since 3.0 can still manage to upgrade .
Here 's the best part : your unit tests are n't going help you — at least , not in the same way they would with your in - memory data .
When you change an in - memory data structure , you are n't supposed to have to change your unit tests .
You want the behavior to stay the same , you do n't change the tests ; if they start failing , you know something is wrong .
With your new protocol changes though , you can have tests for the old protocol , and tests for the new protocol , but every time you make a protocol change .
Plus , you probably can't stop supporting older versions of the protocol ( see above ) .
If you 've got a message X [ 3 ] , and you 're introducing X [ 4 ] , you have to make sure that X [ 4 ] can talk to X [ 3 ] and X [ 2 ] and X [ 1 ] .
Each of those is potentially a new test .
Each one is more work .
Even worse , it 's possible to introduce X [ 4 ] without realizing that you 've done it !
If you have a new , optional argument , let 's call it " y " , to a dynamically - typed protocol , your old tests ( which did n't pass y ) will pass .
Your new tests ( which do pass y , to the newly - modified X [ 4 ] ) also pass .
But there 's a case which has now arisen which your tests did not detect : y could be passed to a client which only supports X [ 3 ] , and an error occurs .
If this were some in - memory structures , that case no longer exists .
There is no version of Xwhich cannot accept y.
Your tests ensure that .
You have to time - travel into the past for your unit tests to discover the code which would cause them to fail .
You ca n't just do it once , either : maybe X [ 3 ] was designed to ignore all optional parameters .
You have to consider X [ 2 ] and X [ 1 ] .
You have to travel back to all points in time simultaneously .
This is why I said that the cost is exponential : you carry this cost forward with each new supported version that gets released .
Of course , there are ways to reduce it .
You can design your protocol such that arguments which your implementation does n't understand are ignored .
You can start adding version numbers to everything , or change the name of every message every time some part of its schema changes .
All of these alternatives get tedious after a while .
So what does this have to do with static typing ?
Static type declarations can save you a lot of this work .
For one thing , it becomes impossible to forget you 're changing the protocol .
Did you change the data 's types ?
If so , you need to add a compatibility layer .
These static type declarations give you key information : what do the previous versions of the protocol look like ?
More importantly , they give yourkey information : is an automatic transformation between these two versions of the data format possible ?
( If not , is the manual transformation between these two versions correct ? )
In a dynamically typed program , you can figure out your in - memory types are doing by running the debugger , inspecting the code that 's calling them , and simply reading the code .
Sometimes this can be a bit spread out — in a badly designed system , spread out — but the key point is that all the information you need is right in front of you , in the source code .
If you 're working on code that is shipping data elsewherean explicit schema , you have to have a full copy of the revision history and somefancy revision control tools telling you what the protocol looked like in the past .
( Or , perhaps , what the protocol that somepiece of software has developed used to look like in the past . )
Your disk is another kind of wire .
This one is particularly brutal , because while yoube able to tell someone to download a new client to be able to access a service , there isyou aregoing to get away with saying " just delete all your data and start again .
there 's a new version of the format . "
When writing objects to disk ( or to a database ) , you might not be talking across a network , but you 're still talking to a different program .
A later version of the one you 're writing now .
So these constraints all apply to Axiom just as they do to AMP ; moreso , actually , because in the case of AMP all the translations can be very simple and ad - hoc , whereas in Axiom the translations between data types need to be specifically implemented as upgraders .
With a network involved , you also have to worry about an additional issue of security .
One way to deal with this is by adding linguistic support to the notion of untrusted code running " somewhere else " , but type declarations can provide some benefit as well .
Let 's say that you have a function that can be invoked by some networked code :
Seems simple , seems safe enough , right ?
' number ' is a number taken from the network , and you return a result to the network that is 1000 times bigger .
But ... what if ' number ' were , instead , a list of 10,000 elements ?
Now you 've just consumed a huge amount of memory and sent the caller 1000 times as much traffic as they 've sent you .
Dynamic typing allows the client side of the network connection to pass in whatever it wants .
Now , let 's look at a slightly different implementation of that function :
Now , your protocol code has a critical hint that it needs to make this code secure .
You might spell it differently ( " arguments = [ ( ' number ' , Integer ( ) ) ] " comes to mind ) , but the idea is that the protocol code now knows : .
You can , of couse , add checks to make sure that all the methods you want to call on your arguments are safe , but that can get ugly quickly .
Let 's break it down .
Static type declarations have a cost .
You ( probably ) have to type a bunch of additional names for your types , which makes it difficult to write code quickly .
Therefore it is preferable to avoid that cost .
All the information you need about the code at runtime is present when you 're looking at your codebase .
Therefore — although you may find its form more convenient — static type declarations do n't provide any additional information about the code as it's running .
However , information about the code on opposite ends of the wire may only be in your repository history , or it may not be in your code at all ( it could be in a different codebase entirely ) .
Therefore static typing provides additional information for the wire but not in memory .
At runtime , you only have to deal with one version of an object at a time .
On the wire , you might need to deal with a few different versions simultaneously in the same process .
Static type declarations provide your application with information it may need to interact with those older versions .
At runtime ( at least in today 's languages ) you are n't worried about securityyour process .
Enforcing type safety at compile time does n't really add any security , especially with popular VMs like the JVM not bothering to enforce type constraints in the bytecode , only in the compiler .
However , static type declarations can help the protocol implementation understand the expectations of the application code so that it does not get invoked with confusing or potentially dangerous values .
Therefore static type declarations can add security on the wire while they can't add security in memory .
( It turns out that if you care about security in memory , you need to do a bunch of other stuff , unrelated to type safety .
When the rest of the world catches up to the E language I may need to revisit my ideas of how type safety help here . )
If you have data that 's being sent to another program , you probably need static type declarations for that data .
Or you need aof memory to store all those lists I 'm about to multiply by 1000 on your server .
ICANN has unanimously approved a request by the Public Interest Registry ( which handles .org domains ) to become the first generic Top Level Domain ( gTLD ) to switch to the DNS security protocol DNSSEC .
As part of the agreement , PIR will trailblaze DNSSEC , while simultaneously developing an education and adoption plan that can later be disseminated across the Internet 's infrastructure , PIR 's use of DNSSEC is a significant step forward , but a mixture of contentious political and technological issues have slowed the worldwide development and deployment process .
DNSSEC is intended to fix fundamental flaws in the original DNS protocol that leave it vulnerable to several different attack vectors , including cache poisoning .
This is accomplished in part through the use of digital signatures .
By using such signatures , the DNS resolver can check to see if information it is receiving is actually from the appropriate address ; the digital signatures effectively act as a password ( the analogy is not exact ) .
The DNS flaws themselves are n't anything new — they were discovered back in 1990 — but the solution to the problem has been no less than eleven years in the making , putting the length of its development cycle almost on par with Duke Nukem Forever .
DNSSEC development lasted from January 1997 to the present day , or roughly 11 years and six months .
DNF was announced in April of 1997 , and , assuming 3 DRealms makes good on its 2008 projection , must ship no later than December 2008 , for a total development time of 11 years , eight months .
Hail to the king , indeed .
Spurious references to Duke aside , DNSSEC has had a difficult road to deployment .
Early versions of the protocol proved incapable of scaling upwards to the degree that would be necessary to cover the entire Internet .
Later , privacy and legal concerns arose around the way DNSSEC handled zone enumeration .
These issues were eventually dealt with as well , but critical parts of the protocol were n't formally published until March of this year .
.org is n't the first high - level domain to implement DNSSEC , as several nations have already adopted it for their country - level domains .
The issue of whether or not ICANN should sign the root has been batted about but is still something of a political mess .
Doing so could speed and simplify the DNS to DNSSEC transition , but if ICANN signs the root , ICANN ( and ICANN alone ) has full access to the public root encryption keys .
This , in turn , revives the question as to whether or not ICANN / the US government can be trusted , etc , etc , ad nauseum .
PIR 's announcement indicates that we should expect to see other gTLD 's eventually jump from DNS to DNSSEC , but given the slow pace of adoption thus far , it 's anyone 's guess as to when that will happen .
If you 're shopping around for an extension language for your project , it 's pretty hard to go past Python .
Aside from being a very pleasant language to work with , it has a huge selection of libraries , and a user base that 's at least as large .
Add projects like Boost .
Python into that , and you 've got a pretty compelling case .
However , it 's not all beer and sunshine in Python land - at least , not on Windows .
Lets start with the simplest case : Ship python25.dll , and python25.zip ( containing the standard libraries ) with your application , and provide some means for users to enter Python code .
Golden , right ?
Not so much .
It 'll work fine right up until someone with an international version of Windows tries to install your application to a localized version of " C: \Program Files " that contains a unicode character .
Then everything falls over .
Oh , you thought Python supported unicode ?
Well , it does .
Sort of .
Provided you do n't expect to be able to put unicode paths within sys.path , the list of directories python files may be loaded from .
Ouch !
There are still options though : you can set sys.path to load from the current directory , and just set the current directory appropriately before making any calls into Python .
Now , let 's take a look at loading user supplied plugins from . py files .
You could just place them in the same directory that the application is installed to , but that 's not a great solution on Vista , as users generally wo n't have write access to Program Files .
A better location is to place them within the Application Data folder , contained within the user 's home directory .
This raises some more problems :
It 's not uncommon for users to have unicode characters in their username , and hence in their Application Data path .
So we can't simply add that to sys.path .
We also can't use the current directory trick any longer , as there are now two directories to load things from .
For Sublime
Text , I 've implemented a half way solution :
Do some sys. path_hooks mangling to get modules loading from python25.zip , and use the current directory trick for user supplied modules ( Drop me an email if you 're interested in the code ) .
It 's not pretty , but it does work .
Aside from current directory wrangling , there 's another option I 've yet to try : short path names .
Windows has a notion of short path names , where every file has its full path name , and a short one ( see GetShortPathName ) in 8.3 format for archaic programs .
The noteworthy part is that the 8.3 name uses ASCII characters , so they 'll be safe to use as Python module paths .
There are a few caveats with this approach :
Not every file has a short path name .
Generation of them may be turned off .
Some file systems do n't support 8.3 file names :
They presumably wo n't exist on Samba shares , for instance .
It 's unfortunate that Python has this limitation .
My understanding is that it is not going to be fixed for Python 3.0 , though there has been some work in this direction .
Despite this , I still think you'd be mad to use anything else as an extension language .
How do the Guantánamo tribunals work ?
The trials for terrorist suspects devised by the Bush White House give significant advantages not seen in civilian courts to Pentagon prosecutors .
Inflammatory evidence , such as the videotape comparing al - Qaida to the Nazis that was played at the trial of Salim Hamdan , is permissible .
Hearsay evidence derived from third parties is also acceptable in the Guantánamo courtroom .
Violent interrogations can also produce admissible evidence unless a judge rules otherwise .
Defendants are presumed guilty , not innocent , at the outset of the military tribunals .
Evidence is often withheld from defence lawyers until the very last minute .
Perhaps the most extreme difference between Guantanamo tribunals and other courts is the consequence of acquittal : the US military has laid the groundwork to detain even those not convicted .
For the third time in a year , a secret spying court rejected an ACLU request to let some sunshine pierce its dark curtains of secrecy , ruling late Thursday that national security prohibits publishing even unclassified versions of court documents or allowing non-government lawyers to argue in the court .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was reacting to an ACLU petition in July to be part of the court 's review of new wiretapping powers handed to the Administration by Congress in July .
Under the new law – known as the FISC Amendments
Act – the nation 's spies can order companies like AT&T and Google to help the government drop dragnets into domestic internet and phone facilities to capture all communications suspected to involve at least one foreigner .
Previously , the law said that such wiretaps had to be approved on an individual basis if done inside the United States , while more lax rules held sway if the government wiretapped such communications outside the United States .
That legality did not stop the Bush Administration , which began a secret spying program after 9/11 that included targeting these kinds of communications .
The ACLU argued that the new law expanded the government 's powers so broadly that the court needed to make exceptions to its ultra-secret hearings that never allow any opposition .
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge Marya McLaughin dismissed those pleas , saying ( . pdf ) that there was no right for the public to know about the workings of the court .
The FISC has no tradition of openness , either with respect to its proceedings , its orders or to Government briefings filed with the FISC . [...]
Although it is possible to identify some benefits which might flow from public access to Government briefs and FISC orders ... any such benefits would be outweighed by the risks to national security created by the potential exposure of the Government 's targeting and minimization procedures .
ACLU attorney Jameel Jaffer expressed frustration , yet again – saying that secrecy should not be wrapped around a new law that affects every American 's privacy .
" The Bush administration says that the new law is necessary to protect the country against terrorism , but there ’s nothing in the law that prevents the government from monitoring the communications of innocent Americans , " Jaffer said in a written statement .
" The intelligence court should not be deciding important constitutional issues in secret judicial opinions issued after secret hearings at which only the government is permitted to appear . "
The ACLU also wanted to file a brief contesting the constitutionality of the targeting procedures and the law , but McLaughin declined , saying that the group 's analysis would not be helpful since only the government and the court know how the spying works .
The FISC was given a little authority in the new law to oversee the procedures the National Security Agency will use to make sure it does not intentionally target Americans or snag purely domestic communications with its new dragnets .
Under the rules , the NSA can't point the microphone at a particular American to monitor their overseas communications without a court order naming the target , but can monitor all Americans by targeting anyone outside the country using a new blanket order .
The ACLU also asked the court to make the government file unclassified versions of the documents it has to file with the court that describe the dragnets .
Other than a yearly accounting of how many surveillance court orders it has granted or denied , little is known of the court and it has only released a handful of decisions in its 30 - year history – including three in the last 12 months denying the ACLU 's petitions to open itself up .
The ACLU also filed suit in federal district court to contest the law , which also provides retroactive amnesty for telecoms that helped the government to conduct warrantless spying on Americans .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures closed with a loss of more than $ 2 a barrel Tuesday , as ongoing concerns over easing demand as well as strength in the dollar pushed prices to their lowest level in nearly three months .
Energy futures finished mainly lower .
Crude for September delivery fell by $ 2.54 , or 2 % , to close at $ 122.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Earlier , the contract touched a low of $ 120.75 .
It has n't traded or closed at levels this low since early May .
" Nothing goes up in a straight line , and crude 's run has been phenomenal , " said Sean Brodrick , a natural resources analyst for MoneyandMarkets.com .
Crude was trading at just $ 78 a barrel a year ago .
" A short - term pullback is a normal and necessary part of any bull market , and crude is no different , " he said in emailed comments .
On the currency market , the dollar index DXY , +0.02 % was recently at 73.307 , up from 72.694 in late North American trading Monday .
Strength in the U.S. currency typically weighs on dollar - denominated commodities such as oil and gold .
“ ' A short - term pullback is a normal and necessary part of any bull market , and crude is no different . ' ” — Sean Brodrick , MoneyandMarkets.com
The greenback shrugged off downbeat housing data reported earlier Tuesday and took comfort from upbeat consumer confidence data and a recovery in stock prices .
See Currencies .
In other news , the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries President Chakib Khelil called oil prices " abnormal " and said they could pull back to $ 80 a barrel over the long term if the dollar were to continue to recover and global political worries eased , Reuters reported Tuesday .
" Whether prices drop to $ 80 ... or not , there can only be the unavoidable conclusion that markets are finally working as they are supposed to , as higher prices inevitably act as a brake on demand , " said John Kilduff , an analyst at MF Global , in a note to clients .
Khelil , who is Algeria 's oil minister , also said that OPEC should not consider cutting production after the steep decline in prices over the last two weeks since markets are now balanced , according to Reuters .
" Crude futures had an impressive rally recently , hitting all - time highs earlier this year , " said Andrey Kryuchenkov , analyst with Sucden Research .
" The market was in need of a correction , which could continue if we see more signs of slowing demand and sluggish economic growth in OECD states , " he said .
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is a 30 - nation group that includes mostly developed countries from North America , Europe and Asia .
In the long run , the oil market still looks fundamentally strong , Kryuchenkov said .
Petroleum data on deck
Energy traders looked ahead to Wednesday 's data on U.S. petroleum supplies from the Energy Department , covering the week ended July 25 .
The data are expected to show that crude supplies fell by 1.3 million barrels , according to a Platts survey of analysts .
MF Global 's Kilduff expects to see a decline of 1.8 million barrels .
Gasoline supplies likely rose by 400,000 barrels in the latest week , the Platts survey said .
But MF Global is looking for a decline of 1.1 million .
And distillate inventories , which include heating oil , were likely up by 1.8 million barrels , according to Platts .
MF Global expects a climb of 800,000 barrels .
" Imports are unlikely to recover from last week 's depressed 9.806 million barrels per day , given a two - day closure of the Houston Ship Channel due to Hurricane Dolly , " according to Linda Rafield , Platts senior oil analyst and editor of Platts Futures & Derivatives Review .
The Houston Ship Channel closed July 23 and was only partially open on July 24 .
Traffic to Corpus Christi , site to three oil refineries , was also halted for two days , according to Platts .
" Dolly also likely caused a decline in refinery utilization rates along the Gulf Coast , " Rafield added .
Platts said analysts project a drop in refinery utilization rates to 86.6 % in the latest week from 87.1 % in the week ended July 18 .
Retail gasoline under $ 4 ; force majeure in Nigeria
The average U.S. price for a gallon of regular gasoline stood at $ 3.955 for the week ended July 28 , according to government data released late Monday .
That 's the first fall below $ 4 since June 2 .
" A $ 20 - plus drop in crude is certainly one of the causes , " said Kilduff , who also noted that Transportation Department figures show that the number of U.S. highway miles traveled in May fell by a record 3.7 % .
Against this backdrop , September reformulated gasoline fell 6.1 cents to close at $ 3.0132 a gallon .
September heating oil also dropped 8.9 cents to end at $ 3.4985 a gallon .
The decline in petroleum prices , as well as a contract expiration , weighed on the natural - gas futures market Tuesday .
Natural gas for August delivery tacked on 5.4 cents to close at $ 9.217 per million British thermal units .
The contract expired at the close of Tuesday 's session , after which September became the front month .
That contract closed down 86.5 cents at $ 9.13 per million British thermal units .
Also Tuesday , Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A , - 1.68 % ( RDSA ) said that it wo n't be able to meet a significant part of its Nigerian oil - export obligations for the next two months after a pair of militant attacks left two oil pipelines damaged , Dow Jones Newswires reported .
A Shell spokesman said the oil giant declared force majeure with customers after assessing the damage to its Nembe Creek and Rumuekpe pipelines , according to Dow Jones .
Shell did n't specify how much crude would be affected , the report said .
Force majeure is a clause in contracts which frees parties from obligation in the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond their control .
On Monday , oil futures closed up $ 1.47 at $ 124.73 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , getting a lift from the supply disruption in Nigeria .
Elsewhere in commodities trading Tuesday , prices for gold futures dropped more than 1 % .

The simmering issue over possible underage Chinese gymnasts did not boil over before the women ’s team final was settled Wednesday with the host country taking the gold from the United States , and convincingly .
But why do I get the feeling that if these Olympics were happening in Chicago or Los Angeles , the story would by now be a serious cable television cause célèbre ?
Larry King would be hosting the stricken parents of victimized Americans .
Hannity would be chiding Colmes about Communist child abusers .
Lou Dobbs would be demanding the borders be closed to all Chinese gymnasts under 80 pounds .
Here , claims by the coaching legend , Bela Karolyi , that what China has done is “ a slap in the face of the whole world ” have barely resonated outside the gymnastic venue and across the greater Olympic community .
Even his wife , Martha , the American team coordinator , took the wink - wink approach after Alicia Sacramone ’s aborted mount on the balance beam and mistakes by all three Americans in the floor exercise cemented silver - medal status .
“ I have no proof so I can not make an affirmation , ” Martha Karolyi said afterward , referring to issue of underage gymnasts .
Then she mentioned that one of the Chinese girls  she said she did not know them by name  seemed to be missing a baby tooth .
Wednesday night , the unnamed gymnast will be sleeping with a gold medal under her pillow .
A former senior civil servant who was responsible for coordinating the government 's anti-drugs policy now believes that legalisation would be less harmful than the current strategy .
Julian Critchley , the former director of the Cabinet Office 's anti-drugs unit , also said that his views were shared by the " overwhelming majority " of professionals in the field , including police officers , health workers and members of the government .
He also claimed that New Labour 's policy on drugs was based on what was thought would play well with the Daily Mail readership , regardless of evidence of what worked .
Downing Street policy advisers were said to have suggested stunts such as sending boats down the Thames to catch smugglers to coincide with policy announcements .
Critchley - not be to be confused with the late Tory MP of the same name - was director of the UK Anti-Drug Coordination Unit in the Cabinet Office , with the job of coordinating government policy across departments and supporting the then drugs Tsar , Keith Hellawell .
In a contribution to the debate on the " war on drugs " on a BBC website , Critchley spelled out his reasons for now supporting legalisation and claimed the government 's position is hypocritical .
Yesterday Critchley , who is now a teacher , confirmed that the blog posting accurately conveyed his views .
" I joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy , being personally opposed to drug use , but open - minded about the best way to deal with the problem , " he wrote on the blog .
" I was certainly not inclined to decriminalise .
However , during my time in the unit , as I saw more and more evidence of ' what works ' , to quote New Labour 's mantra of the time , it became apparent to me that ... enforcement and supply - side interventions were largely pointless .
They have no significant , lasting impact on the availability , affordability or use of drugs . "
He said that his views were widely held in the government but rarely expressed in public .
" I think what was truly depressing about my time in UKADCU was that the overwhelming majority of professionals I met , including those from the police , the health service , the government and voluntary sectors held the same view : the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves .
Yet publicly , all those intelligent , knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be ' tough on drugs ' , even though they all knew the government 's policy was actually causing harm . "
Critchley believed that the benefits to society of the fall in crime as a result of legalisation would be dramatic .
" Tobacco is a legal drug , whose use is declining , and precisely because it is legal , its users are far more amenable to government control , education programmes and taxation . "
Anyone who wished to purchase the drug of their choice could already do so .
" The idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is simply ridiculous . "
His intervention was welcomed yesterday by drugs law reformers .
" Julian Critchley is one of the brave few to tell the truth about the failure of prohibition and the need to replace it with a system of regulation , " said Danny Kushlick , of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation .
" It is truly shameful that there are so many more who know that the war on drugs is overwhelmingly counterproductive , and yet continue to remain silent , tacitly endorsing a policy that they know creates misery , degradation and death for millions across the globe . "

A good summary of the danger , from Max Bergmann at DemocracyArsenal …
The big concern with a McCain presidency – a concern which I am surprised has not been vocalized more fully – is that the U.S. will lurch from crisis to crisis , confrontation to confrontation , whether it be with Iran , North Korea , Russia , Syria , Saudi Arabia , etc .
The danger is that McCain ’s pundit - like rhetoric will entrap the U.S. in descending spiral of foreign policy brinksmanship .
Just think about the very likely scenario of McCain giving Iran / Russia a rhetorical ultimatum and Iran / Russia ignoring it .
Now we are stuck – either we lose face by not following through on our threats or we follow through and go to war .
We ca n’t afford such a reckless approach after the last eight years .
For the next eight we need a president not a pundit .
I ran across an article , in The National Business Review ( NZ ) , that ( attempts to ) explain why the climate is not highly sensitive to CO2 warming .
In December last year . . . ( the author ) heard . . . a paper . . . that showed while the IPCC models predict that greenhouse gases would produce an extensive " hot spot " in the upper troposphere over the tropics , the satellite measurements show no such hotspots have appeared .
. . .
a large part of this discrepancy is the result of some basic errors in the IPCC 's assessment of the Stefan - Boltzmann equation .
When they applied their revised factor to the effect of greenhouse gases , the temperature rise was about a third of that predicted by the IPCC .
. . .
The findings that the predicted " tropical hot spots " do not exist are important because the IPCC models assume these hot spots will be formed by increased evaporation from warmer oceans leading to the accumulations of higher concentrations of water vapour in the upper atmosphere , and thereby generating a positive feedback reinforcing the small amount of warming that can be caused by CO2 alone .

The gun control capital of America – Chicago – where only the criminals are allowed to own firearms – has been hit by a fresh wave of crime and violence , prompting Governor Rod Blagojevich to call for National Guard helicopters to be used in law enforcement operations .
Blagojevich plans to form an “ elite tactical team ” to help the city fight crime , according to a speech he gave last week .
“ Violent crime in the city of Chicago is out of control , ” Blagojevich said at the bill signing ceremony .
“ I ’m offering resources of the state to the city to work in a constructive way with Mayor Daley to do everything we can possibly do to help stop this violence , ” said the governor .

Citing the fact that a child has been shot nearly every day since the end of June , Blagojevich called for National Guard helicopters to be used in high crime areas .
However , as police department spokeswoman Monique Bond noted , the actual number of homicides in the city is significantly down .
“ 2008 may end with fewer than 500 homicides and that it is expected to be one of the least deadly years in the city in the last 40 years , ” reports NBC5.com .
Following questions regarding the use of National Guard choppers in the city , Blagojevich ’s office attempted to pour cold water over the issue by stating that National Guard troops would not enter the city .
“ The only way the National Guard would be involved , if they are involved , is with the use of tactical helicopters that are currently used in narcotics operations , ” spokesman Lucio Guerrero said in a prepared statement .
The precedent for National Guard units and military personnel to be used in domestic law enforcement has been a growing cancer for the last three decades .
Documentarian and radio talk show host Alex Jones has has attended numerous military urban warfare training drills across the U.S. where role players were used to simulate arresting American citizens , confiscating their weapons , and taking them to internment camps .
Actors scream out that they have constitutional rights as they are handcuffed and hauled off to the detainment facility .
Legislation has already been passed that paves the way for the U.S. military to engage American citizens on home soil .
The John Warner Defense Authorization
Act of 2007 allows the President to declare a “ public emergency ” and station troops anywhere in America and take control of state - based National Guard units without the consent of the governor or local authorities , in order to “ suppress public disorder . ”
Military - style drills involving unmarked black helicopters ( the kind that the corporate media insists only exist inside the minds of conspiracy nutjobs ) took place in Denver and Florida last month under the pretext of “ terrorism training , ” with choppers buzzing around downtown Denver and even causing damage to people ’s property by flying well below legal altitudes .

Yeah , another bad headline - does n't sound possible , you say ?
You may be right .
But I just saved $ 350 outright because gas prices are so high .

A decade ago , we opted to move pretty far away from the center city : 27 miles from the driveway to CNN Center in Atlanta .
The decision was largely due to the prospects for our three school - age kids :
A shaky , in - town school district versus a well - regarded one farther away .
And since the State of Georgia always finishes in the Top 50 among State Educational Quality , we went for it .
The kids have had a good shake in their schools , so no regrets .
But the costs for Daddy driving to work have included up to two - hour commutes , plus more recently , brutal gasoline costs , even with a 32MPG car .
A few years ago , in a nod more to traffic burdens than to energy or environmental concerns , Georgia rolled out commuter buses to far - flung places like Conyers , GA .
Five per day , from the commuter lot next to the Rockdale County Jail into downtown Atlanta .
So yes , I go to the County Jail at least twice a week .
Being in the 24 - hour news business , I feel obligated to give you the Bad News First :
The last bus in is at 8 am ; the last bus back is at 6:15 pm .
This does not always fit the bipolar nature of covering 24 - hour news .
Bottom Line : I can't always rely on the bus - not for late nights , or weekend work .
The Good News ?
My employers have had the foresight to let me keep my parking privileges for when I have to drive , plus a part - time pass for the bus .
With minor inconvenience , I can take two bus trips a week to work , with little or no compromise to my workload , saving 2 gallons of charitable donation to the oil companies per day , plus environmental benefits , per round trip .
But I called my insurer ( GEICO ) , and they also told me that the reduced mileage on my car would save me about $ 350 a year on insurance costs .
Whoa !!
Just think how much extra gasoline I can afford now !!!
I wo n't have to take the damn bus !!!
( Just kidding ) .
Actually , the bus is n't bad .
It 's still only about half full each day , which is amazing to me .
I can listen to my IPod on the way in ( it has a lot of songs on it , and you would n't like most of them .... ) , and I arrive at work bearing no anger to all the Barbarians and Fools who would tailgate me or cut me off on Interstate 20 on the way in ( full disclosure :
It 's never my fault as a driver ; to quote Dustin Hoffman , I 'm an excellent driver . ) .
Oh , and on the way in , I read stuff , too .
One more note :
They 're considering Commuter Rail from many towns like Conyers , but 'round here , the feelings still run strongly about General Sherman tearing up the railroad tracks 144 years ago , so it may take a while longer for the State Legislature to warm up to the idea .
So I 'd like to thank the Oil Companies , OPEC , the shrinking dollar , the increased international demand , the speculators , the guys who blow up the pipelines in Nigeria every week , and everyone else who 's been blamed for high oil prices for making my ride to work more relaxed and a tad cheaper , at least twice a week .

Price Increase Plagues Discount Shoppers
The major discount chain increased its prices by as much as 15 percent .
July 24 , 2008  --
There may be nowhere left to hide from rising prices .
In today 's tough economy , food and commodity prices , which have long been directly affecting consumers , have begun to take a toll on big discount chains .
" Big - box " stores like Costco have tried to resist passing on their cost increases to consumers , but they cannot provide discounts as they did before .
Costco has announced that it will have to raise its prices , on some items by as much as 15 percent .
" It 's tough because we 're already on a budget , " said Nikky Hughes , a mother of two who shops at Costco .
" I do n't want it to go up .
It makes budgeting harder . "
Jim Sinegal , president and CEO of Costco , said that Costco 's current price increase is unprecedented for the company .
" This is the first time in our history since my partner and I started the business 25 years ago that we 've had this type of situation where we 've had inflation , " Sinegal said .
" It 's difficult , but we will have to deal with it . "
Increasing prices place a burden on Costco shoppers , who come to Costco specifically searching for the best value .
At Costco , the cost of diapers is up by 7 percent , and the price of poultry has increased by more than 10 percent this year .
Holiday items will cost about 12 percent more than last year .
And it 's not just Costco that 's responded to tough economic times by raising prices .
With months of skyrocketing prices in the stores , bulk discounters everywhere have done the same .
" It 's going to be harder to buy food , harder to buy everything , " said J.K. Palmer , also a parent of two who shops at Costco .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that all food prices will increase by as much as an additional 5 percent in 2009 .
Kraft Foods , Kellogg 's and Tyson -- some of Costco 's suppliers -- have said they may be forced to raise prices on some items by more than 20 percent , citing higher energy costs .
With rising food and gas prices colliding , Costco 's price increase is not by choice .
Nevertheless , consumers have been hit hard by the change .
Another Costco shopper , Arsi Nazarian , the mother of two sons , said her family spent twice as much on their vacation as it did last year , largely because of the increased cost of fuel .
She was not surprised that increased costs have hit the aisles of Costco .
" Food , trucks , gas -- it has effects on everything thing , " Nazarian said .
" We have to cut down on the little extra stuff . "
Costco and other bargain retailers have benefited from their discount - seeking clientele in tough times .
But the company could no longer maintain such low prices and stay afloat .
Analysts , like Michael Tarsala at Thomson Reuters , point to Costco as a sign that discounts will continue to evaporate .
" You have rich people that shop at Costco ; you have not - so - rich people that shop at Costco , " Tarsala said .
" So if prices widely are increasing there , I would say prices are increasing pretty much everywhere . "

The Sandvich is the Heavy ’s first unlockable .
It tastes as good as it looks and heals 120 health .
Like in real life , the decision to eat a Sandvich must not be taken lightly ;
The Heavy is completely vulnerable during the four second eating process , and his loud , happy sounds of vigorous chewing will draw enemies like tiny ant cowards to a picnic .
OF DEATH .
On the bright side , the Heavy ’s Sandvich supply is unlimited , so his only real concern is being caught short while enjoying this delicious edible device .
The Sandvich is a great tool for a Heavy defending an area , as it gives him the ability to replenish health between enemy waves without having to abandon his post .
Similarly , an offensive Heavy without a Medic can step back from the front line and grab a quick snack before resuming his rampage .
Beware , however : the Heavy must set aside his shotgun to take the Sandvich , and enemy Snipers are much more dangerous for a Heavy wielding only a minigun .
Daily pill that halts Alzheimer 's is hailed as ' biggest breakthrough against disease for 100 years '
Breakthrough :
The new drug reverses symptoms in 81 % of patients
A new drug halts the devastating progress of Alzheimer ’s disease , say British scientists .
It is said to be more than twice as effective as current treatments .
A daily capsule of rember , as the drug is known , stops Alzheimer ’s disease progressing by as much as 81 per cent , according to trial results .
Patients with the brain disorder had no significant decline in their mental function over a 19 - month period .
‘ We appear to be bringing the worst affected parts of the brain functionally back to life , ’ said Dr Claude Wischik , who led the research .
It is the first time medication has been developed to target the ‘ tangles ’ in the brain that destroy nerve cells , leading to deteriorating memory .
The drug helps to disrupt this process , preventing the formation of new tangles and loosening those already created .
Last night the findings were hailed as the biggest breakthrough in the battle against Alzheimer ’s since 1907 .
Eventually the drug could be used to stop the disease in its early stages before symptoms have even appeared , it is hoped .
It could be available to patients within four years although , in the wake of the NHS ban on the £ 2.50 - a- day drug Aricept , there are concerns over whether it would be funded on the Health Service .
The trial was carried out by a team at the University of Aberdeen , led by Professor Wischik , who 20 years ago discovered the ‘ tau protein ’ which makes up the tangles .
‘ This is an unprecedented result in the treatment of Alzheimer ’s disease , ’ he said .
‘ We have demonstrated for the first time that it may be possible to arrest progression of the disease by targeting the tangles that are highly correlated with the disease .
This is the most significant development in the treatment of the tangles since Alois Alzheimer discovered them in 1907 . ’
The research , presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer ’s disease in Chicago , involved 321 people with mild and moderate Alzheimer ’s disease in the UK and Singapore .
They were divided into four groups , three taking different doses of rember and a fourth group taking a placebo or dummy capsule .
After 50 weeks , those with both mild and moderate Alzheimer ’s who were taking rember experienced 81 per cent less mental decline compared with those on the placebo .
Those taking rember did not experience any significant decline in their mental function over 19 months , while those on the placebo got worse .
The results suggest the drug is about two - and - a - half times more effective than existing drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors .
Images of the brain showed rember had its biggest effect in the parts linked to memory , where the density of tau tangles is greatest , with better blood flow to these areas .
The drug works by dissolving the tangle of tau fibres which releases waste products that kill nerve cells , and by preventing the fibres from becoming tangled .
Consultant psychiatrist Dr Donald Mowat , who monitored the progress of patients , said they were more confident , better able to cope with daily life and not experiencing the level of mental decline they had expected .
The trial was a Phase 2 study , which checks the safety and efficacy of the drug , but if a large - scale Phase 3 trial due next year repeats the findings , the drug could be available for prescribing
by 2012 .
At the same time , the research team is investigating a way of diagnosing Alzheimer ’s at its earliest stages when tau tangles are first being formed in the brain .
People may have these tangles in their 50s , long before symptoms develop , and the researchers hope the drug could be used as a preventive treatment .
Professor Wischik co-founded TauRx Therapeutics , which is developing the treatment .
Professor Stephen Logan , professor of neuroscience and TauRx board member , said : ‘ This is a fantastic breakthrough and very exciting .
‘ Patients have been doing well for 18 or 19 months .
They are continuing to take the drug and will probably do so until there is no benefit or they start to decline .
‘ It ’s not reversing the disease process , but appears to stabilise it .
It could be on the market by 2012 . ’
Professor Logan said the team is working on scanning techniques to detect the early stages of tangles so the drug could be used as a preventive but this would take much longer to perfect .
He said the cost of the treatment is unknown but would need to be compared with the expense of caring for Alzheimer ’s sufferers both in the community and in hospital .
Existing Alzheimer ’s drugs costing £ 2.50 have been banned for NHS use in sufferers of ‘ mild ’ disease on grounds of cost .
Around 700,000 Britons have dementia , with the majority suffering Alzheimer ’s , and the number is increasing as people live longer .
Professor Clive Ballard , head of research at the Alzheimer ’s Society , said it is a major development .
But he warned there is a long way to go before the treatment will become available for patients .
He said : ‘ It is the first realistic evidence that a new drug can improve cognition in people with Alzheimer’s .
‘ However we are not there yet .
Larger scale trials are now needed to confirm the safety of this drug and establish how far it could benefit the thousands of people living with this devastating disease . ’
I feel more confident , more positive
Sandra Sutherland had been struggling to focus on her job in accounts for several years when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s .
The 61 - year - old tested positive for the disease in 2005 as doctors investigated another medical condition .
Drug trial : Sandra Sutherland with husband Ian
She said : ‘ When I was diagnosed I was absolutely gobsmacked .
I tell everyone that I meet that I have Alzheimer ’s and they ca n’t believe it . ’
Mrs Sutherland , who lives with her husband and two sons in Aberdeen and enjoys crosswords and gardening , started a trial of rember two years ago and believes the medication has helped her .
She said : ‘ Since I ’ve been on the trial I feel more confident , more positive .
I think my concentration has levelled off and not got any worse . ’
Her husband Ian added : ‘ Sandra still has days when she is not great
‘ But there has been no decline in the mini-mental tests she has had to do as part of the trial , so it would appear the medication is working . ’
Jimmy Hardie , 72 , used to put sugar mistakenly in the fridge and suffered mood swings .
He and his wife Dorothy , a 69 - year - old former nurse , live in the coastal village of Boddam , south of Peterhead in Aberdeenshire .
The couple have two children and five grandchildren , who all live in the Buchan area .
Mr Hardie was diagnosed with Alzheimer ’s disease three years ago , after he began to suffer ‘ blank ’ periods and could not remember what he was about to do .
He started on the rember trial in 2006 .
Mrs Hardie said she believes the treatment has helped her husband gain confidence .
He runs a trout fishery , is an enthusiastic handyman and loves his shed .
‘ Two years ago if Jimmy had gone to his shed , he may have forgotten what he was about to do , ’ she said .
‘ Now he is able to plan what he wants to do , go and get the tools that he needs and do the task .
It is very encouraging . ’
Mr Hardie , who worked at the nearby power station for 14 years , added : ‘ I feel the treatment has helped me .
Having a lot of friends and hobbies has also been a great help . ’

It was 5:30 in the morning when Edwin Canilang realized he had been bought and sold .
Crowded in the back of a van heading north of Toronto with four other Filipino men last summer , the skilled welder faced another unpaid day on a cleanup detail at a bottling plant .
He thought of his wife , who had just given birth to their third child back home in San Carlos , a five - hour drive north of Manila .
He thought of the promises that lured him to Canada – $ 23 an hour , plus overtime , food and lodging , to help build two icebreakers for the Canadian Arctic .
He thought of his first week in Canada , eight men in the basement of a Toronto house sleeping four to a bed , their passports taken from them .
Then they were trucked north to their new home – a filthy , abandoned farmhouse in the middle of nowhere .
Now , bumping down a dirt road in August 2007 , Canilang mustered the nerve to ask Bob De Rosa , his labour boss , when the first paycheque was coming .
" Do n't you guys know that I spent $ 4,000 to get you ? "
De Rosa snapped back .
What Canilang experienced last summer is an all too - common situation – foreign workers brought to Canada under false pretences and exploited .
Federal officials call it the " modern - day slave trade " and warn of " People for Sale in Canada " in a poster campaign in 17 languages , distributed through Canadian missions around the globe .
At least 800 workers are trafficked into Canada yearly and another 1,000 or more pass through Canada and into the United States , according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Settling back in his seat , Canilang seethed .
De Rosa headed east from Elmvale to deliver his workers – welders and plumbers – to job sites in Barrie and Orillia .
Some were pressed into service at a water bottling plant , run by De Rosa 's family .
Others dug ditches or picked up garbage around a large rural estate where De Rosa lives .
The workers , threatened with deportation , did every menial job thrown at them .
None of the work involved welding and plumbing , the trades that brought them here .
Their ordeal ended six weeks later when welder Eric Martinez , fed up with the squalid living conditions , long hours and no pay , bolted while on a work detail near Hamilton .
Eventually , Martinez managed to contact Philippine embassy officials who alerted ambassador Jose Brillantes to the deplorable situation .
Days later , the men were rescued by Filipino consular staff .
" We did n't believe such scum existed here , " Canilang , 32 , said recently from the safety of a new home and job in Saskatoon .
" Canada has such a great reputation worldwide . "
" This was nothing short of slavery , " said Frank Luna , the labour attaché with the Filipino consulate in Toronto .
" This was a chain gang without the chains . "
At the heart of the case of the Elmvale 11 , as the men have been dubbed by Filipino consular staff , are immigration documents called Labour Market Opinions ( LMO ) issued by Service Canada .
These are Canadian gold cards for foreign workers .
With an LMO , a foreign national can get a temporary permit to work in Canada .
The company that wants the workers must first show Service Canada it made a reasonable – but unsuccessful – effort to hire or train Canadians for the job .
LMOs stipulate the number of workers approved for the job .
Copies are then sent to the workers , who apply for work permits upon arrival in Canada .
Since the federal government relaxed LMO rules two years ago , the program has expanded rapidly .
In 2007 , there were 201,057 temporary foreign workers in Canada , up from 162,046 in 2006 and 142,705 in 2005 .
South of the border , the U.S. State Department recently called Canada " a destination for foreign victims trafficked for labour exploitation " and in an annual report recommended Canada " intensify efforts to investigate , prosecute and convict trafficking offenders . "
Canada 's justice department said the country is combating human trafficking , with new training of RCMP officers and border officials .
Spokesperson Carole Saindon cautioned that the U.S. report is based on the state department 's " own standards and its own perceptions of the situation in Canada . "
A half dozen business people brought the Elmvale 11 to Canada .
Most talked to the Star – pointing fingers of blame at the others .
Bob De Rosa , the labour boss , refused numerous interview requests .
Here 's what happened , according to interviews with most of the players , and documents including work permits , LMOs , invoices and correspondence .
Two years ago , Oakville labour supply company ComFact anticipated a federal contract to supply labour to build two ocean - going icebreakers .
ComFact owner Robert McAllister said he decided to " bank " a workforce and , after obtaining LMOs for more than a hundred workers , sent the paperwork to the Philippines .
Two local recruiting companies in Manila , Cete Millenium , and Sanlee , ran advertisements for jobs with McAllister 's company .
Canilang and the other workers signed up .
They underwent medical exams , upgraded their professional skills and took English lessons – at their own expense .
When they got word they had been approved , the men quit their jobs .
Some sold everything they owned and borrowed at loan - shark rates to make the $ 12,000 payments to the recruiter for an LMO and to buy plane tickets .
They said goodbye to their families and flew to Toronto on June 29 , 2007 .
What they did n't know was that the Canadian government had scrapped the icebreaker contract and that ComFact had no jobs for them .
McAllister said his LMOs , which circulated like hard currency in Manila , were improperly used to get the Elmvale 11 into Canada .
" They ( recruiters in Manila ) basically stole our workers from us and spirited them away , " he said .
" This is human trafficking , but we had nothing to do with it . "
When Canilang and the other workers arrived at Pearson International Airport , they were expecting a ComFact representative .
Instead , they were met by Susan Teng , a woman who said she worked for ComFact but in reality was part of Cete Millenium , the recruiting company in Manila .
A Taiwanese national in Canada on a visitor 's visa , Teng jammed the men into two taxis and ferried them to a house in Scarborough near the Pacific Mall .
Eight arrived that day ; three came a few days later .
Settling them into two sparse rooms in the basement , Teng demanded they turn over their passports and work permits .
She removed all telephones and warned them not to try to phone relatives .
" We slept four people to a bed , " Canilang recalled .
" It was awful . "
A week later , Teng told them ComFact had backed out of the deal .
She said a new company had work , but they would have to relocate .
In an interview , ComFact boss McAllister said this was untrue .
He said he had no idea these workers came to Canada using the LMOs he had obtained .
He later flew to Manila and told local recruiters to stop using the ComFact LMOs .
The workers were picked up at the house by Susan Teng and another man , Imtazur Rahman .
Rahman said he was a lawyer and was there to help them .
A Star investigation ( see tomorrow 's Star ) found labour recruiter Rahman is a twice - bankrupt businessman whose law degree is bogus .
The drive north to Elmvale took two hours .
Teng and Rahman handed over their human cargo to labour boss Bob De Rosa at an abandoned green and white farmhouse on a country road outside of Elmvale .
" This is your new home boys , " De Rosa said .
Ronald Galang could n't believe his eyes .
" Outside , the grass was five feet tall .
Inside there was mud on the floor everywhere .
We had to spend a week cleaning it up . "
Four used mattresses on the floor in two rooms in the attic , four more in the living room .
The sheets and towels were dirty .
There was no food in the fridge .
De Rosa put the men to work at various tasks .
They would be paid eventually , he told them .
The De Rosa family has many business interests , including real estate , construction , and some production facilities .
They also raise buffalo for food .
Bob De Rosa and his brother Vince made headlines in 2003 when police raided two of their properties ( one the former Molson Brewery in Barrie ) and busted a $ 120 million marijuana grow - op .
Seven men involved later pleaded guilty to production and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and received sentences ranging from five years in prison to two years ' house arrest .
The De Rosas , who were not charged , told police they had only leased the brewery space .
For the Filipino men working last summer for Bob De Rosa , a typical day started at 5:15 a.m .
The Star interviewed the Filipino workers and read affidavits they prepared at the request of their embassy , which called in the RCMP .
" They were living in deplorable conditions , " said Frank Luna , the labour attaché who took part in the rescue and prepared a report for the Filipino government .
Welder Ronald Galang worked a 17 - day stretch , splitting his time between an Orillia mechanical company and Aurora Beverage , owned by the De Rosas .
Worker Narciso Nicdao's affidavit states his time sheets from last summer show he did a 24 - hour shift " cleaning beer cage " at Aurora Beverage .
Some of the Elmvale 11 worked at Moonstone Mechanical ( not a De Rosa company ) .
While workers say they were not paid , Moonstone 's Ken Fraser told the Star he paid De Rosa for the services of two men he subcontracted to him .
" All I know is that I paid off all my bills , if they did n't get paid I guess they have to go after Bob , " Fraser said .
Repeated attempts to interview De Rosa were eventually answered by a brief email : " No comment .
Please stop calling , " De Rosa wrote .
At the Elmvale home , food drop - offs were intermittent .
One day , De Rosa brought pasta and tomatoes .
Another day , buffalo meat .
Two weeks into their harsh new life in Canada – broke , depressed and anxious to contact their families in the Philippines – they wandered across the road to a neighbour 's house .
The farmer , a Barrie city cop , took pity on them , took two into town , bought them soft drinks and a meal , and gave them money to buy phone cards .
" They were strangers in this country , isolated , without a phone , " Sgt. George Cabral said .

To combat boredom they constructed a pool table from scrap wood and rigged an old black and white TV with rabbit ears .
Finding two kids ' bikes in the shed they patched the tires and took turns riding up and down the dirt road .
They were never paid their agreed wages .
After many complaints , some received a pittance , always in cash .
Plumber Romero Bonete , for example , was paid only $ 200 by De Rosa .
Bonete now works in Lloydminster , Sask. , in a maintenance job at a local hotel .
Others received $ 900 for six weeks of labour – far below the amount agreed upon .
On Aug. 23 , six weeks after they arrived , they muscled up the courage to tell De Rosa they were n't going to work for him any more .
" Bob de Rosa was so angry with us , " Galang recalled .
" He said , ` I am warning you for the last time , ' then took off saying he was going to sign our deportation order . "
Two hours later , Filipino consulate officials arrived at the farm and took the men out .
A week after his entire Filipino workforce quit on him , De Rosa applied for LMOs to hire 191 workers for a large construction project .
He promised $ 18 to $ 28 an hour and full benefits .
The Canadian government denied the application , saying he had not shown " sufficient efforts " to hire Canadian workers .
So , who made money off the Elmvale 11 ?
Documents suggest some of the people involved have been selling the Canadian LMO documents – which is illegal .
For how much , and who was paid , is not known .
One memo from a Filipino recruitment agency said Toronto - based recruiter Rahman would be paid " one thousand per head " for signing up a worker and another $ 1,000 when the worker arrived in Canada .
It 's not known if those payments went through .
Rahman denies he received money .
He said he got jobs for the Elmvale 11 " from the goodness of my heart . "
" Bob de Rosa asked me if I know any workers .
I know this one girl have some workers .
So I put them together , that 's all . "
Susan
Teng did not respond to requests for an interview .
Another person who touched the case was Nelma de Celis .
ComFact 's McAllister accuses her of selling his LMOs to agencies in the Philippines .
Tracked down to the modest Edmonton house she shares with several of her Filipino clients , de Celis denies the charges .
" You ca n't sell LMOs , " she bellows .
" Those are government documents . "
A memo the Star obtained shows de Celis acknowledging receiving $ 12,000 cash as " partial payment of released LMOs . "
De Celis said any money she received was simply to cover her expenses .
Out west , the Elmvale 11 are spread among several job sites .
As he cooks dinner in the kitchen of the little house on the prairie , Ronald Galang 's thoughts are with his wife and three children , including his twin girls , back in the Philippines .
And he is worried .
Not only was he forced to sell his house and move his family to an apartment in Manila before he left , he also borrowed hard to finance his trip to Canada .
" I have n't been able to pay anything on the loans and I am scared about what these companies might do , " he says his voice trailing off .
" We 're all scared . "
But at least he and the others are in Canada .
They have jobs , they have contracts , and they have a future .
Facing deportation , Galang and four others were hired by Cover - All Building Systems and now work as welders for that company in Saskatoon .
The rest of the 11 are in Canada also , working elsewhere in Saskatchewan , or in Alberta and British Columbia .
" We want them to be Cover - All employees for life , " said Byron Hardy , the company 's manager of human resources .
" They are great workers .
We are now working on having their families join them . "
In the wake of the trafficking scam , the Filipino government closed down Cete Millenium and Sanlee recruitment agencies .
After months of investigations by the RCMP and the Canada Border Services Agency , no charges have been laid .
Amended in November 2005 to reflect the UN 's definition of human trafficking , Canada 's criminal code says it 's a crime for anyone who " recruits , transports , transfers , receives , holds , or harbours a person " for the purpose of exploitation .
" The way exploitation is phrased in the criminal code , they have to fear for their safety or their lives , " said RCMP Const .
Julie Meeks , who conducted the initial investigation .
In her opinion , Meeks said " they just did n't have that fear . "
Edwin Canilang , for one has n't given up on getting the money he believes is owed to him by De Rosa .
" Even slaves , " he says , " have some rights . "

A Beginner 's Python Tutorial
When CivilizationTM IV ( Firaxis Games , published by Take2 ) was announced , one of the most exciting features was that much of the scripting code will be in python , and the game data in XML .
This tutorial attempts to teach you the basics of python programming that you could use with civIV .
Of course , this tutorial is not limited to those who want to play a slow - paced turn - based strategy game .

Only a small number of the first generation iPods have the fault
Apple has admitted that a battery fault had led to a small number of its first generation iPod Nanos overheating .
But it said that the problem was " rare " , occurring in 0.001 % of devices sold between 2005 and 2006 adding there had been no serious injuries or damage .
The comments came after the Japanese government began investigating a possible battery defect in the Nano .
There have been two reports of the music players overheating in Tokyo , scorching nearby paper .
Economy , Trade and Industry ministry official Hiroyuki Yoshitsune said the government was in touch with Apple to investigate the defect .
Battery problems
Apple said the overheating problem , which could lead to the iPod failing to work and being damaged , could be traced to a single battery supplier .
" There have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage , and no reports of incidents for any other iPod Nano model , " it said .
Any customer worried about their device , bought between September 2005 and December 2006 , should contact customer services , Apple added .
Lithium-ion batteries , which are used in iPods , have been blamed for a series of fires in laptops , which resulted in global recalls .
In 2006 , Apple was forced to recall some 1.8 million lithium - ion Sony - made laptop batteries that were prone to overheating .
Four years after pleading guilty to an abortive scheme to steal customer credit card numbers from the Lowe 's hardware chain , hacker Brian Salcedo learned from prison last week that a co-conspirator who pressured him to go through with the hack attack was working for the feds at the time .

*Salcedo , 25 , is serving a record - breaking nine - year prison term for a 2003 intrusion into Lowe 's corporate network .
Salcedo and another hacker had parked outside a Lowe's in Southfield , Michigan and tapped into the store 's unsecured WiFi network .
Over the course of weeks , they used their foothold to penetrate Lowe 's servers at stores across the country , where they eventually planted software that would sniff and store customer credit card numbers as they flew from cash registers to a processing server in North Carolina .
The hackers ' downfall was seemingly straightforward .
According to court records , Lowe 's detected an intrusion and called in the FBI , who staked out the Southfield store 's parking lot and eyeballed Salcedo and his partner working from a Pontiac Grand Prix .
Salcedo pleaded guilty without even looking at the thousands of pages of " discovery " in the case – the government 's evidence .
But now , revelations in last week 's indictment of three Miami men for a WiFi hacking spree have Salcedo replaying in his head a crucial moment in the genesis of his crime – when , a week before he planted the credit card sniffing code , he nearly backed out of the scheme entirely .
Salcedo says he started getting cold feet when he realized that Lowe 's network administrators had detected his presence on their network .
He wanted to bail .
But he had already lined up a buyer for the credit cards – a mysterious figure in the computer underground known as SoupNazi , who would n't take no for an answer .
SoupNazi told Salcedo and his partner that it was too late to turn back , says Salcedo .
" He insinuated threats against us , and said we had to continue doing what we were doing , " Salcedo said in a phone interview from prison Monday .
Last week , federal indictments handed down in Boston unmasked SoupNazi as 27 - year - old Albert Gonzalez , who 's also known as Cumbajohny and Segvec .
Gonzalez is the alleged mastermind of a series of WiFi based intrusions into U.S. retailers , including TJ Maxx , OfficeMax and DSW .
Perfecting the attack pioneered by Salcedo , Gonzalez allegedly stole at least 40 million credit and debit card numbers worth millions of dollars on the black market .
Of significance to Salcedo :
At the time Gonzalez threatened him , he was also working for the feds .
Court records reveal that Gonzalez had been busted in July 2003 – three months before Salcedo 's Lowe 's hack began .
At his arrest , the government admits , Gonzalez became a key informant for the U.S. Secret Service , eventually aiding in the 2004 arrest of 28 fraudsters linked to the credit card fraud supersite Shadowcrew.com .
Now , " I know for a fact that he was an informant during the time that he was dealing with us , " says Salcedo .
Another source involved in the Lowe 's hack independently confirmed Salcedo 's account , and said that SoupNazi cultivated the impression that he was connected to organized crime , and demanded that Salcedo go through with the attack .
It 's unlikely that the Secret Service instructed Gonzalez to threaten Salcedo , and the agency may have been unaware that its informant was even dealing with the Lowe 's hackers , says Mark Rasch , a former Justice Department cybercrime prosecutor .
Rasch notes that it was the FBI , not the Secret Service , that foiled the attack .
But Rasch says the revelations raise enough questions of potential entrapment for Salcedo to attempt a court challenge to his nine - year prison sentence – at the time , the longest sentence for any U.S. hacker , which was upheld by a federal appeals court in 2006 .
" His argument would basically be that ...
Gonzalez threatened him as a government agent in order to induce him to plant the sniffer , " Rasch says .
" He would not have planted the sniffer but for the threat , and his sentence was based on that . "
Salcedo 's prosecutor did not return a phone call Tuesday .
Gonzalez was arrested in a Miami hotel room last week , in possession of more than $ 20,000 in cash and a Glock 27 firearm with ammunition .
Salcedo is serving time at a federal prison camp in McKean , Pennsylvania , where he has a job in the welding shop .
He 's projected for release in October , 2011 .

Editor ’s Note : This was a joint effort between Managing Editor Clayton Cornell and Editorial Intern Orion Kubow .
Apparently it takes two editors to screw in a lightbulb , er vacuum …
Earlier this month , Eureka was kind enough to send us a review sample of their “ green ” vacuum : the EnviroVac .
Vacuuming is n’t something you ’d think of as a real energy efficient , but Eureka ’s model does a good job of making the domestic cleaning process a little bit greener .
EnviroVac : GreenWashing or Real Deal ?
Here are the major talking points that Eureka says qualifies it as a “ green ” vacuum :
The vacuum ’s 8 - amp motor uses 33 % less energy than the 12 - amp motor used in most upright vacuums .
( That ’s 960 watts per hour on an 8 - amp motor , compared to 1,440 watts per hour on a 12 amp motor ) .
If 1/4 of US homes switched to the EviroVac , it would save 6.25 million kilowatt hours of energy per year , which , in terms of CO2 emissions is roughly equivalent to removing 855 cars off the road .
The EnviroVac uses no bags , just a washable HEPA filter , which decreases waste , and the hassle associated with Vacuum bags The HEPA filter captures 99.97 % of dust and allergen particles .
It comes in 100 % recycled packaging .
How Well Does the EnviroVac Work ?
I would n’t call myself a vacuum connoisseur , but this is probably the nicest little vacuum I ’ve ever used ( which could be related to it being the newest vacuums I ’ve ever used ) .
It seems to clean the carpet just as well as any standard vacuum , but with a cool new feature : since the vacuum has no bags , it uses a central plastic cylinder that collects dirt , lint , and dust .
As you vacuum , it creates a vortex in the cylinder that spins all this stuff around .
It ’s a cool effect , and I ’m all for anything that makes the vacuuming process a bit more exciting .
It ’s incredibly easy to remove and empty the collection cylinder , which this is probably the biggest single advantage that the EnviroVac has to offer .
No more dusty vacuum bags to deal with .
The vacuum has the expected standard additional adapters and vacuum heads and they all work very well , despite clinging to the vacuum in a somewhat emotionally unhealthy way .
( You know those insecure extra little vacuum bits . )
What We Did n’t Like about the EnviroVac :
100 % recycled packaging is great , but what about the vacuum itself ?
Seems like it should also be made from recycled products or one of the newer plant - based plastics we ’ve been hearing about .
The green branding of the vacuum may be a little excessive when an Energy Star rating for energy efficiency might be more appropriate .
But all in all , we like the EnviroVac .
At $ 72 ( + tax ) it ’s not going to break your budget , and it does have enough benefits to make it a serious contender for your next home cleaning purchase .
What Is RubyFrontier ?
It ’s a way of maintaining and generating Web sites .
It imitates UserLand Frontier , but it ’s written in Ruby .
It presently uses TextMate ( a superb writing / programming tool , and very nimble when dealing with a big hierarchy of files ) .
In a sense that means RubyFrontier is Mac-only , though there is n’t any a priori reason for this ( since Ruby is platform - agnostic ) .
It ’s not a GUI tool and it ’s not for non-programmers ( it ’s about using Ruby to make the fancy stuff happen in the Web site , such as navigation bars and such ) .
You might like to watch this screencast showing RubyFrontier in action .
Here is some further description of what RubyFrontier is .
Want to see a Web site of about 150 heavily interlinked pages with great navigation , made with RubyFrontier ?

Ah .
I thought you ’d never ask .
Here are the technical details .
Too Much Info .
How Do I Just Get Started ?
My friend Johnny told me to include this section .
Here ’s how I actually start writing a new Web site with RubyFrontier .
And do n’t forget to watch the screencast ; in it , I demonstrate making the initial pages of a Web site .
Interviews with former military officials and government officials , local residents and a former Taliban member who worked in proximity to Mr. Mehsud ’s inner circle portrayed him as a militant leader who is barely educated , attracts more knowledgeable people to his side and is ruthless in his goal of an extreme form of Islamic rule .
He and his main ally , Qari Hussain , whom officials and associates have described as a highly trained and vicious militant , have methodically built up strongholds in North and South Waziristan  killing uncooperative tribal leaders , recruiting unemployed young men to their jihad and filling the vacuum left by a lack of government services .
Now , they also have lieutenants and allies across the tribal region .
In South Waziristan , they run training camps for suicide bombers , some of them children , according to the former Taliban member .
Their realm is so secure that in April Mr. Mehsud ’s umbrella group , Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan , held a conference of thousands of fighters that culminated in a public execution , according to a local resident .
Local Pakistani authorities say they are helpless to deal with Mr. Mehsud ’s group .
In a measure of their despair , on Wednesday the authorities in the Mohmand district , where the conference and public execution were held , announced a truce with the Taliban .
Mr. Mehsud was once a minor figure in the small Shabikhel branch of the fierce Mehsud tribe that lives in South Waziristan , whose inhospitable territory remained a sliver of imperial India left unconquered by the British .
But he managed to enhance his stature through the ambivalence  or protection , according to some officials  of the Pakistani authorities , say former Pakistani military officials and tribal leaders .
His strength grew quickly after February 2005 , when the military , then under the control of President Pervez Musharraf , signed a peace deal with him .
“ That was when I knew the army was not serious , ” said a tribal leader who has dealt with Mr. Mehsud and would not be named for safety reasons .
“ If the army took firm action they could crush him in two months . ”

The best news about yesterday 's White House - Democrat deal on overseas eavesdropping is that the ACLU and the anti-antiterror Internet mob are apoplectic .
This can only be good for U.S. national security .
Too bad the compromise also comes at the cost of a further erosion of Presidential war powers .
The deal would extend the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to cover eavesdropping on terrorist communications overseas .
A six - month extension – the Protect America
Act – expired earlier this year and surveillance authorization on al Qaeda targets will start to expire in August .
The new deal – assuming it is n't defeated by liberals on the House floor – would last for six years .
It is thus a gift to the next President , who wo n't have to spend capital battling those who think that letting our spooks read al Qaeda 's email inevitably means that Dick Cheney is bugging your bedroom .
On the bright side , the deal gives crucial immunity to the telecom companies that in good faith assisted this surveillance after 9/11 .
A reality of this Internet era is that the feds need these private companies to monitor terrorists ; our spies can't merely bug the phones of Russian spies like they could during the Cold War .
The left understands this and has hit the companies with some 40 lawsuits in an attempt to shut down the surveillance by the backdoor , without a political debate that voters might understand .
The telecom ( and other ) companies have thus made it clear that they can't afford to cooperate any longer without immunity .
And so the deal will let the companies escape the lawsuits , for past and future cooperation , if they present to a federal judge a certification from the Attorney General that they are helping at federal request .
The eavesdropping orders that expire in August can thus be renewed , so our security services wo n't have to " go dark " over the global antiterror battlefield .
NEW YORK -- Yankees ace Chien - Ming
Wang is expected to be sidelined until at least September after injuring his foot running the bases , prompting club co-chairman Hank Steinbrenner to chastise the National League for playing without a designated hitter .
An examination in New York on Monday showed Wang partially tore a tendon and sprained his right foot Sunday during the Yankees ' 13 - 0 interleague win at Houston .
He will be on crutches and wear a protective boot for a minimum of six weeks , the latest blow to the team 's banged - up pitching staff .
" My only message is simple .
The National League needs to join the 21st century , " Steinbrenner said in Tampa , Fla .
" They need to grow up and join the 21st century .
" Am I [ mad ] about it ?
Yes , " Steinbrenner added .
" I 've got my pitchers running the bases , and one of them gets hurt .
He 's going to be out .
I do n't like that , and it 's about time they address it .
That was a rule from the 1800s . "
Making a rare appearance on the bases at an NL park , Wang pulled up rounding third and hobbled home on Derek Jeter 's single .
Wang doubled over after scoring , pointed toward his right foot and was helped off the field .

Stupid gender stereotyping and questionable coding practices 101
The WSJ blog of all places has an article about how men and women code ( and women do it better ) .
Apparently , " testosterone - fueled " men tend to write cryptic code without comments , while " touchy - feely and considerate " women tend to write lots of helpful comments and are just all - around nice people .
If you 're going to make sweeping generalizations about how men and women code , I want to see some real studies , not the personal observations of some random female engineer .
The random engineer in question is Emma McGrattan , a high - up muckety - muck about Silicon Valley and the sole source quoted in the article , who
… boasts that 70 % to 80 % of the time , she can look at a chunk of computer code and tell if it was written by a man or a woman .
But that 's not very impressive .
80 % of the programmers at her company are men — she could guess " man " every time and have an 80 % chance of being right .
The ratio of men to women is even higher in the general programmer population ( in the English speaking world , at least ) .
So this means that the accuracy of her spidey senses is less than or equal to chance .
Even granting the premise that women add more comments to their code than men , I have my doubts about whether copious commenting is particularly helpful or even a good idea .
That 's why I 'm not especially enthusiastic about her company 's coding standards :
In an effort to make Ingres ’s computer code more user - friendly and gender - neutral , McGrattan helped institute new coding standards at the company .
They require programmers to include a detailed set of comments before each block of code explaining what the piece of code does and why ; developers also must supply a detailed history of any changes they have made to the code .
The rules apply to both Ingres employees and members of the open - source community who contribute code to Ingres ’s products .
Spot the logical error corner
So , she created gender - neutral coding standards by enforcing the coding style that
she thinks women prefer ?
A detailed history of any changes they have made ?
In the comments ?
Is n't that what source control is for ?
Please do n't tell me that this major company has replaced its source - control system with code comments .
The alternative is that this standard breaks the DRY principle ( do n't repeat yourself ) by duplicating source - control information in the comments .
That 's not the only problem with this standard .
The big problem with comments is that they lie .
Code , on the other hand , never lies .
It does what it says it does ( albeit sometimes cryptically ) .
It 's very common for programmers to modify the code without bothering to modify the comments ; the comments , therefore , get out of date .
It 's much better , in my opinion , to document code in a way that can never get out of date : with unit tests .
I know it 's a cliché , but I believe that comments should tell you the why , and unit tests should tell you the what and the how of the code .
At any rate , this article still gave me a warm fuzzy because the draconian standards imposed by Emma give lie to the depressing stereotypes that the article espouses .

A ' Green ' Convertible Currency Many countries of the world face a fourfold dilemma .
They are experiencing unemployment , inflation , and ecological degradation , and they lack a convertible currency .
They produce some raw materials for which an international market exists , but because of the burden of debt servicing and a soft currency , their dilemma yearly becomes more acute .
This article proposes a solution in the form of a new convertible currency , that I call New Currency .
This comprises a combination of two familiar concepts : stamp scrip and currency backed by a basket of commodities .
Stamp scrip is a medium of exchange characterized by a small monthly " user fee " or " negative interest " charge .
This fee was typically levied by requiring a small stamp to be affixed to the back of the bill each month to revalidate it .
The user fee gives an incentive to the bearer not to hoard this currency .
Its practical and demonstrated economic effects include strong , positive impacts on employment creation and on inflation control .
It also provides structural support for ecologically sound economic growth .
It has been tested and used with remarkable success in a variety of cultures and historical settings , including Western Europe as recently as the 1930s .
The second concept -- a currency backed by a predetermined basket of commodities -- is more familiar .
An original aspect of my proposed plan is that a country 's central bank would guarantee delivery of the value of the basket but would remain free to deliver it in the form of any mix of the commodities included in it .
This approach provides unusual stability for the international value of the currency , while guaranteeing substantial flexibility in the way the country fulfills its commitments .
The stamp scrip concept actively promotes internal economic stability and employment growth , while the basket of commodities concept ensures immediate convertibility of the national currency and the international stability of its purchasing value .
These two concepts fit together by equating the negative interest rate of the stamp scrip with the approximate costs of storing , insuring , and delivering to their respective international markets the commodities in the basket .
1. The Stamp Scrip Concept
The negative - interest scrip concept was originally developed during the latter part of the last century by an Argentinian businessman and economist named Silvio Gesell .
The basic ( and unusual ) premise is that money as a medium of exchange is considered a public service good , and therefore a small user fee is levied on it .
Instead of receiving interest for retaining such a currency , the bearer in fact pays interest for its use ( typically at a rate of 1 to 2 percent a month ) .
Interestingly enough , Gesell 's concept of " negative - interest money " was supported by John Maynard Keynes in his General Theory .
However , banking interests have rather consistently strenuously opposed it , even though banks could keep a key role in a New Currency economic system .
The primary practical effect of a negative - interest currency is a strong incentive to avoid hoarding .
People prefer to spend the currency very quickly on goods or services and thereby generate a chain reaction of economic transactions that otherwise would occur much more slowly or simply not at all .
This means in practice a strong and immediate creation of local employment without the need for government intervention .
Thus , negative - interest scrip can be created and used in a local setting to generate local employment and other benefits .
When stamp scrip was used from 1932 to 1934 in the Austrian town of Worgl ( in parallel with the official state currency ) , there was immediate creation of addition aI employment without the need for government intervention and without the creation of new local or public debt .
The alternate currency circulated with many times the rapidity of the official Austrian currency , and there was local prosperity in the midst of national depression .
Negative - interest currency can help to push inflation down .
Inflation is simply the depreciation of a currency in terms of goods .
A negative - interest currency -- like any commodity that has a significant storage cost -- becomes automatically more valuable over time ( a look at the price of future delivery of gold or copper in the financial pages compared to today 's " spot " price shows that effect ) .
In addition , in a " normal " economy , there is a substantial amount of hidden debt servicing in every purchase we make -- estimates put it on average at 30 to 50 percent -- which would be gradually eliminated by the introduction of negative - interest currency .
The combination of the automatic appreciation of the value of the currency and the gradual reduction of the interest component from all capital - intensive goods and services , results in a powerful technique to combat inflationary tendencies .
There is an additional beneficial effect with regard to the environment .
The higher the money rate of interest , the stronger is the pressure to discount the future and to place immediate gains ahead of long - term concerns .
With negative - interest currency , this pressure is not only absent but even reversed , and more environment - friendly priorities automatically prevail .
During the economic depression of the 1930s , Europe saw a number of practical monetary experiments with negative - interest alternative currency .
The device worked splendidly .
The alternative currency ( typically issued by a small city or region ) had many times the rapidity of circulation of the official currency , and the anticipated employment and environmental benefits were actualized .
In Worgl , for example , people spontaneously started replanting forests just to dispose of their negative - interest currency in anticipation of future cash flow to be expected from the growing trees .
In every case , however , the central bank halted the experiment after a few years .
The experiments were blocked not because they were unsuccessful but because they were so remarkably successful that they were perceived as threatening to centralized decision - making and the central bank 's monopoly on issuing currency .
2. Commodity - Based Currency
Wondering who the filmmaker is behind the 13 - minute attack video A Video Portrait of Barack Hussein Obama ?
So were we .
Though the narrator identifies himself as " Lorne Baxter , " and e-mails to the production company are answered by " Rodney Talmud , " it turns out the man behind the video is a 28 - year - old Christian television producer from North Carolina named Jason " Molotov " Mitchell , who has priors for inflammatory YouTubing .
Jason " Molotov " Mitchell is producer and host of the Christian television show Flamethrower .
The video , you 'll recall , has supposedly racked up a million - and - a - half views on the conservative - leaning Eyeblast.tv .
Among other things , it regurgitates the false viral e-mail claim that Obama refuses to put his hand over his heart during the national anthem , and claims that the Democratic candidate has been a disciple of racism , Marxism , quasi-Christianity , Islam and anti-Semitism .
" When we are at war with Islamic terrorism , can Americans elect a man with not one , not two , but three Islamic names ? " the video poses .
The viral video provides a rare opportunity to examine the source of a pseudonomous internet political smear , the type of which is widely expected to play a role in November 's presidential election .
Recent press reports have shown that such attacks have already gained traction with some white voters , who erroneously believe that Obama is a Muslim , based on internet chain letters making the claim .
The video was made by Mitchell 's company , Illuminati Pictures .
Mitchell is former wedding videographer who now produces and hosts a weekly Christian television show called Flamethrower , which began airing on the satellite network Faith TV last October .
A round - table show featuring Mitchell and three other Christian panelists , Flamethrower is best known for a segment that never aired .
Produced in January , Mitchell 's video Making Mohammed Cookies !
shows a chef , wearing Islamic headdress , baking a cookie in the shape of the Muslim prophet .
He 's interrupted at one point by his roommate , whom he shoots with a handgun while yelling , " Jew ! "
Faith TV refused to broadcast the video , setting off controversy with some conservatives .
Mitchell subsequently put a portion of the video on YouTube .
" He tamed the show down a lot after that , " says Faith TV vice president Mark MacGregor .
" I told him we 're not going to air that , and if he keeps doing that kind of thing we 're not going to air him at all ....
I felt like we could reach the Muslim community through a loving tone . "
Jason Mitchell appears in a still taken from a tribute video produced by his wife for the couple 's anniversary .
The tattoo reads " zealot . "
Image : YouTube.comMacGregor , who was not familiar with the Obama video , describes Mitchell as a talented producer with a " real heart for speaking the truth , " and contempt for political correctness .
" He makes a lot of political statements that can be incendiary , " says MacGregor .
" We air it on Saturday night at 10 p.m .
We used to air it earlier in the day , but we moved it into the evening because of that kind of thing . "
Mitchell 's cookie video has accumulated about 1,000 views on YouTube , which makes his new video far more successful .
Though prominent conservative bloggers and pundits seem to be shying away from the Obama smear , it 's being aggressively hawked on message boards and in e-mail , in much the same way as earlier , ongoing e-mail chains striking the same themes .
An e-mail in circulation promoting the Obama video , penned by a self - described friend of Mitchell 's , encourages readers to " forward it to as many people as you possibly can . "
" Key figures have told us that this video has the potential to really change things , if we can get enough people to watch it , " the e-mail reads .
Mitchell did not immediately return a phone call Wednesday .

LAGOS , Nigeria ( Reuters )  Militants in Nigeria ’s oil heartland said Saturday they had used missiles , grenades and speedboats in a deadly offensive against army positions , but the military denied it had come under attack .
The militants ’ group , called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , known as MEND , said it killed 29 soldiers in attacks in three locations , which it said it were in response to the killing of civilians by security forces .
“ Operation Hunter Hunted involved the use of several fast - attack speedboats , general purpose machine guns , rocket - propelled grenades and deadly Soviet - made antitank missiles at close range combat , ” MEND said in an e-mail statement .
The group said six of its own fighters died in the coordinated attacks .
Lt. Col. Rabe Abubakar , military spokesman for Bayelsa and Delta States , denied the army was under attack , saying soldiers were carrying out regular duties .
In 2001 reports about Zip Bombs or Zip of Death attacks made the round on the Internet and I thought it would be nice to write about one shiny harmless example of that technique .
On first glance the file 42.zip is a normal compressed file with the size of 42 Kilobytes .
Many users who run a virus scanner will probably run into troubles downloading that file to their computer .
It still looks like a normal 42 Kilobyte archive after the download but the surprise begins when you try to unpack that file .
What they did was basically pack a 4.3 Gigabyte file consisting only of zeros .
That packed file was replicated 16 times and packed again , and again , and again , and again .
Or , to use their own words :
The file contains 16 zipped files , which again contains 16 zipped files , which again contains 16 zipped files , which again contains 16 zipped , which again contains 16 zipped files , which contain 1 file , with the size of 4.3GB .
You could basically unpack the 42 Kilobyte file into 4.5 Petabyte of uncompressed data if your hard drive storage space would be enough to do that .
It is usually not enough to do just that , so you either need to browse the file in your archiver of choice , or believe what the creator of the file has posted about the file on the website .
The zip file is password protected , probably to avoid that it gets flagged during download by an antivirus program .
Update : Most modern antivirus programs should detect the file these days and block it from being extracted on the system .
If you want to test your antivirus solution download the file to your system and try to extract it .

Few places on Earth are as untouched as the “ Crown of the Continent ” — a 10 - million - acre expanse of mountains , valleys and prairies in Montana and Canada .
The area has sustained all the same species — including grizzlies , lynx , moose and bull trout — for at least 200 years .
Now — in one of the most significant conservation sales in history —
The Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land have preserved 320,000 acres of forestlands in western Montana that provide valuable habitat for species in the Crown of the Continent .
“ There has n’t been an animal extinction here since Lewis and Clark encountered it in the early 19th century , ” explains Kat Imhoff , the Conservancy ’s state director in Montana .
“ It ’s the only such ecosystem in the Lower 48 states . ”
The deal is part of the Conservancy ’s large - scale efforts to protect forestlands around the world — the majority of which are working forests supplying sustainably harvested timber .
Over the past five years , the Conservancy has protected 3.5 million acres of forestlands — at a time when nearly one - half of Earth ’s original forest cover is gone and global deforestation rates continue to rise .
‘ A Landmark Conservation Project ’ That Also Benefits People
The initiative — known as the Montana Legacy Project — helps more than nature .
Crucial to the deal are its benefits to people , including :
Maintaining the forests in sustainable timber management — keeping jobs in Montana and maintaining local businesses .
— keeping jobs in Montana and maintaining local businesses .
Promoting continued public access to these lands for fishing , hiking and other recreational pursuits .
to these lands for fishing , hiking and other recreational pursuits .
Helping to curtail a growing trend nationwide — the conversion of timberlands into residential developments .
“ This is a landmark conservation project that will benefit the environment and help to maintain strong local businesses , ” says Imhoff .
Stopping Habitat and Landscape Fragmentation
The land is being sold to the Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land by Plum Creek Timber Company , the largest private landowner in the United States and owner of 1.2 million acres of forestlands in Montana .
In recent years , a downturn in the timber industry has led companies such as Plum Creek and International Paper to divest their holdings and sell their land — much of which has been bought by developers and subdivided into smaller parcels , fragmenting large landscapes .
The lands covered in the agreement include multiple parcels spread across western Montana , primarily in Swan Valley and areas surrounding Missoula .
Together , these lands provide crucial pathways for wide - ranging animals such as grizzly bears and wolverines to feed , breed and rear their young .
The area also includes some of the most popular recreation lands in the western United States .
Under the Montana Legacy Project , the purchased lands will be transferred into a mixture of private , state and federal ownership , allowing sustainable timber harvesting for Plum Creek for up to 15 years .
Conservation easements will restrict subdivision and home development on the vast majority of lands sold into private ownership .
And maintaining public access for recreation will be a top priority .
Neither the Conservancy nor The Trust for Public Land will retain long - term ownership of any lands .
The Farm Bill ’s Role
Funding for the $ 510 million purchase could come from several private and public sources — including a new Qualified Conservation Forestry Bonds program that was included in the recently passed federal Farm Bill .
The bonds were designed to help fund the purchase of ecologically important lands that are adjacent to existing U.S. Forest Service owned - lands .
The purchased lands would eventually be conveyed to the Forest Service .
Funding for the purchase is also being sought from other sources , including the state of Montana , private philanthropists and investors .
This would be the first forest - protection effort to receive these newly designated bonds , which were championed by U.S. Senator Max Baucus of Montana .
“ This project is a once - in - a lifetime opportunity to protect these lands for our families and future generations , ” said Montana Senator Max Baucus , who helped facilitate the agreement .
“ It will keep jobs in Montana , help maintain our communities and our working forests , and preserve public access for hunting and fishing .
This will be the most significant land conservation project in the state ’s history , by far , and I ’m proud to be part of it . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson complained on Tuesday that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama can seem to be “ talking down to black people ” at times and should broaden his message .

But Jackson apologized for a disparaging remark about Obama at the weekend while he was speaking into an open microphone that he thought had been turned off and which CNN said was too crude to broadcast .
Jackson , talking to CNN on Wednesday , said Obama has given what amounts to “ lectures ” at African - American churches .
“ I said it can come off as speaking down to black people .
The moral message must be a much broader message .
What we need really is racial justice and urban policy and jobs and health care .
There is a range of issues on the menu , ” said Jackson , who was an acolyte of the slain civil rights leader , Martin Luther King Jr.
Obama would be America ’s first black president if elected on November 4 over Republican John McCain .
Jackson ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and lost .
Jackson told CNN the remark he apologized for was “ a sound bite within a broader conversation about urban policy and racial disparities .
And I feel very distressed because I ’m supportive of this campaign and with what the senator has done and is doing . ”
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said the candidate accepted Jackson ’s apology .
“ ( Obama ) will continue to speak out about our responsibilities to ourselves and each other , and he of course accepts Reverend Jackson ’s apology , ” Burton said .
Jackson made the remark after an interview with Fox TV .
“ I was in a conversation with a fellow guest at Fox on Sunday .
He asked about Barack ’s speeches lately at the black churches .
I said it can come off as speaking down to black people , ” Jackson said .
“ And then I said something I felt regret for -- it was crude .
It was very private , and very much a sound bite -- and a live mike .
I find no comfort in it , I find no joy in it .
“ So I immediately called the senator ’s campaign to send my statement of apology to repair the harm or hurt that this may have caused his campaign , because I support it unequivocally . ”
Jackson ’s son , Jesse L. Jackson Jr , an Illinois congressman and active Obama supporter , condemned his father ’s remarks .
“ Revered Jackson is my dad and I ’ll always love him .
He should know how hard that I ’ve worked for the last year and a half as a national co-chair of Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign .
So , I thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric , ” he said in a statement .

I dropped in to hear Rich Hickey talk about Clojure at the New York Semantic Web meetup group .
Some highlights :
• Some programs , like compilers or theorem provers , are themselves functions .
They take input and produce output .
Purely functional languages like Haskell are good for these kinds of programs .
But other programs , like GUIs or automation systems , are not functions .
For example , a program that runs continously for months or years is not a function in the mathematical sense .
Clojure is mostly functional , but not purely functional .
• Most Clojure programmers go through an arc .
First they think “ eww , Java ” and try to hide all the Java .
Then they think “ ooh , Java ” and realize that Clojure is a powerful way to write Java code .
Rich frowns upon “ wrapper ” functions in Clojure that do nothing but wrap a Java method .
Calling the Java method directly is faster and easier to look up in JavaDoc .
• Rich recommended a paper , Out of the Tar Pit , for a discussion of functional and relational techniques to manage state .
• Clojure ’s data structures are persistent .
This is n’t persistent in the stored - in - a - database sense .
It refers to immutability .
For example , adding an element to a vector creates a new vector that shares structure with the old one .
Because all data structures are immutable , this is both safe and efficient .
Clojure ’s hash maps , for example , have time complexity of log - base - 32 , which is so small it ’s practically constant .
• The first thing Rich did when experimenting with the semantic web was to pull data out of the Jena API and get it into Clojure data structures .
That allows him to leverage the full power of Clojure ’s data manipulation functions .
This opens up a world of possibilities that he would n’t have if he stuck with Jena objects .
Basically , having your data trapped inside objects is bad , because you ’re limited to whatever methods those objects provide .
With generic data structures , you can re-use and compose all the functions that Clojure already provides .
Screencasts and code from the talk should appear soon — watch clojure.org or the Clojure Google group for an announcement .
Then I do n't want to know what defeat would be .
Even I am getting tired of writing about Gretchen Morgenson columns , but this one cries out for demystification .
Anyone who wants to claim that any homeowner who stops foreclosure and keeps her home has necessarily " won " anything or received any particular financial benefit needs to read this post .
This is a profoundly important issue : the whole " stop foreclosure " movement is based on the assumption that stopping a foreclosure is always and everywhere a " win " for homeowners .
Morgenson appears to buy this idea so much that her reporting crosses the line from its typical tendentiousness to outright distortion in order to sustain the myth .
I suggest that no actually useful and successful response to the " foreclosure crisis " will ever come about as long as this kind of distortion goes unchallenged .
*************
Here 's Morgenson : MAMIE RUTH PALMER is n’t a celebrity .
People magazine does n’t chronicle her every move .
The paparazzi do n’t wait for a photo op outside of the modest Atlanta home where she has lived since 1987 .
But in some mortgage circles , Ms. Palmer , a 74 - year - old former housekeeper , has earned her moment of fame .
After enduring six years in foreclosure hell , almost losing her home twice , Ms. Palmer has escaped intact .
Last month she received a settlement from the Bank of New York , the trustee for a vast pool of mortgages that included hers .
Under the terms of the deal , the bank reduced Ms. Palmer ’s loan balance to $ 59,000 from about $ 100,000 and has agreed to accept the proceeds of a reverse mortgage in full satisfaction of her obligation .
The settlement also eliminated about $ 12,000 in foreclosure fees added to her debt and called for the installation of central air - conditioning in Ms. Palmer ’s home .
Roughly $ 10,000 in legal fees billed over five years by Ms. Palmer ’s lawyer , Howard D. Rothbloom , will be covered by payments she has made toward her mortgage while she was battling foreclosure .
“ I feel good , ” Ms. Palmer said last week .
“ It ’s been a long time coming . ”
To celebrate , she said , she is going to Florida to fish with her nephew .
Ms. Palmer ’s case is hardly unique .
It ’s just one of a swelling number that revolve around the thorny issue of who owns the note on a home when it ’s forced into foreclosure proceedings .
This case is not " about " who owns a note .
It just is n't .
Certainly , among the tens of thousands of dollars worth of objections and motions made by Palmer 's attorneys over the course of six years , there was some question about the standing of the mortgage servicer .
It appears that the servicer produced some pretty sloppy paperwork for the court .
It appears that the Debtor 's attorney also filed some pretty sloppy paperwork with the court , too , which dragged out the challenge to the servicer 's standing for months .
( If you want to read a first - rate judicial slapdown and you have a PACER account , do n't miss Judge Massey 's " Order Directing Debtor 's Counsel to Withdraw Objection to Claim of HomeEq Servicing Corporation or To Litigate The Objection Properly , " In re Palmer , Case No. 02-81333 , docketed 3-31-03 , US Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Georgia . )
At the end of it , the mortgage servicer withdrew its proof of claim and the trustee of the security owning this loan ( Bank of New York ) entered the case directly .
I do not see from my review of the documents on PACER that there was ever any question that Bank of New York as trustee for the MBS had standing in bankruptcy or was owed money .
The final complaint that resulted in a settlement of this case alleged that Bank of New York charged inappropriate fees .
There was no challenge at all to BNY as the creditor .
At no time , it seems , was there ever any question about the fact that Palmer had a mortgage loan and did not make payments either pre- or post-petition .
Documents in this case indicate that the mortgage loan in question was originated in October of 1996 , and that Palmer began making late payments by June of 1997 .
Palmer failed to pay taxes and insurance on the property .
She filed prior bankruptcies in 1999 , 2000 , and 2002 , each of which was dismissed .
When this $ 52,000 loan was first originated on what was then a $ 78,000 property , the monthly payment exclusive of taxes and insurance was $ 554.97 , and it became clear within a year that Palmer could not afford that .
By November of 2005 , Palmer owed ( according to her servicer ) $ 50,611.70 in principal , $ 10,104.98 in escrow advances , $ 19,802.60 in accrued but unpaid interest , and $ 11,379.90 in legal fees , late charges , etc .
During most of this period she does not appear to have made any mortgage payments , or any payments for taxes and insurance .
The final complaint made by Palmer 's attorneys alleged that some fees were inappropriate .
By this time there was no question that Bank of New York had a proof of claim ; the argument was about how much the debtor owed .
I have no idea whether the $ 10,000 Morgenson reports as being the cost of Palmer 's own attorney 's efforts is " appropriate " or not .
It appears that BNY just got seriously tired of all of this and did , indeed , decide to settle .
But Morgenson 's description of that settlement leaves a lot to be desired .
I quote from Judge James E. Massey 's Interim Consent Order of May 5 , 2008 :
The parties have reached a settlement of any and all claims that were or could have been raised in this case .
Plaintiff has been approved by Financial Freedom , a subsidiary of Indymac Bank , for a reverse mortgage to be secured by her residence .
Plaintiff will receive approximately $ 79,530.00 in a principal limit .
The lender will deduct approximately $ 6,436.00 for the cost of closing the loan and approximately $ 5,946.98 for servicing the loan .
Approximately $ 7,300.00 must be set aside for repairs to be made as a condition of the loan .
After all deductions , Plaintiff will receive approximately $ 59,847.02 .
From the proceeds of the reverse mortgage , Plaintiff will pay the sum of $ 57,800.00 to Defendants and Defendants shall accept the sum of $ 57,800.00 in settlement and as full and final satisfaction of the entire debt owed by Plaintiff to Defendants .
Upon receipt of these funds , Defendants shall cause the deed to secure debt on Plaintiff ’s residence to be released and will withdraw the proof of claim filed by them in this case .
The Trustee shall not disburse any additional funds whatsoever to Defendants for ongoing mortgage payments or for any proof of claim filed by Defendants in the case .
The parties shall bear their own respective costs incurred in this adversary proceeding .
So this is how Mamie Palmer came out " intact " : she began her case owing $ 51,000 in principal and around $ 76,500 in total , including interest , escrow , and legal fees .
She now owes $ 79,530 .
She will also have to pay $ 10,000 to her attorney out of payments she made to the bankruptcy trustee .
She gets $ 7300 worth of repairs to her home .
Although her new mortgage , being a reverse mortgage , will not require her to make monthly payments , she will still have to pay taxes , insurance , and maintentance out of pocket , since the initial disbursement for this loan was equal to its full principal limit .
If she does not make those payments , she can face foreclosure from IndyMac .
Or , well , the FDIC .
If the FDIC is willing ever to foreclose on any IndyMac loans .
I guess that punishes the investors in Palmer 's mortgage loans and her mortgage servicer for having made an error on a mortgage assignment : they 'll be writing off most of their accrued interest and all their legal expenses .
I suppose it 's just more of the crashing irony of this story that Palmer 's new loan now belongs to us taxpayers , unless the FDIC can find a buyer for IndyMac .
That and the fact that a homeowner left the bankruptcy system owing more , not less , than she did when she started .
One of our regular commenters likes to tell me this is called " rough justice , " and I should " get used to it . "
I 'm not sure I 'd call this " rough justice . "
I certainly will not call this a " victory " for a homeowner in " foreclosure hell . "
Whatever Morgenson is smoking , she needs to give it up .
Continuing their tradition of banning videogames , the Office of Film and Literature Classification ( OFLC ) have decided that Fallout 3 is n’t going to get a classification in Australia ( and thus ca n’t be sold legally ) .
However , the OFLC reasoning seems inconsistent even with their own past censorship efforts , and has reignited the debate over Australia ’s lack of an R18 + gaming classification .
As Asher Moses reports :
The Classification Board effectively banned the role playing shooter game by refusing to issue it an age rating , citing the simulated drug use in the game .
In Fallout 3 , players can use drugs to augment their characters ’ abilities such as stamina , health and intelligence .
The ban stems from the lack of an R18 + classification for games in Australia , which means any titles that do not meet the MA15 + standard – such as those with excessive violence , drug use or sexual content – are simply banned from sale .
Gamers were outraged by the board ’s decision because other games featuring a similar or higher level of drug use have passed through the censors unscathed .
Game review site Gameplayer.com.au , which has begun a petition to “ Save Fallout 3 ” , has compiled a list of 12 games with stronger drug use .
They include Battlefield Bad Company , BioShock , Haze and Grand Theft Auto IV .
As the uneven hand of the OFLC becomes more obvious , surely the time is at hand to admit the practice of banning games which have less offensive content than many films needs to be curtailed and Australia finally needs an R18 + category for videogames .
Update ( 14 August 2008 ) : After unspecified edits and changes were made to the game , the ban was lifted in August 2008 , with the game gaining an MA15 + rating .
How many times has this happened to you ?
You leave work , decide that you need to get groceries on the way home , take a cellphone call and forget all about your plan .
Next thing you know , you ’ve driven home and forgotten all about the groceries .
Or this .
You decide , perhaps circa Jan. 1 , that it ’s time to lose weight ; you need to eat less , eat better and exercise more .
But by the first of May , your New Year ’s resolutions are a distant memory .
Human beings are , to put it gently , in a unique position in the animal world .
We ’re the only species smart enough to plan systematically for the future -- yet we remain dumb enough to ditch even our most carefully made plans in favor of short - term gratification .
( “ Did I say I was on a diet ?
Mmm , but three - layer chocolate mousse is my favorite .
Maybe I ’ll start my diet tomorrow . ” )
In a wonderful study conducted at Stanford University in the late 1960s , psychologist Walter Mischel offered preschoolers a choice : a marshmallow now , or two marshmallows if they could wait until he returned .
And then , cruelly , he left them alone with nothing more than themselves , the single marshmallow , a hidden camera and no indication of when he would return .
A few of the kids ate the oh - so - tempting marshmallow the minute he left the room .
But most kids wanted the bigger bonus and endeavored to wait .
So they tried .
Hard .
But with nothing else to do in the room , the torture was visible .
The kids did just about anything they could to distract themselves from the tempting marshmallow that stood before them .
They talked to themselves , bounced up and down , covered their eyes , sat on their hands -- strategies that more than a few adults might on occasion profitably adopt .
Even so , for about half the kids , the 15 to 20 minutes until Mischel returned was just too long to wait .
Toddlers , of course , are n’t the only humans who melt in the face of temptation .
Teenagers often drive at speeds that would be unsafe even on an autobahn , and people of all ages have been known to engage in unprotected sex with strangers , even when they are perfectly aware of the risks .
( To say nothing of the daily uncontrollable choices of alcoholics , drug addicts and compulsive gamblers . )
What gives ?
Why are we as a species so often so desperately poor at achieving our goals ?
If we are , as the selfish - gene theory would have it , organisms that exist only to serve the interests of our genes , why do we waste so much of our time doing things that are not , in any obvious way , remotely in the interest of our genes ?
How can one explain , for example , why a busy undergraduate would spend four weeks playing “ Halo 3 " rather than studying for his exams ?
The selfish - gene theory does n’t , in itself , answer these questions , but there is another facet of evolution that can :
The fact that evolution is entirely blind , unable to look forward , backward or to the side .
As Charles Darwin observed , evolution invariably proceeds through a process called “ descent with modification . ”
In lay language , this means that Mother Nature never starts from scratch , no matter how useful an overhaul might be .
Everything that evolves necessarily builds on that which came before .
Our arms , to take one simple example , are adaptations of the front legs of our primate ancestors .
In practical terms , that means that evolution ’s products are n’t always particularly sound .
Truly dismal solutions are quickly weeded out ; if someone has a genetic condition that brings them into the world without a functioning heart , they do n’t live long enough to reproduce .
But merely adequate solutions ( what engineers call “ kluges ” ) -- like the awkward , injury - prone human spine , good enough but far from perfect -- can stick around indefinitely if better solutions are too far away on the evolutionary landscape .
In the mental machinery that governs our everyday decisions , kluges abound .
Take , for example , the scenario described in the beginning of the essay -- the fellow who forgets his errand on the way home .
His problem is clearly not in finding his way to the grocery store -- it ’s in remembering to go in the first place .
The problem is that evolution failed to realize that remembering goals is not like recognizing objects .
When your brain sees a lion , the thing to do is to decide , lickety - split , to get out of the way .
Run first ; ask questions later .
We ’re programmed for just that kind of split - second decision ; just about every creature on the planet is built such that it can identify things like predators and prey very rapidly .
We ’re not programmed to remember precise episodes from the past .
Why not ?
Because remembering the exact date on which you last saw a lion is not particularly helpful when you ’re trying to get out of the way .
Alas , evolution did n’t have the foresight to realize that different kinds of tasks require different kinds of memory , and it used the same basic sort of memory for everything , not just for remembering what lions and tigers look like ( in which general tendencies suffice ) but also for cases -- like tracking our goals -- where a bit more precision would have been helpful .
As a result , trying to remember what to do next can be a little like trying to remember what you had for breakfast yesterday :
There are too many breakfasts and too many yesterdays for our biological memories to keep track of .
The same thing can happen with our goals .
When you sit in your car late in the day and ask yourself , “ What am I supposed to do next ? ” and all of a sudden the cellphone rings , your brain can easily lose track of which “ next step ” is the right one .
Instead of zeroing in on the specific memory it needs , it may well settle for remembering whatever you ’ve done in the car most often -- and that ’s drive home .
Voila , autopilot .
Our attempts to pursue our goals are often thwarted by the fact that evolution has built our most sophisticated technologies on top of older technologies -- without working out how to integrate the two .
We can plan in advance , using our modern deliberative reasoning systems , but our ancestral reflexive mechanisms , which evolved first , still basically control the steering wheel .
When the chips are down , it ’s those mechanisms that our brains turn to , and that means that our brains frequently wind up relying on machinery that is all about acting first and asking questions later , squandering some of the efforts of our deliberative system .
No sensible engineer would have designed things this way .
Why design fancy machinery for making long - term goals if you ’re not going to use it ?
Yet the brain is structured such that the more tired , stressed or distracted we are , the less likely we are to use our forebrains and the more likely to lean back on the time - tested but shortsighted machinery we ’ve inherited from our ancestors .
Still , all is not lost .
Even though our short - term desires are pretty good at grabbing the steering wheel of our consciousness , our more recently evolved deliberate minds are powerful enough to regain at least some measure of control .
Consider , for example , the difficulty that most people having in sticking to abstract goals like “ I intend to lose weight ” or “ I plan to finish this article before the deadline . ”
Nice thoughts , but not formulated in terms that your ancestral , reflexive brain might understand .
The work - around ?
Translate those abstract goals into a form your ancestral systems -- which traffic largely in dumb reflexes -- can understand : if - then .
If you find yourself in a particular situation , then take a specific action : “ If I see French fries , then I will avoid them . ”
As Peter Gollwitzer , my colleague in New York University ’s department of psychology , has shown , even simple changes like these can markedly increase the chances of success .
Our conscious , deliberate systems will never have total control , and our memories will never be perfect , but as they say in Alcoholics Anonymous , recognition is the first step .
If we come to recognize our limitations , and how they evolved , we just might be able to outwit our inner kluge .
Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at New York University , is the author , most recently , of “ Kluge : The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind . ”
In my last post , I described a Javascript client to display results from Google 's JSON search service .
In that , I used a PHP proxy to get around Javascript 's Same Origin Policy .
A cleaner remoting architecture called JSONP or Padded JSON , proposed by Bob Ippolito , and supported by most JSON web services , relies on the server being able to emit a JSON response wrapped in a client specified callback function .
To request padded JSON , the client would populate an optional query parameter which would contain the Javascript callback function name .
The client code would implement the callback function .
The implementation would typically parse the JSON response and construct HTML to populate into the innerHTML element of a div tag on the page displayed on the browser .
So when the query is sent to the server , the JSON response is wrapped inside the specified callback function name .
For example , a query to the Yahoo WebSearchService API would look something like this :
1 2 3 http://search.yahooapis.com/WebSearchService/webSearch?query=foo&\ callback=handleResponse&\ appid=get-your-own-yahoo-id-and-stick-it-in-here
And the server will return a JSON response wrapped within the callback , which is executed as a Javascript function call .
1 handleResponse ( json_response_string ) ;
So now if we defined a function handleResponse ( String ) , then whatever is in the function will be executed .
I think this approach is quite beautiful ( in the Beautiful Code sense ) - not only does it exploit the macro expansion feature in interpreted languages in a clever yet intuitive way , it enables true serverless operation by getting around Javascript 's Same Origin Policy .
Setting up the client to do dynamic calls is a bit of a pain with this approach though .
Since we do n't know the search term until its entered , so using plain Javascript involves manipulating the DOM tree to insert the call into a html / head / script element .
However , there are a lot of Javascript frameworks around which make light of this work .
One such framework is Dojo , which comes with both JSON and UI components .
In this post , I describe a client that I built using Dojo to run against Yahoo's WebSearch API to display search results from my blog .
Dojo has a fairly steep learning curve , but it is very well - documented , and the resulting code is very easy to read and maintain .
Here is the code ( really an HTML page containing Javascript code ) :

( CNN ) --
With the Democratic convention just a week away , the countdown is on for Sen. Barack Obama to make his VP announcement .
Sen .
Joe Biden is considered a top VP contender because of his foreign policy credentials .
While there is a chance Obama could wait until the convention to announce his pick , he 's expected to end the guessing game this week .
Obama 's campaign says that when the senator from Illinois makes up his mind , an alert will be sent to supporters via e-mail and text messages .
The presumptive Democratic nominee has n't dropped any hints about who's on his shortlist , but several people stand out as likely contenders for the No. 2 spot .
Obama on Monday is campaigning in New Mexico , Gov. Bill Richardson 's home state .
Richardson is considered a good pick because he could help bring in support from the Latino community .
But Richardson did n't endorse Obama until late in the game , and he did n't get very far in his own White House run .
Also in the spotlight is Sen. Joe Biden .
He returns Monday from a trip to the former Soviet republic of Georgia , made at the request of the country 's president .
Watch more on Biden 's chances in the VP race »
Biden , a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , brings to the table top - notch experience that would help counter GOP arguments that Obama is inexperienced on foreign policy .
But Biden 's state has just three electoral votes , which are safely in the Democrats ' column .
See the pros and cons of VP contenders
Biden , Richardson and Indiana Sen .
Evan Bayh are scheduled to speak at the Democratic convention next Wednesday -- the same night that the vice presidential candidate is slated to speak .
Watch more on Obama 's process for making his decision »
A former governor , Bayh is a Midwest moderate and a popular figure in Indiana , a Republican stronghold .
His service on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees could help shore up Obama 's weak spots .
Some liberals , however , could have a tough time with Bayh because of his support for a ban on " partial - birth " abortions , a term that some abortion rights opponents use to refer to a type of late - term abortion .
Another contender , Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia , has yet to receive a speaking slot at the convention .
Obama also has events scheduled in Virginia on Wednesday and Thursday .
Kaine could help Virginia fall in the Democrats ' column for the first time in 44 years , but the Virginia governor would not bring much foreign policy experience to the table .
Plus , another Virginian -- former governor and Senate candidate Mark Warner -- is the keynote speaker Tuesday night .
Virginia will be a major battleground come November , but would the Democrats pick Virginians to headline back - to - back nights at the convention ?
The VP buzz has dwindled for some others who were once considered top contenders .
iReport.com : Who would you pick as VP ?
Hillary Clinton is likely to place her name in nomination , and she 's set to give a speech on the second night of the convention .
While the schedule could always change , it 's not likely that she 'll be Obama 's pick .
Kansas Gov. Kathleen
Sebelius has been rumored to be a potential pick , but if Obama chooses a woman , and it's not Clinton , he could burn bridges with his former rival 's supporters .
She 's also on the schedule for a Tuesday night speech .
Obama could always throw out a surprise -- retired Gen. Wesley Clark , Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd , Texas Rep. Chet Edwards , Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel , former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn , Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed and Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell all stand a chance to be a dark horse pick .
Meanwhile , on the Republican side , Sen . John McCain still has some time before he needs to announce his pick .
The Republican convention is the week following the Democratic convention .
Likely contenders for McCain's No. 2 spot include Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
Democrats meet August 25 - 28 in Denver , Colorado , and the Republicans convene September 1 - 4 in Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minnesota .

No , this is n't an alternate Waterworld costume for Dennis Hopper - it 's Miroslav
Tichy , posing with one of his amazing trash cams , which he fabricated from paper towel tubes , thread spools , rubber bands and other bits of detritus and has used since the 1950s .
Now in his 80s , Tichy and his works have only recently ( as far as the art world goes ) been discovered .
And like all good photographers , he trained his intentionally imperfect camera rigs on the considerably more refined female form .

A little more analog than the amazing HD trash projectors we 've seen , but that 's exactly the point ;
Tichy described his trash cams as being the only way to add enough poetic imperfections to photography , describing his philosophy with the fantastic maxim : " If you want to be famous , you have to do whatever you 're doing worse than anyone else in the whole world . "

His subject matter was mostly regular folks in his small Czech town doing what they do , and naturally he gravitated toward the ladies , who look great in Tichy 's proto -Lomography style .

Sunlight comes only rarely , with a sliver slicing down between the ramshackle towers .
The light here is fluorescent and the people packed sardine tight amongst twisting corridors .
Some of the lower levels are widely considered uninhabitable due to trash .
Up the street ( if it can be called that ) there ’s a drug parlor with an unlicensed “ doctor ” open for business upstairs .
They exist openly : there are no police because there is no law .
The above is not a description of a dystopian ( or utopian ) fantasia , but of the Kowloon Walled City which was very real .
From 1945 - 1993 , a political loophole created a zone of Hong Kong where there was no law .
The resulting anarchic , hodge - podge monolith was the descendant of the pirate utopias of old : a testament to humanity ’s ingenuity , greed , violence and tenacity .
Here is a glimpse within the walls of one of the strangest human settlements ever .
The story goes like this : it ’s 1898 and , at the height of their imperial power , the British have just forced the Chinese to sign away the Kowloon Peninsula for the next 99 years .
There is one exception , however , as the British agree to let a small magistrate ’s fort remain until they set up their colonial administration .
The Chinese leave , but when the British attack the fort , they find it abandoned .
So , like any good colonial bureaucrat , they scratch their heads before promptly turning it into a tourist attraction and ignore its murky legal status .
Along comes World War II , and the Japanese , after taking Hong Kong , tear down the walls to build an airport .
After the war , squatters flock to the area and begin to build .
Attempts to evict them end , twice , end in riots that threaten to cause a diplomatic incident .
The British go back to ignoring the place .
The population grows exponentially , and by 1971 there are 10,000 people living on seven acres .
It attracts the usual types drawn to undiscovered countries : criminals , dreamers , dissidents , refugees and the plain desperate .
But even as the buildings practically merge into one monolithic labyrinth , people manage to build a life in the Walled City .
The communities work out basic rules to prevent fires , sink over 70 wells or tap into city supplies to get water ( Hong Kong ends up providing it ) , set height limits on the buildings to prevent trouble with the nearby airport and establish volunteer groups to keep some basic order .
But this is still a lawless place .
Driven from mainland China , the Triads set up shop and start living like kings , while Hong Kong ’s upper crust comes in for the sex , drugs and gambling .
The gangsters end up lording it over the inhabitants until 3,000 raids by the Hong Kong police in the 1970s clear most of them out ( though it leaves the city ungoverned as ever ) .
After the Triad recedes , the city thrives , the population multiplies to 35,000 ( making it one of the most densely populated places on the planet ) , and by most accounts , the violent crime rate is lower than similar neighborhoods in the rest of the city .
Doctors and entrepreneurs who ca n’t afford the licenses in Hong Kong set up shop and make a fortune .
But , thing change as the handover to China approaches .
Neither country ’s government particularly likes the filthy uncontrolled pocket that their nearly century long dispute has created .
An agreement is made , the residents are moved out and , in 1993 the whole staggering structure is demolished .
Today , it ’s a park .
Before and After
But the Walled City left its mark , vexing the Muscles from Brussels in Bloodsport , inspiring Christopher Nolan ’s depiction of Gotham ’s slums and is rebuilt in cyberspace in William Gibson ’s Bridge Trilogy .
Every observer seems to have taken a different lesson .
Some extolled it as the “ rarest of things , a working model of an anarchist society , ” while U.S. News and World Report ( never big on the whole nonconformity thing in the first place ) , sputtering in its disgust , dubbed it “ a fetid conglomeration ” of tenements , piling on words like “ festering ” for good measure .
I think any lessons the place offers defy easy categories .
But because it ’s closer in history , it should be a reminder , whenever any of us looks back on the aforementioned pirate utopias , or the romanticized depictions of Tortuga or the Wild West , that those no-rules fantasy lands were real places with all the attendant blood and stink .
Yes , the anarchistic types out there are correct when they say that the Walled City is evidence that humans can co-exist , and even thrive , without laws constantly piled on them .
But it ’s not that simple .
After all , without massive police raids ( government incarnate ) , the place would have probably become a mob-run tyranny .
Its residents had a degree of freedom that anyone who comes home to piles of bills or endless forms can’t help but envy .
They also had darkness , a lower life expectancy , filthy living conditions and huge numbers of drug addicts .
But if the Walled City is a reminder that lawlessness is n’t quite as cleanly romantic as some might think , it also reminds us that a staggering number of societies are possible — and that every one of them has a price .

More than 20 million travellers pass through Palma de Mallorca 's airport each year and at first glance Bettina could be just another tourist waiting for a flight home .
But she never checks in .
The 48 - year - old German has been living at the airport - known as Son Sant Joan - for 10 years , pushing her three suitcases , a blanket , a pile of books and her white cat , Mumu , around with her .
Referred to in the airport simply as " the woman with the cat " , Bettina has become as much a part of the airport as the planes and runways .
Her story recalls the Tom Hanks film The Terminal , which was reportedly inspired by the story of man who lived at Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris for 18 years after his documents were stolen .
Bettina , who refuses to disclose her full name , is from a small town in southern Germany .
She arrived in Mallorca more than 10 years ago for a new start after a relationship ended and she lost her office job .
She landed odd jobs working as a waitress then helping in a kitchen , but the dream of living in the sun turned sour .
" Suddenly there was no work because they only give jobs to Spaniards , " she told the local Diario de Mallorca newspaper .
" I wanted to work in Mallorca but I got stranded here . "
With no job , home or money , she began living in the airport , where she gets by on the kindness of friends or strangers .
" One friend brings me something to eat twice a week .
Sometimes people give me a bit of money as well , but I do n't ask anyone for anything . "
Amid the bustle of the airport , Bettina is often seen quietly reading , dressed smartly in jeans and a sweatshirt .
She cleans herself and her clothes in the toilets , while departure lounge seats serve as beds .
But she has no desire to return to Germany .
" No way .
Life is better for me here . "
She is popular among airport staff .
" She is intelligent , discreet and does not bother anyone .
She says she has made this her home because she has everything she needs here , " said cleaner María Jesús Rueda García , 54 .
" Things did n't work out so she has come to live here .
She can get by and is not a beggar because she has income - I have seen her take money out of the cashpoint .
This could happen to us all . "
Marie - Carmen Gallárdo , 40 , a cafe worker , said : " She has been here 10 years - the same as me .
Perhaps at Christmas she goes home to see her family . "
The airport authorities turn a blind eye to Bettina .
" She has never bothered anyone and as this is a public building she can use the facilities - washing in the toilets or cleaning her clothes , " said Marta Fernández , spokeswoman for Aena , the state company that manages Spain 's airports .
Bettina is not the only one to live in a Spanish airport .
Generally , such residents are tolerated so long as they do not bother passengers .
In Britain , four people were given asbos for living at Gatwick .
After weeks of collecting signatures from constituents in San Francisco 's 8th Congressional District , Independent candidate Cindy Sheehan has made it onto the November ballot to oppose Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , for Pelosi 's heretofore secure Congressional seat .
As Sheehan told me exclusively this afternoon : " I think this is the happiest that I have been since before Casey was killed ( except when my grandson was born ) .
Getting on the ballot as an independent in California is so difficult , but with the help of many of our friends who are committed to peace , accountability , economic equality and environmental sustainability , we have done it !
The voice of the people will be on the ballot in San Francisco in November . "
Sheehan , the s/heroic " Peace Mom , " whose 24 year old soldier son , Casey , was killed in Iraq on April 4 , 2004 , inspired the creation of an entire peace community outside George W. Bush 's Crawford Texas ranch in August of 2005 , when she followed Bush to Crawford to ask him , " for what noble cause did my son die ? "
George W. Bush 's refusal to answer Sheehan spurred Sheehan on to become an outspoken and pivotal member of the anti-war movement .
She gained national and international fame as a leader in the effort to end the Iraq War and to impeach those who illegally began it - as is mandated by the Constitution .
For the past few years , and more so since the 2006 election , Sheehan has been an integral part of the growing number of Americans frustrated by Congress ' failure to hold the Bush administration accountable for its crimes .
After the 2006 election , in which Democrats won majorities in both the Senate and the House , Americans ' disgust for Congress reached a fever pitch when the new Democratic Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , instantly took impeachment off the table - thereby ensuring George W. Bush and Dick Cheney the job security to complete their second term and commit further offenses with impunity .
Sheehan 's anger toward Pelosi was palpable .
While other valiant patriots expressed their ire for Pelosi in emails , faxes , opeds , and camp - outs at her San Francisco home and Congressional office , Sheehan took it a step further and decided to challenge the wealthy Pelosi for her powerful seat in Congress - clearly no easy task .
After an uphill battle against institutional rules and regulations designed to quash third party candidates , Sheehan showed her mettle and prevailed .
As of today , after a s/heroic effort to gather the thousands of signatures needed to qualify for the November election , Cindy Sheehan became just the sixth person in the history of California to get on the ballot as a " Decline To State " candidate .
According to Sheehan : " I am even more convinced now than I was a year ago that the people of San Francisco are ready to lead the way to step outside of the dated two - party system and elect someone who truly represents San Francisco values , not party loyalties and criminal activities . "
Now comes the true test for the progressive movement .
Will progressives who vehemently oppose Nancy Pelosi 's failed Congressional leadership come forward to help Cindy Sheehan challenge Pelosi for her seat in San Francisco 's 8th Congressional District ?
I know I will .
Nancy Pelosi represents all that is wrong with American government .
As long as we have s/heroes like Sheehan who are willing to reclaim our democracy , I 'll do my part to help .

Editors ' Note
A front - page picture caption on June 26 describing an 11 - month - old boy whose legs were in casts stated that his legs were broken and that his mother said the injuries were caused by an episode of state - sponsored violence in Zimbabwe .
After the picture and an accompanying article that also described the injuries were published , The New York Times took the boy to a medical clinic in Harare for help .
When the casts were removed , medical workers there discovered the boy had club feet .
Doctors said on Monday that X - rays of the baby ’s legs showed no evidence of bone fractures .
The mother subsequently admitted that she had exaggerated injuries she said had been sustained by the boy during an attack by governing party militia .
In multiple interviews , she said that youths backing President Robert Mugabe had thrown her son to the concrete floor  and she still says that event did occur .
The owner of the house where she and the baby were staying confirmed that marauding youths from the governing party had attacked the house .
He said he believed the baby had been thrown to the floor during the attack , but the owner was in a different room and did not witness it firsthand .
The landlord , other lodgers , neighbors and opposition supporters also confirmed that the mother had been singled out because her husband was an opposition member .
The mother , however , later told The Times that the boy had been wearing casts even at the time of the attack , as part of a treatment he had received for his club feet at a different medical facility .
She said she misrepresented the boy ’s injuries to generate help because she could not afford corrective surgery for the boy .

However , on more than one occasion I ’ve found that after creating a sliding effect , the animation jumps on completion .
Having found the cause , I thought it only fair to share and explain why it ’s happening and how to avoid it .
Watch the animation jump fix screencast ( alternative flash version )
QuickTime version is approximately 7 Mb , flash version is streaming .
View the demo and source code used in the screencast
Understanding the Problem
The way the slide animation works is it animates the height CSS property of the element .
The problem occurs if the element being animated has a margin or padding .
This is because when the element shifts from display : none to a tiny height ( or width ) and visa versa , the padding ( or margin ) jumps in to view , causing the real height to be height + padding + margin .
If you look at the screenshot below , you can see the padding is still visible but the height of the element is 1 px , the next step is the to display : none , which in this case , the blocks below will jump up 32px ( padding - top + padding - bottom ) .
Fixing the Problem
The solution is very simple to fix once you ’ve understood the problem .
The problematic code would have the following style :
#expand { padding : 16 px ; display : none ; }
The code required to create the smooth animation is :
#expand { display : none ; } #expand div { padding : 16 px ; }
We ’ve moved the padding away from the animating element and so only the height affects the height of the sliding block .

Many technology pundits say that Web and mobile applications that are tailored to where you are — often called “ location - based services ” — will be the next big thing .
Or at least , one of the next big things .
Before those applications take off , however , some problems must be solved .
For example , there are already several services that track a user ’s location , but many applications that want to access that information have no easy way to get it .
For their part , users want to decide which applications can have access to their location information and which cannot — and they want to do it once , if possible .
On Tuesday , Yahoo introduced a new service called Fire Eagle that simplifies all that .
It is free and available to any application and any user who wants to try it .
“ We really wanted this functionality for Yahoo ’s services , ” David Filo , a Yahoo co-founder , said to reporters in San Francisco .
By opening it up to everyone , the service will probably gain much wider adoption , Mr. Filo said .
At this point , more than 50 third - party applications from partners like SixApart , which offers a blogging platform , and Pownce , a micro- blogging service , are using Fire Eagle .
“ We can bring the same functionality to Yahoo properties , ” said Tom Coates , head of product at Yahoo Brickhouse , a home for start - up - like projects within Yahoo .
The service appears to give users complete control over which applications have access to their location .
Users can also control whether an application can track their exact location , their ZIP code or merely the city they are in , for example .
And they can purge any personal information from the system when they want to .
Yahoo will not make any money from Fire Eagle , at least for now .
Mr. Coates raised the possibility that the service would be linked to advertising applications that want to know a user ’s location in the future .

A federal judge has awarded a whistleblower $ 1.6 million for tipping off federal prosecutors to a scheme by pharmaceutical company Cell Therapeutics to illegally promote unapproved uses of the cancer drug Trisenox .
Prosecutors argued against granting whistleblower James Marchese any portion of the $ 10.5 million settlement that Cell Therapeutics agreed to pay .
Typically , whistleblowers are entitled to between 15 and 25 percent of any funds received by the government , unless they were the initiator or planner of the offense .
The offense in question involved defrauding Medicare by promoting unauthorized uses of Trisenox .
Among Marchese 's actions in furtherance of the fraud was getting unapproved uses of the drug listed in cancer journals , then writing letters to Medicare directors citing those listings as proof that such uses of Trisenox should be reimbursable .
But Marchese said that he was only a low - level employee acting on the orders of his supervisors , and that he risked his job by going to the government .
Marchese and his lawyers asked for the full 25 percent , or $ 2.6 million , saying that without him the government would have had no case .
Instead , Judge Marsha J. Pechman instead awarded him the minimum , 15 percent .
She ruled that he was not an initiator of the scheme , and that in its early phases he believed his actions to be legal .
But she scolded him for waiting so long to come forward after realizing that the company was committing fraud , even as patients continued to be placed at risk by the company 's actions .
According to the court , Marchese became angry after being passed over for a promotion , at which point he wrote a letter to his superiors taking credit for the Medicare scam .
Only after another confrontation with his superiors did Marchese eventually go to the authorities , in October 2002 .
By settling the case , Cell Therapeutics avoided admitting to or being convicted of any crime .
EXCLUSIVE :
The United States has a standing agreement with Pakistan that CIA - operated Predator drones may strike Osama bin Laden ’s hide - out without prior permission from Islamabad , according to people familiar with the arrangement .
One source said the free hand - an exception in a country politically sensitive to U.S. counterterrorism operations - was granted by President Pervez Musharraf early in the war if the U.S. locates bin Laden in Pakistan ’s rugged tribal areas , where he is thought to be hiding .
A knowledgeable official disclosed the arrangement to The Washington Times at a time of growing frustration in the Pentagon and in the CIA that bin Laden remains at large seven years into the war and as President Bush ’s term approaches an end .
That fact has put renewed focus on the Pakistani government ’s restraints on the U.S. effort to find bin Laden .
Pakistan prohibits American military ground forces on its soil , limiting the U.S. presence to scores of CIA officers and paramilitary operators .
Nadeem Kiani , spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington , declined to comment on the purported bin Laden deal but said Pakistan stands ready to move against bin Laden if he is inside the country .
Pakistan allowed the CIA to secretly launch missile - equipped Predators from its soil into Afghanistan during the war to oust the Taliban .
It has continued to let the agency fly the unmanned surveillance planes over Pakistan .
But earlier this year , Mr. Musharraf rejected a Bush administration request to allow more CIA personnel into his country .
Washington must coordinate planned strikes on militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) where bin Laden is thought to be hiding .
Bin Laden as a target is an exception to that rule .
“ What I can tell you is that the president has a strong , overarching commitment to make sure that we track down and bring to justice Osama bin Laden and other top members of al Qaeda , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters Monday .
The arrangement with Pakistan was confirmed by a second source - a former U.S. intelligence officer who spent time in Afghanistan .
A CIA spokesman declined to comment .
Pakistan ’s sovereignty has been an issue in the presidential campaign .
Sen. Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee , said at one point that he would unleash strikes into Pakistan without Islamabad ’s approval to hit bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders .
The U.S. has options for sending special operations teams into Pakistan if bin Laden ’s exact location is determined , but military officials said it would be the Predator , not boots on the ground , that would be dispatched to kill the al Qaeda leader .
This is because a Predator could be airborne - or redirected in flight - in a matter of minutes .
In contrast , special operations forces in Afghanistan would have to be assembled , briefed on the mission and then dispatched by helicopter - a time - consuming and risky process .
By not requesting Pakistan ’s approval first , the U.S. would avoid the risk of breaching operational security .
Washington still harbors suspicions about Pakistan ’s Inter - Service Intelligence agency ( ISI ) , which helped establish pro-al Qaeda Taliban rule in Afghanistan .
It is one thing to have Pakistan ’s permission to shoot bin Laden on sight .
It is another to find him .
“ It ’s a needle in a haystack , ” said one intelligence official .
For nearly seven years , since his escape from Afghanistan ’s Tora Bora mountain region , bin Laden has evaded capture .
The reasons given by intelligence officials :
He stopped communicating on radios and telephones to avoid being intercepted by the National Security Agency ; he is protected by militant leaders whose tribes have been infiltrated by al Qaeda operatives who impose a no - talk discipline ; the CIA has been unable to penetrate this tribal ring of security to find a spy who might disclose his location ; and bin Laden moves frequently amid the FATA ’s vast , rugged terrain .
“ I would say to you in the last seven years there has been a lot of success in terms of finding that second - and third - level al Qaeda guy , ” Mrs. Perino said .
“ And we have been able to prevent attacks so far .
But one of the things that we ’re up against is that we have a very determined enemy .
They hide in caves , they respect no uniform , they are in a very treacherous geographic area that ’s very hard to get into . ”
The NSA installed a network of electronic boxes in the Afghan mountains to absorb communications from the FATA .
The chatter has helped the CIA identify militant hide - outs and training bases , but the network has not picked up bin Laden ’s voice .
The military ’s chief terrorist hunting unit is Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , a mix of Army Delta Force , Navy SEALs and a special intelligence unit known as Task Force Orange .
An intelligence source said most JSOC assets are committed to Iraq to hunt a list of high - value targets within the al Qaeda in Iraq organization .
At one point last year , the JSOC contingent in Afghanistan was down to just 30 SEALs .
The U.S. Special Operations Command , which oversees the JSOC , does not discuss the unit´s numbers .

France said the kidnap of humanitarian personnel was ' totally unacceptable '
Two French aid workers have been abducted in central Afghanistan , the French aid organisation Action Against Hunger has announced .
The pair , who have not been named , were seized at gunpoint in the early hours of Friday from their house in Daykundi province , the Paris - based group said .
It said the kidnappers tied up guards before breaking in and escaping with the aid workers in waiting vehicles .
Action Against Hunger said it had halted relief work in Afghanistan .
' Totally unacceptable '
Action Against Hunger said a crisis group had been set up in Paris and the Afghan capital , Kabul , in an effort to secure the hostages ' release .
It said the information it had indicated the two workers were still alive .
The French foreign ministry has confirmed the kidnappings .
In a statement it said : " Making humanitarian personnel a target is totally unacceptable . "
The governor of Daykundi , which is about 300 km ( 190 miles ) west of Kabul , told the AFP news agency that the pair were kidnapped by " enemies of the Afghan government " .
No group has said it carried out the abductions .
Two French relief workers from another humanitarian group , Terre d'Enfance , were abducted last year and held for weeks before being set free .
As war clouds gather : Democrats back covert US attacks on Iran
By Patrick Martin
30 June 2008
Leading congressional Democrats have given their approval to a vastly expanded program of US covert warfare against Iran , according to an article by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh , published in the New Yorker , and made available on the magazine ’s web site Sunday .
( See “ Preparing the Battlefield — The Bush Administration steps up its secret moves against Iran ” )
President Bush issued a Presidential Finding , a classified notification to top congressional leaders about the covert program against Iran , last year , after the Democrats took control of the Senate and House of Representatives in the November 2006 elections .
The Finding called for a series of operations , including funding of separatist groups working among Iran ’s Arab and Baluchi minorities , as well as the kidnapping of members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard for interrogation across the border in Iraq and targeting individuals within Iran for assassination .
Hersh reports that Bush carried out the legal requirement that he notify the Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate , as well as the chairman and ranking members of the intelligence committees .
The four Democrats are House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Jay Rockefeller , and House Intelligence Committee chairman Silvestre Reyes .
Hersh writes , “ Congress does have the means to challenge the White House once it has been sent a Finding .
It has the power to withhold funding for any government operation .
The members of the House and Senate Democratic leadership who have access to the Finding can also , if they choose to do so , and if they have shared concerns , come up with ways to exert their influence on Administration policy . ”
Nothing of the kind took place .
None of the four congressional Democrats took any steps to forestall the covert action campaign against Iran , and the $ 400 million was quietly approved without public notice .
Nor would any of the four comment to Hersh for his June 29 article in the New Yorker .
The Democrats prefer to keep secret their collaboration with the Bush administration ’s violations of international law .
This revelation demonstrates the complete insincerity of the “ antiwar ” posture adopted by the Democrats in the 2006 election and in the current 2008 presidential campaign .
While appealing for the votes of the vast majority of Americans who oppose both the ongoing war in Iraq and a new war against Iran , the Democrats are quietly preparing to continue the same policy if , as now seems likely , they regain the White House in the November election .
Hersh seems to suggest a conflict between the congressional Democrats and the party ’s presidential nominee , Senator Barack Obama .
He writes : “ the funding for the escalation was approved .
In other words , some members of the Democratic leadership ... were willing , in secret , to go along with the Administration in expanding covert activities directed at Iran , while the Party ’s presumptive candidate for President , Barack Obama , has said that he favors direct talks and diplomacy . ”
There is no reason to believe that there is an actual conflict between Obama and the congressional Democrats over the campaign of covert action against Iran .
It is more a matter of a division of labor .
Obama emphasizes diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of differences , as part of an electoral campaign aimed at deceiving the American people .
The congressional Democrats , who now share responsibility with the Bush White House for US government policy , must do what is required to defend the interests of American imperialism in the region .
Obama is already on record as proposing a more aggressive American military posture in Afghanistan and on the Afghan - Pakistan border , declaring that he will move troops from Iraq to Afghanistan and authorize cross - border strikes against purported Al Qaeda sites in Pakistan , with or without the permission of the Pakistani government .
He is also reportedly considering keeping Defense Secretary Robert Gates at his post in a new Obama administration .
The Times of London wrote Sunday , “ Obama ’s top foreign policy and national security advisers are pressing the case for keeping Robert Gates at the Pentagon after he won widespread praise for his performance .
The move would be in keeping with Obama ’s desire to appoint a cabinet of all the talents . ”
Richard Danzig , a former navy secretary and Obama ’s top military adviser , told the newspaper , “ My personal position is Gates is a very good secretary of defense and would be an even better one in an Obama administration . ”
The newspaper commented that “ retaining Gates would give Obama ‘ cover ’ for adjusting his policy ” in relation to the war in Iraq — i.e. , to renege on his pledges to end the war and instead continue the US occupation indefinitely .
Gates has extended his own olive branches to the Democrats , appointing two former Clinton administration officials to the Defense Policy Board last year : John Hamre , who was named chairman , and Clinton ’s former defense secretary William Perry , who is now among Obama ’s top national security advisers .
The result is a direct line of communication between the Pentagon and the Obama campaign .
The Hersh article comes amid mounting tensions in the Middle East , with repeated public threats of military action against Iran by either Israel or the United States or both , and warnings from Iranian officials that they will retaliate forcefully against such an assault .
Earlier this month the Israeli air force conducted a full - scale dress rehearsal for air strikes against Tehran , sending warplanes on a 1,500 - kilometer flight against mock targets in the Mediterranean Sea .
Bush administration officials leaked reports on the military exercise to the media , in a clear attempt to intimidate the Iranian regime , as well as prepare US and world public opinion for such a strike .
Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari , commander of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard Corps , the country ’s strongest military force , warned Saturday that in the event of US or Israeli attack , Iran would consider closing off the sea lanes through the Strait of Hormuz used by tankers supplying the world with Persian Gulf oil .
“ Naturally every country under attack by an enemy uses all its capacity and opportunities to confront the enemy , ” he told the Iranian newspaper Jaam-e Jam , according to the official Fars News Agency .
“ Iran will definitely act to impose control on the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz , ” he said .
“ After this action , the oil price will rise very considerably and this is among the factors deterring the enemies . ”
Three British newspapers carried reports Sunday of a further intensification of the war atmosphere :
* The Sunday Telegraph interviewed Shabtai Shavit , a former head of the Israeli secret service Mossad , who suggested that Israel might strike unilaterally against Iran after the US presidential election , especially if Senator Barack Obama wins .
He suggested that Iran was a year or less from building its first nuclear weapon , and that Israeli military action would be driven by that timetable .
“ The time that is left ... is getting shorter , ” he said .
* The Guardian reported that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert held a meeting at his official residence with Aviam Sela , the organizer of the 1981 Israel airstrike that destroyed the Iraqi nuclear facility at Osirak , to discuss the practical aspects of a similar assault on Iran .
* The Times of London reported that in response to these threats , Iran has targeted its most powerful long - range ballistic missiles , the Shahab - 3B , with a range of up to 2,000 kilometers , against locations in Israel , including the principal Israeli nuclear research facility at Dimona in the Negev desert .
The US covert action campaign inside Iran involves both the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon ’s Joint Special Operations Command , Hersh writes .
As in previous exposés by the veteran journalist — the first to report US war crimes ranging from the My Lai massacre nearly 40 years ago to torture at Abu Ghraib in 2004 — his sources are disaffected sections of the military - intelligence apparatus , particularly in the CIA .
Hersh reports a conflict between the CIA and the White House over the language in the Presidential Finding , with the CIA demanding explicit authorization for the use of deadly force by US operatives engaged in covert action inside Iran , while the White House claimed that Bush ’s authority as commander - in - chief was sufficient .
One of those interviewed is the former head of the US Central Command , now - retired Admiral William Fallon , fired by Defense Secretary Robert Gates earlier this year after a profile in Vanity Fair magazine depicted Fallon as an in - house opponent of a US war against Iran .
Citing comments from several former intelligence and military officials , Hersh describes an increasingly bitter struggle within the US government , with the office of Vice President Richard Cheney playing the lead role in demanding a more aggressive campaign of provocations and a broader list of targets .
One former official told Hersh of a meeting in the Vice President ’s office : “ The subject was how to create a casus belli between Tehran and Washington . ”

The Life of a Photon
By John W. Reed
Picture a distant star in the Andromeda Galaxy two million lightyears away .
This star shines brightly , as do countless others in this stellar pin-wheel .
The star is pouring out tremendous energy in the form of visible light , infrared radiation , ultraviolet and many other flavors of the electromagnetic spectrum .
It is also emitting material in the form of various particles , including the mysterious neutrino .
A typical star .
And yet one photon of this star 's light is about to have a very non-typical journey .
The story really begins at the center of the star where its nuclear engine is burning hydrogen , creating helium .
One of the products of this process is visible light .
Our photon is created here in this infernal region and begins its arduous journey toward the star 's photosphere .
The particle of light constantly bounces from one atom to the next , being absorbed and re-emitted uncounted times .
Its path is serpentine in the extreme as it worms its way to the surface of the star .
The temperature here is in the millions of degrees .
Finally after what some astronomers believe are many years of this perpetual serpentine flight , a point is reached where the star - stuff or plasma becomes transparent and the photon flies away , along with trillions of others , leaving the relatively cool photosphere ( only thousands of degrees now ) far behind .
Our intrepid traveler scuttles through Andromedan interstellar space in a mere few hundred years .
During this time it makes few close calls to neighboring stars ( and planets ? ) .
Some of its traveling companions are , however absorbed by nebular gas residing here .
The only sign of these expiring quanta of light are a slight heating of this gas .
As if passing a last signpost saying " No Gas for 100 Miles " it passes a lone globular cluster .
This cluster 's mass bends the path of the photon slightly as even light is affected this way .
It passes this solitary globe of stars and proceeds into the emptiness of intergalactic space .
While the particle speeds through this void , it travels in a straight line  almost .
Even here it is affected by gravity .
The Andromeda Galaxy is still exerting its influence , trying to pull our dab of light back toward its center .
However , light never varies from its ever constant speed , at least in the vacuum of space .
Even so , the conservation of energy must be maintained .
So instead of losing velocity , the photon shifts color slightly toward red .
You see , our particle is also a wave .
This is a confusing idea .
Its like water that is sometimes solid , sometimes liquid , a photon exhibits both the properties of a particle and a wave .
According to general relativity its wavelength becomes longer as it climbs a gravity hill , while the path it takes is affected by the pull of gravity as it would if it were a particle .
Another strange thing happens to our mote of light .
As noted earlier it tries to travel in a straight line , but can't quite succeed .
Stars affect its path , clusters and even galaxies pull it off its course .
Stranger still is that even after these affects are taken into account , it still curves slightly !
The mass of the entire universe affects its trajectory .
Space itself is curved and our particle follows this curve .
In the two million lightyears it travels in its life this curve is a subtle influence , but is real !
Astronomers would very much like to know the exact shape of this curve : positive as on a sphere or negative as on a saddle - shaped surface .
The photon knows , but is n't telling .
During the time of this passing through the intergalactic deep , many things happen on our own small world .
Several ice ages come and go .
The rocky mountains grow taller .
Strange animals flourish and become extinct .
Yet after all this , our particle has still not reached its destination .
Finally , man 's civilization begins to reshape the planet .
This time period  our time period  is the last one half of one percent of the entire journey .
Our history is like a flash of fat in afire that has been burning for hours .
Finally the photon enters the reaches of our milky - way galaxy .
The gravity of our galactic home shifts the photon 's color toward blue a small amount .
Its path veers yet again toward the galactic center , but it does n't make it that far  not even close .
It enters an obscure arm of the starry spiral , falls in and is once again surrounded by stars .
Fiery points pass by , but none are close enough to greatly affect it .
It almost makes an uneventful trip right back out the other side of the galaxy .
Instead , though , it encoun - ters a small , relativity dark body .
In the last five seconds , if it could see , it would glimpse a small blue dot exploding into a sky - filling globe .
The photon enters the Earth 's atmosphere and it's path is bent alarmingly .
This is not due to gravity , but refraction as the lens of our air slants its path before its final plummet to the nighttime country - side below .
It penetrates the earth 's envelope of gas in one one - thousandth of a second .
Many of its co-travelers which have so far survived the journey end their existence hitting the ground , tree branches , and even the jacket of a lone telescopic observer .
However our photon along with a handful of others falls right down the barrel of a waiting telescope .
As it strikes the metal coating covering the glass parabolid that is the primary mirror , it is absorbed by an atom of aluminum .
This atom on the surface of that very thin metal layer then ejects the particle and sends it back up the tube .
It bounces off the secondary mirror and enters the eyepiece .
Refraction once again takes hold and bends its path yet again as it passes through the first lens element .
It flies through several such elements and crosses a small gap of air , finally entering the living lens of the observer 's eye .
In a time too small to measure it penetrates the cornea and lens of the eye .
This lens is being very carefully shaped by a small muscle so that the photon along with its traveling companions are aimed by refraction to a common point on the waiting retina .
Here our photon ends it existence .
It impacts on a light sensor called a " rod " .
The photon expends its energy and causes a complex photochemical reaction .
Signals are sent via nerves behind the retina to the brain .
Even as this visual information is being sent to the observer 's brain it is being processed .
What is finally received by the visual cortex is not a signal that says " light " but one that roughly says " dim pin-point " .
This incredible chain of events is rather amazing as the signal has not yet even reached the brain itself .
What happens there is even more amazing .
All the pin-points are put together in the visual cortex and an image is formed of a distant softly - glowing pin-wheel .
The Andromeda Galaxy is reconstructed in the observer 's mind from bits of light that were borne in the belly of stars two million years ago !
While it 's better known for dead parrots and crossdressing lumberjacks , Monty Python has a surprisingly academic background .
Five of the six members of the group ( Graham Chapman , Michael Palin , Terry Jones , John Cleese , and Eric Idle ) attended either Oxford or Cambridge .
Cutting their teeth writing for other BBC series , the five eventually joined up , along with American Terry Gilliam , to create Monty Python 's Flying Circus .
While experimenting with the bounds of sketch comedy , the group also flexed their academic muscle throughout the course of the show , making reference to many works of classic literature in the process .
Here 's a compendium of many of these references , excluding the ones I could n't find on YouTube .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
What 's in a name ?
Westerners are more accustomed to names that describe the ingredients and how they are cooked .
Local dishes like " Husband and wife 's lung slice " or " Chicken without sexual life " conjure lots of furrowed eyebrows on famished foreigners .
So , with the Olympics a few short weeks away , China is giving its cuisine a linguistic makeover .
It is proposing that restaurants change the names of exotic , but bizarrely named , delicacies to make them more delectable for the estimated 50,000 visitors arriving in August for the Summer Games .
The appetizer " Husband and wife 's lung slice " is taking on the more appetizing " Beef and ox tripe in chili sauce . "
" Chicken without sexual life " has been transformed into " Steamed pullet . "
The government has put down more than 2,000 proposed names in a 170 - page book that it has offered to Beijing hotels , according to state media .
" Thanks to the pamphlet , we do not have to struggle to come up with the English translations of dishes any more , which is usually time consuming , " a senior manager at the four - star Guangzhou Hotel in downtown Beijing told the Xinhua news agency .
The Chinese say the names of their dishes focus more on appearance than taste or smell .
But Westerners are more accustomed to names that describe the ingredients and how they are cooked -- such as pot roast .
The government realizes local names are a matter of taste , but do n't want them to get lost in translation .
Hence , the spicy Sichuanese dish " Bean curd made by a pock - marked woman " has been bestowed the more palatable " Mapo tofu . "
Not everyone is pleased .
" The process of standardizing a menu translation is a double - edged sword , " wrote columnist Raymond Zhou in the China Daily newspaper .
It " removes the ambiguity and unintended humor " and " takes away the fun and the rich connotation .
" It turns a menu into the equivalent of plain rice , which has the necessary nutrients but is devoid of flavor . "

After crude oil 's biggest one - day drop in 18 years , there 's been no bounce �not even a dead - cat bounce .
Crude kept falling in early Wednesday trading , even as the dollar rattled around at record lows against the euro .
Preparing another charge ?
( AP )
What 's behind oil 's fall ?
There are suspects for all tastes �demand , supply , and the market itself .
Let 's see .
Demand - side theorists point to bearish remarks Tuesday by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , who painted a gloomy picture for the U.S. economy .
High energy prices and economic pain should mean less demand �and it is certainly holding true for gasoline , as demand fell last week by 5 % .
OPEC itself revised downward its own demand growth forecasts Tuesday .
Many analysts figure " demand destruction " has finally arrived to kneecap runaway oil prices .
But the problem with that is that demand outside the U.S. and other rich countries continues to grow .
While the U.S. is the single - biggest oil consumer , developing countries in tandem have a bigger �and growing �appetite .
Even OPEC 's revision was only a 100,000 barrel - per - day downtick , or about 0.1 % of global oil consumption .
And domestic demand growth shows no signs of slowing in oil - producing countries , either , which leaves even less oil for export .
After the run-up in crude prices was largely blamed on ravenous demand in the developing world , is it plausible that the prospect of weaker demand in the U.S. would be enough to reverse the tide ?
Censoring My Software
by Richard Stallman
[ From Datamation , March 1 1996 ]
Last summer , a few clever legislators proposed a bill to “ prohibit pornography ” on the Internet .
Last fall , the right - wing Christians made this cause their own .
Last week , President Clinton signed the bill .
This week , I 'm censoring GNU Emacs .
No , GNU Emacs does not contain pornography .
It 's a software package , an award - winning extensible and programmable text editor .
But the law that was passed applies to far more than pornography .
It prohibits “ indecent ” speech , which can include anything from famous poems , to masterpieces hanging in the Louvre , to advice about safe sex … to software .
Naturally , there was a lot of opposition to this bill .
Not only from people who use the Internet and people who appreciate erotica , but from everyone who cares about freedom of the press .
But every time we tried to tell the public what was at stake , the forces of censorship responded with a lie :
They told the public that the issue was simply pornography .
By embedding this lie as a presupposition in their other statements about the issue , they succeeded in misinforming the public .
So now I am censoring my software .
You see , Emacs contains a version of the famous “ doctor program , ” a.k.a.
Eliza , originally developed by Professor Weizenbaum at MIT .
This is the program that imitates a Rogerian psychotherapist .
The user talks to the program , and the program responds — by playing back the user 's own statements , and by recognizing a long list of particular words .
The Emacs doctor program was set up to recognize many common curse words and respond with an appropriately cute message such as , “ Would you please watch your tongue ? ” or “ Let 's not be vulgar . ”
In order to do this , it had to have a list of curse words .
That means the source code for the program was indecent .
So this week I removed that feature .
The new version of the doctor does n't recognize the indecent words ; if you curse at it , it replays the curse back to you — for lack of knowing better .
( When the new version starts up , it announces that it has been censored for your protection . )
Now that Americans face the threat of two years in prison for indecent network postings , it would be helpful if they could access precise rules for avoiding imprisonment via the Internet .
However , this is impossible .
The rules would have to mention the forbidden words , so posting them on the Internet would violate those same rules .
Of course , I 'm making an assumption about just what “ indecent ” means .
I have to do this , because nobody knows for sure .
The most obvious possible meaning is the meaning it has for television , so I 'm using that as a tentative assumption .
However , there is a good chance that our courts will reject that interpretation of the law as unconstitutional .
We can hope that the courts will recognize the Internet as a medium of publication like books and magazines .
If they do , they will entirely reject any law prohibiting “ indecent ” publications on the Internet .
What really worries me is that the courts might choose a muddled half - measure — by approving an interpretation of “ indecent ” that permits the doctor program or a statement of the decency rules , but prohibits some of the books that any child can browse through in the public library .
Over the years , as the Internet replaces the public library , some of our freedom of speech will be lost .
Just a few weeks ago , another country imposed censorship on the Internet .
That was China .
We do n't think well of China in this country — its government does n't respect basic freedoms .
But how well does our government respect them ?
And do you care enough to preserve them here ?

Olbermann tells 71 - year - old McCain to ' grow up !'
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday August 19 , 2008
Print This Email This MSNBC's Keith Olbermann offered a scathing Special Comment on Monday , tearing into Senator John McCain 's recent remarks about Senator Barack Obama , which Olbermann described as " unseemly contempt , undignified calumny , and holier - than - thou persiflage unsupported by reality . "
McCain had told the Veterans of Foreign Wars earlier that day , " Victory in Iraq ... could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines .
And this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent . "
" The shifting positions of Senator Obama ? " asked Olbermann .
" Senator , you declared victory in Iraq five years and nearly three months ago .
Today you say ' victory in Iraq is finally in sight .' ...
You are putting up a campaign based on the mirage that Iraq is winnable .
...
Even if this country were to forget , Senator , the victory lap that you and President Bush took five years ago , just on their face your remarks at the VFW , Senator , are nonsensical . "
" Prudence and judgment demanded that Senator McCain tread lightly today , " Olbermann continued .
" Instead he told that convention , ' I suppose from my opponent 's vantage point veterans ' concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage . ' "
Olbermann pointed out that last spring McCain opposed a bill expanding GI educational benefits " on the asinine premise that the rewards to our heroes in it were so good that it did not encourage them to stay in the service . "
This year , McCain has missed every Senate vote on Iraq , " including one to honor just the sacrifice of the fallen , " and has voted over and over to deny additional spending for veterans ' health care .
" And yet , sir , " Olbermann proclaimed , " you have the audacity to stand there in front of the very veterans you repeatedly and consistently sell out and claim it is your opponent who has put politics first and country second . "
Olbermann then turned to McCain 's remark that " behind all of these claims and positions by Senator Obama lies the ambition to be president . "
" Criticizing a man for having ' the ambition to be president , ' " Olbermann repeated incredulously .
" Seriously -- you do realize you are currently running for president as well , right ?
Either you also have the ambition to be president or -- what ?
Somebody 's blackmailing you into it ? "
Olbermann ended by mentioning the McCain campaign 's outrage over a report by NBC's Andrea Mitchell that Obama 's people believe McCain may not have actually been in a " cone of silence " before his appearance at a joint forum with Senator Obama this past weekend and may have been able to find out the questions in advance .
McCain campaign manager Rick Davis angrily called Mitchell 's story " irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at NBC News this election cycle . "
He went on to threaten , " We are concerned that your news division is following MSNBC 's lead in abandoning non-partisan coverage of the presidential race .
We would like to request a meeting with you as soon as possible . "
" He wants no level of objectivity , " Olbermann explained .
" The only campaign he wants questioned is Obama's . "
" You and your campaign need a serious and immediate attitude adjustment , " Olbermann concluded , addressing McCain directly .
" Despite what you may think , Senator McCain , this is not a coronation .
...
You have no automatic excuse to politicize anything you want .
Despite how you have whined , Senator McCain , you have no entitlement to only sycophantic deceptive airbrushed coverage from the media .
And despite how you have strutted , Senator McCain , you have no god - given right to the presidency . "
" In other words -- and I am embarrassed to have to say this to a man who turns 72 this month -- Senator , grow up ! "

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Welcome to the conservative 's worst nightmare :
The law of unintended consequences .
Why ?
Nobody wants to admit it , folks , but the conservatives ' grand ideology is backfiring , actually turning the world 's greatest capitalistic democracy into the world 's newest socialist economy .
A little history :
The core principles of conservative economic ideology are grounded in Nobel economist Milton Friedman 's 1962 classic " Capitalism and Freedom . "
Too late to stop President Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society , those principles became the battle cries energizing conservatives since Reagan : Unrestricted free markets , free enterprise and free trade ; deregulation , privatization and globalization ; trickle - down economics and trickle - up wealth to an elite plutocracy destined to rule the new American capitalist utopia .
So what happened ?
Are you guys nuts ?
Hey , I 'm talking to all you blind Beltway politicians ( in both parties ) ... plus the Old Boys Club running Wall Street ( into the ground ) ... plus all you fat - cat CEOs ( with megamillion parachutes ) ... and all your buddies scamming everybody else to get on the Forbes 400 .
You are proof of Lord Acton 's warning : " Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely . "
It 's backfiring !
You folks turned our America from a great capitalistic democracy into a meddling socialist economy .
Still you do n't get it .
You 're acting like teen addicts tripping on an overdose of " greed - is - good " testosterone while your caricature of conservative economics would at best make a one - line joke on Jay Leno .
Here are 11 reasons your manipulations are sabotaging the great principles of leaders like Friedman and Reagan :
1. Dumber than a fifth grader with cognitive dissonance
Kids know what it means .
They know most adults today can't see past the end of their noses .
Liberals tune out candidate McBush for being lost in the past .
Conservatives can't hear Obama without seeing that turban .
Cognitive dissonance simply means most brains cannot see past their own narrow ideologies .
They dismiss any data that contradicts their old ideologies .
Whether you 're a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat , you only hear what you already know is " true . "
All else is tuned out .
2 . Where did all the leaders go with their moral character ?
Friedman 's economics requires leaders of moral character .
Did it run into Lord Acton 's warning : " Power corrupts , absolute power corrupts absolutely ? "
Former Ford and Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca said yes in " Where Have All the Leaders Gone ? "
Friedman 's great conservative principles have been commandeered by myopic ideologues whose idea of leadership is balancing the demands of self - interest lobbyists with the need for campaign donations .
Unfortunately , a new " change " president wo n't be enough ; there are 537 elected officials in Washington controlled by 42,000 special interest lobbyists .
3. Fed and U.S. Treasury adopted Enron accounting tricks
Bad news : Enron failed several years ago because of its off - balance - sheet accounting scam .
The Fed 's doing the same thing : Dumping Bear 's $ 30 billion liabilities onto the taxpayer 's " balance sheet . "
Next Treasury proposes adding $ 5.3 trillion more from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Unfortunately clever accounting tricks by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke are n't going to fool foreign lenders analyzing America 's creditworthiness .
Worse - case scenario : U.S. Treasury bills with less than a triple - A rating .
With 90 banks on the brink and already too many bail - outs , our so - called leaders are running out of magic bullets .
So now the taxpayer 's " balance sheet " has become the all - purpose " dumping ground " and it's overcrowding fast as our leaders raise the white flag of socialism .
4. Deregulation creating new socialist housing system
Back in 1999 a Democratic president and Republican Congress were in love with a fantasy called the " new economics . "
Enthusiastic lobbyists invented the brilliant idea of dismantling the wall between commercial and investment banking :
They killed the Glass - Steagall Act that was keeping the sleazy hands of short - term hustlers out of the pockets of long - term lenders .
Flash forward :
We lost 85 - year - old Bear Sterns and $ 32 billion IndyMac .
Lehman 's iffy .
And 90 banks .
With the virtual takeover of Freddie and Fanny , Wall Street 's grand experiment with free - market ideology is backfiring , having socialized the housing market .
They have nobody to blame but their self - centered greed .
5 . Trade deficits outsourced more of America 's wealth than jobs
One look at Forbes lists of fat cats and you know the 21st Century does n't just belong to Asia , it belongs to everyone but America .
Why ?
Once again , remember Warren Buffett 's famous " Farmer 's Story " in Fortune : " We were taught in Economics 101 that countries could not for long sustain large , ever - growing trade deficits ... our country has been behaving like an extraordinarily rich family that possesses an immense farm .
In order to consume 4 % more than they produce -- that 's the trade deficit -- we have , day by day , been both selling pieces of the farm and increasing the mortgage on what we still own . "
Friedman was right : Congressional spending is the biggest cause of inflation , and , wow , those conservatives sure did love blank - check deficit spending the past eight years !
6 . Banking system in meltdown , minting penny stocks
The Friedman conservatives apparently understand Joseph Schumpeter 's " creative destruction . "
Yet , our free - market ideologues can't seem to accept that America is now on the " destructive " downside leg of the cycle , in the economy , markets , trade , politics and , yes , sadly , even with their conservative ideology .
You do n't have to be smarter than a fifth grader to figure out that our leaders are clueless about the reality of our crumbling banking system , with many banks trading as penny stocks , while the Fed still panders to conservative pre-election politics rather than getting serious about inflation .
7. Ideologues preach savings , but still push spending
A core principle of conservatism is frugality , saving for the future .
Grandparents raised me , struggled during the Depression , passed on strong ideals .
Somewhere over the past generation conservatives forget frugality .
This distortion peaked in 2003 when consumers were told to spend , not sacrifice , and fuel the economy even as government spent excessively on war .
That was a clear breach of every conservative leader 's position in earlier wars .
As a result , in one brief generation , as the power of conservative ideologues grew , America 's savings rate dropped precipitously from 11 % in 1980 to less than zero today .
8. Warning , the market 's under 2000 peak , losing money
Imagine you 're on Jeff Foxworthy 's fabulous show competing to see if you really are smarter than a fifth grader .
Question : " If you put $ 10,000 in the market in March of 2000 when the Dow peaked at 11,722 , how much money would you have today if the market 's 10 % under 11,722 ? "
So you guess $ 9,000 .
But then two fifth graders raise their hands :
One asks if the CPI inflation rate should be considered ?
If so , maybe $ 5,000 is closer to the right answer .
The other kid wants to know if you 're buying stuff in Chicago or Singapore .
The truth is , the best answer for most adults is : " You 've lost a hell of a lot of money in the market under the grand conservative ideology the past eight years . "
9. Inflation and dollars : Is Zimbabwe the new model for the U.S. ?
The Los Angeles Times ran a photo of a Zimbabwe $ 500 million bank note , worth $ 20 at noon , less at dinner .
Why ?
Inflation 's there is running 32 million ( yes million ! ) percent annually .
The German company printing their banknotes finally cut them off .
Things may be worse in America , psychologically .
Our ideological obsession with " growth " is not working because there is too much collateral damage , namely inflation .
Our dollar has lost substantial value to the euro because our dysfunctional leaders are convinced that a trade policy funded by debt makes sense .
Now we owe China $ 1.3 trillion , sovereign funds want equity not cheap dollar IOUs , and still our clueless Treasury and the Fed continue debasing our currency , printing money like Zimbabwe .
10 . Free - market health care failing 47,000,000 Americans
Big Pharma loves free - market conservatism and no-compete Medicare drug programs .
Nobody else is happy .
Taxpayers get stuck with the bill .
" The Coming Generational Storm " tells us that without massive reforms and big lifestyle changes for taxpayers ( especially retirees ) , within a couple short decades America 's entitlement programs will eat up the entire federal budget .
Medicare is the biggest cost item in your future , over $ 50 trillion in unfunded liabilities .
Conservative ideologues naively believe the answer is more pay - out - of - pocket insurance plans , even with 47 million already uninsured because they can't pay .
Here as in so many areas of our economy , free - market junkies really are suffering a severe case of cognitive dissonance , as blind to the facts about the uninsured as they are to their outdated free - market fantasies .
11 . Conservative free - market policies inflated oil 300 % !
Yep , oil inflated 300 % in eight short years under the " leadership of two oil men . "
But , you can't blame them .
We put the foxes in the henhouse , knowing full well " real " oil men love digging holes on the supply side , supporting ethanol subsidies and blaming speculators -- it 's in their genes !
Talk about cognitive dissonance ; real oil men thrive on cowboy images of Marlboro Men in Hummers , Navigators and F - 150 trucks .
Net result ?
Another perfect example of " creative destruction " in action as conservative ideology meets " law of unintended consequences , " driving GM , the symbol of America capitalism , closer to bankruptcy ... while turning America into a socialist economy .
As Apple prepares to launch the iPhone 2 on Monday , competitors like Palm and RIM are not worried .
On the contrary , they are licking their chops , preparing for a surge in sales , even though Apple expects to sell millions of new iPhones worldwide .
" The way I look at it is there are 1.2 billion cellphones out there , and we 're just scratching the surface , " said Mike Laziridis , CEO of Research In Motion , which makes the BlackBerry , the iPhone 's closest rival .
Steve Jobs is expected to announce the second version of the iPhone on Monday morning during a keynote speech kicking off Apple 's annual Worldwide Developer 's Conference .
The iPhone 2 has already been dubbed the " BlackBerry killer . "
It promises to be faster , slicker and cheaper , boasting features like fast 3 - G networking , Exchange support and even carrier subsidies .
If the rumors prove true , it will be the iPhone many buyers have been holding out for .
It 's a standard line for companies to say they " welcome competition , " but it 's usually a throwaway meant to deflect attention from strategic vulnerabilities .
In the case of the iPhone , however , competitors earnestly have reason to welcome Apple to the market .
Sales show that what 's been good for Apple has been verrrry good for smartphone makers .
Retail sales of the BlackBerry , for example , are up 38 percent in the year since the iPhone 's introduction .
It did n't initially look that way .
When the iPhone 2 rumors first surfaced , nervous investors sold off shares of RIM under the assumption that the company would get creamed by Apple .
Instead , RIM 's market share of smartphones in the United States has actually swelled from 35 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 45 percent in the first quarter of 2008 .
" The fact of the matter is this , " said Pablo Perez - Fernandez , an analyst with Global Crown Capital .
" There were a lot of BlackBerrys in those stores where iPhones were selling , and there were people who may not have thought about a smartphone before , wanted the iPhone , thought it was too expensive , and bought a BlackBerry instead . "
And for smartphone makers like Palm , Nokia and RIM , Apple helped whet the market 's appetite while they went in for the kill , helped by discounted prices and a choice in carriers .
Palm says the sell - through rate on smartphones over the last two quarters has climbed 21 percent to 833,000 units in the third ( and most recent ) quarter , from 686,000 in the previous quarter ( although the sell - through rate was 689,000 in the first quarter ) .
" The Centro has played a critical role in moving our transformational efforts along at a fast pace , " said Ed Colligan , CEO and president of Palm , in a March conference call .
He added that more than 70 percent of Centro buyers are traditional cellphone users who are purchasing a smartphone for the first time .
" What the iPhone did was make it cool to use smartphones , " said Ramon Llamas , an analyst with research firm IDC .
" Before , you had the BlackBerry , which mostly just resonated with enterprise users or business people .
Now , there 's a whole new market of smartphone consumers .
Before the phone came out , I actually asked guys from companies like Nokia and RIM how they were going to respond , and the answer was unanimous – it was , ' Welcome to the party , hop in the pool , the water 's fine ' "
It 's an odd phenomenon because it's not as though Apple invented the smartphone or any of its features – touch screen devices have been around for years and lots of mobile phones already had music capabilities on phones .
What Apple did was package it – and market it – in a way that made it attractive to mainstream consumers .
" The fact that it looks cool and sexy has helped Apple , and has called attention to a portion of the market that had been under the radar for a lot of people , " Llamas said .
In many ways , the iPhone 's effect on the market can be compared to what the iPod did for MP3 players .
Before Apple rolled out the iPod , the portable audio market was n't doing much .
In 1999 , there were really only a handful of MP3 - player makers and unit sales were marginal .
Just a couple years after Apple rolled out the iPod in 2001 , an industry was born .
Total sales of MP3 players in the United States jumped from a paltry couple million ( depending on whose data you use ) up to tens of millions over the last few years , as less - expensive models have become readily available .
" The combination of Apple 's iPod device and its iTunes Store for music downloads has energized the music industry , " gushed a JupiterResearch report in 2003 .
Now we 'll have to see whether the iPhone will have the same effect on the smartphone market .

NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city beginning 8 a.m.
Sunday but urged residents to consider escaping " the mother of all storms " before then .
New Orleans residents leave Friday via Interstate 10 westbound ahead of Hurricane Gustav . more photos »
" You need to be scared , " Nagin said of the Category 4 hurricane tearing along Cuba 's western coast .
" You need to be concerned , and you need to get your butts moving out of New Orleans right now .
This is the storm of the century . "
The city 's west bank is to evacuate at 8 a.m .
Nagin said the city had evacuated roughly 10,000 people Saturday on buses , trains and planes , in addition to the thousands who left on their own .
Buses from collection points would continue running until midnight and resume at 6 a.m.
Sunday , he said .
Watch CNN's Don Lemon report on evacuations »
" This storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day , " Nagin said .
" I 'm not sure we 've seen anything like this . "
At 8 p.m. ET , Gustav 's eye was over western Cuba near Los Palacios , about 65 miles ( 105 kilometers ) west - southwest of Havana , with sustained winds near 150 mph .
Hurricanes are ranked 1 to 5 in intensity on the Saffir - Simpson scale .
A Category 4 has winds of 131 to 155 mph and can cause extreme damage .
Watch a report on the hurricane watch »
" This storm could be as bad as it gets , " Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Saturday afternoon .
" We could see flooding even worse than we saw in Hurricane Katrina . "
New Orleans joined the growing list of local governments in south Louisiana ordering mandatory evacuations on Saturday and Sunday as Gustav roared past Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico .

Many parishes also were imposing tough dusk - to - dawn curfews , hoping to assure residents that they could evacuate without fear of their vacant homes being looted .
Jindal did not order mandatory evacuations at a state level , but he urged residents to take the evacuations seriously .
" I would n't worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p.m. today or 8 a.m. tomorrow , " he said .
" When it comes to evacuation , do it sooner rather than later . "
Jindal said the state planned to begin " contraflow " procedures , opening both sides of interstates to outgoing traffic only , at 4 a.m. Sunday .
Thousands of people had begun fleeing the coast by the time a hurricane watch was issued Saturday afternoon for southeastern Texas to the Alabama - Florida border .
The watch , which means hurricane conditions are possible within 36 hours , was announced the day after many in the region marked the third anniversary of Katrina 's landfall .
In New Orleans , anxiety was high Saturday as residents fled , leaving behind a ghost town of boarded - up homes and empty streets .
Watch Nagin urge people to leave »
Hundreds of people lined up for buses and trains to take them out of New Orleans and thousands of other Gulf Coast residents drove inland , clogging major highways .
At the Union Passenger Terminal in downtown New Orleans , people began arriving as early as 5:30 a.m. , forming a line that snaked behind the main Amtrak terminal .
Humvees circled the crowds of people , many who waited as long as 2 ½ hours , enduring the heat and relentless sun , unsure of their destination .
New Orleans officials designated 17 sites for people without transportation to board buses to take them to the terminal , where they will be moved to shelters outside New Orleans .
However , scores of residents went directly to the terminal , prompting confusion , as did a glitch in the computer system being used to register people .
Watch people flee New Orleans in buses »
Jindal suspended registration at the terminal and instructed people to register when they arrive at shelters .
By Saturday afternoon , 1,100 to 1,200 people had left the city on those buses , Nagin said .
" I 'm not sure where I 'm going , " Margie Hawkins of New Orleans said .
" My last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very , very prayerful , because this is a very serious threat , and it's a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are . "
The city also arranged with Amtrak for more than 7,000 seats to evacuate the elderly by train .
About 1,500 people left for Memphis , Tennessee , Nagin said .
There were also crowds at New Orleans ' Louis Armstrong International Airport , which the city plans to keep open through 6 p.m. CT Sunday .
Both Delta Air Lines and AirTran Airways said they planned to continue flights in and out of New Orleans until the airport is closed .
Watch residents prepare to leave the city »
Vehicles jammed Interstate 10 headed west toward Texas .
Cars also clogged Interstates 55 and 59 heading north out of eastern Louisiana .
Heavy volume was also reported on Interstates 65 and 59 as Mississippi evacuees streamed north .
The hurricane is projected to pass over western Cuba and to move into the southern Gulf of Mexico early Sunday and into the central Gulf by early Monday , according to forecasters .
Gustav could make landfall as a Category 3 or 4 on the U.S. Gulf Coast late Monday or Tuesday , the National Hurricane Center said .
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour announced Friday that Hurricane Katrina victims living in government - issued trailers or mobile homes along his state 's coast would begin evacuating Saturday .
The storm called up uneasy memories Friday of the deadly 2005 hurricane season , particularly of Katrina .
When Katrina hit , more than 1,800 people died in five states , 1,577 of them in Louisiana .
Unlike the situation during Katrina , there will be no " shelter of last resort , " the city said .
In 2005 , the city 's Louisiana Superdome housed thousands of New Orleanians who could n't , or did n't , heed the mandatory evacuation order .
Watch FEMA administrator talk about being proactive »
Nagin warned that all but a " skeleton crew " of city workers would be leaving the city and said local authorities could not promise help for those who choose to stay behind .
" This is very , very serious , and we need you to heed this warning , " he said .
" We really do n't have the resources to rescue you after this . "

Throughout the history of America , and indeed in the course of any developing culture , the universal historical trend ( with some notable , but temporary deviances ) has been towards expanding rights for an expanding number of people .

In a hundred years , flamboyant gay guys will be getting married in fabulous dresses on your grave , and there 's absolutely nothing you can do about it .

Once a year , tens of thousands of tourists gather in a town in Spain to hurl over one hundred tons of overripe tomatoes … all in just one hour .
When the festival is called to a halt fire houses are used to clean the streets as well as the participants .
For this brief but amazing food fight the size of the town quadruples , drawing visitors from all over the world to participate in the largest spaghetti sauce bath of all time .
Participants in La Tomatina are encouraged to wear safety gear such as goggles and forbidden to bring anything that could be used as an actual weapon into the fray .
Nonetheless , clothing is typically torn and outfits are trashed within the brief free - for - all hour of the main event .
Strangely enough , though , the acidity of the tomatoes renders the ground underneath essentially clean once the tomatoes are washed away .
In recent years the festival has become such a phenomenon that parties surrounding it start up to a week early and participants in many cases must stay multiple towns away from Bunol – and may have trouble getting into the middle of the tamato fight itself once it starts on the narrow streets of the town .
Strangely , no one is quite certain how the festival started decades ago though theories abound as to its origins .
For a more extended peak check out the SciFi Channel ’s feature on the festival .
A recent study shows that popular fish oil supplements have an effect on the healing process of small , acute wounds in human skin .
But whether that effect is detrimental , as researchers initially suspected , remains a mystery .
The omega - 3 fatty acids found in fish oils are widely considered to benefit cardiovascular health and other diseases related to chronic inflammation because of their anti-inflammatory properties .
But insufficient inflammation during the initial stage of wound healing may delay the advancement of later stages .
In the study , blister wounds on the arms of people taking fish oil supplements were compared to the wounds of people taking a placebo .
The wounds healed in about the same amount of time – but at the local cellular level , something unexpected happened .
The levels of proteins associated with initiating and sustaining inflammation were higher in the blister fluid in people who had taken the active fish oil supplements .
The researchers had expected those proteins to be lowered by the increased systemic presence of omega - 3 fatty acids in the blood .
" That finding was hard to explain , " said Jodi McDaniel , lead author of the study and an assistant professor of nursing at Ohio State University .
" These proteins may have other functions that we do n't yet fully understand .
And our results also suggested there could be a difference between men and women in the amount of inflammatory proteins that are produced , because on average , women had lower levels of one of the proteins . "
If the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fish oils do indeed delay acute wound healing , then they probably should be discontinued for awhile by patients scheduled for surgery , McDaniel said .
They appear to have enough of an effect that patients should at least inform their doctors if they 're taking a fish oil supplement , she added .
But there could still be a bright side to the supplements ' ability to alter those proteins and other molecular substances that control inflammation locally .
Fish oil 's systemic anti-inflammatory power , which has been illustrated in previous studies , still might assist in the healing of chronic wounds at the local level .
Chronic wounds are essentially stuck in an inflammatory stage that slows or prevents transition to the later stages needed for complete healing .
That mechanism needs to be explored further , McDaniel said .
" There 's so much information out there now about omega - 3s and they clearly have lots of potential , " McDaniel said .
" We 're just trying to figure out how to evaluate what they do and how to advise people to take these supplements .
Our goal is n't to stop supplement use but to fill in the picture of what conditions they help and what they might hurt . "
The research is published in a recent issue of the journal Wound Repair and Regeneration .
Study participants were divided into two groups of 15 healthy adults each .
One group took a placebo , and the other took an active supplement containing 1.6 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and 1.1 grams of docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) daily for four weeks .
EPA and DHA are the polyunsaturated fatty acids obtained primarily from fish oil that serve as the basis of most standard omega - 3 supplements .
Previous research has suggested that these fatty acids affect the production of proteins called proinflammatory cytokines , which signal biological processes during the inflammatory stage of wound healing .
The primary cytokines in the process are interleukin - 1 beta ( IL - 1b ) , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF -a ) .
But research had not yet addressed how the interaction between fatty acids and these cytokines might affect human wounds .
McDaniel and colleagues expected to find that research participants taking the fish oil supplements – and therefore being affected by their anti-inflammatory properties – would have significantly lower levels of the cytokines in their blister wounds during the initial stage of inflammation , resulting in a slower healing process .
Instead , the group taking the fish oil had significantly higher levels of IL - 1b in their blister wounds than did the placebo group 24 hours after the wounds were created .
The active group also had higher levels of IL - 6 and TNF - a cytokines in their blisters over time than did the placebo group , but those differences in levels were not significant .
The blisters took an average of 10.7 days to completely heal in the active supplement group and an average of 9.8 days in the placebo group , but the difference was not significant .
The results suggest that the function of these cytokines still is n't completely understood , McDaniel said .
And the scientists were also surprised to find that gender appeared to make a difference in cytokine production .
Men were more likely than women among the active supplement group to have higher levels of the IL - 1b cytokine in their wounds .
McDaniel said that some studies have suggested that estrogen plays a role in inhibiting the production of this particular protein during the inflammatory stage of wound healing , but more research is needed .
McDaniel and colleagues are following up with a similar study in which they are adding a low - dose aspirin to both the fish oil supplement and placebo groups .
Some research has shown that aspirin can facilitate the anti-inflammatory properties of omega - 3 fatty acids , and low - dose aspirin is commonly included in the medication regimen of patients with cardiovascular disease .
The researchers also will look at different biological markers in blister wounds to see if the combination of fish oil and aspirin produces compounds that function as what McDaniel called " stop and go switches " in controlling inflammation .
" If we find that the fish oil can work in an anti-inflammatory fashion at the local level of wound sites , we would consider moving on to the chronic wound population , " McDaniel said .
" Even if we find that there are times when omega - 3 fatty acids should not be taken in advance of creating an acute wound , such as in elective surgery , we still have high hopes that fish oil might be beneficial for chronic wounds in certain situations . "

McCain 's slips , and Reagan's
With Democrats on the precipice of raising the age issue against John McCain , Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont seemed to cross the line completely , then immediately backtrack , my colleague Ken Vogel reports .
Leahy told Vogel yesterday the media has given McCain a free pass on flubs including mixing up Middle East geography , Shiite and Sunni Muslims , and referring to Russia 's relationship Czechoslovakia — a country that has n't existed for 15 years .
" It was the same way with Ronald Reagan in the last few years he was president , " Leahy said , referring to the belief that Reagan experienced early signs of Alzheimer 's disease late in his presidency .
The press " let Ronald Regan get away with " slips , Leahy said , though he denied he was suggesting that McCain was experiencing mental decline .
" No , I 'm just saying he gets a free ride , " Leahy said .
Giving love to the Previewer
Very hard work has been done in these days to improve more and more the Previewer .
The first thing i focused on was making a good DBus interface .
Helped by Fabrizio Montesi ( fmontesi on irc ) i made some methods to allow a good integration with JOLIE .
So these methods came out :
void openFile ( QString filename )
void goToPage ( uint page )
QString currentFile ( )
uint currentPage ( )
Actually goToPage and currentPage only work when an Okular part is loaded .
They allow the client / server communication provided by JOLIE .
You can have a look at this screencast made by Fabrizio to show JOLIE +
Previewer working together = ) .
http://jolie.sf.net/videos/vision-previewer.ogv
This works for most of you ( Thank you Fabrizio ) : http://jolie.sf.net/videos/vision-previewer.avi
Btw there are also some graphical improvements to talk about = ) .
First of all Nuno Pinheiro made a really nice icon for the Previewer .
Currently it looks this way , enjoy :
Now let ’s have a look to multiple previews handling .
Previewer stores recently opened files in the context menu .
Now we have a nicer and faster way to retrieve recently previewed files just by clicking on the left side of the dialog , where a list of recent files is shown .
Pictures will talk in place of me =)
I made the list as “ Plasmy ” ( awful term ) as possible so that it looks not so alien as other widgets do .
It reacts well to theme changing :
Nice huh ? =)
Now , as you ( ok , some of you = ) ) noticed , there are two more icons near the close button .
We got a trash :
As suggested by friedrich| on irc , some of you would need to delete some recently opened files from the history .
So here comes that trash : click on it to remove the currently opened file both from the Previewer and from its history .
Simple ! =)
The second added icon is the resize one = ) .
Since scrolling the wheel to resize the previewer was getting hateful for me i decided to make something different ( more like is done for your applets on the desktop ) .
So , as the tooltip suggests , just drag that icon to resize your dialog . =)
Oh !
Forgetting ..
Some of you asked for an integration with Dolphin / Konqueror .
Currently Previewer provides a service menu :
“ Preview this file ” sends the file to Previewer and shows it ..
This is n’t a real Dolphin integration .
Btw I ’m keeping in touch with Peter Penz to integrate this behavior in Dolphin natively .
It does n’t seem so easy to implement but i’m sure that Peter will do a great job for this !! =)
That ’s it guys .
Of course comments are always welcome !
Cheers

There has been a lot in the news recently about current volcanic activity – Merapi in Indonesia and Bezymianny in the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia , but while most reports have focussed on the very real dangers to the local populace and air traffic , volcanoes can have important impacts on climate as well .
However , there are a number of conditions that need to be fulfilled before an eruption will show up in the climate record .
The most important recent volcanic impact on climate was that of Mt. Pinatubo in the Phillipines which erupted in June 1991 .
Prior to that El Chichon ( Mexico , in 1982 ) , Mt. Agung ( Indonesia , 1963 ) , Santa Maria ( Guatemala , 1902 ) and Krakatoa ( Indonesia , 1883 ) all had noticeable cooling effects .
The observant among you will notice that all of these volcanoes are in the tropics , and this turns out to be a crucial determinant of how much climate impact there is .
Additionally , each of the these eruptions had a high VEI ( Volcanic Explosivity Index ) and high sulphur dioxide amounts in the ejecta .
In each case , the eruption was so strong that significant amounts of sulphur dioxide ( which gets converted to sulphate aerosols ) were carried up into the stratosphere ( 12 to 15 km above the ground ) .
There , because this is well above the clouds and rain of the troposphere , the sulphates can hang around for a long time ( a few years ) while sulphates in the lower atmosphere get quickly washed out and do n’t generally have a long term impact ( but there can be exceptions – see below ) .
This can happen equally well in the mid and high latitudes , but the key factor in tropical eruptions is that the circulation of the stratosphere ( rising in the tropics , subsidence in the high latitudes ) favors the worldwide dispersion of tropical sulphates , but pushes high - latitude sulphates right back down again .
So for tropical eruptions , the effects both last longer and are more widespread than for equally explosive high - latitude eruptions .
The principle impact is a couple of years of cooling ( since sulphates are reflective ) , but related changes in dynamics can cause ‘ winter warming ’ in Europe , and there are hints in the paleo - record of an impact on El Nino events – the probability of one may double after a big tropical eruption ( Adams et al , 2003 ) .
There can be some exceptions to the tropics - only rule , and at least one high latitude volcano appears to have had significant climate effects ; Laki ( Iceland , 1783 - 1784 ) .
The crucial factor was that the eruption was almost continuous for over 8 months which lead to significantly elevated sulphate concentrations for that whole time over much of the Atlantic and European regions , even though stratospheric concentrations were likely not particularly exceptional .
One point that is also worth making is that although volcanoes release some CO 2 into the atmosphere , this is completely negligable compared to anthropogenic emissions ( about 0.15 Gt / year of carbon , compared to about 7 Gt / year of human related sources ) .
However , over very long times scales ( millions of years ) , variations in vulcanism are important for the eventual balance of the carbon cycle , and may have helped kick the planet out of a ‘ Snowball Earth ’ state in the Neo- proterozoic 750 million years ago .
Volcanoes can provide great tests for climate models , and indeed , predictions of the impacts of Pinatubo ( before they happened ) proved very accurate ( about a 0.5 C cooling after about 18 months ) – for instance in Hansen et al ( 1992 ) .
Other studies have examined the dynamic impacts of volcanic eruptions ( the ‘ winter warming ’ – Robock and Mao , 1992 ; Shindell et al 2004 ) , the water vapour feedback as the planet cools ( Soden et al , 2001 ) , the impact of high - latitude eruptions ( Oman et al , 2005 ) , impacts on ENSO ( Mann et al , 2005 ) and have shown that the models work pretty well .
So what of the current eruptions ?
Well Bezymianny appears to be explosive enough , but its latitude ( 55 N ) will tend to preclude it having any big climate impact .
Merapi is in the right location but does n’t appear ( so far ) to be explosive enough to put anything in the stratosphere , and so this too seems unlikely to impact climate .
At some point , there will be another climatically important eruption , but it has n’t happened yet …
Have you noticed what the interest rate TIPs now pay ?
How about Zero ?
Thanks to a flight to safety , the fixed rate on the newest issue of Series I inflation - indexed savings bonds has for the first time fallen to zero .
Heres ' the Treasury Department press release :
The earnings rate for Series I Savings Bonds is a combination of a fixed rate , which applies for the life of the bond , and the semiannual inflation rate .
The 4.84 % earnings rate for I bonds bought from May through October 2008 will apply for their first six months after issue .
The earnings rate combines a 0.00 % fixed rate of return with the 4.84 % annualized rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers ( CPI - U ) .
The fixed rate applies for the 30 - year life of I bonds purchased during this six - month period .
The CPI - U increased from 208.490 to 213.528 from September 2007 through March 2008 , a six - month increase of 2.42 % .
Bloomberg observed :
" Financial market turmoil has caused the fixed rate on the newest issue of Series I inflation - indexed savings bonds to fall to zero for the first time , according to the U.S. Treasury 's Bureau of Public Debt .
Investors still get a return on the investment as long as consumer prices rise , because the government pays additional interest in lockstep with inflation .
The fixed rate 's decline to zero reflects the decline in returns in money markets in the aftermath of the credit collapse , said Kim Treat , a spokesman for the bureau in Washington .
The government promotes the savings bonds as " low - risk ' ' investments for individuals that protects them against inflation .
The so - called earnings rate on the bonds issued between May and October , which is tied to the rate of inflation , is 4.84 percent , the bureau said in a press release .
The fixed rate , on top of the compensation for rising consumer prices , is officially 0.00 percent , down from 1.2 percent when the Series I was last issued , in November .
That means investors get no returns on their investments other than compensation for inflation .
The fixed rate has never fallen so low since inflation - indexed savings bonds were introduced in the 1990s , Treat said . "

very C++ programmer has had one of those days : A simple use of a template library turns into a nightmare , with pages upon pages of error messages streaming out of the compiler .
Somewhere in that proverbial haystack are the clues you will need to determine exactly what went wrong an error about a missingoperator here , an incompatible type assignment there but you know you are in for a long search through the grisly internals of the template library , or a visit from your local C++ template guru .
This article is not about C++ template error messages , but they are indicative of a far more general problem with the C++ template system .
Most errors in the use of templates come from a misunderstanding between the author of the template and the user of the template .
The author of the template expects the user 's type to provide some specific set of operations , say , a + operator for addition and a copy assignment operator , which I 'll refer to as the template requirements .
When the user provides a type with the appropriate operations , i.e. , the type satisfies the template requirements , everything works .
However , when the user 's type is missing some operations , the compiler reports the error as soon as the template tries to use that operation , which is often deep in the implementation of the template library .
Thus , the template requirements are effectively a contract between the template author and user , and debugging a template error message is the act of trying to determine who broke the contract and how .
Enter : Concepts
Concepts is a language feature planned for C++0 x that allows programmers to express the template requirements as part of the template ’s source code .
Placing requirements on a template formalizes the contract between template author and user , allowing the compiler to ensure that both parties uphold their end of the bargain .
The template author is permitted to use only operations that he has required the user to provide , while the template user is allowed to supply only types that provide all of the operations that the template requires .
When both parties uphold the terms of the contract , the program works ; but when one party makes a mistake , the compiler produces an error message that describes the error in terms of the contract , isolating the template author from the template user and , therefore , producing shorter , simpler error messages that do not expose library internals to the user .
This article introduces the core ideas behind concepts , showing how they can be used to express the template requirements to provide correct and easy - to - use template libraries .
The end of the article will illustrate some of the advanced features of concepts that make template libraries more powerful and more flexible .
The intrepid reader may want to follow along using ConceptGCC , a prototype compiler implementing the concepts language feature .

Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux 2.6.26 yesterday on the Linux kernel mailing list .
This release , which has been under development for about 3 months , comes after 9 release candidates .
Major changes in this release are support for read - only bind mounts , KVM on additional architectures , wireless mesh networking ( 802.11s ) , x86 page attribute tables , improved webcam support , and per-process securebits .
Another major new feature in this release is the integrated kernel debugger ( KDB ) , which was included despite objections by Torvalds who has vetoed similar additions in the past because he believes that the absence of a debugger encourages more careful development .
According to the Linux Foundation 's kernel Weather Forecast some of the features that are going to be the focus of development now that 2.6.26 is released are the new Ext4 filesystem and preemptible spinlocks .
The full changelog and patch ( 7.3 MB compressed ) are available from kernel.org .
For additional details , see the release announcement on LKML and the Linux Weather Forecast web site .
For an overview of the new features , check out the coverage on KernelTrap and at the Kernel Newbies web site .

Mary Poppendieck talked today at Agile 2008 about compensation schemes , attacking the traditional model of bonuses and appraisals .
Pointing out that a traditional bonus system undermines teamwork and implies that most people will not do their best without additional financial incentives , she suggested focusing on more immediate and non-financial motivation techniques .
Quoting Jeffrey Pfeiffer ’s testimony to US Congress in 2007 , Mary Poppendieck said that there is a lot of evidence that intrinsic motivation is much more effective than external factors such as financial bonuses , pointing out that external motivators can actually undermine intrinsic factors .
Opensource projects , for example , work because people care about them and starting to pay some of the contributors will negatively affect the motivation of other contributors on the project .
Citing a research by Arie de Geus , author of The living company , Mary said that highly successful companies foster a culture which does not use financial compensation as a primary rewards motivator .
The same research shows that those companies pay people above market rates to to reduce turnover and attract the best people , coupled with rewards that share organizational success , but money is not the primary reason why people work there .
As an extreme case , Mary mentioned Tandem Computers , who according to her gave no salary information on job interviews .
Their CEO was of the opinion that people who come for money will leave for money and did not want those people onboard .
Team payment does not work
Mary said that 80 % compensation systems reward individual , not team performance and that only 10 - 20 % of appraisal systems include team performance , causing a lot of competition inside teams that discourage team behaviour .
In software development , it is very hard to establish the effects of individual contributions and good teamwork is key to the project .
Most individual compensation schemes , according to the presentation , absorb vast amounts of management time and resources and leave nobody happy , but team compensation strategies are not easy to implement .
Mary presented results from HP ’s experiments during the beginning of the nineties , when HP allowed 13 local organisations to experiment with team - incentive plans .
All programs were discontinued by the 4th year , due to constant changes to the plans which were needed to distribute available money among the teams and a wide dissatisfaction with the plans by employees .
On the end , all projects concluded with no relationship or negative relationship between actual incentives and performance .
San Diego team pay for performance program started great , with everybody feeling very positive about the plan in the first six months and most teams outperforming their goals .
However , that meant that a lot more money was given out than HP planned for , so the standards were adjusted in the next six months which met stiff resistance .
High performance teams started excluding new members , managers felt that teams concentrated on money not jobs and the plan was discontinued because it caused way too much hassle .
Mary also gave a case study of a high performing team that was given a large bonus to distribute internally .
Everyone agreed that individuals should get a part matching their contributions , bot no one could agree on individual contribution levels .
After a heated discussion , team decided on an equal split which left everybody unhappy , and the same group of people never worked again well as a team .
Instead of financial incentives , companies should focus more on encouraging and training teams to provide internal intrinsic positive feedback and non-financial positive reinforcements , according to Mary .
Fair compensations are effective
Citing a research from Elliot Jacques , she said that the most effective financial compensation schemes are those that are felt fair in the organisation .
Differences in salaries can exist between different levels that are perceived fair .
In software , criteria that is generally accepted fair are the timespan of discretion ( how long can you work without your boss looking over your shoulder ) and job complexity .
That kind of compensation schemes is , according to Mary , validated by many studies over several decades .
An especially important idea was that the money should not be used a differentiator at the same level , and that if money moves rapidly in the market , everyone in the company should be moved up regularly , not generating a gap between new hires and older employees .
On the end , Mary gave some advice on effective incentives and compensation schemes :
A previously unrecognized group of air pollutants could have effects remarkably similar to harmful substances found in tobacco smoke , Louisiana scientists are reporting in a study scheduled for presentation today at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society .
Inhaling those pollutants exposes the average person up to 300 times more free radicals daily than from smoking one cigarette , they added .
The discovery could help explain the long - standing medical mystery of why non-smokers develop tobacco - related diseases like lung cancer , said H. Barry Dellinger , Ph.D. , the Patrick F. Taylor Chair of Environmental Chemistry at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge .
" Free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body , " Dellinger said .
" Based on our work , we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life - threatening conditions .
This is a staggering , but not unbelievable result , when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin . "
Scientists have long known that free radicals exist in the atmosphere .
These atoms , molecules , and fragments of molecules are highly reactive and damage cells in the body .
Free radicals form during the burning of fuels or in photochemical processes like those that form ozone .
Most of these previously identified atmospheric free radicals form as gases , exist for less than one second , and disappear .
In contrast , the newly detected molecules — which Dellinger terms persistent free radicals ( PFRs ) — form on airborne nanoparticles and other fine particle residues as gases cool in smokestacks , automotive exhaust pipes and household chimneys .
Particles that contain metals , such as copper and iron , are the most likely to persist , he said .
Unlike other atmospheric free radicals , PFRs can linger in the air and travel great distances .
" You basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas - phase radicals , " Dellinger said .
" You 'd have to be right next to a road when a car passes , for example .
Whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles .
So you 're never going to get away from them . "
Once PFRs are inhaled , Dellinger suspects they are absorbed into the lungs and other tissues where they contribute to DNA and other cellular damage .
Epidemiological studies suggest that more than 500,000 Americans die each year from cardiopulmonary disease linked to breathing fine particle air pollution , he says .
About 10 to 15 percent of lung cancers are diagnosed in nonsmokers , according to the American Cancer Society .
However , Dellinger stresses additional research is necessary before scientists can definitely link airborne PFRs to these diseases .
Smokers likely get a double dose of PFRs every time they light up , Dellinger said , since tobacco smoke also contains these molecules .
In the five minutes it takes a typical smoker to finish a cigarette , he or she will breathe in an equal number of PFRs from the air and the smoke itself , likely compounding the damaging effects .
WASHINGTON , June 20 ( UPI ) --
The U.S. military appears to have misplaced hundreds of nuclear missile components , officials told The Financial Times .
The newspaper said it learned details of a report from the Defense Department on the security of nuclear weapons .
One official said that more than 1,000 parts cannot be accounted for .

Hello , this is the Open Flash Chart project .
Get graphs like this for free :
How does it work ?
User browses to your web site .
The browser downloads the web page which contains the Open Flash Chart .
Open Flash Chart downloads the data file and displays the chart .
When you add Open Flash Chart to your web page , you tell it where to find the data file .
We also do pie charts .
Why is that great ?
When the user downloads the web page , Open Flash Chart requests the chart data from the server .
The server knows who the user is so it can generate a chart for that particular user showing up to the minute data .
Add a bit of pizzazz to your bar charts !
Is it complicated to set up ?
You will need to include the Open Flash Chart in your HTML , and you also need to provide the data file on the server .
The data file is either a text file , or a .php , Perl , Python , Java ( or another flavour of dynamic ) page .
For a simple chart you would just drop the data .
txt file on your website and point the Open Flash Chart to this URL .
But what we really want is dynamic data that is pulled from a database or calculated or something .
To do this you need to create the data file when it is requested .
To do this we point the Open Flash Chart to a .php page and this PHP page does your calculations and / or database lookups , then outputs the data file .
To make this a bit easier there are PHP , Perl , Python and Java classes to write the data file for you .
Why only these languages ?
Well any scripting language will do the same job .
But I do n’t have access to anything but PHP .
If anyone wants to translate the PHP class into a different language , then email me and I ’ll post your code and a link to your web site here .
The link to your site will be great for your page rank !
Change the style of the charts .
Get started !
Download Open Flash Chart , this includes the PHP class .
Read the tutorial .
Check out the gallery .
And it ’s really free ?!
Yes .
Once upon a time I had to deal with a company who sell flash charting components , their component had a bug that I needed fixing , so I emailed them about it asking when it ’d be fixed .
( Remember that I had paid real money for this software . )
They were so incompetent , rude and obnoxious that after three or four weeks of emails I thought to myself “ I could learn Flash and Actionscript and write my own charting component , release it as Open Source , host it on sourceforge and build up a community of helpful coders faster than they can fix a single bug . ”
And that is what I did .
And that is why it is free .
I guess the moral of the lesson is : do n’t piss off your customers .
Want to sponsor Open Flash Chart ?
I am stuck with Flash 8 which is a bit naff .
I would love to upgrade to Flash 9 with Actionscript 3.0 but I am skint .
So if you are rich and are looking to help out with this project click here !
Annotated images show observations taken on Jan. 7 and Jan. 9 , 2008 .
For Jan. 7 , 2008 : Scientists had planned on studying Supernova 2007uy in the galaxy NGC2770 , which was already several weeks old when seen in this visual ultraviolet image taken on Jan. 7 , 2008 , by NASA´s Swift satellite .
A close - up , X - ray image of that supernova is below it .
For Jan. 9 , 2008 : Seemingly out of nowhere , Supernova 2008D burst onto the scene on Jan. 9 , 2008 , as seen in ultraviolet images and X - ray images taken by NASA´s Swift satellite , giving scientists the unique opportunity to witness the birth of a supernova .

Thanks to a fortunate observation with NASA 's Swift satellite , astronomers , for the first time , have caught a normal supernova at the moment of its birth -- the first instant when an exploding star begins spewing its energy into space , transforming into a supernova that during its brief lifetime will shine brighter than billions of stars combined .
Until this discovery , the only supernovae glimpsed during their first moments were the more rare kind -- the ones whose birth cries are drowned out by a blindingly bright gamma-ray burst , which sometimes forms in the space surrounding a massive exploding star but is not part of the star itself .
This new supernova , named SN2008D , intrigues scientists because it is closer to Earth than any type of supernova ever observed in the act of exploding and because its gamma - ray - free radiation gives them the clearest picture ever of a star at the moment its explosive death transforms it into a supernova .
The discovery will be described in a paper to be published in the 22 May 2008 issue of the journal Nature .
" This discovery is giving us unique insights into how a supernova - producing star explodes , " said David Burrows , a senior scientist and professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State University and a co-author of the paper to be published in Nature .
" This explosion seems to be characteristic of the vast majority of supernovae -- those that do not contain gamma rays .
All the data we are collecting , beginning with the initial shock wave , will help us to more fully understand why some supernovae make gamma rays and others do not , " said Burrows , who is the lead scientist for Swift 's X - ray telescope ( XRT ) , which detected the first signals from the new supernova and has continued to observe its evolution .
The Swift satellite is controlled by Penn State from its Mission Operations Center at University Park .
" We were in the right place , at the right time , with the right telescopes , and witnessed history , " says Alicia Soderberg of Princeton University and Carnegie observatories , who is leading the group studying this explosion .
Astronomers previously had observed thousands of such " normal " supernova explosions , but not until days or weeks after the supernova 's first moment of birth , after the expanding shell of debris becomes energized by the decay of radioactive elements forged in the initial explosion .
" This newly born supernova is going to be the Rosetta stone of supernova studies for years to come , " Soderberg said .
A typical supernova occurs when the core of a massive star runs out of nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity to form an ultradense object known as a neutron star .
The newborn neutron star compresses and then rebounds , triggering a shock wave that plows through the star ’s gaseous outer layers and blows the star to smithereens .
The new observations of the first " shock break - out " in X - rays are important because they provide a direct view of the exploding star in the last minutes of its life .
Soderberg 's discovery of the supernova 's shock breakout began on 9 January 2008 , when Soderberg and Edo Berger , also a Princeton / CarnegieFellow , were using Swift to observe a supernova known as SN 2007uy in the spiral galaxy NGC 2770 , located 90 - million light years from Earth in the constellation Lynx .
At 9:33 a.m. EST they spotted an extremely bright X - ray outburst that lasted for 5 minutes , and they quickly recognized that they were witnessing a new and unprecedented phenomenon that was occurring in that same galaxy .
In the paper to be published in Nature , Soderberg and 38 colleagues show that the energy and pattern of the X - ray outburst is consistent with a shock wave bursting through the surface of an exploding star , which gave birth to the supernova now known as SN 2008D .
The astronomers were making these observations with Swift , which is well equipped to study such an event because of its multiple instruments observing in gamma rays , X - rays , ultraviolet light , and optical light .
The X - ray observations were captured by Swift 's X - ray telescope , the XRT , which was developed and built by an international team led by Penn State 's Burrows , who directs the continuing operation of the XRT instrument and the analysis of the data it collects .
The principal analyses of the X rays from the new supernova were done by members of the XRT instrument team led by Burrows , including Kim Page and Andy Beardmore at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom and Judy Racusin , a graduate student at Penn State .
Due to the significance of the X - ray observations , Soderberg immediately mounted an international observing campaign to study SN 2008D .
Astronomers rushed to observe the new supernova with major telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , the Very Large Array in New Mexico , the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii , the Keck I telescope in Hawaii , the 200 - inch and 60 - inch telescopes at the Palomar Observatory in California , and the 3.5 - meter telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico .
Chandra 's ACIS X - ray camera was conceived and developed for NASA by Penn State and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the leadership of Gordon Garmire , Evan Pugh Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Penn State .
" Data from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory turned out to be crucial for interpreting some of the Swift XRT telescope 's follow - up observations of this supernova 's evolution , " Burrows said .
The combined observations helped Soderberg and her colleagues to pin down the energy of the initial X - ray outburst , which is helping theorists to better understand supernovae .
" A fascinating conclusion from the theoretical modeling of this outburst is that a thin outer layer must have been ejected at velocities up to about 70 - percent the speed of light .
This speed is much higher than previously known for the bulk of the stellar envelope , which moves at only up to 10 - percent the speed of light , " said Peter Meszaros , Holder of the Eberly Family Chair in Astronomy and Astrophysics and Professor of Physics at Penn State and leader of the theory team for Swift .
" The relatively higher - energy X - rays observed can now be understood as the usual optical photons emitted by the supernova being boosted up to X - ray energies as they are batted back and forth between the slower envelope and the faster outer shell , " Meszaros explained .
In addition to Meszaros , other members of Swift 's theory team include XiangYu Wang , a former Penn State postdoctoral fellow now at Nanjing University in China ; and Eli Waxman , of the Weizman Institute of Science in Israel .
Penn State graduate student Peter Brown is involved in follow - up observations in ultraviolet and optical wavelengths with Swift 's Ultraviolet / Optical Telescope ( UVOT ) , which was developed , built , and is operated by international teams led by Penn State .
Penn State graduate student Antonino Cucchiara and his advisor Derek Fox , assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State , have been working on the team 's effort to study the evolving optical light of the supernova using the Gemini - North and Hobby - Eberly Telescopes .
" We are getting new data every other day that we quickly share with astronomers worldwide , " says Cucchiara .
" Our observations are giving us a deeper understanding about not only this supernova , but also about a dynamical evolution that may be characteristic of most supernovae . "
" It was a gift of nature for Swift to be observing that patch of sky when the supernova exploded .
But thanks to Swift 's flexibility , we have been able to trace its evolution in detail every day since , " commented Swift lead scientist Neil Gehrels of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .

Setting up OSX for some Erlang Development - yes - with Emacs
I ’ve decided to dig a bit into Erlang .
The setup
has been painless .
I first installed Macports ( look here for a step by step guide ) .
With this installed , to install Erlang is a single command :
sudo port install erlang
Then I looked up the recommended development environment .
What a surprise : a lot of people suggest Emacs .
And so I followed the instructions of lisp Guru extraordinaire Bill Clementson on how to setup Emacs to develop in Erlang .
I wo n’t repeat what he has explained perfectly in the post linked above .
Now since yesterday I am going through “ Programming Erlang ” with a development Erlang node embedded in my Emacs session and I am enjoying it very much .
My mind wanders freely on the power and the ease Erlang will give me to develop massive , concurrent , real - time , next generation services . :)

Small outbreaks of violence , like recent food riots in Haiti , can prefigure a larger crisis . *
Photo : AP * Whether news of current events is good or bad , there is always a lot of it .
Worldwide , an estimated 18,000
Web sites publish breaking stories in at least 40 languages .
That universe of information contains early warnings about everything from natural disasters to political unrest — if you can read the data .
When the European Commission asked its researchers to come up with a way to monitor news feeds in 2002 , all it really wanted was to see what the press was saying about the EU .
The commission 's Joint Research Center developed software that monitors 1,540 Web sites running some 40,000 articles a day .
There 's no database per se , just about 10 gigabytes of information flowing past a pattern - matching algorithm every day — 3.5 terabytes a year .
When the system , called Europe Media Monitor , evolves to include online video , the daily dose of information could be measured in terabytes .
So what patterns does EMM find ?
Besides sending SMS and email news alerts to eurocrats and regular people alike , EMM counts the number of stories on a given topic and looks for the names of people and places to create geotagged " clusters " for given events , like food riots in Haiti or political unrest in Zimbabwe .
Burgeoning clusters and increasing numbers of stories indicate a topic of growing importance or severity .
Right now EMM looks for plain old violence ; project manager Erik van der Goot is tweaking the software to pick up natural and humanitarian disasters , too .
" That has crisis - room applications , where you have a bunch of people trying to monitor a situation , " Van der Goot says .
" We map a cluster of news reports on a screen in the front of the room — they love that . "
EMM gives snapshots of the now .
But " the big thing everyone would like to do is early warning of conflict and state failure , " says Clive Best , a physicist formerly with the JRC .
Other research groups , like the one run by Eric Horvitz at Microsoft Research , are working on that .
" We have lots of data , and lots of things we can try to model predictively , " says Horvitz .
" People think in terms of trends , but I want to build a data set where I can mark something as a surprise — a surprising conflict or surprising turn in the economy . "
Horvitz is developing a system that picks out the words national leaders use to describe one another , trying to predict the onset of aggression .
EMM has something similar , called tonality detection .
Essentially , it 's understanding the verbs as well as the nouns .
Because once you know how people feel about something , you 're a step closer to being able to guess what they 'll do next .
Related The Petabyte Age : Sensors everywhere .
Infinite storage .
Clouds of processors .
Our ability to capture , warehouse , and understand massive amounts of data is changing science , medicine , business , and technology .
As our collection of facts and figures grows , so will the opportunity to find answers to fundamental questions .
Because in the era of big data , more is n't just more .
More is different .
If you ’ve ever asked for help with your Windows computer that wo n’t boot anymore , you ’ve probably been told to “ Backup all your data and then reinstall ” … but if you ca n’t boot , how can you get to your data ?
That ’s the question we ’ll be answering today .
One of the easiest methods to access your data is to simply boot off an Ubuntu Live CD … and it ’s completely free ( except for the cost of a blank cd ) .
Burn an Ubuntu Live CD
If you have another computer , you can download and burn the Ubuntu Live CD using a very simple application called ImgBurn .
Otherwise , you can bug one of your friends to help you burn a copy .
Just open up ImgBurn , and click the icon to “ Write image file to disc ”
Then click on the icon next to “ Source ” , pick the downloaded ISO file , stick a recordable CD into the drive , and click burn .
Now that you have the boot cd ( which you should keep in a safe place , as it ’s very useful ) , just stick it in the drive of the computer and boot from it .
You should see an option to “ Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer ” .
Once the system has started up , the first thing you want to do is choose Places \ Computer from the menu .
This should show you all the drives available in the system , including your Windows drive .
In my case , that is the 52.4 GB volume .
You can try and double - click on the drive to open it … and if it immediately works then lucky you !
Most of the time it ’s going to give you an error saying “ Unable to mount the volume ” , because Windows did n’t shut it down cleanly .
Click the Details link so that you can see the full message , and leave this window open .
You ’ll see a “ Choice 2 ” in the message , which includes the commands to force Ubuntu to use that drive even though there ’s something wrong .
What you ’ll want to do is open a new Terminal from Applications \ Accessories \ Terminal on the top menu .
Once you ’ve done that , then you ’ll want to type in a bunch of commands , which I ’ll walk you through .
First , we ’ll want to switch to “ administrator ” mode , which in Linux terms is known as “ root ” .
The simplest way to do it is with this command :
sudo / bin / bash
Now we ’ll need to create a directory that we ’ll mount the drive on .
The full explanation of mounting drives is a little complex , so just run this command :
mkdir / media/disk
Now comes the tricky part .
You ’ll need to type out a command very similar to this one , but you ’ll need to replace / dev/ sda1 with what you see in that message box we showed you above .
This command tells Ubuntu to use the ntfs - 3g driver , and force mount even if there is a problem .
mount -t ntfs - 3g /dev/sda1 / media / disk -o force
If your drive is FAT32 instead of NTFS , then you can use the following command instead :
mount -t vfat -o umask=000 / dev/sda1 / media/ disk
If you are having problems figuring out whether you have NTFS or FAT32 , and you ca n’t figure out which / dev / whatever to use , then type in the following command at your prompt ( make sure you already ran the command to run things as root )
fdisk -l
In the output you should see a lot more information about the available drives … you can see in this example that the filesystem type is NTFS and the device name is / dev/sda1 .
At this point , you should be able to access your hard drive through the icon in Computer .
Note :
If you have more than one drive in the computer , or more than one partition , they should show up separately in Computer .
You should perform the same steps as above to open those drives up as well .
Backing Up to External USB
The absolute simplest thing to do at this point is to plug in an external USB drive , which should place an icon on the Ubuntu desktop , and most likely immediately pop up a nautilus window showing the contents of the drive .
Note : I plugged in a USB Flash drive for illustration … it would be better to plug in a full external USB drive so you ’ll have more space for backups .
What Should I Backup ?
If you are n’t extremely technical , you might be wondering what on earth you should be backing up … and that ’s a very good question .
1 ) Best Method
If you have loads of empty space on your external drive or network share , you should simply backup the entire contents of the drive , and sort through it later .
It ’ll take a little longer , but at least that way you can be sure everything has been backed up .
2 ) Still Good
You should try and backup your entire user folder … on XP you ’ll go to “ Documents and Settings ” , and on Vista you ’ll go to “ Users ” , and you should see your username in the list :
You can simply copy this entire folder to your backup drive , which should contain your music , documents , bookmarks , and most of your important files .
Important Note :
This will not backup your application files , and you should look around your drive and see if you ’ve saved anything important somewhere else .
This is especially true if you have more than one drive .
Again , your best bet is to simply backup everything .
Backing Up to Network Share
If you would rather backup your drive to a network share on another computer , you can use the Places \ Connect to Server item on the menu .
Change the Service type menu to “ Windows share ” …
And then enter in the details for your network drive , with these being the required fields :
Server : Computer Name
Share : Shared Folder Name
User Name : your username
Once you click the Connect button , you ’ll be prompted to enter in your password .
Typically you can leave Domain set to the default , but if you have a custom workgroup name you should enter that instead .
I also chose the “ Remember password until you logout ” button just so I wo n’t have to enter the password again .
Once you click the Connect button you should have an icon on the desktop for your network share .
Now you can open up the network share , and if everything is setup correctly on the shared folder side of things , you can copy all of your files across the network using the instructions above on which files to choose .
At this point you should have a backup of your data .
If you backed up to an external hard drive , you might want to consider also copying those files to another computer just in case , and if you copied across the network you could consider backing that up elsewhere as well .
Now you can proceed with reinstalling or whatever else you ’d like to do .
If you are having issues , be sure to leave them on our forum .

Glider helps WoW players get experience and loot quickly
Blizzard has won the first round of a legal battle against the maker of software that automates game play in World of Warcraft .
It brought the case against MDY Industries claiming its WowGlider program infringed its copyright .
An Arizona district court has ruled MDY does infringe Blizzard 's copyright but not in the way the game maker claimed .
WowGlider controls characters in Warcraft so they kill enemies and loot them automatically .
Damage claim
The summary judgement by US District Court Judge David Campbell says that MMOGlider , as the software is now called , breaks the terms of the license players agree to abide by when they run World of Warcraft ( WoW ) .
Despite this decision Justice Campbell did not side with Blizzard in its claim that MMOGlider broke the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
MMOGlider is the creation of MDY founder Michael Donnelly and more than 100,000 copies of the $ 25 ( £ 12.47 ) tool are thought to have been sold .
It has proved popular as it helps players overcome the " grind " involved in turning low level WoW characters into more powerful ones .
Blizzard launched the case in 2006 via a lawyer from Vivendi , which publish WoW , who visited Mr Donnelly at home accompanied by a private investigator who told him to stop selling the software and hand over profits from it to Blizzard .
" Offended " by these threats Mr Donnelly decided to take Blizzard on in the courts .
Unless Blizzard and MDY settle out of court the case looks set to go before a jury in September .
This court case will decide some of the issues the Judge did not pronounce on and address the question of whether Blizzard is due damages .
They say that sufferers react to new foods in the same way that a normal eater would to someone putting a sheep 's eye in their sandwich and forcing them to eat it .
ATLANTIC CITY -- Jose Canseco was knocked out by former Philadelphia Eagles return man Vai Sikahema in their celebrity boxing match Saturday .
Canseco 's size advantage -- he is 6 - foot - 4 , 245 pounds to Sikahema 's 5 - 9 , 205 -- was not a factor in the bout , which was over in the first round .
" When you step inside the square circle , " Sikahema said , according to the Press of Atlantic City , " do n't ever think that your size is going to matter because in Philadelphia , we will chop you down . "
Sikahema was asked if there were any surprises .
" That it did n't finish in the first 30 seconds , " he said .
Sikahema , who is also a sportscaster , has some experience in the ring .
He has had more than 80 fights as an amateur boxer , according to the Press .
Canseco said he had a background in martial arts .
Sikahema knocked Canseco down twice -- once with a left hook , and the second after a flurry of punches -- as the bout was called before the end of the first round .
Sikahema donated $ 5,000 of his winnings to the family of a slain Philadelphia police officer , who was shot and killed in May .
The Cowboy and His Sunset Europe Happy to See the Back of Bush
US President George W. Bush will arrive in Europe this week amid a trans -Atlantic spat about American chickens .
But the issue is not likely to disrupt the business at hand : Bush 's ride into the political sunset .
Europe is more than happy to see him off .
Aug. 6 , 2008 -- Every August , the mega - yachts descend on the south of France in a swarm of pristine white and fiberglass that glistens above the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea .
By day the yachts , some more than 400 feet long , coast from port to port and marina to marina .
The owners , an exclusive club of the world 's billionaires , take in local sights , dine at the region 's most luxurious restaurants and soak up the sun on what have become their own " floating islands . "
" There 's an undeniable luxury to these yachts and to know that one person bought it and owns it is pretty remarkable , " said Diane Byrne , executive editor of Power & Motoryacht magazine .
" It 's also a way to enjoy getting away from the craziness of life on land , work and traffic .
It does n't matter whether you 're a billionaire or a hard - working Joe , it 's a means of escape for them , a way to have a self - sufficient luxury resort all to yourself . "
At night , the world 's elite come out to play .
Dressed to perfection in designer clothing , they shimmy off their boats into the Mediterranean 's hottest nightclubs -- Les Caves Du Roy in Saint - Tropez or Cinquante Cinq ( Club 55 ) in Monaco -- for an evening of thumping music and high - class hob - knobbing .
" It 's the who 's who of … the south of France , " said yacht consultant Mark Elliot .
" There 's the ' boom - boom ' rhythm of the music and parties on the docks .
Everybody 's dressed to the nines -- the beautiful people all coming off of their boats . "
For some , the super - sized , ultra- luxurious boats are the main attraction .
For yachting insiders , it 's all about the far - off , picture - perfect locales where the gigantic yachts drop anchor .
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen 's 414 - foot Octopus was launched in 2003 .
With a permanent 60 - man crew , two helicopters , seven boats and a submersible , Octopus is a seaborne estate .
For all of its amenities , Octopus requires an estimated $ 20 million annual budget .
The spirit of good - natured one - upsmanship lives on among the world 's yacht - owning billionaires ;
Oracle founder Larry Ellison and music bigwig David Geffen co-own the Rising Sun mega yacht , which clocks in at 452 feet .
Russian investment tycoon Roman Ambramovich 's Eclipse literally overshadows others when it floats into port at a reported 508 feet .
The Sheikh of Dubai owns an even larger yacht -- 524 feet long -- that dwarfs those of fellow billionaires .
" It all about prestige , " said Vanessa Stuart , administrator for the International Superyacht Society .
" If you 're the best it 's about having the best -- it 's all about looks , how it looks to other people .
The larger the vessel , the better the man you are or the better the woman you are . "
With a mega yacht , Stuart said , " you can have all the toys on board -- your jet ski and all your fancy tenders , your amphibious car , your submarine . "
Trinity Yachts Vice President William Smith III said his company has had some unusual requests from customers , from underwater speakers for scuba divers to an inflatable air slide -- ( usually found on an airplane ) for use as a water slide .
" That 's what 's great about this business -- it 's always changing , " Smith said .
" You do n't have zoning laws ; you do n't have condo associations you 've got to deal with .
As long as it's not illegal or un - seaworthy , as long as they 're willing to pay , yes , we can do that . "
His clientele includes a cast of characters who are " very interesting " and " not the average millionaires , " he said .
" Most of our clients are first - generation money and they 're fascinating people , just the creativity that they come up with , " Smith said .
" The owners are at a stage in their life where they want what they want -- the reason they 're talking to us is because they have n't found what they want in the existing market . "
Making a Grand Entrance
Stuart said the mega yacht world is always changing , with new faces joining the yachting scene every year .
" There 's some old money , there 's new money , " she said .
" That 's why it 's a great industry because if somebody has a great empire and it collapses , someone else comes in , buys it and makes their empire even bigger , then they can decide if they want to have the toy . "
This summer , billionaire yacht owners and their ships have crisscrossed the world .
Allen 's Octopus was in St. Nazaire , Polynesia , the Azores and then France .
Ellison 's Rising Sun was spotted in Tahiti , St. Tropez and Capri .
One of Abramovich's other yachts , Ecstasy , has been to Trieste , Italy , and Croatia .
According to Wall Street Journal wealth columnist Robert Frank , the ideal spot to anchor is a place to dock a tender that can refuel and fill the boat with food provisions from catering companies .
" Probably a nice restaurant as well for the owners to get off and have nice meal even though their private chef is probably the best thing in the world , " Frank joked .
The Mediterranean boasts yacht - friendly ports that are known for their natural beauty , history , shopping and ritzy restaurants , Byrne said .
Due to their boats ' huge berth , the giant yachts can fuel up and travel almost anywhere , Frank said .
" They can go to the South Pacific , they can go to islands off South America , they can explore parts of the North and South Pole so the advantage is that they can really go anywhere , " he said .
" But pulling into a place like Monaco or Amalfi or Portofino and being the biggest boat on the block is still very important to these people . "
The Mediterranean still reigns as the spot to be seen among the rich and famous , but the popularity of the region comes with a price , Frank said .
" The Mediterranean becomes a giant parking lot for boats and if you try to go to Portofino or Capri or Cannes or Monaco , unless you booked a year ago , you 're not going to get a spot even if you have a fairly small boat , " Frank said .
He added that the wealthy yacht owners and their guests tend to look down upon anchoring out at sea and riding a luxury yacht tender -- usually a permanently inflated boat -- to the shore .
" Your hair gets messed up when you 're on the slip and mistresses complain about not being able to walk onto the dock with the Rolls Royce waiting , " Frank joked .
Instead of facing the dearth of docking space in the Mediterranean , yacht owners are traveling to new areas and are inadvertently minting new hotspots for the super - yacht crowd .
" Croatia has become a very popular yacht destination for the Russians , Turkey has become a very popular yacht destination for Europeans and Americans , even Slovenia simply because the Mediterranean has run out of space , " Frank said .
Owners are traveling to what used to be considered backwater areas and turning them into yacht destinations , said yacht consultant Mark Elliot .
" The newest , hottest craze has been out to Croatia , " Elliot said .
" For me , it 's 1,000 different anchorages and 100 different islands where you can go to be all by yourself .
It 's old cities that have been beautifully restored and kept , the water 's crystal clear like in the Bahamas . "
Elliot said although the shores of Eastern Europe do n't have " nightclubbing with the rich and famous , " the ports in Croatia allow yacht owners to " get back to a real sense of yachting where you 're anchored all by yourself , exploring and getting off the beaten path , " he said .
Yacht owners are constantly trying to find the next hot ports , Elliot said .
The yacht consultant has seen boats travel up the Amazon River , base out of Alaska for a summer and plan an " around the world " itinerary .
According to Elliot , Saint - Tropez is still the number one summer yacht destination , with Monaco and Portofino in second and third .
Spots such as Alaska and North America 's eastern seaboard are smaller summertime yacht hubs .
Yacht owners escape the traffic of more popular marinas by sailing to Eastern Europe , Byrne said .
" It 's so nice and quiet and is essentially untouched , " Byrne said .
" It 's undeveloped so it kind of has this old world European feel to it -- it 's not the hustle and bustle of other ports .
They say , ' let 's chill and enjoy and have a spot all to ourselves , we do n't really want to be in the midst of the action anymore . ' "
Smith said that contrary to popular belief , mega yacht owners are " notoriously private " and wish to find a unique luxury escape like Eastern Europe that can be tailored to their needs .
" That 's the beauty of these boats , " Smith said .
" You can send the yacht anywhere in the world and when you need it there 's your staff and your stuff in the closet . "
We 've all heard of ridiculous metrics used to measure job performance , often with disastrous results .
When productivity is incentivized , employees figure out how to game the system .
Milo 's boss , " Greg , " familiar with other failed performance metrics , abandoned traditional methods and invented his own — gauging productivity by SVN Checkins per Week .
Similar to counting lines of code , this method did n't track what was checked in , just that something was checked in .
Hopefully multiple times .
After a brief period of recording data , Greg noticed a disturbing trend with the staff .
When he started measuring the team 's performance with this metric , some of the developers that he'd previously thought were the most productive had less checkins than some those he thought were less productive .
This was clearly a problem with the staff , and not with Greg 's new performance metric .
He called a particularly unproductive slacker into his office : Milo .
Greg : Milo , I have to be blunt .
I called you in here because your productivity has been slipping .
Milo : ... it has ?
I have n't missed a deadline in months , and the last project I was put on could n't have gone better !
Greg : Yes , and we appreciated your help , but can you tell me why Scott had 23 checkins yesterday and you only had four ?
Milo :
Well , not really .
I 'm not even sure what Scott 's working on .
In my case , I was working on the order entry system all morning and did n't check it in until the afternoon .
Is that a problem ?
Greg : Frankly , yes .
I 'm going to have to keep my eye on you and your checkins .
After the meeting , Greg announced to the team that their performance would be measured by checkins per week .
Which immediately kickstarted a boom in ( Greg 's version of ) productivity .
Both Milo and Greg were delighted to learn that with a few minor changes in the daily routine , doubling , or even tripling productivity was easy !
The Unproductive Milo would have worked on a module , tested it on his local workstation , and checked changes in only after he was reasonably sure they were " done . "
The Productive Milo learned that this was highly unproductive .
Productive Milo slowly adapted an increasingly productive technique — first checking in after each function he wrote , then after about every four lines of code he wrote , then after each line of code he wrote .
His checkins ( and therefore his productivity ) soared .
Still , it irked Milo that he was n't reaching his full productivity potential .
He was wasting a lot of time writing code ; time that should be spent checking code in .
With a can - do attitude and an unquenchable thirst for productivity , he was even able to create a utility to help him be even more productive .
It would , for example , convert this :
for ( int i=0 ; i< 10 ; i++) //Stuff
into a more - productive , more - checkinable :
const int LOOKUP_0 = 0 ; int i ; i=LOOKUP_0 ; landhere1 : if ( !( i < 10 ) ) goto landhere2 ; //Stuff i++ ; goto landhere1 ; landhere2 : if ( i < 10 ) goto landhere1 ;
With his script , dubbed " PHLEGM " ( Programmer 's Helper for Literally Engaging in General Machination , named by one of his colleagues ) , he could stretch what would usually be one checkin to 20 - 30 commits .
It 's evolved like an open source project with his fellow team members adding new features .
While PHLEGM mostly served as an exercise for Milo to practice string parsing and code generation , he should technically be expecting a raise as he 's increased his productivity by over 600 % .
And although this has been going on for the past two months , strangely his boss is none the wiser that most checkins are single - line changes , or that fixing a misspelling of " guarantee " on an order form should n't take more than a dozen checkins to fix .
On the contrary , Milo 's boss is glowing at how Milo has " turned things around . "
Today , this metric is still in use .
And while actual productivity and morale has declined , there has been a tremendous upswell in Greg - related jokes around the office .
In one instance , one of Milo 's colleagues stopped to use the ATM while they were out at lunch .
He retrieved his cash , then returned to the back of the line to use the ATM again , got some more money , and got back in line again .
Puzzled , Milo asked " what are you doing ? "
" Dude , is n't it obvious ?
You get more money this way . "
Smallest x86 ELF Hello World
( That I could achieve )
Final size : 142 bytes
Intro
This page is a combination tutorial / documentary about my attempts at creating the smallest x86 ELF binary that would execute saying Hello World on Ubuntu Linux .
My first attempts started with C then progressed to x86 assembly and finally to a hexeditor .
I ended up compromising and switching to a " Hi World " app instead in order to fit the string data into the elf magic number .
The final result is a completely corrupted x86 ELF Binary that still runs .
From start to finish .
The first thing you need to do is get an a proper environment setup .
Install Ubuntu ( or a distro of your choice ) run : sudo apt - get install g++ gcc nasm System versions user@computer : ~$ lsb_release -a No LSB modules are available .
Distributor ID : Ubuntu Description : Ubuntu 8.04.1 Release : 8.04 Codename : hardy user@computer : ~$ uname -a Linux ryanh - desktop 2.6.24-19 - generic # 1 SMP Wed Jun 18 14:43:41 UTC 2008 i686 GNU / Linux user@computer : ~$ gcc --version gcc ( GCC ) 4.2.3 ( Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu7 ) Copyright ( C ) 2007 Free Software Foundation , Inc .

There is NO warranty ; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE . user@computer : ~$ nasm - version NASM version 0.99.06-20071101 compiled on Nov 15 2007
My first attempts started with C , the following is what I used for chello .c
Code : chello.c # include < stdio.h > int main ( ) { printf ( " Hi World
" ) ; return 0 ; }
Command : gcc user@computer : ~$ gcc -o chello chello.c user@computer : ~$ ./ chello Hi World
My initial executable was 6363 bytes .
.
You can use readelf to dump the ELF header from the executable .
Command : readelf user@computer : ~$ readelf -h chello ELF Header : Magic : 7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 Class : ELF32 Data : 2's complement , little endian Version : 1 ( current ) OS / ABI : UNIX - System V ABI Version : 0 Type : EXEC ( Executable file ) Machine : Intel 80386 Version : 0x1 Entry point address : 0x80482f0

ldd is useful for showing all the dynamic libraries an executable is linked to .
Command : ldd user@computer : ~$ ldd chello linux - gate.so.1 => ( 0xb7f77000 ) libc.so.6 =>
/lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6 ( 0xb7e18000 ) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 ( 0xb7f78000 )
file will give you a description of what a file is .
Command : file user@computer : ~$ file chello chello : ELF 32 - bit LSB executable , Intel 80386 , version 1 ( SYSV ) , for GNU / Linux 2.6.8 , dynamically linked ( uses shared libs ) , not stripped
The " not stripped " returned from the file command means that the debugging symbols have n't been stripped from the excutable .
Command : strip user@computer : ~$ strip -s chello
After stripping the executable was now 2984 bytes , still unacceptable !
Time to take drastic measures ...
, still unacceptable !
Time to take drastic measures ...
I scratched the C attempt and dropped using printf , instead opting for nasm x86 assembly .
file : hello.asm SECTION .data msg : db " Hi World " , 10 len : equ $ - msg SECTION . text global main main : mov edx , len mov ecx , msg mov ebx , 1 mov eax , 4 int 0x80 mov ebx , 0 mov eax , 1 int 0x80 Compiling the asm user@computer : ~$ nasm -f elf hello.asm user@computer : ~$ gcc -o hello hello .
o - nostartfiles - nostdlib - nodefaultlibs user@computer : ~$ strip -s hello user@computer : ~$ ./ hello Hi World
Before stripping the file was 770 bytes after stripping 448 bytes .
However there is still useless headers and sections to destroy .
after stripping .
However there is still useless headers and sections to destroy .
Open the binary in your favorite hex editor , I use the curses hexeditor and ghex2 .
Delete everything including and past offset 0xAD , this will drop it down to 173 bytes
Move 0xA4 - 0xAC to 0x7 and Change offset 0x86 from 0xA4 to its new location 0x07 .
Delete 0xA2 and 0xA3
The file should be 164 bytes and now its time to enter the twilight zone ...
The rest is a lot to explain , basically I attempted to find what I could change in the elf head with out having it segfault on me .
I added some jmps and completely corrupted the executable , however it still runs :) .
Here is some useful information :
In x86 0xD9D0 is nop or no operation , useful for just filling space if you need to .
0xEB followed by a single signed byte is a relative jmp .
Really you should read the intel docs on x86 instructions A - M N - Z .

Conclusion .
Final size : 142 bytes
I am certain that there are ways to get it even smaller .
There may also be more things that can be removed from the header to increase size , but I did n't spend the enough time fully researching the ELF header format .
Another option might be to use the a.out format instead of ELF may allow you to get even smaller .
Huff
Post reports on a story that I knew of last week , but was n’t going to report until and unless it was confirmed .
They appear to have done just that :
One of Sen. Hillary Clinton ’s top financial supporters offered $ 1 million to the Young Democrats of America during a phone conversation in which he also pressed for the organization ’s two uncommitted superdelegates to endorse the New York Democrat , a high - ranking official with YDA told The Huffington Post .
Haim Saban , the billionaire entertainment magnate and longtime Clinton supporter , denied the allegation .
But four independent sources said that just before the North Carolina and Indiana primaries , Saban called YDA President David Hardt and offered what was perceived as a lucrative proposal : $ 1 million would be made available for the group if Hardt and the organization ’s other superdelegate backed Clinton … .
Saban is the nation ’s largest political campaign contributor over the last decade , FEC records show , giving nearly $ 13 million since 1999 to dozens of candidates , PACs , and Democratic campaign committees … .
In March , high - ranking donors for Sen. Clinton , including Saban , sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi chastising her for suggesting that superdelegates had a responsibility to support the candidate who finished the primary process leading in the pledge delegate count .

A continuation is basically the state of a program at the time the continuation was captured .
For a common example , consider a blocking system call for any operating system .
If the system call blocks the process , the continuation of that process is placed on a blocked queue until the system call completes .
When the operation completes , the continuation is removed from the queue and resumed with the result of the system call .
There has been plenty of well - deserved hoopla around continuations for web interaction .
Navigating a website is a great deal like operating on a program 's continuations .
A page generated from a server - side program contains references to a number of program continuations in its links and forms .
Clicking a link or submitting a form invokes the captured continuation which the server then executes .
The result is yet another set of continuations on the resulting page , ad infinitum .
Unfortunately , most continuation frameworks are designed around server - side continuations , where the continuations are saved on the server , and the client receives only a secure token naming the continuation .
The Waterken server is a particularly beautiful example of this for Java .
Awhile ago I ported an older version of the Waterken server to ASP .
NET .
Here is a public continuation for the comments page , and embedded in the comments page is the editing authority , which is an unguessable capability URL for the continuation to edit the comments page .
The Waterken " web- calculus " is actually a full blown persistent , distributed object system with a binding for the web .
However , maintaining persistent server - side state significantly complicates many aspects of web systems .
It makes load balancing servers difficult , and persistent continuations are single threaded so only one invocation can proceed at a time which hurts scalability .
Furthermore , if the continuations are persistent , as they are in Waterken which provides orthogonal persistence , then we must also contend with schema upgrade .
Two recent articles prompted me to re-examine these issues and devise a solution .
First , Tommy McGuire posted a link to his " Infernal Device " paper on LtU .
His paper describes a set of structures which can be used to develop an application by reifying the application 's states as transitions in a finite state machine .
The Transition objects are essentially application - specific partial continuations .
The paper also details all of the different storage available in a browser , and how it can be exploited by a server to save state on the client .
For page - local state , the browser URL can hold up to 2 kB on IE ( other browsers can store more ) , and we have embedded form fields for POST requests .
For site - local state , we have cookies which can be in the multi- kB size .
Then I came across this blog post about scaling Seaside by reducing the need to capture server - side state .
The best way to optimize expensive operations is by avoiding them completely !
However , much program state does not need to reside on the server .
We can capture a limited set of program state in the browser itself .
In essence , we serialize the program continuation in the browser 's URL or in its form fields .
We also encrypt the serialized form to maintain integrity .
And so our program continuations have become mobile objects that migrate between client and server and can survive server restarts as long as any server state the continuations access also survives restart .
A set of load balanced machines need only share the encryption keys , and user requests seamlessly migrate between them .
I 've created a small library for mobile continuations written in C# .
I also provide an IHttpHandler for use with ASP .
NET .
A web application using this library does n't need to use any web controls or .aspx pages .
An application is structured as a set of continuations which implement two operations : Show , and Apply .
Show outputs the continuation via display - independent set of interfaces .
Apply is invoked when a continuation receives a POST request .
It takes a NameValueCollection containing all of the form 's fields .
This takes the place of a continuation 's named arguments .
I could implement a more elaborate system as found in the Waterken server where the fields are implicitly typed and named , but I felt a more limited scope is preferable for the time being .
By convention , continuations in the research literature are generally named " k " , so the continuation interface is named K .
This simple HelloWorld class implements the K interface and it embeds a continuation to an Adder object in its display :
The Adder class is equally simple , consisting of a text input and a submit button .
This continuation builds a form which submits to itself .
When applying the continuation , it adds its currently stored value to the value specified in the form and returns a new instance of Adder with the stored value .
The library also provides a compact object serializer .
HelloWorld serializes to 48 bytes .
Adding some simple fields barely increases the size at all .
You probably wo n't be entering any of these URLs by hand of course .
There are a few more optimizations that can be made to the serializer as well .
CrystalTech hosts ASP.NET in a medium trust environment , so the library also works for shared hosts .
Some contortions were necessary , and fully general object serialization is not yet available ( for instance , serializing delegates will fail ) .
By default , the library assumes all continuation objects can be migrated to clients .
This encourages more scalable program structures .
If some object needs to remain server - side , simply implement the ILocal interface .
There are no operations , but the interface marks the class as non-mobile .
The default behaviour in this case is to generate a random 64 - bit token , and migrate this token instead .
When the token migrates back to the server , it re-connects to the original object .
If the server restarts , this state is lost , but a state server as found in ASP.
NET can be built which will allow the state to survive restarts and be shared between machines .
Schema upgrade can still pose a problem unfortunately , and unlike with server - side state where the continuations are stored centrally , you can't use a tool to upgrade them .
Altering method implementations does not pose an upgrade problem .
Adding and removing fields is problematic however .
Fortunately , applications using the library are already structured for easy upgrade and permit a configurable policy for deprecation .
Basically , do n't touch existing classes , and only create new classes .
Replace the use of old classes in the program with the new classes , then whenever you judge it appropriate , remove the old class entirely .
On any serialization errors , the library will invoke an application - specific handler which returns a continuation .
I think any conceivable upgrade policy is feasible given these primitives .
The current source for the library is available here .
I plan to improve the mechanism for displaying continuations in a medium - independent fashion .
Ideally , I 'd like to be able to create a binding for Windows .
Forms , and for JSON requests , so that the same continuation - structured application can be reused unmodified in different environments .

We told you earlier that Buzz Aldrin disagrees ( he thinks scifi killed space travel ) .
And over the weekend , MIT synthetic biologist Drew Endy told me his area of research has also suffered because so much science fiction portrays bio-hacking as horrific ( think Frankenstein ) or silly ( think South Park 's " four - assed monkey " ) .
But for every scifi story that hinders science , there 's one that inspires it .
Below , I 've got a big list of stories that hinder , as well as inspire , scientific innovation .

It 's important to remember that when I say that a story " hinders " scientific innovation , that does n't mean the story is n't good or powerful .
In fact , some of the most important , world - changing science fiction is of the " hindering " variety because it serves as a warning against rampant scientific experimentation without any thought for possible consequences .
Even if beneficial in some ways , a " hindering " tale is still , well , hindering scientific progress .

As I noted in my prior post , John McCain is going out of his way to poke conservatives in the eye on virtually every major issue .
Yet the Republican Party is on the verge of nominated him for president .
If I may engage in a bit of straight talk , to use the candidate 's term , this will be the second time in a row the GOP has nominated to the highest office in the land a man who has a good personality but who is both intellectually lazy as well as not that bright to begin with .
And then there 's the fact that both George Bush and John McCain have always been proponents of immigration amnesty and open borders .
And both are believers in big government as well as extending the American welfare state to the Mideast .
But what is the alternative ?
I 've become interested in the Libertarian Party candidate , Bob Barr .
Here 's an interview with Barr in which he gives a good account of himself .
An excerpt :
Q . Do you think if McCain becomes president , we 'll be stuck in the same position for another four years ?
A. Based on the statements he 's made , yes .
I mean , McCain may think it 's fine to spend $ 400 million a day as far into the future as anyone can see , but that 's not his money .
This is the problem .
These folks in Washington might think it 's a great mission we 're serving over there , but is this the wisest use of taxpayer money ?
Is it more important to spend billions of dollars improving Iraq 's infrastructure or improving the infrastructure of our own country ?
Q. Does it make you question McCain 's conservative credentials to see him support such a costly war ?
A. I 'm not sure that anybody can legitimately say that McCain is conservative .
Update : Just to balance out McCain 's stupidity on energy policy , look at this clip of Senator Harry Reid telling us how we have to stop using fossil fuels .
I doubt if a President Obama would be dumb enough to listen to such Democratic leaders on energy , but if he did he'd be a one - termer for sure .
Imagine trying to heat your house with solar energy in a New Jersey winter .
Al - Qaeda expert re-killed by CIA By Lori Price , www.legitgov.org
Updated : 30 July 2008
It 's ' Groundhog Day ' at the CIA !
Abu Khabab al - Masri ' died ' in January 2006 and again on Monday .
Once again , the ' mainstream ' media announces the re-killing of another ' key al - Qaeda operative ' by a ' CIA - operated unpiloted drone ! '
These top al - Qaeda operatives - and their subsequent deaths - are more bountiful than poppy fields in Afghanistan and oil smuggling routes in Iraq .
BTW , who keeps picking up the US $ 5 million reward ?
The Financial Times reports : Al - Qaeda expert killed by CIA 30 July 2008 Pakistan intelligence officials yesterday confirmed a key al - Qaeda [ al - CIAduh ] expert on chemical and biological weapons was killed in an attack by a CIA - operated unpiloted drone , late on Sunday .
Egyptian - born Midhat Mursi al - Sayid Umar , who was also known as Abu Khabab al - Masri , was one of six Arab men who were killed in a remote region along the Afghan border , according to an intelligence official .
The US had offered a $ 5 m ( €3.19 m , £ 2.5 m ) reward for his capture .
Western diplomats said it would be a boost to morale in the Bush administration , struggling with mounting troop casualties in Afghanistan and a revival of militant attacks in Iraq .

News reports : Officials : Al Qaeda 's Mad Scientist Killed -- CIA Drone Targeted Chemical Weapons Expert Abu Khabab Al - Masri On Afghanistan - Pakistan Border 29 Jul 2008
One of al Qaeda 's top chemical and biological weapons experts was killed in an air strike by a CIA pilotless drone in a remote Pakistani border region , senior Pakistani intelligence officials told CBS News Tuesday morning .
Intelligence officials investigating the early Monday missile attack confirmed that Midhat Mursi al - Sayid Umar , also known as Abu Khabab al - Masri was one of six men killed and his remains had been positively identified ...
The timing of the report on al - Masri 's death also aroused suspicion - coinciding with a visit to the White House by Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani .
In the past week two U.S. officials , speaking on deep background , told CBS News that they expected Pakistan to overtly demonstrate its support for the U.S. fight against terrorism by assisting in the arrest or killing of an important Islamic militant , close to the time of Gilani's Washington trip .
But , looky here !
U.S. Strike Killed Al Qaeda Bomb Maker -- Terror Big Also Trained ' Shoe Bomber , ' Moussaoui 18 Jan 2006 ABC
News has learned that Pakistani officials now believe that al Qaeda 's master bomb maker and chemical weapons expert was one of the men killed in last week 's U.S. missile attack in eastern Pakistan .
Midhat Mursi , 52 , also known as Abu Khabab al - Masri , was identified by Pakistani authorities as one of four known major al Qaeda leaders present at an apparent terror summit in the village of Damadola early last Friday morning .
The United States had posted a $ 5 million reward for Mursi 's capture .

Abu Khabab al - Masri : A Master of Terror 18 Jun 2006
According to a growing number of media reports , a recent U.S. airstrike on a Pakistani border village has likely killed a senior Egyptian Al - Qaida commander named Midhat Mursi ( a.k.a. Abu Khabab al - Masri ) .
Since the late 1980s , Abu Khabab has served as a top military aide and deputy to Dr. Ayman al - Zawahiri in Afghanistan .
Mursi was responsible for co-managing Al - Qaida 's notorious Derunta military training complex near Jalalabad , where he maintained his own elite terrorist graduate school aptly named the " Abu Khabab Camp . "
No worries .
The New York Times covers for the Bush regime : Bush Praises Pakistan Just Hours After U.S. Strike 29 Jul 2008 President [ sic ]
Bush on Monday praised Pakistan ’s commitment to fighting extremists along its deteriorating border with Afghanistan , only hours after an American missile strike destroyed what American and Pakistani officials described as a militant outpost in the region , killing at least six fighters .
Mr. Bush , meeting with Pakistan ’s prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , at the White House , sought to minimize growing concerns that Pakistan ’s willingness to fight extremists was waning , allowing the Taliban and Al Qaeda to regroup inside Pakistan and plan new attacks there and beyond .
Senior American officials , including Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice just three days ago , publicly scolded Pakistan for not doing more to root out safe havens like the one bombed on Monday in Azam Warsak , a village in South Waziristan near the Afghan border .
Among those believed to have been killed in the missile attack , evidently carried out by a remotely piloted aircraft operated by the Central Intelligence Agency , was an Egyptian identified as a senior Qaeda trainer and weapons expert , according to residents and officials in the area , as well as American officials .
Neither the operative ’s identity nor that of the others has been confirmed .
The officials spoke anonymously because of the political and diplomatic sensitivities of attacking targets in Pakistan .
The Egyptian operative , Midhat Mursi al - Sayid Umar , also known as Abu Khabab al - Masri , appears on the State Department ’s list of 37 most - wanted terrorists , with a reward of $ 5 million for his capture ...
He was falsely reported to have been killed in a similar attack in January 2006 in news accounts that attributed the claim to Pakistani officials .
The timing of Monday 's strike , the latest in a series by remotely piloted American aircraft inside Pakistan , coincided with the first official visit by Mr. Gilani to the United States .

Petite , leggy women with big busts are the most sexually attractive , study reveals
Small women with long legs are the most sexually attractive to men , scientists claim .
Females such as Scarlett Johansson , Raquel Welch and Marilyn Monroe with short slender bodies , large busts and slim limbs have the ideal body shape , according to research .
Dr William Brown , of Brunel University , which carried out the study , said : ' We found that shorter , slimmer females with long slender limbs and larger breasts are more attractive . '
Small is beautiful :
The study reveals that men find women like Scarlett Johansson , Marilyn Monroe and Rachel Weisz , with long legs , small frames and bigger busts , more attractive because they have low ' body masculinity '
Body symmetry is important to what men and women find aesthetically pleasing in each other , the research suggests .
Previous studies had demonstrated that those with facial features that are symmetrical - so the left and right sides of the face match - are more attractive to the opposite sex .
But the relationship between body symmetry and attractiveness has been less clear .
In the Brunel research , both men and women reported that symmetric bodies were more attractive than asymmetric ones .
The scientists claim , however , that we do not notice symmetry in the body directly , but instead look for much more obvious signs of attractiveness such as height , leg length and shoulder definition .
This means women with low ' body masculinity ' - who are short with long legs and a larger bust - are highly desirable to men .
July 23 , 2008 Video games have evolved to the point where they fairly accurately depict what a real racing car driver experiences as they hurtle around the track .
Gamers can compete against friends and strangers across the globe thanks to the Internet , but now BBC News is reporting on a new technology that will allow gamers to take on real opponents in real races in real time , using GPS data from the cars .
i Opener ’s patented system , which uses an enhanced GPS system known as differential GPS ( DGPS ) , takes real - time GPS data from racing events and sends it to compatible consoles and PCs .
The DGPS system is commonly used for air navigation or shipping where precision is key and uses a network of fixed base stations to correct the GPS signal , which on its own may only be accurate to within 10m .
The system works like this :
The car position is located with Global Navigation Satellite Systems
Location data and car telemetry is beamed to a track side server
Data is tagged with unique ID of the car and sent over the internet
Information stored on servers and " mediacast " to gamers .
The whole process from car to gamer takes less than five seconds and , " With that we know the location and the velocity of the car , " iOpener founder Andy Lurling told BBC News .
As further precision is needed , iOpener can use information from the European EGNOS network , which augments GPS satellite signals to provide positional data accurate to within 2m .
Other tweaks include fitting cars with an inertial measurement unit ( IMU ) , commonly used in guided missile systems , which measure acceleration , angle and yaw of the object and , combined with DGPS , give the location of the car to within less than 30 cm .
In addition , the system collects telemetry data from the car , which is fitted with a small computer , transmitter and the GPS receiver .
" That is already good enough data for a game , " said Mr Lurling .
The company does not intend to develop its own games but instead will provide the backbone for games developers to build on to .
“ It 's clear that the next trend in gaming is going to be bringing real objects into the virtual world ; playing not against other gamers but people doing the real thing , " said Mr Lurling .
At the moment , iOpener is concentrating firmly on racing games , but believes that there is a huge market for the system in other sports such as biking , rowing , skiing and snowboarding .
While the prospect of testing ones mettle against real life heroes definitely sounds exciting , it might also highlight just how far off the pace you are as the real life competitors leave you in their wake on the first lap .

Most people have a basic understanding of the importance of water conservation .
We ’re taught to turn off the faucet while brushing our teeth and not to leave the hose running for long periods of time .
However , we might not be aware of just how important conserving water is , how it impacts our lives , and how much we need it to survive .
The following is an excerpt from Water in Plain Sight by Judith Schwartz .
It has been adapted for the web .
663 million , or one in ten people in the world , lack access to clean water .
Every ninety seconds a child dies of a water - related disease , usually diarrhea from inadequate drinking water , sanitation or hygiene — death and suffering that is preventable .
Women and children collectively devote an astounding 125 million hours a day to water gathering , which can mean carrying across long distances heavy vessels of water of dubious quality on their heads or backs .
This is time that could be spent on schooling , caring for children or other relatives , and income - yielding work .
Every inch of water that runs off represents a loss of up to 150 to 200 pounds of [ food ] production per acre .
As much as 10 percent of the world ’s food is produced by overpumping groundwater .
A tomato “ costs ” about thirteen gallons of water , eight ounces of broccoli accounts for 19.5 gallons and , notoriously , an almond requires a gallon per nut .
The U.S. Geological Survey reports that California uses more water than any state , though the quantity used has been declining since 1980 .
Fully 80 percent of California ’s developed water supply is used for agriculture .
About half of all produce sold in the United States comes from California ( primarily the megafarms in the Central Valley ) , productivity that is highly dependent on irrigation .
Over 90 percent of the global heat dynamics and balance is governed by a range of water - based processes .
When soil is left bare , water evaporates , carbon oxidizes and microorganisms die .
The ground becomes a hot plate and can no longer sustain life .
Water runs off the land instead of sinking into it .
What ’s important is not the quantity of rain a given location receives , but rather how much usable or effective rainfall there is .
It does n’t really matter how much rain falls on a stretch of land , if 90 percent of the water either evaporates or streams away by the next day .

Listen to the following excerpt from the audiobook of Water in Plain Sight .
Moving Water Across the Landscape
When we hear the term water infrastructure this is what comes to mind : dams , pipes and pumps ; tunnels and funnels ; systems engineered by human ingenuity .
From copper plumbing found in the Egyptian pyramids to California ’s complex water matrix to China ’s $ 62 billion South - North Water Transfer Project ( the latter a plan originally envisioned by Mao Zedong that has already displaced 300,000 people ) , technological fixes have addressed the ongoing challenge of how to bring in water from the source , treat and clean water for use and consumption , and dispense with the foul stuff .
By ensuring ongoing supplies of usable , drinkable , nonfetid water , basic waterworks like aqueducts , drains and latrines are a hallmark of civilization — and hygiene .
Without this , a city could flourish only until some virulent , disease - causing agent hit the wells .
My elementary school class once took a field trip to a local water treatment plant .
I remember reacting with awe to the deafening factory - scale machinery and concrete vats of turbid water that we looked way down into , like some sort of roiling underworld .
This was the late 1960s , arguably the heyday of techno - optimism , or at least of a certain kind of big - works mechanical can -do .
For the longest time I went along assuming that the fate of the water that we needed to quench our thirst and wash our clothes and sprinkle our lawns was by necessity determined by big , mechanistic systems .
The natural world played an incidental role .
It was n’t until my research led me to think in terms of ecosystems that I gave much thought to how water moves from place to place — and why this has important implications for climate , poverty , politics and biodiversity .
Infrastructure is , to my ear , a cold word , and for this reason I wanted to avoid using it .
But I could n’t find another way to convey the apparatus that supports water processes , the basic undergirding or hardware that enables the system to function .
And the term does n’t have to refer solely to the built environment — infrastructure can describe natural systems as well .
What do we mean by infrastructure ?
The structure part suggests form , whereas infra comes from the Latin for “ below . ”
Which brings us once more to what lies at our feet , the soil .
The quality of soil on a piece of land may seem unrelated to water infrastructure .
However , Malin Falkenmark of the Stockholm International Water Institute has emphasized that two - thirds of all rain that falls over the continents goes into the soil .
This is in contrast to the lakes , rivers and reservoirs — those blue - colored places on the map — where we assume water will end up .
In the 1990s she coined the term green water to represent soil moisture that cycles through plants .
Blue water is the water in rivers , lakes and aquifers that may be drawn on for domestic and agricultural use .
Falkenmark and her colleagues point out that our engineered infrastructure projects , such as dams , irrigation , and water diversion programs , focus on blue water .
Despite representing two - thirds of the world ’s freshwater resources , green water has been ignored and subsequently mismanaged .
Changes that impede the presence of ground cover , notably desertification and deforestation , have a negative impact on green water .
This is significant because water held in soil is what most directly and efficiently affects a community ’s ability to grow food .
Indeed , while water planning and policy tend to focus on irrigation , most of the world ’s agriculture is rain - fed .
Water as liquid or vapor is always moving into and out of soil and plants , the atmosphere , and natural pools and byways , and so the two systems — green and blue — are interdependent .
The work on green and blue water demonstrates how crucial that thin ground layer is to our global water infrastructure , the system underlying the movement of water and the fulfillment of our water needs .
Australian soil scientist Christine Jones describes how a whole landscape approach to water management has to , paradoxically , work on the level of entire catchment areas as well as the tiny raindrop .
Any time a raindrop meets the earth , she writes , one of four things can happen .
That droplet of water can :
Go up , as evaporation ( or transpiration through plants )
Go sideways , as surface runoff
Go down , as deep drainage to be stored in aquifers
Be held in the soil before moving in one of the other three directions .
The length of time water remains in the soil where it has fallen is an important factor in the viability of a given watershed , she says .
The trouble today — she ’s speaking of Australia but this applies worldwide — is that too much water moves sideways , dragging along topsoil , organic matter and soluble nutrients and depositing it in lakes and rivers .
Because there ’s so much bare soil , thanks in part to desertification and fires and other means of undermining soil health , there ’s also too much water moving up as evaporation .
This is another way to appreciate what our two videos ( Allan Savory on Effective Rainfall ) show us .
Ray the Soil Guy gave us the water - going - sideways scenario : disturbed soil becomes compacted and loses the pore spaces that would allow water and air to flow .
Unable to infiltrate the soil , the water has no choice but to move horizontally — sideways — and thus we have runoff , and all the problems that entails .
Savory ’s two uncovered plots saw their water go up : in the course of a hot day in Zimbabwe the four - millimeter rain equivalent evaporated away .
As in the African bush and on and around North America ’s industrial farms , all around the world we have problems with water : water shortages and runoff and floods .
But maybe we can reframe our challenge as having a keeping - water - in - the - ground problem .
For this is certainly a problem we can do something about .
What we need to do is promote land management practices that enhance a part of our water infrastructure that we ’ve been treating like dirt : the ground .
The surface of the soil should n’t have to “ hurt like hell . ”

Study Finds Wind Turbines Killing Bats Without Even Hitting
Them
August 29th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
Researchers at the University of Calgary found that the vast majority of bats found dead at a wind farm in Southwest Alberta suffered severe injuries to their respiratory systems consistent with a sudden drop in air pressure – called barotrauma .
1
The findings , published in the most recent issue of the journal Current Biology could potentially have far - reaching consequences on bat populations .
Barotrauma is a condition resulting from drastic changes in air pressure occurring , for example , when the bats fly through an area where the pressure drops dramatically , such as it does near a spinning turbine blade .
Historically , less than one bat fatality per turbine per year is considered normal , according to scientists .
At this particular wind farm , the numbers were closer to 18 bats per turbine .
But researchers found that the vast majority of dead bats had no visible trauma , as if they were being struck by a blade tip moving at 250 km/hr .
Upon further examination they discovered that all of the bats had suffered from severe hemmoraging of blood and died as from their lungs filling with fluid .
The study shows that 90 % of the bats examined after death showed signs of internal hemorrhaging consistent with barotrauma .
While it ’s important to note that little is known about their population sizes , therefore , what proportion of migratory bats are being afffected by the syndrome , researchers said their deaths could have serious impacts on bat populations .
“ Slow reproductive rates can limit a population ’s ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction , ” said biologist , Prof. Robert Barclay , of the University of Calgary .
All three species of migratory bats killed by wind turbines fly at night , eating thousands of insects — including many crop pests — per day as they go .
Therefore , bat losses in Southwest Alberta could have very real effects on ecosystems as far away as Mexico and places in between .
According to co-author , PhD candidate Erin Baerwald , “ Given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds , and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites , wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue , not a bird issue . ”

History of the Super Soaker ®
Related Articles :
Written in part by LGJ .
How Ideas are Born
The year of 1989 began the water weaponry revolution .
The origin of the Super Soaker® actually dates back to 1982 when Dr. Lonnie Johnson , a nuclear engineer , first had the idea of making a high performance toy water gun .
At the time , he was employed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California as a spacecraft systems engineer on the Galileo mission to Jupiter .
As a part time inventor , it took eight ( 8 ) years before the gun was finally introduced to consumers .
In 1990 , the Power Drencher ( eventually renamed as the Super Soaker® ) was unleashed onto the water blaster market , still in its infancy .
In the interim , water gun companies such as Entertech ™ and Larami ruled the water fight scene with their advances in battery powered motorized water guns .
However , the motorized blasters did not offer much soaking power and the batteries required to keep these guns working proved to be costly .

The idea behind the Power Drencher was actually derived from some work Lonnie was doing on a heat pump that used water as opposed to freon .
He hooked up the model of the pump to his bathroom sink at his home .
" I turned around and I was shooting this thing across the bathroom into the tub and the stream of water was so powerful that the curtains were swirling in the breeze it sent out , " he said .
" I thought , ' This would make a great water gun . ' "
( Quote from a Weekend Edition interview between Lonnie Johnson and Liane .
Click here for more information . )
Unlike its motorized predecessors , Johnson developed a gun that relied on air pressure and arm pumping for pressurizing the firing chamber .
The end result was a water blaster capable of delivering more water farther and faster than any other water gun on the market .
The brand name , Super Soaker® , was introduced nation - wide in 1991 through a series of TV - advertisements .
Due to his own limited resources at the time , the cost for him to manufacture the blaster was rather steep .
It was then that Lonnie decided to seek a licensing arrangement with an existing toy company .
The first company to express interest in licensing the gun was Daisy™ , a company that is well known for its compressed air powered “ BB ” guns and pellet guns .
During the period from 1985 to 1987 , Johnson worked with Daisy to get the gun into production , however , Daisy experienced several company reorganizations during this time frame and Johnson found himself repeatedly having to restart the development effort from the beginning with a new Manager of New Products .
Although Daisy maintained strong interest in the gun , execution of the product was lacking and a licensing contract was never consummated .
Lonnie Johnson pictured with an array of his funfilled accomplishments .

In 1987 , Johnson contacted Entertech and arranged a meeting in their California office .
During that meeting Johnson presented two products , a water propelled toy airplane and a vibrating machine gun .
During the meeting , Johnson inadvertently mentioned in passing that he had a water gun that would out perform their battery - powered guns .
The president of Entertech indicated that he liked both the airplane and the machine gun and would like to enter into a contract , but added that he would only enter a deal after he had a chance to see the water gun .
Johnson proceeded to construct a new prototype and met with Entertech two ( 2 ) weeks later .
The Entertech staff was ecstatic over the water gun and could not believe how much better it performed over the battery - powered guns .
A licensing agreement was consummated and Entertech decided to market the toy airplane , Jammin Jet™ , as the initial product under the license .
With growing negative publicity associated with toy guns that looked like real guns ( See : Larami Uzi review ) , both Entertech and Larami were facing tough times with their battery - powered water gun lines .
Entertech was having severe financial problems and , in 1989 , went out of business .
Entertech never manufactured Johnson ’s water gun .
With the bankruptcy of Entertech in 1989 , Johnson was without a manufacturer again and began to make more improvements to his gun .
During the development process , Johnson designed and engineered several prototype improvements to make the gun more manufacturable .
It was during this time that he decided to incorporate a blow - molded bottle on the gun as a pressure vessel .
The standard process in the toy industry is to use injection molding toy components in two ( 2 ) halves and then glue them together .
This approach was too unreliable for use in constructing pressure vessels .
Johnson ’s use of a blow - molded bottle as a pressure vessel for the gun was the single most important innovation that made low cost , mass production of the gun possible .
In March of 1989 , Lonnie met with Myung Song , Larami ’s President , at their office in Philadelphia .
Lonnie took his new and improved water gun and shot it across the room , to which Larami ’s president exclaimed , “ WOW ” .
A contract was quickly executed and Larami assigned the project to Bruce D’Andrade to develop tooling for large - scale manufacturing .
D’Andrade configured the gun components for manufacturing using injection molded parts and added a “ pinch trigger valve ” in place of the original valve used by Johnson .
He also added ornamental details to the design .
The “ pinch trigger valve ” was used for less than three ( 3 ) years , whereafter Larami subsequently returned to the use of valves that are more like the gun that was originally designed by Johnson .
When the gun was marketed by Larami in 1990 , Johnson ’s top mounted , blow molded bottle became an icon that made this revolutionary water gun identifiable as the Super Soaker® .
( See photograph below showing Johnson ’s original prototype and the Power Drencher Super Soaker ® 50 )
The use of bottles for water containment has subsequently become a hallmark in the toy industry , with other manufacturers copying this approach for all types of water guns .

Johnson asked Larami to assume responsibility for filing patents to protect improvements to the water gun .
D’Andrade took the initiative of filing patent # 5,074,437 , known as a Pinch Trigger Pump Water Gun .
Of the eighteen ( 18 ) claims in the patent , twelve ( 12 ) of the claims , including the independent claim , are directed toward features invented by Johnson and six ( 6 ) claims are directed toward the pinch trigger mechanism incorporated by D’Andrade .
Both Bruce D'Andrade 's and Lonnie Johnson 's names appear on the patent .
( Both Lonnie Johnson and Bruce D'Andrade are acknowledged on the box for the Collector 's Edition Super Soaker ® 50 ) .
This recognition of D’Andrade is well deserved as he played an indispensable role in carrying the Super Soaker® forward into mass production .
A similar situation exists with patent number 5,150,819 , marketed as the Super Soaker® 100 .
With the overwhelming response to the Super Soaker ® 50 , Larami needed an encore and after several false starts , Larami turned to Johnson for help .
In response , Johnson developed the original working model of the Super Soaker® 100 .
In 1991 , the Super Soaker ® 100 was released , offering the first of the Super Soakers® to have a separate pressurized firing chamber .
This allowed the user to refill the primary reservoir at any time since the primary reservoir did not need to be pressurized for the blaster to shoot , because the blaster required fewer pumps in order to build up enough pressure to fire .
Super Soakers Through the Years
Note : for all the water blaster model lists , novelty and additionally - branded items are not included ( e.g. StarWars , G.I. Joe , World Wrestling Federation , etc. )
For water blaster models after 2009 , see : History of the Nerf Super Soaker
1991
While Super Soaker made its debut in 1991 , improvements to the design and other aspects of water blaster technology did not stop then .
Since its first release , numerous new developments technologies have been added to the Super Soaker brand name .
1992
In 1992 , Larami Ltd. marketed several varieties of water guns based on the pressurized reservoir and separate pressurized firing chamber models .
1993
In 1993 , one of the interesting variants was known as the Super Soaker MDS ( Multi- Directional Soaker ) , which featured a nozzle that could be pointed straight , directly left , directly right , and all angles in between .
This Super Soaker® improvement was originally brought to Larami by an independent inventor named Jeep Kuhn .
Again , D’Andrade played the key roll of carrying this design into large - scale manufacturing .
Johnson and D’Andrade worked together in continuing the Super Soaker® series .
Whereas D’Andrade was committed essentially full time to Larami , Johnson had a wider range of inventive interest .
He periodically planted seeds of invention for D’Andrade such as the pulsating mechanism that lead to Bruce ’s development of the XP ( Xtra Power ) valve .
1994
In 1994 , the first XP - rated Super Soakers ® were released .
XP used the same technology as the original series , but featured larger nozzles in order to deliver more water at a quicker rate .
The XP - generation went through various design mutations culminating in the first two ( 2 ) double - barreled ( XXP 175 and XXP 275 ) and the first triple - barreled ( XP 85 ) Super Soakers® .
Johnson ’s more complex , original pulsating valve was eventually marketed in the Super Soaker® XP 90 which shoots water bullets .
A high performance version of this design was reintroduced in spring 2003 , now known as the EES Turbine .
1995
1996
As the blasters continued to get larger and carry more water , there was no significant increase in output due to the limitations of the pressurized water system and safety concerns .
However , in 1996 , the CPS 2000 ( Constant Pressure System ) was unleashed , once again changing the face of the water war field .
Based on the Super Soaker® 100 design for pumping water from a reservoir to the pressurized firing chamber , the CPS 2000 employed a revolutionary firing chamber system which relied on the elastic properties of a rubber - like substance to pressurize the water ( U.S. Patent under Bruce D'Andrade , Patent # 6,193,107 ) .
The CPS technology allowed even more water to be unleashed at a faster rate than the XP - series could .
Unlike air pressure based blasters that tended to trickle as their pressure dropped during firing , CPS based blasters suffered virtually no change in pressure due to the nature of the elastic chamber used .
As such , virtually all of the water could be dispensed at top pressure and travel the complete firing range .
However , the CPS system was not without its faults .
Rumor has it that the CPS 2000 was removed from the market simply due to its sheer power .
Anyone who has experienced a direct blast from a CPS 2000 can tell you that the stream packs more punch than most garden hoses .
All future models based on the CPS systems appear to have been toned down in order to meet some forms of safety criteria .
Also , due to the nature of the firing chamber , several people have reported firing chamber ruptures during use , turning a power blaster into a dribbling mess .
After prolonged use , it appears that the rubber in the firing chamber can lose its elasticity and break .
Problems aside , the CPS based blasters remain top of the power and range categories .
However , firing chamber technology is not the only facet of the Super Soaker ® which has evolved over the years .
Reservoir and filling technology has also undergone many variations .
The original Super Soakers ® used screw - on bottles with tubing which sat in the bottle to allow water to be drawn from the reservoir .
However , this reservoir design had three ( 3 ) major short - comings : the O - Rings where the bottle met the blaster tended to wear down quickly , especially if the reservoir needed to be pressurized for the blaster to shoot ; the reservoir did not make full use of its contents , as there was always some water remaining due to the design of the tubing ; and the reservoir took a while to remove , fill , and then reattach .
From the original designs , Larami experimented for a while with half twist and quarter - twist on reservoirs as seen on blasters such as the XP75 , XP105 and XP150 .
The angle of the bottle opening was altered such that water drained via gravity directly into the pump intake instead of needing to be drawn in by a hose .
However , these reservoirs had problems mainly due to the tab construction .
The tabs that held the reservoir in place tended to wear quickly after multiple attachments and removals .
This proved rather frightening for users of worn down XP75s that use the pressurized reservoir method for firing .
Worn out tabs in the XP75 can result in a sudden launch of the reservoir upwards from the blaster , showering the user and launching the reservoir several feet into the air .
With some luck , no one will be hit by the reservoir when this occurs .
The half and quarter twist reservoirs still took some time to refill as well .
The user - friendly reservoir improvement was first seen with blasters like the XP250 and XXP275 .
These blasters had a simple screw - on cap to seal closed an otherwise fully weapon mounted reservoir .
This meant that only the cap needed to be removed to fill the reservoir instead of having to remove the reservoir .
However , this also made it impossible for small sinks to be used to fill the reservoir since the entire blaster would need to be positioned properly beneath the water source .
Thankfully , most water wars occur where hoses or larger taps are available , making this not such a major issue .
The capped - reservoir has become the most prevalent reservoir system currently used .
However , unlike the original designs , the caps now include a tether - anchor system to prevent the cap from wandering far from the blaster .
1997
1998
1999
In 1999 , not to be outdone by a rival company manufacturing blasters known as SpeedLoaders™ , Larami Ltd. introduced its own hose - based refill system and termed it Super Charger ™.
With the aid of the Q.F.D. ( Quick - Fill Device ) , blasters capable of Super Charging could be refilled simply by inserting the SuperCharger™ nozzle into an active Q.F.D. The Q.F.D. relies on the water pressure from the hose and it is attached to force water into the Super Charge based blaster .
Along with the SuperCharger™ technology , Larami Ltd. introduced its first pumpless blaster known as the SC Power Pak .
The Power Pak relied on an active Q.F.D. to be refilled and was basically three CPS based reservoirs mounted on the innards of a plastic backpack with a nozzle - blaster mounted at the end of the attached hose .
The blaster part had four nozzle settings and the Pak itself held a good amount of water .
Best of all , no pumping was required .
Unfortunately , without an active Q.F.D. , the SC Power Pak was basically useless .
2000
In 2000 , Larami Ltd. introduced the smaller brother of the SC Power Pak known as the SC Big Trouble .
The SC Big Trouble also has four ( 4 ) nozzle settings , but its capacity was only about half that of the SC Power Pak .
With the exception of the pumpless SC Power Pak and SC Big Trouble , all other SC enabled blasters allowed the user to choose between filling at an available Q.F.D. or by filling from a tap or hose .
This sort of flexibility makes the SC based blasters quite useful on the field .
However , the SC based blasters still appear to take second when it comes to sheer - soaking power when compared to the CPS series .
2001
2002
In 2002 , the Super Soaker brand .
introduced the Max - D series of water blasters .
While air - pressure based , these blasters feature a modified trigger and pressure chamber system based on a low - pressure head loss approach suggested by Johnson to allow these water blasters to fire farther than their predecessors .
However , 2002 also saw the disappearance of Larami Ltd. as its offices and such became merged / engulfed by Hasbro Inc. bringing into question what plans Hasbro Inc had for the Super Soaker line .
2003
In 2003 , the Max - D lineup was recoloured , having at least two varieties for each blaster , as well as expanded to include the Max - D Secret Strike .
As well , a new line was introduced known as the EES ( Electronic Enhanced Soakage ) .
The EES lineup featured soakers that have sounds and sometimes lights + motion that is activated by pulling the blaster 's trigger .
Thankfully , the electronic component is not necessary for the blaster to function as a water blaster .
As well , the electronic " enhancement " can also be turned off by toggling the switch to the off position .
2004
2004 marked a new beginning for the Super Soaker line .
Instead of just making water blasters , Hasbro was now launching the SoakerTag ( tm ) concept with a matching line of SoakerTag Super Soakers alongside .
SoakerTags , themselves , are small body target devices that , when hit with a direct stream of water , will be blasted off .
This device allows one to objectively determine whether a player is to be eliminated from a game or not as opposed to just soaking until everyone is dripping .
The SoakerTag line of blasters , themselves , employed air - pressure or piston - pressure to power their streams .
These blasters were known as the Liquidator ( air ) , the Hydroblade ( air ) , the Vaporizer ( piston ) , the Helix ( piston ) , and the Triple Aggressor ( air ) .
For small kids , Super Soaker released the Aqua Squirts line featuring small boat - shaped soakers with detachable figures atop of them .
The CPS4100 was also found still in select stores , but noticeably absent was CPS - based blasters .
2005
In 2005 , we see a continuation of the development of the SoakerTag game with the introduction of the SoakerTag Elite line .
Soaker styling appeared more back - to - business when compared to some of the models in 2002 and 2003 .
As well , the SoakerTag Elite series included new soaker designs that used CPS - technology , something that had not been seen since the release of the CPS2100 back in 2002 .
As well , a new backpack soaker , the Aquapack Devastator , was introduced to the new generation of soaker - philes .
Perhaps the most notable of the 2005 Super Soaker releases is the Flash Flood .
The Flash Flood follows in the footsteps of the Max - D Secret Strike , but uses a single CPS - chamber to power both the stream nozzle as well as the Flash Flood nozzle .
The end result is a mid-sized water blaster capable of producing either streams or a riot - type blast simple by using the appropriate trigger .
As both nozzles shared the same pressure chamber , one did not need to worry that some water could only be used for one type of attack and not the other .
2006
In 2006 , Hasbro Inc. introduced the Max - Infusion Super Soaker series .
The notable feature of Max -Infusion capable blasters is that they could have an optional backpack or hip - pack water reservoir attached to increase overall capacity .
In order to allow for the hose to attach , the Quick Fill caps were threaded in reverse and slightly enlargened to accomodate the hose connection .
While this made unscrewing reservoir caps counter - intuitive , the fact that reservoirs could be refilled without needing to remove the cap as well as allowing for the attachment of a reservoir expansion helped compensate for this perculiarity .
New in 2006 were the Max - Infusion Defender and Max -Infusion Overload .
Additionally , the Helix and Vaporizer were re-released with no internal changes , but with Max -Infusion caps .
In addition to the Max - Infusion line , Hasbro Inc. also experimented with a novelty blaster known as the Super Soaker Oozinator .
The Oozinator 's claim to fame was its ability not only to blast water , but it also had a piston - based nozzle that fired out " Bio - Ooze " , a non-toxic , slightly tinted gooey substance that would be used to " ooze " your friends .
Unfortunately , this novelty lacked usefulness in the water warfare field .
Moreover , the consistency and motions involved in using the " Bio- Ooze " nozzle ended up making the Oozinator very questionable to some .
2007
By 2007 , the Max - Infusion capability was added to basically all the new Super Soakers it would be compatible ( i.e. all new Super Soakers except for those relying on pressurized reservoirs ) .
However , the Max - Infusion line name gave way to the Aqua Shock series .
While there were a number of newer designs , the most notable and largest water blaster seen for a few years was the Hydro Blitz .
The Super Soaker Hydro Blitz is shaped akin to a real mini-gun and featured dual nozzles : one regular stream nozzle and one , large Blitz nozzle .
Unlike the Flash Flood , the Hydro Blitz large nozzle did not simply blast when selected .
Instead , the blaster 's main pressure chamber would fill a secondary firing chamber up to a critical point upon which the Blitz nozzle would then fire automatically .
The resulting blasts were staggered , pulsing as the secondary chamber would fill and empty .
The other notable different with the Hydro Blitz is its lever - based pumping action .
Due to the design of the blaster , Hasbro Inc. decided it would be better to place the pump on the top of the blaster , attaching it to a lever to allow greater force to be applied .
The pump also worked in both directions , moving water to the main pressure chamber when pushed forward or pulled back .
However , the pump volume per stroke still remained roughly equivalent to smaller water blasters .
2008
In 2008 , only two new Super Soakers appeared on the market : the Quick Blast and the Bottle Shot .
The Quick Blast features a new type of pressure - sensitive nozzle that only fires when enough pressure has built up in the small firing chamber .
While the blaster itself has no trigger , the nozzle holds water in the small pressure chamber of the blaster and only allows full pressure shots to be produced .
The result is no dribble shots from this piston - based blaster .
The Bottle Shot , on the other hand , is an odd water blaster that basically allows a user to attach a variety of water bottles onto it for use .
Apart from that , the Super Soaker line saw a number of re-released blasters , but no newer large water blasters .
2009
In 2009 , the only " new Super Soaker released was a remake / redesign of the original Super Soaker SS 50 called the Super Soaker SS 50 : 20th Anniversary Edition .
While sharing similar overal styling , the Super Soaker SS 50 : 20th Anniversary Edition features a non-removable reservoir with a screw - cap and uses an internal ball valve as the nozzle valve as opposed to the original 's pinch trigger system .
These changes make for a sturdier build and some improved performance .
Apart from the Super Soaker SS 50 : 20th Anniversary Edition , the remainder of the Super Soaker line was comprised of recolours of previous models .
Water blasters released in 2009 : Super Soaker 50 : 20th Anniversary Edition
2009 marked the END of the " Super Soaker " - some of the later years of " Nerf Super Soaker " remain for reference
Editor 's Note : In January , 2013 , I opted to split the Super Soaker Evolution Tree into two parts : the first for the Super Soaker line ; the latter for the Nerf Super Soaker line .
This split was done since , from 2010 on , Hasbro Inc. opted to tag " Nerf " in front of the Super Soaker brand name .
For more information , see : History of the Nerf Super Soaker page .
In 2010 , Hasbro Inc. opted to push the Super Soaker brand into the Nerf line .
They introduced the SoakerWars line of Nerf Super Soakers .
With designs borrowing heavily from existing Nerf guns , the Super Soaker SoakerWars line sport distinctive styling , tactical rails for mounting add - ons , and come in either Red or Blue colour schemes .
Four models were introduced in 2010 : Hydro Fury , Bottle Blitz , Rattler , and Shot Blast .
The Hydro Fury makes use of pressurized reservoir technology , the Bottle Blitz and Rattler are piston - based , while the Shot Blast uses the same pump - to - pressurize - and - shoot akin to the 2008 Super Soaker Quick Blast .
In 2011 , the Nerf Super Soaker line continued to expand with designs continuing to resemble Nerf - type guns .
While there are many compliments on the designs of these new water blasters , because of the space limitations within these more slender builds , performance and capacity are notably reduced .
One feature that two of the new models use is swappable magazines known as Clip System Canisters .
Altogether , five models were introduced for 2011 : Point Break , Scatter Blast , Thunderstorm , Tornado Strike , and Hydro Cannon .
The Point Break is the only new model to make use of air pressure while both the Scatter Blast and Tornado Strike are pump - based blasters .
The Tornado Strike features nozzles that rotate with each pump akin to the Helix ( 2006 ) .
The Thunderstorm is the first water blaster with the Super Soaker name to feature a motorized pump ; actual output , unfortunately , falls short being outperformed even by the smaller Point Break .
The Hydro Cannon is the largest of the 2011 models and features CPS - type technology , but is limited to its burst / " Flood " type large nozzle and limited reservoir capacity .
While the large nozzle definitely increases the area drenched by the blast , the Hydro Cannon 's range is limited since it cannot produce streams .
In 2012 , the Nerf Super Soaker line added a number of products to the line including the Micro Burst , Lightningstorm , and Electrostorm .
Oddly , none of the new models employed stored pressurization systems , instead relying on either pump-action ( for the Micro Burst ) or a motorized pump ( for the Lightningstorm , and Electrostorm ) .
Additionally , a number of accessory products under the Nerf Super Soaker brand , but produced by Perpetual Play Inc. appeared on store shelves later in the year .
These include the Rocket Dart , Pool Splash Mat , Battle Shield , and Assault Bunker .
The actual usefulness of these accessories for training purposes or in an actual water war remains somewhat questionable , though the concept of specialized water warfare equipment shows promise .
In 2013 , the Nerf Super Soaker line added three more piston - based blasters to the line : the Arctic Shock , Shotwave , and Switch Shot .
These three models still made use of the swappable magazines known as Clip System Canisters .
In order to improve how much water the user could potentially carry , they also introduced a swappable backpack with the same magazine interface called the X - Treme Hydro Pack .
However , none of the blasters used air pressure for stream generation .
The only non-pump- action Nerf Super Soaker released was the Flash Blast that uses a spring - loaded mechanism to push out its shot .
Unfortunately , the spring used was not particularly strong , making the Flash Blast 's shot rather poor both in range as well as in amount of water pushed .
Summary
Over the years , Johnson has remained actively involved in the creative aspects of the Super Soaker® product line .
He has put in place a full product development facility staffed with engineers and industrial designers from the Georgia Institute of Technology .
With his team , he is now able to independently follow through on his creations and carry them through to full - scale manufacturing .
He has accomplished this in the past with Nerf® guns that he has created , such as the Blastfire and Wildfire .
He has also created and tooled high performance compressed air rockets for Estes .
Lonnie Johnson is also responsible for many other developments , both toy and non -toy related .
He is pictured above with some of the items which would simply not exist were it not for his visions .
Johnson provided the creative spark and has continued to actively provide improvements for Super Soaker® ; however , the success of Super Soaker® has been a team effort .
All - in - all , the entire Larami team played indispensable roles in the Super Soaker ’s ® success .
Johnson and D’Andrade provided the stability needed for the continued development of the Super Soaker® series .
Unfortunately , Bruce D'Andrade passed away in 1998 , may he rest well .
iSoaker.com owes a good part of its own existence to the success , reliability , and performance of the Super Soaker® series of water blasters .
We would also like to thank Lonnie and Bruce for introducing the Super Soaker® to the world , and for continuously reinventing this now - classic toy through further enhancements and developments .
Closing Thoughts
In late - 2013 , it was announced that Lonnie Johnson had sued Hasbro Inc. for neglected royalty payments from 2007 to 2012 .
Also in October , 2013 , the upcoming 2014 Nerf Super Soaker line products were listed , albeit on Target 's website , perhaps the earliest that we had learned about the next year 's products .
However , the upcoming line again lacks any new pressurized water blasters with all the new products apparently being either pump-action or motorized .
Unless things change with respect to the direction Hasbro Inc. is taking the Nerf Super Soaker line , this lack of truly notable soakers signifies the end of the true " Super Soaker " .
While it was bad enough when Hasbro " Nerf " - ed the Super Soaker brand , I had held out hope for some reasonable blasters to be released .
However , in light of the upcoming 2014 Nerf Super Soaker line products were listed , I am opting to consider 2009 the true end of the History of the Super Soaker and now have a new page covering Nerf Super Soaker history .

Organizers for the Democratic National Convention and party leaders have touted the official greenness of the upcoming convention in Denver , including everything from biodiesel buses and recyclable materials to carbon counting .
But in the rush to secure everything green -— even setting up a “ hybrid - only parking lot ” at the Pepsi Center -— it seems one simple and fairly obvious LEED - certified step was overlooked : Installing bike racks .
Indeed , there will be no bikes allowed within the DNC perimeter of the Pepsi Center , nor at Invesco Field , where Barack Obama will deliver his acceptance speech , DNCC organizers confirmed this week .
Repeatedly citing the Secret Service and the Denver Police Department as making all security - related mandates , including not allowing delegates , volunteers and gathered media to park a bike within the convention perimeter , organizers said not accommodating leg - powered transportation is the exception to the rule when talking about the true greenness of the event .
“ I think it ’s important to take into consideration all of the different mechanisms available for delegates to travel around downtown during the convention , ” said DNCC spokeswoman Natalie Wyeth .
“ Thousands of our delegates will be staying at downtown hotels so they will be able to walk to the Pepsi Center or take the 16th Street shuttle bus .
A majority of our delegates will have access to the light rail as well and all of our delegates will be able to use our shuttle system to bring them to the convention and all of those buses will be run on biodiesel .
The rack lack at the Pepsi Center does n’t bode well for at least one pro-bicycle group that is planning to provide delegates , volunteers and the media free use of 1,000 bikes during the convention .
The group , Bikes Belong , partnered with Humana to bring bikes to Denver so as to be checked out at six different kiosks locations around town and will duplicate the effort in Minneapolis - St.
Paul during the Republican convention a week after the party in Denver .
“ We are disappointed the bikes will not be allowed onto the Pepsi Center ( grounds ) but we know there are security concerns , ” said Avery Stonich , marketing and communications director for Bikes Belong .
“ There will be a station across the street from the Pepsi Center , though . ”
Stonich said 1,000 bicycles will be available on loan for free to people who can supply a driver ’s license and credit card .
“ What we are hoping to do is showcase bicycling as a good option for short trips in big cities , ” Stonich said .
“ Most trips in cities are less than two miles but only 1 percent are taken on a bike .
We are hoping to influence people about the value of riding bikes and we ’re hoping that people get to experience biking , maybe for the first time , at the convention and see how easy it is . ”
The DNCC has vowed it will be the " greenest convention in history . "
Here ’s a list of greenness :
Counting carbon :
The DNCC is comprehensively calculating the carbon footprint of the convention .

West Hammered : MLS Learns from the Pros
While English cynicism used to be a cherished import in the all - too - earnest hinterland of soccer - loving North America , the bile has lost its caché in the past few years .
No more , Guardian .
Cease and desist , ‘ When Saturday Comes ’ .
Your glib asides on the American game , which may have seemed like cutting journalistic insight post 1994 , now sounds like the wet - gummed wheezings of an irate undergraduate student moaning about the mainstream music playing in a once indie - oriented pub .
The fact of the matter is thirty drunken Hammers ( mostly Americans according to some reports ) came flailing toward the supposedly ‘ hard - core ’ Columbus Crew supporters ’ section last week ; there were some scuffles , but no reports of major injuries .
Even so , North Americans are not in need of protection from police at MLS games ; to say as Barney Ronay did recently in the Guardian , that by returning punches to the surging West Ham fans , Crew supporters were somehow emulating a ‘ halcyon ’ period of English violence is absurd .
A noxious social ill is not a hipster trend no matter how many alliterative sentences you manage to spin on the topic .
Mr. Ronay goes on to write of the MLS / Premiership friendlies , “ these kind of games are usually genteel , goodwill - infused affairs . ”
He may have missed the news last year when a group of Aston Villa fans were ejected for light fisticuffs at a Toronto FC ‘ friendly ’ .
Shock horror — it seems even normally polite and unassuming Canadians will react when provoked at their home grounds , although we tend to be more known for hockey violence – the Montreal Canadiens ’ first round victory in this year ’s Stanley Cup resulted in a few blocks ’ worth of burned out cars .
Yet Ronay is actually on the money about the MLS ’ normally good - natured international friendlies .
Hell , we ’re even able to control ourselves during contentious Cup finals : this week ’s draw between Toronto FC and the Montreal Impact at BMO Field — hardly your typical soccer mom MLS crowd — resulted in little more than some halfhearted anti-Quebecois jabs lobbed at the band of away supporters who sat unprotected in the East stand .
Toronto FC had lost the chance to play in the CONCACAF Champions League to a lower division team from Quebec , English Canada ’s arch political and cultural rivals , and yet 20000 rapid TFC supporters simply picked up and went home .
It can not be denied there is a minority of idiots in the MLS who know little of football outside of watching reruns of Football Factories .
Some fans will attempt to raise a pathetic parking lot skirmish to the level of an early eighties West Ham / Millwall encounter .
Yet if Ronay and others like him put away their grab bag of wittily penned clichés about American ‘ sah - ker ’ and instead focus on what is already obvious to most continental Europeans — that drunken fans of English football with cheap tickets at a low - security stadium will sometimes ‘ act out ’ — they would realize that it ’s not MLS fans who are suffering from hooligan nostalgia .

Three - headed turtle destined not to go far

Three 's a crowd ?
TAINAN , Taiwan ( CNN & AP ) --
A villager in southern Taiwan recently discovered an unusual occupant in his pond : a three - headed turtle .
Lin Chi-fa took the turtle directly to a temple to have it blessed .
Chinese folklore regards the turtle as a sacred animal , and the priests at the temple told Lin that the three - headed turtle was a gift from God .
They said the turtle 's markings depict a complete " pa-gua " -- a diagram that plots a map of destiny -- and that it could safeguard Lin 's future .
While the three - headed turtle may have insight into Lin 's destiny , it seems to have trouble determining its own course in life .
Lin noted that the turtle walks in a zigzag pattern because the two fully - developed heads which flank a partially developed one cannot agree on which direction to take .
' China ate your lunch , Joe ' : Trump , Biden end insult - filled debate
Both candidates leveled an unending string of personal attacks on each other ’s character and judgment .

Information Clearing
House editor victim of home invasions , warnings to “ stop what he is doing on the Internet , NOW ! ”
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Thursday , August 7 , 2008
The operator of a leading alternative news and strongly anti-war website has become the target of nefarious thugs apparently in the employ of the U.S. government who have continually harassed him and ordered him to shut down his website .
Tom Feeley , owner and editor of InformationClearingHouse.info , has endured public harassment , home invasions , death threats and threats to his family simply for running a website .
Counterpunch writer Mike Whitney has circulated an e mail describing what happened to Feeley in an attempt to draw attention to the matter .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Whitney writes that earlier this week Feeley ’s wife was startled to suddenly discover three well dressed men standing in her kitchen who told her that Tom must “ Stop what he is doing on the Internet , NOW ! ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
To emphasize the point , the thug pulled back his jacket to reveal a gun while barking out the warning .
Tom ’s wife was hysterical and refuses to go back to the house .
She contacted the FBI but was told there was nothing they could do .
According to Whitney , “ The well - dressed man told Tom ’s wife that he knew where her son lived , what line of work he was in , and how many children he had . ”
Subsequently , two men in a parked car a block from Tom ’s mother ’s house were spotted using laptops and sped off when they were approached by Tom ’s son .
A similar incident had happened four years previously , when Feeley was approached by a stranger in the parking lot of Long ’s Drug store in Southern California , after being forced to remain in his car by an accomplice who blocked him from opening the car door .
The man told him , “ You need to stop what you are doing on the web ” .
Tom said the man was overweight and had his shirt untucked .
Tom was taken aback , but ( after collecting himself said ) “ What the fuck ?
Who do you think you are telling me what I can do ? ”
The man answered , “ Tom , I ’m just giving you some good advice .
You should take my advice , Tom . ”
Alex Jones has experienced similar intimidation tactics on several occasions in the past , particularly the scenario that happened to Tom in the parking lot as well as thinly veiled threats against his family .
In every single instance , the best response is to stand up and be vocal in the face of such harassment .
Mafia - like thugs only continue to feed on those who put up with such treatment .
The most dangerous thing to do is cower and acquiesce to the will of tyrants .
These kind of tactics will only succeed if the thugs think their actions can have any kind of effect .
Every time someone in our movement is intimidated or harassed , we should respond only by re-doubling and intensifying our efforts .
I ’ll tell you this about Tom Feeley ; he is no bullshitter , ” writes Whitney , “ He is the “ real deal ” and completely committed to exposing the mob that is presently running our country .
He does not understand why , ( as he says ) “ They are reaching down SO far to get someone who just runs web site ” .
But , the truth is , they are .
Someone wants him to “ shut up ” and they apparently have the muscle to do it .
He knows he is in danger . ”
Feeley is ditching his cellphone and maintaining a low profile but to his credit , refuses to cave in to the threats and will continue to publish his website .
Drawing attention to Feeley ’s situation is of paramount importance to ensure his protection and also to combat head on attempts to create a chilling atmosphere and intimidate journalists and website publishers .

Chinese police have conducted fire - arms amnesties in the past
Three Chinese reporters attending a police briefing on the success of an anti-gun campaign were accidentally shot , media reports say .
An officer picked up one of the weapons on show - a confiscated home - made gun - but it went off in his hand .
A reporter needed surgery for injuries to his ankle , crotch and chest , after being hit by what appeared to be pebbles fired by the gun .
Two others were slightly injured in the incident in Nanchong , southern China .
White smoke was rising in the room and crushed stone - like things were scattered all around
Lin
Witness
According to the Chongqing Times , the home - made gun had been designed for shooting birds .
It was demonstrated 10 minutes after a news conference giving details of a special campaign against illegal explosives and weapons .
" Journalists from 13 media outlets were led to a hall on the second floor after attending the meeting on the 12th floor , '' one woman called Lin told the newspaper .
" One officer picked up a confiscated pistol and demonstrated it to the journalists . ''
Lin said she heard a bang and saw West China City Daily reporter Su Dingwei collapse .
" White smoke was rising in the room and crushed stone - like things were scattered all around , '' she was quoted as saying .
The UK's conservative Daily Telegraph reports that Buffy The Vampire Slayer presents a clear and present danger to the Church of England ( h/t Kat ) .
[ A ] report claims more than 50,000 women a year have deserted their congregations over the past two decades because they feel the church is not relevant to their lives .
It says that instead young women are becoming attracted to the pagan religion Wicca , where females play a central role , which has grown in popularity after being featured positively in films , TV shows and books .
...
The report 's author , Dr Kristin Aune , a sociologist at the University of Derby , said : " In short , women are abandoning the church .
" Because of its focus on female empowerment , young women are attracted by Wicca , popularised by the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
" Young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church . "
Hmmm .
Opposition to single mothers , to woman clergy , to sex outside marraige , to abortion , to equal rights for women in so many ways .
What could possibly make young women " imagine " traditionalsim and hierachies in church ?
But I 'm actually quite surprised that the McCain campaign has n't had a go at Wiccans yet , maybe by suggesting that " Muslim " Obama 's wife Michelle is a secret coven - goer .
After all , McCain campaign spokesman Michael Goldfarb recently tried to tie Obama to Dungeons and Dragons players , hitting the twin themes of geeky basement - dwellers ( i.e your average Fighting Keyboarder ) and Christian evangelical horror fables about rpgs being closely tied to Satanism .
And we 're told that while no - one in America will vote for an atheist , they 're more likely to vote for an atheist than a pagan .
Give it time , I suppose .
Goldfarb can only manage so much hackery at once .
LOS ANGELES –
In a bid to regain lost ground in the fiercely competitive gaming business , Sony announced Tuesday that it will cut the price of its high - end PlayStation 3 console by $ 100 .
It also will introduce downloads of movies and TV shows to the game machine ’s online store and , with some software partners , roll out a number of exclusive games .
The moves suggested that Sony still views Microsoft as its chief rival rather than market leader Nintendo , which seems focused on extending its lead .
But , of course , that ’s not how Sony brass portrayed its announcements at a press event here at the game industry ’s E3 conference .
Sony ’s PlayStation brand in general and the PS3 in particular are “ just beginning to hit [ their ] stride , ” said Jack Tretton , CEO of the North American branch of Sony Computer Entertainment , which oversees the PlayStation products .
While Sony focused on Microsoft , Nintendo showed that its focus is still on attracting a broad audience .
The company announced a sequel to its popular – and accessible – “ Wii Sports ” game , and introduced a new title in the same vein , dubbed “ Wii Music . ”
But Nintendo also showed an eagerness to compete with its two rivals on what is arguably their turf , announcing that a new version of “ Grand Theft Auto ” is coming out for its DS handheld .
Five years ago , the “ common sense ” view was to be pessimistic about Nintendo ’s future because it had lost out to Sony in two consecutive console cycles , noted Satoru Iwata , Nintendo ’s president , at the company ’s own press event .
But the Wii and DS have launched a “ paradigm shift ” in the game business , he said .
“ In a paradigm shift , common sense does n’t seem to make as much sense any more , ” he said .
Sony announced that this fall it will cut the price of the 80 - gigabyte version of the PlayStation 3 from $ 500 to $ 400 .
At the same time , the company plans to discontinue the 40 - gigabyte version of the console , which previously sold for $ 400 .
Sony hopes the lower price will attract the “ millions of PlayStation 2 users who are on the cusp of upgrading , ” Tretton said .
Slow sales for PS3
Since its launch , the PlayStation 3 has been the most expensive console on the market , which may help explain its slow sales .
The price cut is similar to one announced by Microsoft on Sunday .
Microsoft is cutting the price of its 20 - gigabyte Xbox 360 by $ 50 to $ 299 to clear inventory and is introducing a 60 - gigabyte model at $ 349 , the former price of the 20 - gigabyte version .
But neither Sony nor Microsoft seems ready to get into a price war with Nintendo , whose Wii is not only the lowest price console at $ 249 , but also the best selling .
Sony also plans to introduce a video service that resembles one already available on its rival ’s Xbox Live service .
Through the new service , PlayStation 3 users will be able to buy or rent movies and TV shows from major studios such as Paramount , Disney , 20th Century Fox , and – of course – Sony Pictures .
PlayStation Network ’s video delivery service , which was set to launch Tuesday evening , initially will offer nearly 300 full - length movies and more than 1,200 TV episodes , many available in both standard definition and high definition .
Tretton said Sony would add to the service over time .
Microsoft , meanwhile , now has some 20,000 videos available either through its service or through its new partnership with Netflix .
Nintendo does not offer movies or TV shows through the online service for its
Wii – and has n’t announced plans to do so .
Like Microsoft , Sony also used its press event to tout upcoming games , mostly action and shooter titles .
New versions of the popular “ Resistance ” and “ God of War ” games , which are exclusive to Sony , are heading to the PlayStation 3 , Tretton said .
Microsoft announced Monday that it has a number of games coming that are either exclusive to the Xbox 360 or new to the platform after previously being exclusive to PlayStation consoles .
Nintendo , meanwhile , used its separate press event to focus on games that the company hopes will appeal to an audience broader than game enthusiasts – the same audience that has helped make the DS and the Wii the top - selling game machines .
Nintendo not done
Later this year , the company will launch “ Wii Music , ” a musical game in the mode of “ Guitar Hero ” and “ Rock Band , ” but one that can be played with the controls that come with the Wii – or with the board that comes with the Wii Fit – rather than requiring add - on accessories .
Next spring the company plans to offer a sequel to the popular “ Wii Sports ” game that comes with the console .
Dubbed “ Wii Sports Resort , ” it will come with the company ’s new Motion Plus accessory designed to give users added precision in pointing and using the Wii remote .
The company did announce one big surprise .
Take - Two plans to release a version of its mega - hit “ Grand Theft Auto ” franchise for Nintendo ’s DS handheld .
Dubbed “ Grand Theft Auto : Chinatown , ” the game will be the first version of the series on the DS and one of the first ever for a Nintendo game system .
The hedge fund manager who made $ 3.7 billion betting on the collapse of the mortgage market is apparently confident enough in financials again to start a hedge fund to " provide capital " to them ( a.k.a. , buy their stocks and / or lend them money ) .
Bloomberg :
[ John ]
Paulson aims to open the fund by December , according to two people with knowledge of the matter .
His New York - based Paulson & Co. has n't set a fund - raising target , said the people , who declined to be identified because the plans are n't complete .
Paulson was confident enough about the housing market 's collapse to bet the farm .
Having made billions betting against financials , it now appears he is reversing his position and betting on financials , though it remains unclear which and what kind of companies he 'll invest in .
Does this mean Paulson thinks that this week 's rally in financials is the real thing ?
Not necessarily .
More likely it means he wants to be ready to be the buyer / lender of last resort when banks and other financial services companies suddenly realize they need to raise capital again ( i.e. , when there 's another leg down ) .
Assuming the fund is up and running by December , his timing could be perfect again .

An innovative study examined , for the first time , if noseless bicycle saddles would be an effective intervention for alleviating deleterious health effects , erectile dysfunction and groin numbness , caused by bicycling on the traditional saddle with a protruding nose extension .
Results from this study may be useful for the estimated 5 million recreational cyclists to alleviate perineal discomfort and maintain sexual health .
Ninety bicycling police officers from 5 metropolitan regions in the U.S. ( Northwest , Southern , Desert West , Midwest , and Southeast ) using traditional saddles were evaluated prior to changing saddles and then again after 6 months of using the noseless bicycle saddle .
The findings show that use of the noseless saddle resulted in a reduction in saddle contact pressure in the perineal region .
There was a significant improvement in penile tactile sensation , and the number of men indicating they had not experienced genital numbness while cycling for the preceding 6 months rose from 27 percent to 82 percent using no -nose saddles .
Use of the noseless saddle also resulted in significant increases in erectile function as assessed by the initial evaluation , but there were no significant changes noted in Rigiscan® measures , a method used to record penile rigidity while the subject sleeps .
With few exceptions , bicycle police officers were able to effectively use no -nose saddles in their police work and 97 percent of officers completing the study continued to use the no-nose saddle afterward .
Dr. Steven Schrader of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati , first author of the study and the recent co-recipient along with his research team of a Bullard - Sherwood Research - to - Practice Award in the Interventions Category for “ Health Effects of Occupational Cycling ” stated , “ No - nose saddles are a useful intervention for bicycling police officers alleviating pressure to the groin and improving penis health .
Different saddle designs may require some re-learning of ‘ how to ride a bicycle , ’ but the health benefits to having unrestricted vascular flow to and from the penis and less penile numbness is self - evident . ”
Dr. Irwin Goldstein , Director , Sexual Medicine , Alvarado Hospital , San Diego C.A. , and editor - in - chief of The Journal of Sexual Medicine , wrote an accompanying editorial entitled “ The A , B , C’s of The Journal of Sexual Medicine : Awareness , Bicycle Seats , and Choices ” .
“ For the first time , we have a prospective study of healthy policemen riding bikes on the job , using wider , no - nose bike saddles for 6 months .
Not only did their sensation improve , their erectile function also improved .
Changing saddles changed physiology .
This is a landmark study for our field that that is important for future riders , and modification of lifestyle showing improvement without any active treatment . ”
Guantanamo Prisoner Abuse : Worse Than Iraq ? by sources
Friday May 7th , 2004 12:12 PM
" A former head of the U.S. Guantanamo Bay jail in Cuba has been sent to Iraq to ensure proper prison conditions , after photos apparently showed U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners , the military said on Friday . "
But Guantanamo is not being run more humanely than the prisons in Iraq ; there is just less media access and better restrictions to prevent soldiers from taking pictures .
The few pictures and reports that have gotten out suggest things could be far worse than in Iraq .
http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LOG056890.htm
BAGHDAD , April 30 ( Reuters ) - A former head of the U.S. Guantanamo Bay jail in Cuba has been sent to Iraq to ensure proper prison conditions , after photos apparently showed U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners , the military said on Friday .
While all decent people are horrified by the prisoner abuse that has occurred in Iraq , it would seem that not too many people are equally horrified by the human - rights abuses that are occurring in Guantanamo .
This secretive detention camp is not open to the news media , or even to any human - rights organizations .
At least in Iraq , some prisoners were released after three months when proof of their transgressions was found to be nonexistent .
In Cuba , our secretive government tells us that it has every right to detain people for an unlimited duration , because they may , or may not , be involved in terrorism .
This so - called right includes denying any representation because they are being confined on non- American soil .
Now the Army in Iraq is seeking to shift the blame to the CIA or other intelligence units or civilians hired as interrogators .
These intelligence units are no doubt the ones that are running everything in Guantanamo .

I was kicked and spat on over and over , " he said .
" Before the war . . .

United States authorities have ordered an investigation in the wake of revelations about prisoner abuse at US controlled jails in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Law Council 's president , Bob Gotterson , says if allegations that prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have been beaten and interrogated at gunpoint prove to be true , those responsible must feel the full force of US law .
In one case , Mr Gotterson says representatives of the Australian detainee David Hicks claimed a fellow prisoner had been tied to a post and fired upon with rubber bullets .
" Now it was quite easy perhaps to dismiss that as imaginative , but when one hears of the horrendous treatment of prisoners in Iraq , the consciousness becomes pricked and one starts to think well yes , maybe there is some credit or truth in the allegations that were made about Guantanamo Bay last October . "
The Law Council of Australia says an inquiry into claims of mistreatment of detainees in the American military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba is long overdue .

THE US mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners gave Australia even more reason to insist on the release of alleged terror suspect Mamdouh Habib , his lawyer said today .
Today marks two years since Habib , of Sydney , arrived at the US military base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba after being arrested in Pakistan on suspicion of being involved with a terrorist organisation .
He has not been charged despite his lengthy imprisonment .
His lawyer , Stephen Hopper , who is not permitted to speak with his client , said shocking images of US troops abusing prisoners in Iraq cast doubts on how Habib was being treated at the US base .
Also this week , the US military acknowledged two guards at Guantanamo Bay had been disciplined over allegations of prisoner abuse .
Mr Hopper said he was extremely concerned about Habib 's wellbeing , and called for an independent medical examination of his client .
" We are very concerned about his welfare , particularly since he has a pre-existing mental illness , being chronic depression , " Mr Hopper said .
" Also , in light of the recent revelations about the treatment of prisoners in Iraq , Guantanamo Bay is a place that 's not open to any scrutiny at all .
" There 's no access to detainees by lawyers , their family or media .
" Because of that lack of scrutiny , anything could happen in there . "
Mr Hopper said images had been released of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay being " chained to the floor in interrogations " .
" What happens when people are detained without any accountability or scrutiny at all is ( that ) abuses can and do happen and that 's been demonstrated in light of these prisoners in Iraq , " he said .
Mr Hopper again called on the Federal Government to urgently make strong representations to the US Government for Habib 's release .
" Enough is enough , Mr Habib should be returned to Australia and returned to his family , " he said .
Prime Minister John Howard yesterday said the shocking images of mistreatment did not raise concern about the condition of Habib and fellow Australian David Hicks , who is also being held at Guantanamo Bay .
" Well the information we have is that those people ( Hicks and Habib ) are in good health .
So the answer is no , " Mr Howard said .

The United States holds at Guantanamo about 600 non-U.S. citizens caught in what President Bush calls the global war on terrorism .
Human rights groups long have criticized the conditions under which prisoners are held at Guantanamo , and the announcement came as the United States faced withering criticism for the abuse and humiliation of prisoners at the hands of American forces in Iraq .
An Army Reserve specialist was charged with dereliction of duty and assault on a detainee following an incident in April 2003 , Shavers said .
The guard was accused of hitting a prisoner who already had been subdued .
In noncriminal punishment , the guard was reduced in rank to private , given 45 days of extra duty and reassigned to other duties , officials said .
ANOTHER GUARD PUNISHED
Another Army Reserve specialist was charged with assault in September 2002 in an incident in which the guard sought to spray a prisoner with a hose after the prisoner threw what was believed to be toilet water at the guard .
The guard was reduced in rank to private -- although that rank reduction was later reversed -- and was given seven days of restricted movement and reassigned to other duties .

Guantanamo :
To assert control and speed up the process , U.S. soldiers are using gurneys to shuttle to interrogation able - bodied as well as wounded al - Qaeda and Taliban suspects , commanders confirmed 6 Feb. , reported Miami Herald .
Commanders made the admission as news photographers documented for a second time in less than a week a curious parade through high grass around Camp X - Ray : Military Police pushing huge - wheeled stretchers along a dirt path to deliver a manacled and shackled man in an orange jumpsuit to a windowless , wooden interrogation hut .
It is two years since Habib , of Sydney , arrived at the US military base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba after being arrested in Pakistan on suspicion of being involved with a terrorist organisation .
He has not been charged despite his lengthy imprisonment .
His lawyer , Stephen Hopper , who is not permitted to speak with his client , said shocking images of US troops abusing prisoners in Iraq cast doubts on how Habib was being treated at the American base .
Also this week , the US military acknowledged two guards at Guantanamo Bay had been disciplined over allegations of prisoner abuse .
Mr Hopper said he was extremely concerned about Habib 's wellbeing , and called for an independent medical examination of his client .
" We are very concerned about his welfare , particularly since he has a pre-existing mental illness , being chronic depression , " Mr Hopper said .
" Also , in light of the recent revelations about the treatment of prisoners in Iraq , Guantanamo Bay is a place that 's not open to any scrutiny at all .
" There 's no access to detainees by lawyers , their family or media .
Because of that lack of scrutiny , anything could happen in there . "
Mr Hopper said images had been released of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay being " chained to the floor in interrogations " .
" What happens when people are detained without any accountability or scrutiny at all is ( that ) abuses can and do happen and that 's been demonstrated in light of these prisoners in Iraq , " he said .
...
Prime Minister John Howard said the shocking images of mistreatment DID NOT raise concern
about the condition of Habib and fellow Australian David Hicks , who is also being held at Guantanamo Bay .

America 's mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners gave Australia even more reason to insist on the release of alleged terror suspect Mamdouh Habib , his lawyer said .

Despite claims this week by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to be " stunned " by abuses in Abu Ghraib , and that these were an " exception " and " not a pattern or practice " , Amnesty International has presented consistent allegations of brutality and cruelty by US agents against detainees at the highest levels of the US Government , including the White House , the Department of Defense , and the State Department for the past two years .
Last July , the organization raised allegations of torture and ill - treatment of Iraqi detainees by US and Coalition forces in a memorandum to the US Government and Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) in Iraq .
The allegations included beatings , electric shocks , sleep deprivation , hooding , and prolonged forced standing and kneeling .
It received no response nor any indication from the administration or the CPA that an investigation took place .
Despite repeated requests , Amnesty International has been denied access to all US detention facilities .
" If the administration has nothing to hide , it should immediately end incommunicado detention and grant access to independent human rights monitors , including Amnesty International and the United Nations , to all detention facilities , " said Irene Khan , Secretary General of Amnesty International .
" The US administration has shown a consistent disregard for the Geneva Conventions and basic principles of law , human rights and decency .
This has created a climate in which US soldiers feel they can dehumanize and degrade prisoners with impunity .
" What we now see in Iraq is the logical consequence of the relentless pursuit of the ' war on terror ' regardless of the costs to human rights and the rules of war . "
Amnesty International has expressed concern about the mixed messages which the US government has sent regarding its commitment to international human rights standards .
Abuses have not been restricted to Abu Ghraib .
Numerous people held in the US Air Bases in Bagram and Kandahar in Afghanistan say they were subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment in US custody , and the administration has failed to comply with the Geneva Conventions with regard to the Guantánamo detainees .
Former Guantánamo detainee Wazir Mohammad told Amnesty International of excessive and cruel use of shackles and handcuffs , sleep deprivation , and of being forced to crawl on his knees from his cell to the interrogation room during his detention in Afghanistan .
At Bagram and Kandahar , he was held incommunicado , with no opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of his detention , no lawyer , and no access to his family .
He never met a delegate from the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) .
In over a year in Guantánamo he says he met an ICRC delegate once , on the first day .
Former Guantánamo prisoner , Walid al - Qadasi , was held in a secret detention facility in Kabul .
He said prisoners termed the first night of interrogation by US agents " the black night " .
He said that : " They cut our clothes with scissors , left us naked and took photos of us ... handcuffed our hands behind our backs , blindfolded us and started interrogating us ... threatened me with death , accusing me of belonging to al - Qa'ida . "
He alleged that detainees were subjected to sleep deprivation , including through use of loud music .
An individual who worked in Guantánamo told Amnesty International that most if not all detainees he had contact with there claimed to have been physically abused in Kandahar or Bagram .
This person expressed no surprise at the evidence from Iraq , and stated that abuse in Afghanistan appeared to be part of softening up detainees for interrogation and detention .
Amnesty International is concerned that the investigation headed by Major General Antonio Taguba , which found " systematic and illegal abuse of detainees " in Abu Ghraib , was not intended for public release , and that the administration 's current response only came once the report and photographic evidence became public .

As investigators probe the abuse of Iraqi prisoners in U.S. custody , many observers say Sept. 11 changed how the United States thinks about the use of torture during coercive interrogations of suspects .
Experts say U.S. officials have allowed suspect tactics to creep into interrogations , although the rules officially governing them stayed the same .

While aimed at breaking the prisoners , the techniques developed by the psychologists are designed to skirt the Geneva Conventions and U.N. prohibitions of torture , they said .
Typical examples are sleep deprivation , allegedly used at the U.S. detention facility at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and forcing captives to stand still for extended periods , said Gerald Gray , founder of the Center for Survivors of Torture in San Jose .

Graphic images depicting abuse and humiliation of Iraqi captives at the hands of American forces will likely focus attention on the role of psychologists advising the military on interrogation techniques , experts following the controversy said .

Viewing recent events and deciphering the conceptual underpinnings of Israeli and US military actions in the West Bank , Gaza , Falluja , and Abu Ghraib prison , as well as Guantanamo , it is hard not to conclude that US and Israeli decision makers view themselves as " ubermenschen , " ultra-humans , while casting Arabs and Muslims in the complementary , contrasting role of semi - or quasi - human creatures whose rights , dignity , lives , health , future , wealth , security we can steal , break or violate at will without any compunctions .
We can even have a good laugh while violating others -- and the laws meant to protect us all .

The gay and lesbian couples who packed a Hollywood auditorium last week had come seeking information about California ’s new marriage policies .
But they also got some unsolicited advice .
Be aware .
Images from gay weddings , said Lorri L. Jean , chief executive of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center , could be used by opponents in a campaign designed to persuade California voters that gays and lesbians should not have the right to marry .
Those getting married , she cautioned , should never lose sight of what they might be supplying to the other side .
Sitting close to his husband - to - be in the audience , hairstylist Kendall Hamilton nodded and said he knew just what she meant .
No “ guys showing up in gowns , ” he said .

“ It ’s a weird subject , ” added Hamilton , 39 , who plans to wed his partner of five years , Ray Paolantonio .
“ We want everybody to be free , but the image does matter .
. . .
They are going to try to make us look like freaks . ”
The first legal same - sex marriages in California were performed Monday night , and thousands more gay couples are expected to flood into clerks ’ offices in the coming weeks to obtain marriage licenses .
It ’s all happening with both sides keenly aware that in less than five months , voters will decide whether to amend the state Constitution to define marriage as being between a man and a woman only .
With that in mind , proponents are trying hard to manage what kinds of same - sex marriage images Californians see during this year ’s so - called Summer of Love .
Opponents maintain that Californians ’ views have not changed substantially since 2000 , when more than 60 % of voters cast ballots against same - sex marriage .
They predict that the spectacle of men marrying men and women marrying women will anger voters and spur them to support the anti-same - sex marriage amendment .

“ The more that homosexual activists wave their hijacked marriage licenses in people ’s faces , the more people will say , ‘ This is n’t right .
. . .
What can I do about this ? ’ ” said Randy Thomasson , the founder of the Campaign for Children and Families .
Proponents predict just the opposite will happen , that when voters witness the love and commitment involved in the marriages , they will be won over and wo n’t vote to disallow them .
Strategists cite polls showing that in 2004 , after Massachusetts allowed gay marriage , people who saw the weddings became more supportive .
“ All you had to do was just see it , and it was very difficult to then walk away and say , ‘ That is not a wonderful thing , ’ ” said Eric Jay , an advisor to San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom .
“ It ’s the power of marriage . ”

That said , both sides know that the images of some partnerships may be more palatable than others .
“ One of the things that have hurt the gay effort in California is the exhibitionism in San Francisco , ” which does n’t always play well elsewhere , said political analyst Tony Quinn .
During the campaign for Proposition 22 , the successful 2000 initiative that defined marriage as between a man and a woman , Quinn said many Californians were appalled by images of groups like the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence , a group of gay male activists who dressed up like nuns .
With the initiative looming , proponents of same - sex marriage now are taking care to emphasize mainstream unions .

By design , San Francisco ’s first wedding , officiated by Newsom , was of octogenarian lesbians Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon , who have been together for more than half a century .
They also were the first couple married by Newsom four years ago during the so - called Winter of Love , when San Francisco defied state law and began marrying same - sex couples .
Those marriages were later invalidated , setting the stage for the legal confrontation that resulted in the Supreme Court decision allowing gay marriage .
The Martin - Lyon wedding on Monday , like other ceremonies held before today ’s official launch of same - sex marriage , was strictly orchestrated .
Martin and Lyon were married in a private ceremony in Newsom ’s City Hall office , with only two news agencies -- the Associated Press and the hometown San Francisco Chronicle -- allowed to attend .
Many of the other early weddings in the state were also of long - term couples who could have been selected by central casting to appear both nonthreatening and mainstream .
In many cases , news releases were issued and the media invited .
In Los Angeles , the first wedding at 5:01 p.m. Monday involved Robin Tyler , 66 , and Diane Olson , 54 .
Today , George Takei , 72 , who played Hikaru Sulu on “ Star Trek , ” will get a marriage license with his partner of 21 years , Brad Altman .
San Diego ’s first wedding will be between Bob Lehman , a former Marine who served a combat tour in the Persian Gulf , and his partner of 15 years , Tom Felkner .

One of Sacramento ’s first weddings will feature a former member of the Assembly , Dennis Mangers , and his partner of 17 years , Michael Sestak .
“ One of the things about the gay and lesbian community is we ’re known for our outrageousness , our flamboyance , ” said West Hollywood City Councilman John Duran , who is president of the board of directors of Equality California , an organization pushing for same - sex marriage .
“ But we ’re under this incredible political pressure not to have those portrayals ” right now .
Keeping celebrations tame may be tough , he said .
“ It ’s a micro - manager ’s nightmare .
There ’s no way to control everything .
All we can do is remind people that it is really important . ”
Political analysts said the anti-same - sex marriage side also needs to manage its image by downplaying its fringe elements .
Advertisement
“ Whatever side becomes divisive about this , it is to their detriment , ” said political consultant Rob Stutzman , who managed the winning 2000 gay marriage initiative .
“ These campaigns should be seeking to run their messaging as mainstream as possible . ”
In that vein , Jeff Flint , a spokesman and strategist for the campaign to amend the Constitution , said the campaign would not focus on individual marriages , but on the broader idea that marriage should be defined as only between a man and a woman .
“ We do n’t need to complicate it with other peripheral issues like what is going to happen [ this ] week , ” he said .

Times staff writers Tony Perry , Carla Hall and John Glionna contributed to this report .
CNBC 's Diana Olick is writing Freddie ’s Forecast Seems A Little Too Bright .
Freddie Mac CEO , Richard Syron , warned of the troubled times in housing , even revised his forecast for home price drops , peak to trough , from 15 percent to 18 - 20 percent .
He said we ’re only halfway through the correction .
But then one of his underlings went on to assure everyone that Freddie Mac ( FRE ) would be able to withstand $ 40 billion worth of credit pain through 2009 ( if it finishes raising that $ 5.5 billion it promised ) .
He also talked about how they may reverse some of the previously estimated losses as the portfolio does better than expected .
Freddie , in the second quarter , wrote down the value of its subprime and Alt - A portfolio by $ 1 billion .
Freddie is claiming that they can hold these securities to maturity and not have to take a loss , because over time , the dire predictions of defaults on these loans just wo n’t come to pass .
Freddie ’s subprime and Alt - A portfolio is about $ 130 billion .
Think of that .
Just $ 1 billion in writedowns .
I think Armando Falcon , a former head of OFHEO , said it best when I interviewed him yesterday :
" They 've only written them down by let 's say five or 6 % total over the past few quarters .
If those were sold on the market they would get maybe 50 cents on the dollar for these securities .
At some point they can't delay the inevitable about having to mark these assets down to their true market value .
They are now holding them close to book value , based on the theory that these are temporary impairments .
As the market continues to decline into next year , it will be clear that these are n't just temporary impairments .
Then the government will not be able to allow this forbearance on recognizing losses much longer . "
Freddie CEO Makes Preposterous Claim
Freddie Mac ( FRE ) posted a loss of $ 821 million for the second quarter , slashed its quarterly dividend and promised investors that it would raise at least $ 5.5 billion in new capital , the institution said Wednesday .
It 's the fourth quarterly loss in a row for the company , a government - sponsored entity designed to buy mortgages on the secondary market from lenders .
The magnitude of the loss , five times worse than what Freddie reported for the first quarter of 2008 , stems from the general rise in home foreclosures compounded by the decline in securities made up of subprime mortgages .
The collapse of subprime - backed securities has already forced the world 's biggest banks to write off more than $ 200 billion over the past 12 months .
" We are confident the actions we are taking are strengthening Freddie Mac 's financial and competitive position as well as its ability to serve the American homebuyer and will generate value well into the future , " said CEO Richard Syron in a statement .
But critics contend that Syron 's not doing enough .
Freddie 's share price continues to drop — down 18 % at $ 6.57 in late afternoon trading — eroding its capital base .
Syron says he does n't want to raise more capital now , which would dilute the holdings of current shareholders .
Freddie Mac Alt - A Delinquencies
The Big Bailout
With the Senate 's passage of the Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac bailout Saturday ( July 26 ) , the United States of America has now become the world 's first full - service kleptocracy , a form of government described earlier in this space as a government of , by , and for the robbers .
We are supposed to pretend to believe that the Senate , so great was its anxiety over the nation 's economically distressed homeowners , met in a rare Saturday session for the sole purpose of administering the balm of Gilead on hardworking families who confront the bleak prospect of foreclosure .
When the Senate sacrifices so much as a minute of its down time , it does so not to relieve our burdens , but to add to them in the interest of their fellow parasites .
Gross Says Treasury Will Rescue Fannie , Freddie
Bill Gross , who manages the world 's biggest bond fund , said the U.S.
Treasury will probably be forced to buy as much as $ 30 billion of preferred shares in both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help shore up their capital .
" By the end of the third quarter , the preferred stock in Fannie and Freddie will be issued , the Treasury will have bought it , " Gross , co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co. , said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television .
" We 'll be on our way toward a joint Treasury - agency combination . "
My Translation
Freddie Chief Executive Officer Richard Syron today told investors the company will wait for its stock to improve before starting its planned $ 5.5 billion capital raising .
Freddie agreed in May to raise the capital but failed to complete a sale as its stock slumped as much as 80 percent .
My Comment
" I have enormous respect for Bill Gross , " Syron , 64 , said today in an interview with CNBC .
" I think he's an extraordinarily talented manager , particularly on the fixed income side .
But based on the information I have now , I do not believe that the Treasury will end up having to inject money into Freddie Mac . "
My Comment
" This report significantly shortens the timeline for Treasury intervention , " said Ajay Rajadhyaksha , the head of fixed - income research for Barclays Capital in New York .
With the value of Freddie 's outstanding stock now at $ 4.3 billion , Rajadhyaksha said , " I do n't see how they can raise capital by themselves without a capital infusion from Treasury . "

RELIGION has always played an important role in American politics .
But a new survey by the Pew Research Center suggests that a narrow majority of Americans now think that churches and other religious organisations should keep quiet when it comes to social and political matters .
Most notable is the sharp increase since 2004 in Republicans who believe that churches should keep out of politics .
This shift in opinion may represent frustration and disillusionment among social conservatives rather than a genuine desire for a political system free of religious influence .

It 's a good think I chose Comcast 's oligopoly service for broadband internet service and not AT&T ( my two easy choices for real broadband ) .
That 's because I tend to point out that our government is becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T .

Failure to observe the guidelines set forth in this AUP may result in AT&T taking actions anywhere from a warning to a suspension of privileges or termination of your Service (s ) .
When feasible , AT&T may provide you with notice of an AUP violation , via Email or otherwise , and demand that such violation be immediately corrected .
AT&T reserves the right , however , to act immediately and without notice to suspend or terminate Service (s ) in response to a court order or other legal requirement that certain conduct be stopped or when AT&T determines , in its sole discretion , that the conduct may ( 1 ) expose AT&T to sanctions , prosecution or civil action , ( 2 ) cause harm to or interfere with the integrity or normal operations of AT&T's network (s ) or facilities , ( 3 ) materially or repeatedly interfere with another person 's use of AT&T's Service (s ) or the Internet ( 4 ) damage or disparage the reputation of AT&T or its Service (s ) , or ( 5 ) otherwise present a risk of harm to AT&T or AT&T 's customers , employees , officers , directors , or agents .

You are prohibited from engaging in any other activity , illegal or not , that AT&T determines in its sole discretion , to be harmful to its subscribers , operations , network (s ) , reputation , goodwill , or customer relations .
This telecommunications thing is really heading to a really nice place , where we can't use the Toobz to discuss how the Toobz are being used to watch over what we do and say .
But I guess we should have anticipated that .

Canada 's refugee board has been ordered to take another look at an American deserter 's failed bid for asylum in an unprecedented court ruling that could affect scores of other U.S. soldiers who have refused to fight in Iraq .
In Friday 's decision , which came as Americans celebrated Independence Day , the Federal Court found the Immigration and Refugee Board made mistakes in turning down Joshua Key 's claim for asylum .
" It 's quite a statement , " Key , 30 , told The Canadian Press from his home in Saskatchewan .
" It makes us feel good – probably everybody within this whole process . "
A married father of four , Key served as a combat engineer for eight months in Iraq 2003 .
He said American soldiers committed savage acts against civilians and routinely killed innocent people .
While the board deemed him credible , it nixed his claim for refugee status on the grounds he was not required to systematically commit war crimes even if he had to violate the Geneva Conventions .
Federal Court Justice Robert Barnes disagreed with that analysis .
" Officially condoned military misconduct falling well short of a war crime may support a claim to refugee protection , " Barnes wrote .
Military action that " systematically degrades , abuses or humiliates " either combatants or non-combatants could provide such support , he said .
Lee Zaslofsky , of the War Resisters Support Campaign , was ecstatic on learning of Friday 's ruling .
" Oh my God , that 's wonderful , " said Zaslofsky , who came to Canada from the U.S. in the 1970s to avoid the Vietnam War draft .
" Oh wow .
Oh wow .
That 's big .
That affects all cases . "
Key , a native of Oklahoma , fled to Canada after deserting during a leave in November 2003 .
Punishing him for following his conscience would be unjust , he said .
" You 're treated unfairly just for not wanting to go kill innocent people . "
In turning down several similar asylum claims , the refugee board has consistently held that the United States is a democracy , which affords deserters due judicial process .
However , the court said the board should hear evidence on whether deserters can rely on the American government to treat them fairly .
" State protection has been a very prominent issue that we have felt has just simply not been given the kind of attention it requires , " Zaslofsky said .
" It does n't appear feasible for people like Joshua Key and the other war resisters to rely on state protection that people would normally be able to rely on – even in a democracy like the United States . "
Key 's lawyer , Jeffry House , said the ruling expands a soldier 's right to refuse military service .
" It 's a huge victory for numerous soldiers who are here and maybe others who are thinking of coming here , " House said .
New Democrat politician Olivia Chow called on Prime Minister Stephen Harper to rethink his government 's policy of excluding American war dodgers .
" Rather than wasting time and money for people to go through that whole refugee process , the Federal Court has spoken out loud and clear , " Chow said .
Parliament , she noted , has also passed a resolution calling for deserters to be allowed to stay in Canada .

The resolution also urges a stay of deportation proceedings against soldiers such as Corey Glass , who is due to be removed from Canada next week .

The Washington Post :
Think you 're worried about the economy ?
Phillip Swagel is a wreck .
The assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy , Swagel came out for his monthly economic briefing yesterday , 90 minutes after the Labor Department reported that the country had shed jobs in June for the sixth straight month .
It was a hopeless spin assignment -- but Swagel , the administration 's sacrificial lamb for the day , had to try .
And so Swagel , bookish and bespectacled , entered the Treasury Department 's briefing room with evident trepidation .
He nodded and offered smiles every which way .
His heavy breathing , picked up by the microphone , could be heard in the back of the room .
Read on ...
The first time I watched this video I honestly thought it was a spoof .
I know public speaking is n't easy , and if I had to stand in front of reporters and tell them that the country lost 62,000 jobs last month and there 's no end to the plummeting economy in sight , I might be a little nervous too .
The fear and anxiety on Swagel 's face and in his voice is difficult to watch .
I wonder what Bill O'Reilly 's body language expert would have to say about this performance ?
Swagel looked whipped and out of answers , just like his boss , George .

Posted Tuesday , June 17 , 2008 1:00 am
Tuesday , June 17
Last week , Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , again introduced 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush .
They were referred to the House Judiciary Committee , where no action is likely to be taken .
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich. , strongly supported the impeachment of President Bush three years ago .
In an interview with Harpers magazine in 2005 , Conyers was asked why impeachment was important .
" To take away the excuse that we did n't know , " Conyers said at the time .
" So that two or four or 10 years from now , if somebody should ask , ' Where were you , Conyers , and where was the United States Congress ? ' when the Bush administration declared the Constitution inoperative and revoked the license of parliamentary government , none of the company now present can plead ignorance or temporary insanity , can say that ' somehow it escaped our notice ' that the President was setting himself up as a supreme leader exempt from the rule of law . "

In 2005 , when the Republican Party was crowing about a permanent shift in American politics that meant conservatives would control government for decades to come , Conyers was in the minority .
He could n't get any one to pay attention to the offenses committed by the Bush administration .

But then came the Downing Street Memos , which revealed how the Iraq war was sold under false pretenses .
And then came Hurricane Katrina , and the nation watched how the Bush administration left New Orleans to die .
And the weight of the accumulated lies by the administration grew heavier and heavier .
Taken together , all this was how the Democrats took control of Congress in the 2006 elections .
Yet one of the first acts of Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , when she became Speaker of the House , was to declare that impeachment " was off the table . "
The evidence continues to accumulate of the lies that were told to justify an invasion of Iraq , of the war crimes and constitutional abuses committed in the course of the so - called war on terror , of the subversion of the Constitution by the Bush administration in so many different ways .
Article Continues After Advertisement
Yet Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic leadership in Congress want no part of impeachment .
They still think impeachment is a distraction .
They still think it is unnecessary , and could hurt the party 's chances in November .
They still think that it 's better to run out the clock and let the Bush administration slink out of town .
We disagree .
What Conyers said in 2005 , when he was powerless to act upon his words , still holds true today , when he finally has the power to start the impeachment process .
This is about history , the historical record and ensuring the truth is known .
This is about putting the blame of this nation 's worst foreign policy disaster solely on the shoulders of the president who created it .
This is about letting future presidents know that the rule of law still means something and that the Constitution applies to everyone .
This is not about vindictiveness and partisan politics .
The acts committed by the Bush administration rise to the level of " high crimes and misdemeanors " that our founders said justifies the impeachment of public officials .
And if the Democrats refuse to act upon the articles of impeachment , they are no better than the administration in upholding their oaths of office .
They are co-conspirators , and history will not judge them kindly for putting politics above the Constitution .
I ’m a big fan of California .
I ’m almost as far from the state as I could be , here in Vermont , but I usually wholeheartedly agree with the environmental and public health decisions made by the California legislature to protect their citizens .
The ban on phthalates for one .
The chemical and toxin labeling law ( hence all those “ May Cause Cancer in the State of California ” labels you see all over cheap goods from China ) .
And the higher fuel efficiency standards , which have considerably reduced smog .
Then , they were poised to ban BPA ( bisphenol A and PFOA ( a chemical in food wrapping ) .
No dice .
What happened ?
In a close vote , the California legisture voted not to ban BPA and PFOA .
The FDA has long defended the use of BPA in plastics , citing studies done by the manufacturers of the chemical and the products that contain it .
Again , they defended their stance about in the New York Times last week .
Here is a breakdown of the studies done all over the world that share a much different view of BPA then the FDA states .
The timing of the FDA ’s announcement is also suspect , coming only days before California ’s vote on a BPA ban .
Renee Sharp , Senior Analyst with the Environmental Working Group said ( on Yuba.net ) :
“ The timing of the announcement by FDA raises eyebrows considering the California legislature is about to vote on a measure to remove the toxic chemical from some children ’s products .
BPA has been linked to altered brain development , behavioral changes and prostate problems in animals and should not be used in any consumer products that could potentially leach into food and liquids , especially in products young children use every single day .
We have long since lost faith in FDA ’s ability to be an impartial authority on BPA ’s safety .
Time and again , FDA has sided with special interests instead of the public interest on this chemical . ”
Canada , Europe , and several other states ( most recently Maine ) are taking , or considering taking , a more thoughtful , precautionary approach regarding chemicals in everyday products , especially for children .
Maybe BPA is n’t that harmful by itself .
But what about when it is added to our children ’s everyday chemical load ?
There are so many ways their little bodies can come into contact with potentially damaging chemicals , from their toothpastes , shampoos , food , frying pans , shower curtains — there has to be some looking at the cumulative effects versus thinking of each chemical in a vacuum .
In education , we like to think about educating the whole child , taking different learning styles , personalities and backgrounds into consideration .
Why , then , should we just consider the effect of this chemical or that on the human body ?
Have n’t we learned that all things are connected , in nature and in chemistry ?
If you live in California , you can take action to support a more comprehensive approach to toxic chemicals that the legislature is considering .
This seems like a similar bill that was just passed in Maine , giving the state more power to test , regulate and manage chemicals used in products .

The Obama campaign has seized on an answer that John McCain gave at the Saddleback Forum on Saturday defining the line between middle class and rich as income over $ 5 million a year .
Here is the exchange between McCain and Warren from Ben Smith ’s Blog :
WARREN : Everybody talks about , you know , taxing the rich , but not the poor , the middle class .
At what point , give me a number , give me a specific number .
Where do you move from middle class to rich ? [… ]
Advertisements
MCCAIN : How about $ 5 million ?
No , but seriously , I do n’t think you can , I do n’t think seriously that the point is I ’m trying to make , seriously , and I ’m sure that comment will be distorted but the point is …that we want to keep people ’s taxes low , and increase revenues . …
So , it does n’t matter really what my definition of rich is because I do n’t want to raise anybody ’s taxes .
I really do n’t .
McCain was joking , but he did dodge the question completely .
That was a through non-answer .
Barack Obama said today in New Mexico that he thought maybe McCain was joking , but by McCain ’s definition a person making $ 3 million is middle class .
Obama said that McCain ’s skewed idea of wealth is reflected in his policies .
Why is McCain afraid to define his idea of middle class ?
Is it because he has chosen , much like President Bush has , to ignore the working people of this country .
John McCain has been living the rich life for so long that he does n’t know , or even worse , does n’t care about the middle class .
It is the spending of the middle and lower classes that keeps this economy going .
We have had eight years of trickledown economics under George W. Bush , with the same results we experienced under Reagan .
The rich got richer , and the poor and middle class got squeezed .
This is what John McCain is offering America more of .
I am not in favor of overtaxing , but it is time for those who make the most to pay their fair share .
They have been getting richer off the backs of the rest of us for eight years , and now it is time to return the favor .
How can anyone trust a candidate who is afraid to speak directly to those who are hurting most in this economy ?
John McCain only sees the world of wealth that he lives in .
The rest of us do n’t exist , and I , for one , am tired of being invisible .
メーリングリストにも少々書かせてもらいました
が、こちらにも書き留めておきます。
経緯から説明しますと、現状、フランスにおいてはコンピュータにあらかじめインストールされているソフトウェア、特にWindowsについて、使用をしないので返品したとしても、メーカは返金に応じる必要はありません。
実際、私たちの会社ではWindowsを返品して、ラベルをひっぺがすということを頻繁に行ってきましたが、それに対してライセンス料を返還してもらったことはありません。
先日、フランス政府のウェブサイトにおいて、
Ordinateurs et systèmes d’exploitation : Luc Chatel veut la fin de la vente liée という記事を公開されました。 この記事で、 消費・観光担当副大臣 （Secrétaire d’Etat chargé de la Consommation et du Tourisme）のリュック・シャテル氏 （Luc Chatel）が、 コンピュータ販売の際、プリインストール済みのソフトウェアの価格を表示し、消費者が返金を受けられるようにすべきであるという意見を表明しました。 方法としては、アクセスコードを入力しなければ使えないようにし、 アクセスコードを得るためにはそのライセンスの価格の支払いに同意しなければならないものとする、と提案しています。
それに応じて、私たちの会社はプレスリリースを公表し、
ZDNet Franceで採り上げられています。 アイデアとしては、 GRUB 2 を拡張して、 アクセスコードの入力インターフェースを作成し、 ハードディスク上の暗号化されたデータを復号化するというものです。 この方法を用いれ ば
、BIOS やWindowsなどを改変する必要はありませんし、 GRUBはフリーソフトウェアですから、 余計なライセンス購入も発生せず、 仕組みはすべて公開されます。
私たちの考えとしては、 いくら政府が良い方針を打ち立てたところで、 それがライセンス料を取り立てることができなくなるベンダに頼るような方法では、 なかなか現実化はしそうにもないということです。 ですから、不利になる側に依存するようなやり方ではなく、 中立的な方法論が必要になると考えました 。
私見を言わせてもらえれば、現在のWindows、その他のソフトウェアを強制購入させられるようなやり方はアンフェアです。
どう考えても特定ソフトウェアがなければ意味を成さないハードウェアならともかく、PCのような汎用コンピュータにおいて、特定ソフトウェアをバンドルされるというのは、明らかに抱き合わせ販売と呼ばれるものでしょう。
そういうソフトウェアを本当に使う人が支払わなければならないことについては、私は決して否定しません。
ソフトウェアの対価を設けることは全く悪いことではありません。
しかし、全く使う気もないし、実際使わないものに支払いを強制されるというのは、とてもおかしいことだと感じます。
それはまるで、住んでもいない人から住民税を取り立てるようなものです（もちろん、地方自治体はそんなことはやってません）。
当然、メーカやベンダにも言い分はあるでしょう。
典型的には、インストールしたものとそうでないものを用意するのはコストがかかるということです。
そして、インストールしたものの方が売れるのであれば、そちらを優先せざるを得ないというわけです。 それはその通りです。
しかしながら、暗号化技術の発展のおかげで、
そうした問題は技術的解決が図れるところに到達しているのです。
もはや、残りの理由付けは、そのための開発コストが必要になるということでしょうが、
GRUBというフリーソフトウェアによってコストの増大は防ぐことができますし、
そのための開発は私たちがもうやっているというわけです。
残念ながら、販売を行う人の多少の手間暇はどうしても必須になりますから、インセンティブを与えるのは簡単ではありません。
そうすると、やはり政府の介入は避けがたいと言わざるを得ません。
しかし、消費者の利益を守るのも政府の重要な機能の一つであることを考えると、ここは政府に頑張ってもらうしかないんじゃないでしょうか。
この話はあくまでフランスの話ではありますが、
おそらく他の国にも大なり小なり影響を与えることになりそうです。
私としてはとても喜ばしいことです。
In March 2005 , then - CIA director Porter Goss told the Senate " there are no techniques ... that are being employed that are in any way against the law or would ... be considered torture . "
When Senator John McCain asked him about waterboarding , Goss would say only that is was " an area of what I will call professional interrogation techniques . "
We now know that the CIA destroyed videotaped evidence of the torture of terrorist suspect Abu Zubaydah , despite the fact there were ongoing federal court cases where the tapes might have been relevant as evidence and the 9/11 Commission had requested such evidence .
The Congress must aggressively investigate this issue to discover whether or not criminal activity was being covered up and justice obstructed .
An Iran -Contra - style select committee must be formed with members of the House and Senate to hold serious hearings and begin a thorough investigation .
This inquiry cannot be left to the Intelligence Committees because their members -- security hawks all -- have been severely compromised by their past condoning of torture in CIA interrogations .
Only an entirely new committee , which Congress has the power to form in an instant , can begin to find out for the American people what was happening behind closed doors and whether or not heads should roll at Langley for obstruction of justice .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
In a rare Saturday session , the U.S. Senate voted against moving forward with legislation that would boost funding for a federal program that helps low - income families pay their cooling and heating bills .
The legislation would nearly double money for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program , commonly known as LIHEAP , to $ 5.1 billion .
“ At a time when the cost of home heating fuels and electricity are soaring , and when the economy is in a decline , millions of Americans are finding it harder and harder to stay warm in the winter or cool in the summer , ” said independent Sen.
Bernie Sanders of Vermont , who sponsored the legislation .
Low - income families spend on average about 15 percent of their income on home energy bills , compared with 3.4 percent for all other households .
Senators voted 50 - 35 to limit debate on the bill , but fell short of the 60 votes needed to move to final passage .
The White House threatened to veto the bill on grounds LIHEAP operates mostly in the winter and the heating season is over .
It said a contingency fund held $ 100 million to cover emergencies through the September 30 end of the fiscal year .

Escalating global demand for fuel , food and wood fiber will destroy the world ’s forests .
Unless efforts to address climate change and poverty empower the billion - plus forest - dependent poor .
This according to two reports released today by the Rights and Resources Initiative .
The first study finds that world will need a minimum 2 million square miles by 2030 to grow food , bioenergy , and wood products .
This is almost twice the amount of land actually available — roughly two - thirds the size of the continental US .
The second study reports that developing - country governments still claim an overwhelming majority of forests .
They ’ve made only limited progress in recognizing local land rights .
Consequently , great violence lies ahead , as some of the world ’s poorest peoples struggle to hold on to their only asset — millions of square miles of valuable and vulnerable forestlands .
“ Arguably , we are on the verge of a last great global land grab , ” says Andy White , Coordinator of RRI and co-author of the first report .
“ Unless steps are taken , traditional forest owners , and the forests themselves , will be the big losers .
It will mean more deforestation , more conflict , more carbon emissions , more climate change and less prosperity for everyone . ”
The second study notes some progress .
In 2002 , 22 % of developing - country forests were owned by communities or were public forest used by communities .
That figure increased to 27 % by early 2008 .
Twelve out of the top 30 forest nations put into place policies that strengthen community rights , leading in many cases to new market opportunities for local people , and providing the means to influence decision makers in the powerful worlds of conservation , industry and politics .
The authors warn that in most regions governments retain a firm grip on most of forests .
Meanwhile , industrial claims on forests are increasing sharply , largely for biofuels production :
• In Brazil , 108,000 square miles are currently under cultivation for soy and sugarcane .
By 2020 , these plantations are expected to cover up to 495,000 square miles .
• In Indonesia , 26,000 square miles of land are dedicated to oil palm plantations .
By 2025 , these will spread up to 100,000 square miles .
• In China , biofuel cultivation alone is expected to require an additional 51,000 square miles by 2020 .
“ It is clear from the research that the dual crises of fuel and food are attracting significant new investments and great land speculation , ” White said .
“ Our studies have shown that we will protect the forests themselves by recognizing the rights of the people with the most to lose if they are destroyed . ”

The web is an increasingly chatty place .
Between following comment threads , checking in with friends on Twitter , reading a few blogs with RSS feeds , and conquering a mountain of e-mail , we have plenty of conversations to keep track of .
Mozilla wants to help us on the conversational journey , which is why the company has launched Snowl , a new tool that offers a small glimmer of hope for those seeking communications nirvana .
Announced on the Mozilla Labs blog , the company presents Snowl with a simple question : " Could the web browser help you follow and participate in online discussions ? "
Snowl has materialized as a prototype Firefox extension based on a few key ideas :
It does n’t matter where messages originate .
They 're alike , whether they come from traditional e-mail servers , RSS / Atom feeds , web discussion forums , social networks , or other sources .
Some messages are more important than others , and the best interface for actively reading important messages is different from the best one for casually browsing unimportant ones .
A search - based interface for message retrieval is more powerful and easier to use than one that makes you organize your messages first to find them later .
Browser functionality for navigating web content , like tabs , bookmarks , and history , also works well for navigating messages .
For its debut , Snowl only supports RSS / Atom feeds and Twitter messaging , and it offers two UIs for reading .
The first is a traditional three - pane setup where feeds and Twitter users are organized in a left sidebar , with a message list above the center column and a preview / reading pane below .
The second reading UI employs the " river of news " concept ( which Dave Winer is credited for ) where new items are listed one after the other in multiple columns .
For now , there is n't much to go on in Snowl .
We realize that it was introduced on Mozilla Labs for a reason , but as it stands , Snowl is a stripped - down RSS extension that feels like a straightjacket , especially when it comes to Twitter .
There 's no way to post to Twitter or reply to tweets from friends , which is arguably the most valuable aspect of the service .
A number of basic UI problems also caused some head scratching in the Ars Orbiting HQ , such as a lack of any menu item called " Snowl " — the two reading panes mentioned appear inconspicuously under the View menu as " Message List " and " River of Messages . "
Adding more confusion , some Twitter users that we follow automatically get their own entry in the Snowl Message List sidebar , but we can't figure out why .
Last on our list is the fact that , when viewing either the " All " list which , aggregates all RSS and Twitter entries , or the " River of Messages " view , which does the same thing , there is no clear way to tell what source each entry comes from .
Snowl attributes entries to the author name for sites with more than one writer , so news items appear next to Twitter messages without so much as a favicon to distinguish them .
Early UI and design issues aside , Mozilla is probably on to something here .
Snowl 's announcement post talks up some intriguing features that are on their way , and as usual , the company is very open to feedback to help shape Snowl 's development direction .
Mozilla is working on support for more messaging protocols and services , an interface for writing and posting messages , and an API to let developers add their own enhancements .
Mozilla also talks about differences in interfaces for reading important messages , versus " casually browsing unimportant ones . "
One of the next frontiers in managing our communication is the automated prioritization of messages to save time and improve the quality of our conversations .
If Mozilla can crack that nut with Snowl , it could easily have another big hit on its hands .
Back in the 1960s , America declared a war on poverty .
The government funneled millions into " community development " programs , recruited neighborhood enablers , financed jobs programs , and then , by the 1970s , realizing that poverty was the most tenacious of adversaries , pretty much gave up the effort .
By the time the Reagan administration came around , it was widely assumed that poor people were poor because they wanted to be poor .
Greed was in .
About five years ago , a callow young man from northern Florida decided he did n't believe that .
He wanted to do something about poverty himself .
With just the glimmer of an idea , Aaron Jackson traveled to Haiti's Port - au - Prince , hooked up with some like - minded Haitians , and established a home for street kids , which he subsequently financed with his earnings as a golf caddy .
A simple , preposterous idea that , crazily enough , worked .
Since then , Jackson , a rangy , shaggy - haired 26 - year - old who seems to embody , without the rhetorical flourishes , all the selfless idealism of the 1960s and Bobby Kennedy ( " I dream things that never were and I say , ' Why not ? ' " ) , has brought his magic touch to other nations .
His organization , Planting Peace , now sponsors , among others , a homeless shelter in Guatemala , a home for teenaged prostitutes in Ecuador , and a home for children with AIDS in Port - au - Prince 's gritty Cité de Soleil ( see www.plantingpeace.org).
He has also almost single - handedly dewormed much of Haiti , where thousands of children die from malnourishment every year , largely because of digestive parasites .
How does Jackson do it ?
It 's the polar opposite of the federal approach , with its block grants and Frankenstein bureaucracy .
Jackson has quit his caddy job , of course , and Planting Peace now gets contributions from churches and synagogues .
But the emphasis is still on " small scale , sustainable projects . "
Jackson recently went to Cambodia and , predictably , left the seeds of a program behind .
" I 've always been interested in Southeast Asia , " Jackson says .
" I wanted to possibly open up a home for children involved in the sex trade there .
So I went there to see , you know , what was up .
We originally wanted to fly straight into Cambodia , but it was $ 3,000 cheaper per ticket to fly into Thailand and just bus it over the border to the capital , Phnom Penh .
One of the cities along the way — about three days on the bus from Thailand — is Sihanoukville , a beautiful coastal city that has a lot of tourism .
" It was just me and this guy I went to high school with , Matthew Chambliss .
He was on the golf team with me , but , like , we had n't spoken at all since high school .
He heard about some of the things I was doing and asked if he could help out .
I told him I was thinking about going to Cambodia , and he said he was in .
" So the first day we 're in Sihanoukville , we check into the hotel and Matt 's hanging out in the room .
I decide I 'm going to go out and get some lunch .
As soon as I get to a place , I like to figure out what the deal is .
I like to get into the underground and talk to people .
This woman serving me lunch started telling me about — she called them ' tree people ' — people who live under the trees .
This town is covered with beach chairs , and there are people who come sit by the ocean .
These people were living under trees !
I had to meet them immediately .
" I tried to do this hand - talking thing I do , where I try to communicate , trying to figure out , you know , what their deal is .
Finally , a kid walked over and translated for me .
I just started asking , ' Is there anything I can do to help you ? '
" Most of them were amputees , hurt by land mines .
Cambodia has a huge land mine problem .
People lose limbs all the time .
These people were homeless and basically had their children go out to the beaches and beg the tourists for money for food .
But this is monsoon season , and there are no tourists .
" Another kid came over to see what was going on — there was a big group gathered around by now to see this random American here asking all these questions .
This kid said his family had a house with eight rooms , basically an eight - bedroom hotel , they would rent for one dollar per room for each day .
" So it worked out beautifully .
Within one hour of talking to them , all these tree people had housing .
I cut a check for the entire year ; it came to something like $ 2,900 .
That included $ 50 extra , like a tip for making it happen so fast .
" And these people , they needed food , case management — the kids need school , which is free in Cambodia , but there 's no agency to make sure they go .
We decided to start a shelter right there .
Matt said he'd stay there and run it for a while .
" We 're giving the amputees jobs .
A lot of them only have one arm , but they can still pick up trash and work in reforestation there .
If they can't work , we 'll give them a little bit of money .
One man had legs literally as thin as my thumbs all the way up and down .
He had polio as a kid .
He dragged himself around , that 's the only way he could move .
He asked for money to see a doctor .
You know how much he needed to see the Cambodian doctor ?
Five bucks .
" This is the fastest Planting Peace has ever gotten a shelter up and running , but that 's just how I like to do things .
I do n't like to wait for red tape or try to raise money , then do it .
I just like to go there and start doing things , and it works out .
" These people , they told me tourists pass there every day .
Nobody ever just thought to ask , ' Is there anything I can do to help you ? ' "

Hear that giant sucking sound ?
That 's the sound of Nova Southeastern University swallowing the Museum of Art / Fort Lauderdale .
The two tax - exempt entities painted the shift last month as a " merger . "
But upon further prodding from Tailpipe , NSU President Ray Ferrero said that henceforth , the museum 's finances will be reported as those of a Nova " division " in the school 's annual report .
At a news conference to announce the deal , the white - haired Ferrero , dressed in a dapper seersucker suit , assured reporters that the museum 's financials will still be " very transparent . "
As a condition of being tax - exempt , of course , nonprofit entities are obligated to make their annual tax returns available for public viewing .
The average joe can view most such documents at websites like www.guidestar.org.
But the latest report available on Guidestar for the museum covers the 12 months leading up to July 2006 , whereas Nova is current only through July 2005 .
Transparency ?
What exactly does the museum get out of a formal alliance with Nova ?
For starters , storage space .
At present , three out of every ten artworks from the museum 's 6,000 - piece permanent collection already reside at Nova 's enormous Davie campus .
The museum 's executive director , Irvin Lippman , is also hopeful that Nova art teachers will eventually curate projects at the Las Olas digs .
That is , once Nova actually has a visual arts program .
Nova 's Farquhar College plans to start offering bachelor 's programs in both art and art administration this fall .
Lippman denied that the " merger " was motivated by financial need , saying the museum has been in the black since 2003 .
Still , Nova dwarfs the museum in financial and fundraising muscle .
For the 2005 - 06 school year , NSU posted $ 469 million in revenue versus just $ 7.5 million in sales for the museum .
And , no , the museum did n't bother negotiating with public universities like FAU or BCC , both of which have downtown campuses adjacent to the museum .
But , hey , it 's all good .

Or maybe the sucking sound was a huge chunk of the Broward County budget flaking off , like a calving iceberg , to satisfy a liability suit .
This goes back to March 13 , 1998 .
Christopher Thieman was late for work at the Broward Sheriff 's Office .
He stepped on it .
He was doing 70 in a 45 - mph zone when his cruiser smashed into Eric Brody 's car , which was making a left turn at the intersection of Oakland Park Boulevard and 117th Lane in Sunrise .
The 18 - year - old Brody , a high school student who'd hoped to become a DJ , was in a coma for six months and was left with severe incapacitating brain damage .
On December 1 , 2005 , a jury awarded Brody $ 30.6 million in damages .
In a news release at the time , lawyers for Brody called it " the largest Florida jury verdict in memory penalizing a government agency . "
BSO appealed , arguing that during the trial , Brody 's attorneys had inappropriately summarized witness testimony and presented it on poster boards for jurors to take with them into the deliberation room .
But the District Court of Appeals affirmed the verdict in November 2007 , deeming the poster boards harmless .
BSO pursued its beef to the Florida Supreme Court .
Two weeks ago , the Robed Ones decided it would not reconsider the case — so the award to Brody stands .
But those millions are still elusive .
There 's a measure in place to protect taxpayers ' money — it 's called sovereign immunity , and it caps payments at $ 200,000 in cases like these in which the government has been found at fault .
For victims to get any more than that , the state legislature must pass a claims bill waiving sovereign immunity and authorizing paying out the dough .
In this case , BSO has claims insurance , so the money should come from the insurance company , not county coffers .
That may make state legislators more likely to pass the bill next session .
Meanwhile , the spirited Brody , who is now an FAU student but severely speech - impaired and in need of long - term care , waits and waits some more — in his wheelchair .
Lance Block , one of Brody 's many attorneys , who have worked on the case for a decade without seeing a dime , thinks it 's about time the case came to a close : " It 's been ten years of BSO B.S. "
Bless This Ground
On a recent sun-kissed Sunday , gospel glitterati gathered from near and far to bless the ground in Lauderhill where a long - awaited gospel complex is to be built .
There was Black Entertainment Television gospel star Bobby Jones , decked out in a lime - green pinstriped suit .
And Albertina Walker , sitting in a wheelchair but looking sublimely regal in a white suit ( living up to her moniker as " The Queen of Gospel " ) .
Both Jones and Walker are on the board of the complex .
Broward politicos , black and white , turned out for the event , as did local black preachers like Pastor Mack King Carter , who prayed in his deliciously gravelly voice for the ground where the $ 60 - million complex should be completed in 2010 to be made holy .
Even Betty Osceola , of the Seminole tribe , made the journey to request , in her native tongue , that Jesus bless the crowd and the gospel complex .
Those are some tough acts to follow .
Yet five teenaged sisters from Boynton Beach provided the most inspirational display of all .
The Mays girls , ages 13 to 18 , have been " ministering " through interpretive dance since 2000 ; they started out rehearsing in the family den ( their parents are Pastor Anthony and Carla Mays of the Boynton - based Restoration House Empowerment Ministries International ) and soon were touring with gospel greats as the Chenaniah Praise Dancers .
So twirling for a few hundred people from a portable stage plunked in a field should have been no sweat , right ?
Clad in sparkly purple , black , and silver robes — ooh , and white gloves ! — the young ladies breezed onto the stage .
They'd be dancing to " I Believe I Can Fly , " sung to a recording by gospel goddess Yolanda Adams ( not R&B bad boy R. Kelly , who won a Grammy for his rendition of the same tune , which he wrote ) .
The group 's choreographer , 17 - year - old Ashanti , was lip - synching her heart out while her sisters flapped their arms in unison like birds in flight when , suddenly , there was complete silence — the music cut off .
These gals did n't miss a beat .
They kept on , in perfect coordination , executing the moves they had memorized .
It was n't the first time music has disappeared during one of their live performances , Ashanti said afterward .
That Sunday , though , a friend would come to the rescue .
Eighties R&B hitmaker Shirley Murdock stepped out from behind a red velvet rope where she was sitting with other gospel bigwigs and walked calmly to the stage .
The imposing Murdock , of Dayton , Ohio , had performed before with the girls , and her " spirit just leaped " watching the awkward , music - less moment .
She thought : " My babies ! " Murdock grabbed a microphone and belted the last few lines of the tune , in pitch - perfect a cappella .
" Come on , girls , do your thing , " she beckoned .
And the Mays sisters did .
The crowd stood .
They clapped .
They whooped .
For they had just witnessed a moment of almost miraculous stage improvisation , a trope of music and dance that somehow exceeded its own conception .
With average temperatures of minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit , an almost nonexistent atmosphere and a complex web of cracks in a layer of ice encompassing the entire surface , the environment on Jupiter ’s moon Europa is about as alien as they come .
So are the enormous forces behind the surface display , namely an ocean beneath the ice nine times deeper than Earth ’s deepest ocean trench and gravitational affects from a planet 318 times the mass of Earth .
For nearly a decade , it has been Simon Kattenhorn ’s passion to understand the amazing surface features on Europa and how they are formed .
And supported by new grants from NASA , his research may provide clues to one of Mankind ’s biggest questions — is there life outside of Earth ?
Kattenhorn — an associate professor of geology at the University of Idaho — delights in dissecting the beautiful and complex web of cracks , faults and ridges on the surface of Jupiter ’s fourth largest moon .
The first of his two recent grants totaling $ 358,000 will allow him to study the most recent geological features on the highest resolution photos NASA has to offer of Europa .
These subtle cracks will reveal if there is any current geological activity on the distant moon , which would also be the best place to look for signs of life .
“ In order to really get at the issue , ‘ Is there life out there ? ’ , we have to know the best place to look , ” said Kattenhorn , who is also currently authoring a chapter for a book on the moon .
“ And in the case of Europa , the best place to look is where cracks on its icy surface are active today . ”
But finding signs for current geological activity is no easy task .
Kattenhorn can tell a lot about fractures because they form very specific patterns that allow him to unravel their relative ages .
His goal in this project is to find the youngest fractures and compare them to the tidal forces that Europa would be experiencing today to see if the features and recent forces match up .

Although there is some debate over how thick Europa ’s outer shell of ice is — some say over 20 miles and some claim only a few — it is generally agreed that it covers an ocean more than 60 miles deep .
This means that although Europa is only about the size of our moon , it has more water than Earth .
As the moon orbits Jupiter , it gets closer and further from the giant planet , changing the amount of gravitational pull it experiences .
The result is that the moon is constantly being squeezed and released like a balloon full of water , which causes cracks and fissures , raising the question of the possibility of geysers , like the ones recently spotted on Saturn ’s moon Enceladus .
Recent photos from the Cassini spacecraft passing by Enceladus revealed stunning plumes of water - ice jetting out into space .
The discovery sent a flurry of excitement and activity through the academic community , including Kattenhorn , whose second recent NASA grant will allow him to apply what he ’s learned from Europa to studies on Enceladus .
The discovery also led to a renewed vigor to study and explore Europa in order to find out if similar , active processes might be occurring today .
“ This research feeds that need that I have as a geologist and as a person to be the explorer , to be the adventurer , to see things that no one else has seen before and figure out things that no one else has figured out before , ” said Kattenhorn of his research into the two moons .
“ And out in the solar system is a great place to do that , because there are some things — like the plumes on Enceladus — that we really are seeing for the very first time . ”
Only a few decades ago , nobody would have believed any form of life could exist on or in an icy moon like Europa .
But recent discoveries of amazingly adaptive bacteria in some of Earth ’s harshest environments have led to the speculation that it is possible .
advertisement
“ Europa has the potential for something very similar to hydrothermal systems we have here in our oceans , ” said Susan Childers , head of the geomicrobiology research team at the University of Idaho , who studies life in extreme environments .
“ Very ancient organisms that thrive on oxidized metals could potentially be centered on one of these oases formed by heat and metals seeping from cracks in the ocean floor . ”
The search for extraterrestrial life has long guided NASA ’s choices in mission planning .
Currently , NASA is in the process of choosing its next flagship mission ; the most ambitious , long - term programs that often provide the most data .
The choices include sending a satellite to explore Saturn ’s moon Titan , Europa or the entire Jupiter system , meaning there is a two in three chance the next major mission will include Europa .
This makes research detailing where to look — or maybe even land with a probe — that much more important .
But even if further exploration of Europa was n’t a possibility , Kattenhorn would still be eager to study the fascinating moon .
“ We do n’t walk around on Earth with our eyes closed .
We want to know what ’s going on ; why things happen , ” said Kattenhorn .
“ It ’s like Galileo looking through his telescope all those centuries ago and going , ‘ Gosh !
What ’s out there ? ’
It ’s that same spirit of exploration and I just get a real kick out of that . ”

One of the most fundamental requirements of a civil society is the rule of law which means that the people must follow the law of the land irrespective of his or her status or position in the society .
In the modern world , the developed countries feel proud that their society is governed by the rule of law while most developing countries like India feel ashamed that their society does not have the rule of law .
The developed countries are the role model for the underdeveloped countries , where the rule of law is still a distant dream .
Societies that follow rule of law are often considered more civilized as there is much more order in the society .
Every thing in such societies appears to be in order .
The roads are clean , lawns and parks are well - maintained , government officials work in office , trains and public transports run on time .
Further , there is virtually no corruption in public offices .
People are well paid , deliver better efficiencies and keep everything neat and clean .
These societies appear perfect to the people of other parts of the world , who often wonder why they ca n’t be like them .
All societies need laws for their existence .
Even though the laws may be different in each society , yet there are some basic principles that are common to all laws of the world .
These fundamental principles are equality , fraternity , justice and liberty .
The Indian constitution , for example , incorporates these goals in the preamble to the constitution which seeks to secure for all its citizens justice , liberty , equality and to promote among them the spirit of fraternity .
These principles are so universal in nature that they find place in every civilized society of the world .
It is matter of great surprise that in reality the outcome of the rule of law is just the opposite .
The more civilized a society is , the more is the inequality among its population – more injustice to the have - nots , less liberty due to strict enforcement of law and more hatred among the citizens based on race , caste and religion .
What goes wrong in the implementation in the so - called rule of law ?
Law of Nature
Indian thinkers in the Vedic period , i.e. around 3000 years before the birth of Christ , discovered that the universe does not perform its functions at random but follows certain laws .
These were called “ Rita ” or the universal laws or principles that guided the universe .
The progress of man can be largely attributed in understanding these basic principles of nature and exploiting them for the benefit of the human race at the cost of the rest of the creations .
The laws of man , therefore , run contrary to the laws of nature as they are human - centric and not designed for all the creations of God or Nature .
One of the basic differences between man-made - laws and the laws of Nature is that the laws of nature are spontaneous as they require no effort in implementation .
For example , in a natural piece of earth like a forest , the earth produces trees , plants , fruits and vegetables spontaneously without any need of watering or breeding .
The nature itself provides timely rain and fertilizer to the new plants .
The forests and the mountains are covered with greenery and beauty , which is purely natural since it comes without any effort .
On the contrary , the man -made creations like parks , trees , plants are artificially made .
They too may look as beautiful as the natural ones , yet they cannot survive without regular effort on the part of man .
Imagine a park , which is not maintained for a few months , or a house not cleaned for months .
It will lose all its beauty and soon be filled with dust and weeds .
No building or modern gadget can survive without external effort from man .
However , all natural creations are able to survive on their own and maintain their existence ; and enjoy their life without any external support .
The laws of nature are just as they treat every specie ( and not only man ) with equality .
In a jungle , every specie gets its due share of food , air and water which enable them to live a dignified life without being dependent on any other creation .
Nature makes no distinction between one specie , and the other as all species are the children of the same God .
However , in the man ’s world , every other creature is killed if it is not useful for man .
They can survive only if they can be useful for man .
Thus man ’s world does not treat any other creature of the nature with respect and does not provide them any right of equality , liberty , justice or fraternity .
He cleverly usurps this universal law and makes it applicable only for human beings .
For all other lesser species , he has created a man - made - law , calling it ‘ the law of jungle ’ or ‘ the survival of the fittest ’ which justifies his domination over the weak creations .
The fact , on the contrary , is that the laws of jungle are far more just and equal for all species than the man -made - law .
Most men are not concerned about the way they treat the lesser animals as they feel that ‘ the survival of the fittest ’ theory is more logical than the laws of nature .
However , they forget that every principle created in the universe has to be applied on them also and that they may not always be a beneficiary .
Man -made - laws do not stop with animals but they soon spread their wings to encompass human beings , too .
This is where conflicts between man and man starts that gives rise to hatred and wars .
Man feels the pinch when the law of jungle is applied against them and the law of nature is denied to him .
He is hurt when he is treated like weeds by the society .
Weeds : The Undesirable Plants of Nature ?
One of the most interesting creations of the natural world is weed .
Weeds are undesirable vegetation in the kingdom of plants .
Weeds are defined as any plant that is not valued by the human society and usually tends to overgrow or compete with valued flora .
Weeds are the plants which are considered by human beings as unattractive , undesirable , or troublesome .
In the natural world , man has to continuously fight against weeds to make their artificial plants survive .
Weeds grow automatically and if the artificial gardens do not have the support of man , it is soon overpowered by weeds and the whole field or garden becomes full of weeds .
Weeds are created by Nature ( God ) as no human effort is required to grow them .
They are , however , so powerful that man has to continuously guard his creation from these weeds , lest all creation of the civilized society is destroyed .
Weeds are as undesirable to man in the world of plants as criminals in the human society .
Criminals : The Necessary Evil for the Civil Society
Similar to weeds in the natural world , there is a growth of criminals in civilized societies .
Who these criminals are ?
Why do they grow ?
Whether the criminals are healthy people or are they mentally ill as often thought by the civilized world ?
Criminals are defined as the people who commit crime .
Crime is defined as an act that is a violation of the criminal law that is punishable by law .
Crime is usually considered an evil act and criminals are often seen as evil created by Devil , out there to destroy the civilized citizens , the children of God .
There are many similarities between criminals and weeds .
Criminals grow automatically in every society and the society has to work hard to weed out these criminals .
Criminals like weeds are so powerful and competitive that they have the power to defeat the civilized people .
They are , therefore , fought jointly by the society .
Yet in every society , there is crime and there are criminals .
We are used to look criminals as evil that is unnecessary just like weeds .
Yet if God ( Nature ) is the creator of all , then everything in this world must have been created with a purpose .
“ What could be the purpose of creation of criminals ? ” We wonder .
Criminals are , as a matter of fact , creation of the civilized world .
In an uncivilized world , there would be no law , so there can be no violation of law and hence , no criminal .
If we wish to understand the utility of criminals in the civilized world , we must imagine the world of nature without weeds .
In such a world , all plants will have to be grown by man with artificial watering – canals , tube - wells , and other irrigation systems used for agriculture .
In all certainty , man will grow only such crops and plants that are useful to man and the rest of the species would surely not survive in the man ’s world .
Further , man ’s energy is limited and with all his effort , he can hardly take care of a minuscule part of the world by artificial plantation , so the rest of the physical world would be without plants and so without oxygen and other animal life and Eco-system .
This will soon lead to the end of the world including the human being .
The role of criminals is similar to the role of the weeds .
Imagine a world without crime i.e. everyone follows the law of the land without questioning .
It will only provide status quo in the world .
Kings will always be kings and only their children or loved ones can become kings .
Poor will always be poor .
Kings will frame more inhuman laws that would give them more powers .
The less fortunate people would die out of hunger and poverty as they wo n’t break the law and the state will have no obligation to feed them .
Thus the world without criminals would be a place where people will die due to inaction , boredom and cruelty .
Such an ideal world , indeed , would be the most inhuman and most undesirable to mankind .
Thankfully , people called criminals automatically grow in every civil society as soon as man creates laws to govern it .
The laws of man are always challenged by them since they are mostly against the laws of nature i.e. equality , justice , liberty and fraternity .
States always have to face opposition from such people who break the law and are known as criminals .
They may have an ugly appearance as weeds but they only provide oxygen to the society for its life .
Thus in posterity , people recognize them not as criminals but as heroes .
The Path of Heroism
While man hates criminals , he worships the heroes .
He can lay his most valuable possession i.e. his life on a single call from his hero .
Who are these heroes ?
Are they law - abiding civilized people or the law - defying criminals ?
Take the example of Mahatma Gandhi in the modern world .
He was perhaps the biggest criminal in the time of the British rule in India and he was jailed many times on charges of being waging war against the state .
He spent more than 15 years in jail for his various crimes .
Yet the people of India call him ‘ Father of the Nation ’ and love him more than any civilized person on the earth .
Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in jail , yet he is a national hero not only for South Africa but for the entire world .
In history , we can find numerous examples of great people who have broken the law and having been punished for their criminal acts .
The list includes people like Christ , Prophet Mohammad , Socrates and Galileo .
Yet it is these people who changed the history of the world and they are rightly worshiped as heroes by the masses even after their death .
How many people you have ever known who have become heroes without breaking the law and committing crimes in their time ?
Perhaps none .
Heroes are created not by following the law but by breaking the law .
Rule of Divine Law
It is not always good to follow the law blindly as it provides order and rule of law in the society but kills the humanity as the implementation of most of the man -made laws are against the natural laws .
Man -made laws are often disguised under the cover of natural laws like equality , justice , liberty and fraternity yet they serve just the opposite purpose .
Most people see the letter of the law but fail to grasp its spirit .
One must understand that breaking man-made laws is one of the fundamental requirements of all civil societies , if it contradicts the natural or divine laws .
Thus every person who breaks the law need not be a criminal .
One must go deeper into the facts before declaring a law - breaker to be a criminal .
The key distinction perhaps would be to see if he is breaking the law for the interest of the humanity or for his own selfish end .
Is it need - based or greed - based ?
There lies the distinction between good and evil , between a true criminal and a hero .
One who is breaking a law for others or to fight injustice is a hero and not a criminal .
A poet said “ Jo lade din ke khet , Sura toi ” ( One who fights for the weak is the real hero ) .
Jewish World Review July 23 , 2008 / 20 Tamuz 5768 Bankrupt exploiters , Part II By Thomas Sowell
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
We do n't look to arsonists to help put out fires but we do look to politicians to help solve financial crises that they played a major role in creating .
How did the government help create the current financial mess ?
Let me count the ways .
In addition to federal laws that pressure lenders to lend to people they would not otherwise lend to , and in places where they would otherwise not invest , state and local governments have in various parts of the country so severely restricted building as to lead to skyrocketing housing prices , which in turn have led many people to resort to " creative financing " in order to buy these artificially more expensive homes .
Meanwhile , the Federal Reserve System brought interest rates down to such low levels that " creative financing " with interest - only mortgage loans enabled people to buy houses that they could not otherwise afford .
But there is no free lunch .
Interest - only loans do not continue indefinitely .
After a few years , such mortgage loans typically require the borrower to begin paying back some of the principal , which means that the monthly mortgage payments will begin to rise .

Since everyone knew that the Federal Reserve System 's extremely low interest rates were not going to last forever , much " creative financing " also involved adjustable - rate mortgages , where the interest charged by the lender would rise when interest rates in the economy as a whole rose .
In the housing market , a difference of a couple of percentage points in the interest rate can make a big difference in the monthly mortgage payment .
For someone who buys a house costing half a million dollars  which can be a very small house in many parts of coastal California  the difference between paying 4 percent and 6 percent interest would amount to more than $ 7,000 a year .
For people who have had to stretch to the limit to buy a house , an increase of $ 7,000 a year in their mortgage payments can be enough to push them over the edge financially .
In other words , government laws and policies at federal , state and local levels have had the net effect of putting both borrowers and lenders way out on a limb .
Yet , when that limb began to crack , the first reaction in politics and in the media has been to look to government to solve this problem because as always  it was called the market 's fault , the lenders ' fault and everybody 's fault except those politicians who created this dicey situation in the first place .
Markets often get blamed for conveying a reality that was not created by the market .
For example , the fact that " the poor pay more " for what they buy in stores in low - income neighborhoods is often blamed on those who run these stores , rather than on those who create extra costs through crime , vandalism and riots .
If the store owners were making big profits , the big chain stores would be rushing in to share in the bonanza , instead of avoiding low - income neighborhoods like the plague .
Markets were also blamed for the Great Depression of the 1930s and New Deal politicians were credited with getting us out of it .
But increasing numbers of economists and historians have concluded that it was government intervention which prolonged the Great Depression beyond that of other depressions where the government did nothing .
The stock market crash of 1987 was at least as big as the stock market crash in 1929 .
But , instead of being followed by a Great Depression , the 1987 crash was followed by 20 years of economic growth , with low inflation and low unemployment .
The Reagan administration did nothing in 1987 , despite outrage in the media at the government 's failure to live up to its responsibility , as seen in liberal quarters .
But nothing was apparently what needed to be done , so that markets could adjust .
The last thing politicians can do in an election year is nothing .
So we can look for all sorts of " solutions " by politicians of both parties .
Like most political solutions , these are likely to make matters worse .

Pear pie .
Pear ginger muffins .
Pear cordials made from aging pears , sugar and vodka .
Pears canned in sugar syrup .
Pear jam .
When Mary calls me every year at the end of August with her annual message of “ The tree is ripe – come pick , ” I turn into the Bubba Gump of pears , gratefully using the four bushels of pears I harvest off her abundant backyard tree .
As the country whines about escalating food prices , there ’s often rotten apples falling from some tree near you .
Or pears , plums – name your fruit .
You know the tree I ’m talking about – the one you pass by every day in someone ’s yard that is practically falling over with ripe fruit and you think to yourself , “ Someone needs to do something with that . ”
How true – and that “ someone ” is you .
Talk about a sustainable homerun :
By connecting with and harvesting a local fruit tree , you not only garner more organic , fresh , local fruit booty than you know what to do with – and put something to use that would otherwise have gone to waste .
You build community by connecting with others .
We ’re talking community at its core , most sustainable essence , sharing abundance with others , relishing the gifts of the land .
Step up to the plate – or bushel – and tap into these unwanted fruit on trees in backyards across the nation that could be making the world a better place through more pie – or jam or cobblers or muffins – you get the picture .
Here are three tips for foraging a fruit tree near you :
1. Approach
Find a tree and ask permission to pick the fruit .
As most of these trees tend to be in backyards , traverse the alleyways to discover that rambling apple tree with branches drooping heavy with fruit over the yard fence .
Seniors make great fruit tree adoption candidates as they typically appreciate the opportunity of such bounty , but are past the life stage of climbing ladders and trees .
Do n’t be surprised if you get a reaction like , “ Oh I ’ve been waiting for you ” from an area senior , thrilled to find an appreciative fruit picker .
Post a flyer at the local senior center for more potential harvest opportunities .
Remember these connections , particularly with seniors , go beyond produce exchange .
With many seniors either shut -ins or living alone , your company and conversation goes a long way in making their day .
Be sure to come prepared with empty buckets and bags for the fruit .
Empty coolers work well , too , for hauling home the harvest .
Do n’t fall discouraged if your picking request receives a negative or hesitant “ well , maybe you can take a few ” reply .
An unfortunate consequence of our world today , people sometimes no longer know how to react to a “ friendly stranger ” on their doorstep , so they react with fear .
Be thankful for whatever is given , and move on till you find a friendly face .
2. Appreciate
Once you bring the fruit home , use it or you ’ll loose it .
Make sure you have time that day to process the fruit , complete with a plan on what you want to make with the necessary ingredients on hand a ready to go .
There ’s nothing worse than running out of sugar when making jam .
First , go through your buckets and divide the fruit into three categories :
* Use immediately ( i.e. very ripe or with damaged sections you need to cut out )
* Great to eat ( perfect , unblemished )
* Let ripen ( Needs some curing time , such as waiting for hard green pears to soften and yellow a bit ) .
Once divided , work through the “ use immediately ” booty right away .
One sweet consequence of tapping into these abandoned fruit trees is the fruit is often organic as no one sprayed the tree with anything , much less pesticides .
3. Return
Express thanks for this fruit gift by bringing some goodies back to the folks who owned the tree .
Seniors light up when someone stops by with baked goods .
Take your time and do n’t rush to your next destination .
If someone invites you in to share some of your own pie together over a cup of coffee , say yes .
If you ’re lucky , this may be the start of an on - going annual connection – and friendship .
If you ’re going to make pie , might as well make two .
It does n’t require much additional work , you already have plenty of fruit that needs to be used and you can fuel the good karma fruit cycle by giving the second pie away in gratitude .
This recipe is from our B&B cookbook , Edible Earth : Savoring the Good Life with Vegetarian Recipes from Inn Serendipity , which also includes other pear favorites inspired by Mary and John ’s bounty , such as Pear Ginger Muffins and Pear Cordial .

HARRISBURG , Pa. —
The intensifying warfare in the former Soviet republic of Georgia has put a new focus on the increasingly hard line that Senator John McCain has taken against Russia in recent years , with stances that have often gone well beyond those of the Bush administration and its focus on engagement .
Mr. McCain has called for expelling what he has called a “ revanchist Russia ” from meetings of the Group of 8 , the organization of leading industrialized nations .
He urged President Bush — in vain — to boycott the group ’s meeting in St. Petersburg in 2006 .
And he has often mocked the president ’s assertion that he got a sense of the soul of Vladimir V. Putin , who was then Russia ’s president and is now its prime minister , by looking into his eyes .
“ I looked into his eyes , ” Mr. McCain said , “ and saw three letters : a K , a G and a B . ”
His hard line has been derided as provocative , and possibly dangerous , by some so - called realist foreign policy experts , who warn that isolating Russia would do little to encourage it to change .
But others , including neoconservatives who deem promoting democracy a paramount goal , see Mr. McCain ’s position as principled , and prescient .
Now , with Russia moving forcefully into Georgia as Mr. McCain seeks the presidency , his views are being scrutinized as never before through the prism of Russia ’s invasion .
For Mr. McCain , the conflict came after months of warnings about the situation in Georgia .
Mr. McCain befriended Georgia ’s president , Mikheil Saakashvili , over the course of several trips there , and even nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 ( in a letter that was co-signed by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , Democrat of New York ) .

DinjackPD : so I called home to my dad ( he works out of a home office ) and asked him to bring it for me
DinjackPD : so he came to school with it and he came up to me and shook my hand and said " Hi there , I 'm David , I 'm your personal secretary . "
DinjackPD : And I said " Hi there , I 'm your son , you signed on for this shit when you did n't wear a condom . "

In the UK some net users have been warned off file - sharing sites European politicians have voted in favour of amendments to telecoms law which campaigners say could be used to curb privacy online and file - sharing .
Digital rights groups in Europe have formed a loose coalition to highlight their opposition to the amendments .
But MEPs have denied that the amendments are aimed at throwing file - sharers off the net .
MEP Malcolm Harbour , who helped oversee the so - called Telecoms Packet , said it was " about improving users ' rights " .
The vote on whether to approve the Telecom Packet itself , which is a raft of laws aimed at harmonising European telecoms regulation , takes place in September .
" There has been a great deal of dismay in the committee at the interpretation being put on these amendments , " he told BBC News .
" They have nothing to do with copyright enforcement .
The interpretation of them is alarmist and scare - mongering and deflects from the intention which was to improve consumers ' rights , " he said .
But campaigners say one of the amendments makes it easier to enforce the controversial " three strikes " law which the music industry is keen to use in order to clamp down on file - sharers .
Soviet net
It would see users receive two warnings if they download copyright material without permission , followed by a complete web ban .
Tentative steps towards such a policy are already underway in the UK with the BPI ( formerly the British Phonographic Industry ) policing file - sharing sites and informing ISPs of people downloading material illegally .
Virgin Media has sent about 800 warning letters to users and the BPI is threatening to take other ISPs to court if they fail to join the campaign .
France is also about to enact laws that penalise persistent file - sharers .
MEPs voted against Europe - wide legislation to tackle the issue in April 2008 .
Campaigners say the changes to the Telecom Packet legislation have more fundamental implications for net freedom .
Another amendment allows governments to decide what software can be used on the web .
The Foundation for a Free Internet Infrastructure ( FFII ) warned that they could create a " Soviet internet " on which only software and services approved by governments would be allowed to run .
" Tomorrow popular software applications like Skype or even Firefox might be declared illegal in Europe if they are not certified by an administrative authority , " said a FFII spokesman in a statement .
But Mr Harbour claimed the legislation has entirely more innocent intentions .
" It is about new provisions so that users can find out about new services .
It will make price comparison sites easier to set up , it will force regulators to give equivalent access to disabled users and enhance emergency services with caller location , " he said .

What are these ?
Consider the Jefferson salamander .
About average - finger length , its grey skin mottled with black .
Amphibious , spawning in Southern Ontario 's quickly vanishing woodland vernal pools .
Prognosis : Dying .
Now , the urban raccoon .
Plump and furry , not so adept at fishing as its rural cousins , perhaps , but expert at garbage - tipping .
An adaptable squatter in buildings both abandoned and , as homeowners near High Park well know , occupied .
Prognosis : Thriving .
The tiny Jefferson , its numbers dwindling to endangered status as swaths of suburbanization razed its habitat , has become , in recent years , something of a cause célèbre .
For conservationists , it 's a potent metaphor for our disconnect with the natural world , the vast land transformation that human activity has wrought – and our ineffectual attempts to counterbalance it .
The raccoon , on the other hand , not so much .
To sum up the popular opinion , our ring - tailed co-urbanite is simply a pest .
Mart Gross offers a different take .
" Racoons would n't be in the city if they did n't fill a valuable niche , " says Gross , a senior professor of conservation biology at the University of Toronto .
" They 're an important part of the ecosystem , and deserve the same protection as any wild species . "
And the embattled Jefferson ?
" Basically , it 's triage for the living dead , " says Gross , on U of T's downtown campus .
" Wildlife management has gone down the tubes because everyone 's obsessed with endangered species .
( The Jefferson salamander ) is no longer adapted to its environment .
It survives because we breed it in labs .
Then , what we try to re-introduce to the wild is a different beast anyway , because it 's adapted to its surroundings in the lab .
" The issue is n't a biological one , it 's an aesthetic one .
And we think it 's so important that we give it rights .
To me , that 's the new conservation biology : Recognizing truly what it is that is the human goal , with biodiversity , and recognizing this concept of organisms having intrinsic rights is no more than a philosophical concept that bears little weight . "
In the largely Catholic world of conservation biology , the idea that a native , endangered species like the Jefferson could be trumped by a trash - grubbing raccoon is a godless notion , to be sure .
But the movement is growing .
To be clear : Gross is not advocating a slash - and - burn mentality in the planet 's remaining wildernesses .
What he is suggesting , though , is equally offensive to some :
To drop the battles we can't win and start thinking about the war .
If that means accepting an altered landscape as a new arena where a different kind of biodiversity might flourish , so be it .
In his realm , Gross 's ideas could be regarded as blasphemous :
That endangered species without habitat , such as the Jefferson , are no longer relevant to the ecosystem ; that non-native species that find a way to thrive in their new environment – for example , the brown goby in Lake Ontario , a Mediterranean stowaway fish with an appetite for another invader , the zebra mussel – are welcome additions ; and , most importantly , that these retrofits , re-do's and manipulations of the biosphere are simply evolution in action .
" The first change in attitude one should have is to think of humans as part of the natural world , " Gross says .
" We are n't inflicted upon nature .
We are part of nature .
We 're a selective force , like wolves on moose and deer . "
MANY OF THESE ideas are radical , and Gross will have a serious test today , when he and a group of his students present their work at the annual meeting of the Society for Conservation Biology in Tennessee , the field 's largest and most influential gathering .
" Ninety per cent of them , if they heard what we were discussing , they 'd want to stone us , " Gross says .
David Aborn , the University of Tennessee biologist hosting the affair , expects some lively debate .
" You need that radical who 's not afraid to stick his neck out . "
Some would trade " radical " for " offensive . "
Among those is Caroline Schultz , the executive director of Ontario Nature , one of the advocacy groups fighting to keep the Jefferson alive .
" The argument that we 've wrecked their habitat , so we should just let it go , is a very nihilistic viewpoint .
" Some ideas are very interesting in academic realms but have to be very carefully applied – if at all – in reality . "
As recently as 2004 , however , Gross was the very picture of the religious conservationist , working feverishly for the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada .
That year , he identified two distinct salmon populations in British Columbia that had dwindled to dangerously low numbers .
In an emergency measure , he recommended to then - environment minister Stéphane Dion that they be given immediate protection under the Species at Risk Act .
Dion was legally obligated to comply , but he refused .
Sockeye as a whole were not endangered , he argued , and protecting these two tiny populations would close down the entire multi-million dollar fishery .
" It was historic , a real groundbreaker , " recalls Gross .
" It was the first time in history a government had allowed a species to go extinct .
And I was stunned .
I just could n't believe they 'd let it go down the toilet like that . "
Gross worked for more than a year to rally support .
" To us , this was anathema – ` You 've got to save all these little twigs of the tree , because that 's biodiversity , ' " he says .
" But then , I started to realize the issue is larger than any one species .
What we want is ecosystem health . "
The holy notion of the unspoiled wilderness is too narrow to begin to describe Gross 's hypothesis on what , exactly , " wild " means .
" Do n't bother with the conservation textbooks ! " implores a line from a presentation Gross gave in May to the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution .
" Take the religion out of conservation biology .
Recognize humans as natural . "
Gross 's ideas are starting to gain traction .
" If you were to look at the roster of scientists for the major conservation ( organizations ) , you would not find anyone who studied evolutionary processes , " wrote Peter Kareiva , the chief scientist and director of research for The Nature Conservancy , one of the U.S. 's largest conservation non-profits .

Kareiva did a survey of conservation organization 's websites – the World Wildlife Fund , the Wildlife Conservation Society , his own – hunting for the word " evolution . "
He found no occurrences .
" It 's striking how comfortable we are talking about `historical conditions ' and what was `natural in the past , ' " Kareiva wrote , " yet fail to realize the extent to which change is so relentless , and that `historical conditions ' must by definition always be historical ( and not some goal for which to strive ) . "
Kareiva was ruminating on a presentation that Gross had given The Nature Conservancy , and found himself moved by his ideas .
" Language matters , " he continued .
The absence of evolution revealed " a view of the world in which the inevitability of change has been overlooked .
Species go extinct , new species arise , and species adapt .
An evolutionary biologist asks what types of traits and organisms are selected in different environments , and how humans are changing the attributes of biodiversity .
We have an opportunity to shape the future of biodiversity that we may miss if we obsess too much over `preservation ' of the past . "
Schultz believes there 's a better balance to be struck .
" Some say we should be striving to restore the landscape to a pre-European state – even if it 's impossible , " she says .
" That might be going too far .
But surely there 's a moral imperative to keep a species alive , even if it 's not pragmatic .
The ultimate goal is to get the species back to the point where it can thrive . "
But Gross 's point is neither moral nor pragmatic , he says .
It 's simply the path that hews closest to a contemporary – and accurate – notion of " natural . "
That being the case , attempts to rebuild endangered populations rarely end well , he says , despite the sometimes - massive efforts to do so .
Take the Chinook salmon .
A system of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia River ( its native habitat ) has pushed it to the brink .
" We closed their niche , " he says .
" But we have endangered - species laws that say we can't let them go extinct .
So we 've got truckloads of salmon being driven around the dams to release them so they can spawn .
It 's hopeless , and it 's totally artificial . "
Meanwhile , in Chile , the Chinook are thriving .
How ?
We put them there .
They 'd never make it themselves – warm equatorial waters would kill them – but in the cool waters of the southern Pacific , the Chinook , introduced as farmed fish , are roaming free by the thousands .
By next year , they 're expected to round Tierra del Fuego and head up the Argentine coast .
Some biologists would chafe at the " unnatural " horror such a situation presents .
But a growing movement is looking to accept the invaders , usually placed by human hand , as natural selection unto itself , one of Gross 's ideas .
" For a long time , ( non-native species ) were regarded as vermin , " says the University of Tennessee 's Aborn .
" But now that they 're entrenched , it 's up to us to adjust our thinking . "
WHAT DOES THIS have to do with the Jefferson salamander , or the raccoon in your garbage can ?
Well , everything .
In a nutshell , the planet is doing what it has always done : Changing .
That we 've played such a significant role in that is secondary to the fact that , as always , the planet will be more hospitable to some species than others .
As Darwin would have said , let the strong – or best suited – survive .
" I would say habitat is not being lost so much as it's being lost to them , " Gross says .
" But it 's also being reconverted for other species as part of our evolving ecosystem . "
Gross would see that as an opportunity .
The Catholic in his field would see it as an abomination .
But as Kareiva wrote , the ability to " shape the future of biodiversity " could well be missed if conservation biology chooses , as it does in large part now , to look backward , not forth .
Home Relational Parametricity and Units of Measure Relational Parametricity and Units of Measure , Andrew J. Kennedy , POPL 1997 .
Type systems for programming languages with numeric types can be extended to support the checking of units of measure .
Quantification over units then introduces a new kind of parametric polymorphism with a corresponding Reynolds - style representation independence principle : that the behaviour of programs is invariant under changes to the units used .
We prove this `dimensional invariance ' result and describe four consequences .
The first is that the type of an expression can be used to derive equations which describe its properties with respect to scaling ( akin to Wadler 's `theorems for free ' for
System F ) .
Secondly there are certain types which are inhabited only by trivial terms .
For example , we prove that a fully polymorphic square root function cannot
be written using just the usual arithmetic primitives .
Thirdly we exhibit interesting isomorphisms between types and for first - order types relate these to the central theorem of classical dimensional analysis .
Finally we suggest that for any expression whose behaviour is dimensionally invariant there exists some equivalent expression whose type reflects this behaviour , a consequence of which would be a full abstraction result for a model of the language .
There 's a new release of F# coming out with support for measure types , and so I thought I 'd post a link to Andrew 's paper about the subject .
Now , if you 've done any physics or engineering , you 're probably familiar with the fact that units can sometimes really strongly constrain what form your equations can take .
If you studied dimensional analysis more carefully than I did , you might even have learned that this is a consequence of the Buckingham pi theorem -- you can prove that if you have an equation with n variables involving k physical units , you can recast it as an equation with ( n - k ) dimension - free variables .
Kennedy shows that the analogue of this theorem for programs in his language is a form of parametricity result at first order , which is quite slick .

Gag Orders Are Unconstitutional And Give The FBI Unchecked Power To Hide Abuses , ACLU Says
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK –
In oral arguments today , the American Civil Liberties Union urged a federal appeals court to uphold a decision striking down the national security letter ( NSL ) provision of the Patriot Act .
This provision gives the FBI the authority to issue letters demanding private information about people within the United States , and to place the recipients of the letters under indefinite gag orders .
Recent reports issued by the Department of Justice 's Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) have revealed the FBI 's widespread , systemic abuse of its NSL power .
" The FBI should n't have the unreviewable power to impose gag orders on the recipients of national security letters , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project who argued today in court .
" As the district court ruled , the FBI 's power to silence the recipients of these letters has to be subject to judicial oversight .
Without that check , the FBI can use its power to hide abuses and silence its critics – and that 's exactly what it 's been doing . "
The ACLU and New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in April 2004 on behalf of an Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) that received an NSL .
Because the FBI imposed a gag order on the ISP , the lawsuit was filed under seal , and even today the ACLU is prohibited from disclosing its client 's identity .
The FBI continues to maintain the gag order even though the underlying investigation is more than four years old ( and may well have ended ) , and even though the FBI abandoned its demand for records from the ISP over a year ago .
In the lawsuit , now called Doe v. Mukasey , the ACLU initially challenged both the FBI 's power to demand records without judicial oversight and its power to impose gag orders on NSL recipients .
In September 2004 , Judge Victor Marrero of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York struck down the NSL statute , ruling that the FBI could not constitutionally demand sensitive records without judicial review and that permanent gag orders violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech .
The government appealed the ruling , but Congress amended the NSL provision before the court issued a decision .
" This amendment violates not only the First Amendment 's strong presumption in favor of free speech but also impermissibly limits the capacity of courts to behave as courts and to adjudicate fairly the propriety of any gag order , " said Arthur Eisenberg , NYCLU Legal Director .
The ACLU brought a new challenge to the amended provision , and in September 2007 , Judge Marrero again found the statute unconstitutional .
Today , the ACLU presented oral arguments in the government 's appeal of that decision .
Bills aimed at bringing the NSL authority back in line with the Constitution were introduced last year in both the House and Senate after reports had confirmed and detailed the widespread abuse of the authority by federal law enforcement .
Since the Patriot Act was passed in 2001 , relaxing restrictions on the FBI 's use of the power , the number of NSLs issued has seen an astronomical increase , to nearly 200,000 between 2003 and 2006 .
A March 2008 OIG report revealed that , among other abuses , the FBI misused NSLs to sidestep the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) .
In one instance , the FBI issued NSLs to obtain information after the FISC twice refused its requests on First Amendment grounds .
The OIG also found that the FBI continues to impose gag orders on about 97 percent of NSL recipients and that , in some cases , the FBI failed to sufficiently justify why the gag orders were imposed in the first place .
In addition to this case , the ACLU has challenged this Patriot Act statute multiple times .
One case was brought on behalf of a group of Connecticut librarians and another case , called Internet Archive v. Mukasey , involved an NSL served on a digital library in California .
In the latter case , the FBI withdrew the NSL and the gag as part of the settlement of a legal challenge brought by the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Attorneys in Doe v. Mukasey are Jaffer , Melissa Goodman and L. Danielle Tully of the ACLU National Security Project and Eisenberg of the NYCLU .
The ACLU 's brief can be found online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/nationalsecurityletters/34476lgl20080310.html

Virgin Media , plagued by a recent flurry of bad publicity thanks to its policy of working with the music industry to warn file - sharers , has announced today that there is " absolutely no possibility " that it will disconnect its users from the Internet or hand over their details to the music industry .
As the war of words over file - sharing in the UK heats up , the music industry represented by the BPI has been seeking ways to stop an estimated 6 million British citizens from sharing music .
It has been pressurizing ISPs to take responsibility for the actions of their subscribers , and demanding that they disconnect those who share unauthorized music , something the ISPs do n’t want to do .
To its credit , one ISP , Carphone Warehouse , has refused to comply .
Others are working with the music industry and at the forefront of that group is Virgin Media .
Virgin has been receiving quite a lot of bad publicity recently after it was revealed that it agreed to work with the music industry to send out so - called ‘ educational warnings ‘ to its customers the BPI accuse of file - sharing .
Virgin has sent out hundreds of these at the behest of the music industry and they have been dropping through mail boxes up and down the country .
The letters come in an envelope and printed on the outside are the words : “ Important :
If you do n’t read this , your broadband could be disconnected ” so recipients could be forgiven for coming to the conclusion that , frankly , if they do n’t read it , their broadband could be disconnected .
However , Virgin Media told has told Jim over at Newsbeat that the printing on the envelope was “ a mistake ” and there is “ absolutely no possibility ” of legal action or disconnection for any recipient of these letters .
Nice to know .
Furthermore , Asam Ahmad from Virgin notes that they cannot be 100 % sure that the person they send the letters to has actually committed any offense at all .
“ It is important to let our customers know that their accounts have been used in a certain way but we are happy to accept it may not be the account holder that ’s involved . ”
He goes on to highlight the problematic issue of incorrectly accusing someone due to a lack of solid evidence : “ It could be someone else in the family or someone living in a shared house .
It could even be someone stealing wi-fi .
We are not making any form of accusation . ”
Virgin Media has also stated that it will not hand over the personal details of anyone accused by the BPI “ under any circumstances ” .
This is a good start by Virgin and all credit to them for taking this stance but the reality is that Virgin hands over its subscriber ’s details in the blink of an eye when faced with a court order to do so .
We know for a fact that they hand over the details of petty file - sharers to the likes of lawyers Davenport Lyons for the alleged sharing of one cheap game costing little more than a single album .
However , the BPI has said in the past that it does n’t want to start taking legal action against individuals .
We 're totally confused , but this is what we can gather : Comcast told some dude in Baltimore that if he wants to watch four local affiliate stations , he has to cough up serious cash to upgrade to digital cable .
So the guy does n't take this lying down – he writes a strongly - worded letter to the Baltimore Sun , whose consumer interest columnist , Dan Thanh Dang , forwards the complaint to Comcast .
Comcast confirms that the company is indeed transitioning a few affiliate channels from analog to digital .
Okay , so we 've gotten that far .
But then , Comcast says , the dude does n't have to upgrade to digital at all .
He can just lease a converter box for $ 3.95 a month .
So it turns out , they were totally joking about that mandatory upgrade for local TV .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Thousands of German policewomen will receive what media have labeled “ bullet - proof bras . ”
Made of white cotton and featuring the word “ Polizei ” ( Police ) along the seam , the bras are meant to better protect police women who wear bullet - proof vests .
“ There was a slight safety risk for women wearing normal bras with metal parts underneath a bullet - proof vest , ” a police spokesman in the northern city of Hanover said .
“ If the vest is hit by a projectile , this can have an impact on the metal bit in the bra underneath and cause injuries . ”
Some 3,000 police women working for Germany ’s federal police will be equipped with the new bras which feature no metal parts and look like sports bras , the spokesman said .

The X - ray techniques produce images with remarkable detail
More details
It is like a magic trick - at first there is nothing and then it appears : a tiny insect unseen by any eye for 100 million years .
We are with Paul Tafforeau who is scrolling through images on his computer .
His pictures have been produced by a colossal X - ray machine that can illuminate the insides of small lumps of clouded amber ( fossil tree resin ) .
As he plays with the settings , what starts out as grey nothingness suddenly becomes the unmistakable outline of a " wee beastie " .
Who knows ?
This little creature could once have buzzed a dinosaur .
It 's certainly the right age .
Tafforeau is a palaeontologist .
But whilst others of his profession will be in the dirt with a rock hammer and trowel , you 'll find him at the end of one of the most remarkable " cameras " in the world .
The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) in Grenoble , France , produces an intense , high - energy light that can pierce just about any material , revealing its inner structure .
Cannot play media .
Sorry you need to have JavaScript enabled on your browser .
Advertisement Tafforeau and colleague Malvina Lak have put kilos of opaque amber chunks in the way of this beam and have found a treasure trove of ancient organisms .
From more than 600 blocks , they have identified nearly 360 fossil animals .
Wasps , flies , ants - even spiders .
There are also small fragments of plant material .
All of it caught up in the sticky goo of some prehistoric tree and then locked away until modern science provided the key .
Everything comes from the Charentes region in south - western France .
EUROPEAN LIGHT SOURCE
Electrons are fired into a linac , or straight accelerator .
They 're boosted in a small ring before entering the storage ring .
The superfast particles are corralled by a train of magnets .
Energy lost by turning electrons emerges as intense light ( X - rays ) .
The 850 m - circumference ring has 32 magnet clusters , or cells .
Electrons turned by plain magnets produce ' standard ' X -rays .
Particles ' wiggled ' at undulator magnets emit stronger X - rays .
X - rays can't turn with electrons and head straight down beamlines .
Experiment ' hutches ' receive the most intense X - rays in Europe .
The light probes materials on the atomic and molecular scale .
Robots can place many samples in the beam for rapid science .
ESRF data leads to new materials , drugs , electronics , etc. BACK NEXT 1 of 3
Most of the organisms are minuscule .
For example , one of the discovered mites measures just 0.8 mm across .
A fossil wasp is large by comparison at 4 mm in length .
" The small size of the organisms is probably due to the fact that bigger animals would be able to escape from the resin before getting stuck , whereas little ones would be captured more easily , " explains Malvina Lak , who is affiliated to the University of Rennes .
You can tell the ones that were trapped alive as opposed to the ones which must have been dead and blown into the goo .
The live bugs were frozen with legs flailing .
The dead , on the other hand , were encapsulated with legs curled up underneath them .
The ESRF synchrotron is using a quick - fire process to screen the ambers .
First , block batches are loaded into the beamline and imaged using a high - contrast , high - resolution form of X - ray radiography .
This identifies the ambers that have interesting inclusions .
These then undergo another session in the beamline which builds up 3D images of the trapped insects .
" Micro - tomography is based on radiography but instead of a single picture , we are taking pictures during rotation of the sample , " explains Dr Tafforeau .
" For a complete rotation , we will take more than 1,000 radiographs - and from all these radiographs , we can reconstruct virtual slices ; and after using a 3D processing tool , we ' extract ' the specimen from the amber . "
A plastic print would be deposited as part of the holotype , or reference
Some 80 % of Charentes ambers are opaque
This virtual insect can be spun around on the computer screen .
With resolution on the micron scale ( millionths of a metre ) , fine anatomical details jump out .
But here 's the really neat part .
All that electronic information can be fed to a 3D plastic printer to make a physical model .
A bug that in reality is less than a millimetre long and hidden inside a resin block then becomes a 30 cm - long facsimile you can hold in your hand .
" In some ways it is better than having the real animal , " says Dr Tafforeau , as he turns a giant plastic wasp in his palms .
The Charentes ambers are opaque - unless you have a synchrotron
More details
" If you think about it , the real wasp is 4 mm and to see it you would need a microscope ; and if it 's in opaque amber you need a synchrotron .
Once it 's done as a plastic print , you can see what you want . "
The work is providing new insights into the ecology of Charantes in the Mesozoic Era .
Many of the newly identified bugs are water - related : they would have lived around an esturine environment .
The translucent ambers gathered from the region had already indicated this ; but the investigation of the opaque ambers at the ESRF has now strengthened this interpretation .
Paul Tafforeau , Malvina Lak and colleagues have high hopes for the techniques they are developing in the synchrotron .
In a paper to be published in the scientific journal Microscopy and Microanalysis , they suggest their work could form the basis of an alternative means of cataloguing new species trapped in amber .
Traditionally , every recorded organism will have a reference specimen , or holotype , deposited in a museum .
This specimen will be made available to any scientist who wishes to examine it or compare it with further discoveries .
But this presents a unique problem for insects caught in opaque amber .
How do you deposit a reference you cannot see ?
The ESRF team proposes that in future such holotypes be composed of the amber block , all the electronic data from the synchrotron and the 3D plastic print .
The type of work undertaken by Tafforeau , Lak and colleagues can only be done in a synchrotron ; but it is time - consuming work .
Long - term , the ESRF hopes to upgrade its facilities .
The improvements it plans are likely to open up many new avenues for " virtual palaeontology " .
At the moment , the X - ray beam is no more than 4 cm wide .
An enhanced ESRF will be capable of producing a beam 25 cm across - wide enough even to image the entire skull of a fossil human .
" We needed four days to scan 10kg of amber .
With a larger beam and a wide - field detector , in four days we would be able to scan perhaps 100kg of amber ; and with even better results , " said Dr Tafforeau .

What are these ?
Sahara solar panel farm ' the size of Wales ' will power European cities
The panels would only need to capture 0.3 per cent of sunlight falling in deserts such as the Sahara to meet Europe 's energy requirements
A series of huge solar panel farms in the Sahara desert could be the key to cutting Europe 's carbon footprint , according to scientists planning to harness the power of the sun .
The ambitious vision is at the heart of scheme for a new £ 35.7 billion supergrid that would allow European countries to share electricity from eco-friendly sources .
The solar panels would cover an area just smaller than the size of Wales and experts claim that it could supply the entire continent with green electricity .
The idea has been backed by Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
The intense sunlight in the North African desert could produce up to three times more electricity than similar solar photovoltaic panels in Northern Europe .
Speaking at the Euroscience Open Forum in Barcelona , Arnulf Jaeger - Walden of the European commission 's Institute for Energy , said that the panels would only need to capture 0.3 per cent of the sunlight falling in the Sahara and Middle East deserts to meet all of Europe 's energy requirements .
The idea was discussed last month as part of the newly formed Mediterranean Union , launched at a summit in Paris .
The electricity would be transmitted along high voltage direct current cables .
These would also allow countries such as the UK and Denmark to export wind energy and import energy from other green sources .
The current largest solar energy roofplant is in Munich .
This would be dwarfed by the new Sahara project
The cost of building the high voltage lines could cost up to £ 1 billion a year until 2050 .
By then the solar farms could produce 100GW .
Doug Parr , Greenpeace UK 's chief scientist , gave his support to the scheme .
' Assuming it 's cost - effective , a large - scale renewable energy grid is just the kind of innovation we need if we 're going to beat climate change . '
It was recently predicted by the International Energy Agency that the world needs to invest more then $ 45tn ( £ 22.5tn ) in energy systems over the next 30 years .
Пчеловодство - Разведение пчел ( бортничество )
Учеными было установлено , что пчелы появились около 38 - 40 миллионов лет назад .
Со временем , ими стали приобретаться многие функции , например : сбор пыльцы с цветков и т.д. Родиной пчелы приносящей мед считается Южная Азия , нигде в мире нельзя отыскать такого разнообразия пород пчел , как здесь .
Когда пчеловодство пришло в Россию , точно сказать никто не может , однако оно всегда пользовалось популярностью у населения , наравне с охотой и земледелием .
Воровство меда или обман ради получения лишних деревьев с дуплами для пчел , наказывались сурово .
Началом " искусственного " пчеловодства в
России считают по - праву 18 век , именно тогда были изобретены важнейшие приспособления для сбора меда и разведения пчел : ульи , медогонка .
Переоценить значение пчеловодства , пожалуй , невозможно .
Маточное молочко , прополис , мед , пчелиный яд , цветочная пыльца - содержат в себе огромное количество полезных веществ и продлевают жизнь человека .
Излечения от многих болезней могло бы не произойти , если бы не продукты пчеловодства .
The science of demographic projection and the art of scaremongering enjoy a relationship akin to that of the sadist and masochist : first comes the threat , then the relish with which the punishment is anticipated .
Thus forecasts of increasing population numbers are guaranteed to produce dystopian visions of social collapse .
The godfather of apocalyptic demographics was the Rev Thomas Malthus , who famously proposed in the late 18th century that unchecked population growth would lead to starvation .
Population , he said , was destined to increase exponentially in relation to food supply .
In the event , Britain 's population grew from a hungry eight million in Malthus 's time to today 's well - fed 61 million .
The cleric 's name long ago became a byword for catastrophic pessimism , but there have been plenty of other doomsayers who have followed in his arithmetically wayward wake .
It could be said that a recent editorial in the British Medical Journal emerges from the same tradition .
Last month , John Guillebaud , professor of family planning at University College London , called for a reduction in the UK birth rate to help combat global warming .
The lesson to be drawn from Malthus , however , is that we should never underestimate the human capacity to misrepresent the future or our ability to deal with it when it does arrive .
Nevertheless , if human ingenuity is boundless , the planet and , in particular , that small corner lying off the coast of north - west Europe , is not .
There is a finite space in which to fit people .
The UK , after all , is significantly smaller than France or Germany .
Last week , the European Commission announced its most recent population predictions .
Britain came top of the league with an estimated growth in the next 50 years of 16 million people .
With a total of 77 million inhabitants , Britain is predicted to become the most populous country in Europe .
To those who view the world through a purely economic prism , these figures are a cause for celebration .
As the headline in the Guardian put it : ' Germany shrinks , France grows , but UK population booms ' , making it sound as if Team GB had added a further gold to its
Beijing tally , this time in the reproduction event .
The paper pointed out that the projected rise meant ' the UK has less to fear about any " generational wars " brought on by the " demographic timebomb " of ageing and shrinking populations where those in work cannot support the pension needs of retired citizens ' .
This has become the rationale for the policy of population expansion .
To deal with greater life expectancy , runs the theory , we need to produce or , rather , import more people .
But it 's worth considering where this cycle will end .
How , for example , will a population of 77 million deal with paying for the pensions of its retired citizens ?
Presumably by expanding to 100 million .
Then what ?
Still , let 's resist the Malthusian temptation to overdramatise the situation and assume that a larger population will not lead to a global warming crisis , that there wo n't be a shortage of food or shelter , or an increase in disease .
Instead , we can frame the problem in more modest terms : will an increase of 16 million people improve the quality of our lives ?
Will life become more pleasurable , less anxious , more satisfying ?
It 's impossible to know the future , but there 's no excuse for ignoring the present and just now things feel a little cramped in Britain , especially in the south east .
Roads are almost permanently clogged , public transport is a mess , schools and hospitals are full and the sense of friction , the tension of reduced personal space , is often palpable .
Would these problems be alleviated with another 16 million , the majority of whom would settle in the south ?
Such is the draw of the south east that the Policy Exchange think - tank recently suggested that the inhabitants of cities such as Sunderland and Liverpool should move there .
Neither is there a shortage of economic migrants from across the rest of the world who also view the south east as their destination point .
The European Commission estimated that immigrants would account for 10 million of Britain 's 16 million increase in numbers .
And here we come to the main problem of discussing the benefits and drawbacks of population growth .
Immigration is inextricably tied to the issue of race .
To wonder if 10 million new migrants is a good thing is to stray into territory most notably occupied by racists .
In fact , immigration has become a much more complex matter than race ; it 's not uncommon , as author Mike Phillips noted last week in these pages , to see black Londoners complaining about the presence of white Poles .
None the less , it 's a sensitive matter and that 's one reason the immigration debate has been restricted to the more neutral ground of economics .
Bodies such as the Institute for Public Policy Research maintain there is a net benefit for the economy and there seems little doubt that much of the dynamism of modern Britain is due to the impact of migrants .
However , economic success is not the only guide to a nation 's health .
As one economic migrant , Nemanja Vidic , Manchester United 's Serbian defender , observed of the British last week : ' They just do n't have time to feel the joy of life .
Through the week they all work so hard .
They only talk to people at lunch break .
Then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day . '
The UK economy has modelled itself on the American version , in which GDP growth and population growth are inseparable .
But Britain is not America .
There is not a sense of unlimited space on these islands or such a such a strong notion of Darwinian individualism .
So the consequences of an entrepreneurial culture based on endless supply of renewable labour are something the nation at large needs to consider and one of those consequences is a population of 77 million .
There 's nothing wrong with asking , in the spirit of free inquiry , whether that may not be just a little too much .

In Turkmenistan getting the date right was a tricky business .
Instead of April there was Gurbansoltan - the name given to the month by the country 's late dictator , who renamed it after his mother .
But yesterday the central Asian nation took another step towards ending its isolation , when its new president suggested dumping the names invented by his predecessor , Saparmurat Niyazov .
Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov , who took over after Niyazov 's death in 2006 , said he wanted to go back to traditional names , including January .
Niyazov had renamed January after himself - calling it " Turkmenbashi " ( father of the Turkmen ) .
Other months were named after heroes and poets .
" It is necessary to draft a Majlis [ parliamentary ] resolution by the end of this half of the year after a very thorough analysis , " the president said .
The late dictator renamed the months in 2002 - one of a series of bizarre decrees that earned Turkmenistan the reputation of being one of the world 's most repressive states .
Ordinary Turkmen stuck with the old names , but the new forms became mandatory for officials and state television .
Since becoming president Berdimuhammedov has ended his predecessor 's personality cult .
He has allowed internet cafes to open , lifted the ban on foreign operas and increased the number of years children attend school .
He has also improved ties with the west .
" He is a different generation from Niyazov .
He 's younger , and he understands that Turkmenistan can't live in isolation from the outside world , " said Sanobar Shermatova , an expert on central Asia based in Moscow .
" The iron curtain around Turkmenistan is coming down . "
She added , though : " These reforms do n't add up to democratisation .
Turkmenistan remains as far away from democracy in the western sense as it is from the moon .
The change to the names is all about unifying Turkmenistan with the world .
I expect this process to continue . "
Other names consigned to the scrapheap include Ruhnama - September - named after the late dictator 's spiritual book .

Luminaries at the Trilateral Commission meeting in Washington expressed confidence that they own all three major presidential candidates , who , despite political posturing , will support sovereignty - surrendering measures such as NAFTA and the “ North American Union . ”
“ John has always supported free trade , even while campaigning before union leaders , ” said one .
“ Hil and Barack are pretending to be unhappy about some things , but that ’s merely political posturing .
They ’re solidly in support . ”
He was referring to Sens. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) and Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) .
Mrs. Clinton , they noted , held strategy sessions as first lady on how to get Congress to approve NAFTA “ without changes . ”
As president , they agreed , she would do no more than “ dot an i or cross a t . ”
Candidate Obama has not denied news reports in Canada that his top economic adviser , Austan Goolsbee , assured Canadian diplomats that the senator would keep NAFTA intact and his anti-trade talk is just “ campaign rhetoric . ”
PETRIFIED ABOUT PAUL
While they are confident they can deal with any “ potential president , ” the Trilateralists paid huge tribute to Ron Paul in an equally large twist of irony , by expressing alarm that he is causing “ significant future damage . ”
They expressed concern that Paul ’s rallies have attracted multitudes of young people who are getting “ their political education . ”
They want Republicans to pressure Paul to drop out now and stop his education rallies .
This assignment was given to Thomas Foley , former U.S. House speaker .
The reasons Paul ’s “ education campaign ” strikes fear into Trilateral hearts are obvious .
Paul would refuse to surrender an ounce of U.S. sovereignty to an international organization and TC wants world government .
Paul would immediately bring U.S. troops home from Iraq , Afghanistan and from 130 UN “ peacekeeping ” missions around the globe .
TC wants to enjoy war profiteering and global power .
Paul would abolish the federal income tax while the TC wants to pile on a global tax payable to the UN .
The formal agenda was loaded with everything Paul and American patriots detest : higher taxes , more foreign giveaways , more immigration , both legal and illegal , into the United States and “ engaging Iran , ” among others .
AMERICA NEEDS TO PAY HER FAIR SHARE ?
The Trilaterals got down to real work on Saturday , April 26 , with a high - powered panel called “ U.S. Foreign and Domestic Policy : Broad Outlines for a New Administration . ”
It was presided over by journalistic pimp David Gergen , who will write nothing about TC in his magazine , U.S News and World Report .
Also participating were Kenneth Duberstein , former White House chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan ; Strobe Talbot , president of the Brookings Institution and former deputy secretary of state ; and Joseph Nye , former assistant secretary of defense .
Henry Kissinger , former secretary of state and long - time Bilderberg leader , was present and listed as a participant .
But a TC staff member crossed his name out .
Some speculated he had throat problems .
This panel had these orders for the next president : increase foreign aid across the board because “ America does not pay its fair share , ” pay up the arrears in UN dues , allow as many immigrants into the United States as want to come and provide “ amnesty ” for illegal aliens already here .
Little , if anything , was said about the fact that American taxpayers pay one - fourth of the UN ’s operating costs and one - third of the cost of 130 “ peacekeeping missions ” or the fact that immigrants from South America depress wages here and the average immigrant family costs the government thousands of dollars a year in welfare , health and other “ benefits . ”
Robert Zoellick , president of the World Bank and another long - time Bilderberg boy , largely echoed these views in a sweetheart “ interview ” by another journalistic strumpet , Lionel Barber , editor of The Financial Times , who will obediently report nothing .
FIGHT WARMING ; ALLOW IMMIGRANTS
There were “ subgroup ” meetings on “ climate change , ” “ water and sanitation ” and “ migration and development . ”
Every nation , especially the U.S. , should spend big bucks to fight “ global warming , ” they agreed .
The United States should spend more “ because Americans cause the most pollution , ” one argued .
Americans should send more money to Africa so natives can drink clean water and scrub themselves , they said .
Antonio Garrigues Walker , chairman of Garrigues Abogadas y Asesores Tributarios , joined Peter Sutherland , the UN secretary - general ’s “ special representative on migration and development , ” to call on the United States to not only allow unlimited immigration , but to throw more money at Mexico and other impoverished Latin countries .
It was , somehow , their “ right ” to have more U.S. dollars .
Sutherland is chairman of British Petroleum and Goldman Sachs International .
He is also a long - time Bilderberg leader .
MEDIA BLACKOUT
Bill Emmott , another kept journalist , spoke on “ the rise of Asia ” at a reception - dinner held at the Smithsonian American Art Museum .
Emmott , former editor of The Economist , will report nothing .
Sunday morning , Robert Blackwill , former U.S. deputy national security adviser for Iraq , led a panel discussion on “ engaging Iran and building peace in the Persian Gulf Region . ”
For the first time , there was dissent .
Blackwill tried to rationalize the invasion of Iraq .
Others doubted that Saddam Hussein was connected to the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks or was a nuclear threat .
Blackwill said the military option remains but he hopes diplomatic efforts succeed .
Other participants were Ray Takeyh of the Council on Foreign Relations , which functions as the propaganda ministry for TC and Bilderberg ; Volker Perthes , head of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and Hitoshi Tanaka , former Japanese deputy minister of Foreign Affairs .
MORE , MORE , MORE MONEY
More foreigners demanded more U.S. money at a lunch panel called “ European and Asian views on U.S. Foreign and Security Policy . ”
Participants were Elisabeth Guigou , a member of the French National Assembly and former minister for European affairs and Han Sung - joo , former minister of foreign affairs for South Korea .
An afternoon session addressed “ global health ” with more calls for American tax dollars .
A major voice in this cause came from Sylvia Mathews Burwell , president of Global Development Programs , Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Bill Gates has attended at least one Bilderberg meeting .
EXCUSES FOR IRAQ ; PLANS FOR IRAN
John Negroponte , U.S. deputy secretary of state , addressed the evening dinner on “ U.S. foreign policy perspectives . ”
Again , the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were rationalized and an invasion of Iran held out as a possibility .
The Monday morning finale addressed the Global Financial Crisis involving these luminaries : Robert Kimmitt , U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury ; Martin Feldstein , former chairman of the President ’s Council of Economic Advisers ; David Rubenstein , managing director of The Carlyle Group ; Naoki Tanaka , president of the Center for International Public Policy Studies and Sir Andrew Crockett , president of JP Morgan Chase International .
Among them , there was much talk of the U.S. government ’s “ duty ” to “ intervene ” on behalf of “ financial institutions under stress . ”
Little or nothing was said of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are losing their homes because financial institutions lured them into buying houses they could not afford .
Throughout the weekend , no American voices were heard objecting to the demands on their country .
Instead , there were smiles , nods and applause .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Purple corn is a Peruvian super food cultivated in coastal areas , as well as in mountains of almost ten thousand feet .
There are very few purple plants found in nature , and so for people who are looking to eat a true rainbow diet , purple corn extract is a fantastic addition .
Purple corn contains a variety of phytonutrients ( plant nutrients ) including massive amounts of phenolics and anthocyanins .
Research shows that crops with the highest phenolic and anthocyanin content also have the highest antioxidant activity .
Anthocyaninins are a type of complex flavonoid that produces blue , purple or red colors .
Anthocyaninins are anti-inflammatory and encourage connective tissue regeneration .
As well as being powerful antioxidants that keep us looking young and protected from disease , they promote blood flow and reduce cholesterol .
It appears that anthocyaninins may stabilize and protect capillaries and blood vessels from free radical damage , and they have been shown to promote collagen formation ( which is great for our skin ) and improve circulation .
Purple Corn has a higher antioxidant capacity than blueberries , making it one of the most exciting new super foods of our time .
And speaking of exciting , there is an ancient Hopi prophecy that says when purple corn comes to the West , that is a sign that great changes are happening on the planet .
Studies show that a diet rich in polyphenolic compounds is associated with reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease and certain cancers .
Recent research in both animals and humans have shown that increasing polyphenol intake can : * Protect against atherosclerosis*
Lowers blood pressure , * Reduces blood clots *
Elevates antioxidant capacity of the bloodA study by Tsuda et al in 2003 revealed the effects of purple corn on obesity and diabetes .
Two groups consumed a diet rich in fats for 12 weeks , but one of the groups also received purple corn pigments .
The group consuming the purple corn :*
Did n't gain any weight *
Did n't suffer hypertrophy in the adiposities of the fat tissues *
Did n't show hyperglycemia ( low blood sugar ) , hyperinsulinemia ( too much insulin in the blood , which is the beginning of diabetes ) , or hyperleptinemia ( increased serum leptin levels , which is another marker for diabetes ) .
In comparison , the group that did n't receive the extract and ate only a fat rich diet , showed an increase in all of those areas , thus showing the incredible benefits for fighting obesity and diabetes .
A Japanese study at Nagoya University showed that the pigment in purple corn impedes the development of cancer in the colon .
A sample group received food mixed with a natural carcinogenic substance which is found in the charred parts of roasted meat and fish , and another group also received 5 % pigment of purple corn .
In the group that was fed the cancer causing substance , 85 % developed colon cancer , compared with only 40 % that also received the pigment .
As colon cancer is one of the most deadly forms of cancer , adding some purple corn to the diet is a pretty good idea !
There are also some people who claim that purple corn can help us open our third eye chakra , since its color is purple .
The third eye chakra is responsible for increased intuition , and opening up to spiritual truths .

John McCain has begun rallying dispirited Republicans behind him , while Democratic rival Barack Obama has made scant progress building new support , leaving the presidential race statistically tied , according to a new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll .
The survey highlights Obama ’s vulnerability on the question of his readiness to lead the nation .
Less than half of the registered voters polled think the first - term Illinois senator has the “ right ” experience to be president , while 80 % believe McCain , a four - term senator , does .
The poll also illustrates some racial undercurrents that confront Obama as he strives to become the first African American president .
Nine percent of voters say they would feel uncomfortable voting for a black candidate .
Most voters say they know people who feel that way .
About one in six say the country is not ready to elect a black president .
Despite his challenges , Obama holds many advantages on the eve of two critical events : his selection of a running mate and his formal crowning as the Democratic nominee at the party ’s national convention next week in Denver .
By Labor Day , Obama hopes to regain -- and build upon -- the momentum he had after he defeated Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton in June .

For now , voters favor Obama on the economy , the issue they rank as most important .
Also , independents , a crucial swing bloc , are leaning toward Obama .
And Obama ’s supporters remain more enthusiastic than McCain ’s , a sign that the Democratic candidate may be able to turn out more voters .
The Republican Party ’s dismal standing under President Bush also remains a drag on McCain ’s candidacy : 75 % of voters say the country has veered onto the wrong track .
“ McCain has more experience , but experience is n’t everything , ” poll respondent John Ritts of Towanda , Pa. , said in a follow - up interview .
A retired teacher and former Republican whose dissatisfaction with Bush drove him to switch his party affiliation to independent , Ritts supports Obama .
In a head - to - head matchup , Obama holds a narrow edge over McCain , 45 % to 43 % , which falls within the margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
( In June , Obama was ahead by 12 points in the Times / Bloomberg poll , but other surveys at the time showed him with a narrower lead . )
Advertisement
More striking , however , is the drop in Obama ’s favorable rating .
It has slid from 59 % to 48 % since the June poll .
At the same time , his negative rating has risen from 27 % to 35 % .
The bulk of that shift stems from Republicans souring on Obama amid ferocious attacks on the Democrat by McCain and his allies .
McCain forces have portrayed Obama as a naive celebrity who is unprepared to be president in dangerous times .
A Navy aviator who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam , McCain has also suggested that Obama would put personal ambition ahead of America ’s interests .
With that backdrop , the poll found that 35 % of voters have questions about how patriotic Obama is .
Just 9 % wonder how patriotic McCain is .
“ All the negative attacks from the McCain campaign seem to have been paying off , ” said Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , who oversaw the survey .
Advertisement
As Obama ’s public image has eroded , McCain ’s ratings have remained steady : 46 % of voters have a positive feeling about him ; 38 % give him negative ratings .
Long unpopular with conservatives , McCain has had more success than Obama in uniting his party ’s base .
Nine out of 10 Republicans now plan to vote for McCain , while roughly 8 in 10 Democrats support Obama .
The survey found a slight shift of Democrats from Obama toward McCain or the undecided column since June .
Among Democrats , 11 % are undecided , while just 3 % of Republicans are .
McCain has also improved his standing among white evangelicals , a major GOP constituency : 69 % prefer him over Obama , still well shy of the 78 % that Bush won in 2004 .
Advertisement
Still , even with the rise in enthusiasm among McCain ’s supporters , it was not enough to match the excitement of those who side with Obama .
The poll found 78 % of Obama ’s supporters are enthusiastic about his candidacy , while 61 % of McCain ’s felt that way .
Nearly a third of Republicans remain unenthusiastic about McCain .
“ In every election , it ’s kind of like the worse of two , ” said McCain supporter Denise Gionet Gonzales , 44 , a Republican from Lake Forest in Orange County .
“ Neither candidate gets me excited . ”
In a worrisome sign for McCain , 61 % of the independents who support him say they are unenthusiastic about him .
Independents , who could wind up deciding the election , favor Obama , 47 % to 36 % .
The poll of 1,375 adults , including 1,248 registered voters , was conducted by telephone Friday through Monday .

Dominating the news during that period -- aside from the Olympics -- was the Russian invasion of Georgia .
McCain has used the crisis to try to strengthen his hand on foreign affairs , calling for tough steps against Russia to protect U.S. interests in the region .
The survey found that 77 % of voters have confidence in McCain ’s ability to deal wisely with an international crisis , while 63 % feel that way about Obama .
On the war in Iraq , the poll ’s results were mixed .
By 48 % to 42 % , voters agree with Obama ’s stance on the war over McCain’s .
But they say McCain would be better than Obama at achieving success there , by 43 % to 36 % .
The survey found a stark contrast in how voters of different races view the campaign .
McCain has strengthened his lead among white voters , who favor him , 50 % to 37 % .
Black voters overwhelmingly prefer Obama , 84 % to 7 % .
Advertisement
Republicans , the poll found , are relatively skeptical about whether the country is ready to elect a black president , with almost a quarter saying it is not .
Nearly three in 10 Republicans also say that an Obama presidency would worsen race relations , a sentiment shared by just one in 10 Democrats .
Also noteworthy : 30 % of black voters say race relations would worsen if McCain wins ; 10 % of white voters say that .
The poll also showed a widening gender gap .
Men prefer McCain , 48 % to 40 % , while women side with Obama , 49 % to 38 % .
McCain has opened an especially wide lead among white men .
They support him over Obama , 53 % to 35 % .
Advertisement
As for issues , the nation ’s stalled economy leads the list of what voters see as top - priority problems , followed by the war in Iraq , high gasoline prices and healthcare .
Nearly half of voters say Obama has better ideas for fixing the economy and reducing gasoline prices .
They narrowly prefer Obama ’s overall energy agenda .
A majority pick Obama as the candidate who would substantially change the way things are done in Washington .
And more than two out of five think he cares more than McCain about people like them .
Voters rate McCain as best at protecting the country from terrorism .
On personal traits , just more than a third of voters agree with the statement that Obama is “ too arrogant and presumptuous . ”
Just less than a third agree with the statement that McCain , who will turn 72 next week , is too old to be president .

Previous studies have linked ageing to a lower chance of fatherhood Scientists say they have found more evidence that men as well as women have biological clocks and that they start to tick in their mid-30s .
A French study of over 12,200 couples having fertility treatment suggests the chance of a successful pregnancy falls when the man is aged over 35 .
It adds that the chance is significantly lower if he is over 40 .
Previous studies have shown that both natural and assisted conception is more difficult if the man is over 40 .
The researchers told a European reproductive health conference that it was likely the problems were caused by DNA damage in sperm .
Miscarriage risk
The researchers studied couples who had sought treatment for infertility at the Eylau Centre for Assisted Reproduction in Paris between January 2002 and December 2006 .
All were given intrauterine inseminations ( IUI ) , also known as artificial insemination , where sperm is inserted into the womb when the woman is ovulating .
It is given to couples where the woman has no fertility problems and is less invasive than IVF .
The men's sperm were examined for quantity , their ability to move and swim and their size and shape .
Rates of pregnancy , miscarriage and births were recorded .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I started my second family at 55 and now have three boys aged five , seven and eight .
Leeroy , London
In addition , the researchers analysed detailed data on the pregnancies , which allowed them to pinpoint factors associated with the man and the woman .
As expected , maternal age had an effect in women over 35 , who had a significantly higher chance of miscarriage and lower rate of pregnancy .
But the team also found that , where the father was in his late 30s , miscarriages were more common than if the man was younger .
And if a man was over 40 , the chances of a successful pregnancy were even lower .
For those couples , a third of pregnancies ended in miscarriage and only 10 % of treatments resulted in pregnancies .
' Growing evidence ' Dr Stephanie Belloc , who presented the work to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology ( ESHRE ) conference in Barcelona , said : " This research has important implications for couples wanting to start a family . "
She said such couples should be offered IVF ( where an egg is fertilised in a lab dish ) , and where the outer membrane of the egg seems to block sperm with DNA damage , and ICSI ( where a sperm is injected directly into an egg ) , where the best sperm can be selected for use .
" These methods , although not in themselves a guarantee of success , may help couples where the man is older to achieve a pregnancy more quickly , and also reduce the risk of miscarriage , " she added .
Dr Allan Pacey , a fertility expert at Sheffield University and secretary of the British Fertility Society , said : " There is growing evidence from a number of studies to show that men are not totally immune from reproductive ageing .
" Previous studies of couples trying to conceive naturally or undergoing IVF have shown that men over the age of about 40 are less fertile than younger men .
Moreover , if they do achieve a pregnancy their partners are more likely to miscarry .
" This study reinforces the message that men are n't excused from reproductive ageing . "

US Airways will remove in - flight movies from domestic flights to save about $ 10 million a year in fuel and other costs .
The carrier decided to pull the entertainment systems because the number of people paying $ 5 for headsets has dropped as money spent on jet fuel , maintenance and studio fees has climbed .
Also the video systems add about 500 pounds to a plane 's weight , increasing fuel use .
" We simply can't afford to do it anymore , " Travis Christ , US Airways vice president for sales and marketing , said Tuesday .
The systems will be turned off Nov. 1 and removed from the Airbus SAS A320 - family aircraft as the planes undergo other maintenance , the Tempe - based carrier said .
The aircraft are used to fly in the U.S. and to Mexico and the Caribbean .
Movies are shown only on flights of at least 2 1/2 hours .

On the heels of a sweeping assertion about the emotions ruling John McCain -- a claim included in a lengthy Washington Post piece on him -- there came today an equally striking character assessment of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee from none other than Karl Rove .
First , for those who missed it , the recent Post article by Robert Kaiser -- headlined " The Curious Mind of John McCain " -- included a leaps - off - the - page quote from a source identified as a senior official in Bill Clinton 's administration who worked with the Arizona senator on the Bosnia and Kosovo crises .
Said the official :
" In the many , many years that I 've been in Washington , John McCain is far and away the most emotional politician I have ever met .
... McCain is all emotion .
People do n't understand that , so they keep talking about his temperament , his temper .
He reacts emotionally , therefore unpredictably . "
Kaiser reported that the official insisted " on anonymity to avoid upsetting McCain " ( a none - too - surprising request , based on the source 's view of his acquaintance ) .
Rove 's judgment about McCain was part of an opinion piece he wrote for the Wall Street Journal headlined : " What McCain Should Do Next . "
After noting that national polls show the presidential contest much closer than it should be expected during these hard times for the GOP ( a much - commented upon dynamic of late ) , Rove walks through some pretty standard prescriptions for McCain , such as " lay out a bold domestic reform program " in the next few weeks .
But then President Bush 's one - time political guru adds this : " Then there 's character .
Mr. McCain is the most private person to run for president since Calvin Coolidge ( at left ) in the 1920s .
He needs to share ( or allow others to share ) more about him , especially his faith . "
One thing about running for president , it can serve as a substitute for seeing a shrink , given how eager others are to offer psychoanalysis ( as Barack Obama , he of the alleged " Messiah Complex , " can certainly attest ) .
" Silent " Cal Coolidge , by the way , is the subject of one of our favorite presidential anecdotes .
As recounted by his wife ( the much more outgoing and , in her time , much esteemed Grace Goodhue Coolidge ) , a young woman told the then - president at a social event that she had wagered a companion she could get at least three words out of him .
" You lose , " he replied .
Imagine the field day pundits / psychologists would have with this very definition of the taciturn New Englander today .

What should progressives say ?
That conservatism is “ fundamentally antidemocratic . ”
It “ tells us to save your own skin and not to care about your neighbor , ” so “ conservatives do n’t pay that much attention to injured veterans . ”
As an exemplar of conservatism , Lakoff cites the CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer .
It ’s hard to take all this seriously if you know any conservatives , just as it ’s hard to take Lakoff ’s neurodeterminism seriously if you know any science .
As he acknowledges , current brain - imaging technology is far too crude to see specific neural activity .
Cores ?
Narrative structures ?
Issue - to - worldview binding ?
It ’s all speculation .
Lakoff ’s historical claims are easier to assess .
They ’re demonstrably false .
In his quest to explain the 21st century , he seems to have forgotten the 20th .
He writes that progressives have opposed presidential power , that Roe v. Wade “ seemed settled ” in the early 1970s and that Democrats have neglected to preach responsibility , community and empowerment through government .
It ’s as though the New Deal , the Roe backlash and the Clinton administration never happened .
When you fancy yourself a scientist of humanity , it ’s easy to mistake the patterns of your era for natural laws .
In Lakoff ’s taxonomy , conservatives exalt “ obedience to authority , ” insulate leaders from accountability , oppose checks and balances against the president and rely on fear .
The myth of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , he writes , was “ invented by the Bush administration to strike terror into the hearts of Americans and to justify the invasion . ”
Except it was n’t .
President Clinton , Senator John Kerry and other Democrats warned of such Iraqi weapons in 1998 .
It ’s easy to forget this , since conservatives spent that year impeaching the president for lying under oath .
Then Clinton pardoned Susan McDougal , who had refused to testify about his role in the Whitewater affair .
Lakoff ignores this , even as he attributes Bush ’s commutation of Lewis Libby ’s jail sentence to authoritarianism .
And what about conservative suspicion of government ?
Is n’t that anti-authoritarian ?
Lakoff quotes Senator Bob Dole ’s mockery of the idea that “ Washington knows best , ” but he never draws the connection .
Lakoff is a puzzle .
No one has more brilliantly dissected conservative spin .
“ My goal as a scientist and a citizen is to make the cognitive unconscious as conscious as possible , ” he writes .
But each time Lakoff the scientist exposes a right - wing frame , Lakoff the citizen substitutes a left - wing frame .
First he shreds
Bush ’s depiction of Iraq as a “ war ” that can end in “ victory ” over a united “ enemy . ”
Then he repeats each of Bush ’s fallacies , oversimplifying the conflict as an “ occupation ” in which the United States is “ losing ” to a united “ resistance . ”
It ’s as though Lakoff were lobotomized .
But he is n’t .
To dismiss his politics as a brain defect would do him no more justice than he ’s done voters .
His proposal to re-engineer our heads is neither democratic nor scientifically warranted .
It defies public accountability , the very principle he purports to serve .
It also underestimates our intelligence .
The fact that brain formation materializes mind formation does n’t simplify their relationship .
To the extent that the brain is the mind ’s recorder , physical laws constrain the writing process .
But maybe the power of rationality is n’t in the writing .
Maybe it ’s in the editing .
The mind , through the brain , revises itself .
We ’re capable of changing our minds .
Just give us a good reason .
A leading member of one of the most notorious clans of the Naples mafia has been arrested while shopping in Rome .
Local media name the man as Adriano Graziano , known as " The Teacher " , who was detained without a fight as he left a designer clothes store .
Mr Graziano , of the clan of the same name , escaped capture in May when police arrested 23 alleged members .
The Grazianos are known for a bloody war against the Cava clan of the Naples mafia , also known as the Camorra .
Investigators say Mr Graziano gave the orders for an ambush which killed the mother and sister in law of the rival clan chief in 2002 .

Johnny Cash died in 2003
The daughter of late country star Johnny Cash has called the use of her father 's name to endorse a US presidential candidate " appalling " .
Country star John Rich implied Mr Cash would have backed Republican hopeful John McCain while appearing at a rally in Florida , according to media reports .
Writing on her website , Rosanne Cash called the remarks " presumptuous " .
" Even I would not presume to say publicly what I ' know ' he thought or felt , " she added .
According to the Washington Post , Mr Rich , a member of the duo Big and Rich , told a crowd of supporters in Florida : " Somebody 's got to walk the line in the country . "
" They 've got to walk it unapologetically .
And I 'm sure Johnny Cash would have been a John McCain supporter if he was still around . "
The star then went on to sing Cash 's hit , I Walk the Line .
Ms Cash , who is also a singer - songwriter , requested that in future : " My father not be co-opted in this election for either side , since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance . "
" I knew my father pretty well , at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals , " she added .
Grammy - award winner Cash sold over 90 million records and had hits with Folsom Prison Blues , Ring of Fire and Man in Black .
He died in 2003 , aged 71 .
I ’m a 35 - year old divorced woman with two cats and two dogs .
I reside in a modest house in Las Vegas , Nevada ( one of the worst real estate markets in the nation ) and also own a town home north of the city as a rental property .
I am a self - employed freelance writer and this past year faced the harsh yet necessary reality of providing my own health insurance .
I work 50 + hour work weeks doing a job I love and go to the gym without fail 5 days a week .
The daughter of a woman who chose divorce rather than stay in an unfulfilling marriage , she raised my brother , sister and me from my first day of junior high school onward .
My father is remarried to a woman who brings him joy and my siblings each pursue lives that bring them , what I hope , is happiness .
I am my own retirement plan .
There is a leak under my bathroom sink that I can’t afford to have repaired right now after a recent $ 1800 water pipe repair under my driveway .
I occasionally eat too much and frequently sleep too little .
I ’m blessed with friends like no other and only hope they feel the same about me .
My story is not unique .
Nor did I mention any of the above to be perceived as special .
I ’m like many people I know and probably more like many I ’ve never met .
But in this election year , I ’ve been humbled in realizing that it ’s not my story that counts .
It ’s yours .
I ’ve been politically apathetic for many years now , having only voted in the last Presidential race for Kerry to avoid the chance of NOT canceling - out a vote for Bush in the State of California .
I can remain silent no longer , and once again , I realize that it ’s not my vote that counts , it ’s yours .
As a woman , I ’m appalled that the Republican Party feels that Governor Sarah Palin is any substitute for Hillary Rodham Clinton .
I also mourn each disaffected Hillary fan who defects and casts a ballot for Palin ’s ticket in November out of spite .
Spite is no overtone to invoke in the running a successful business – and the business of our nation ’s future is at hand .
This blog , while occasionally humorous and purely reactionary to the addition of Palin to the GOP ticket , has stirred in me THIS entry , which goes forth to tell my government all I ask in this election year .
It is meant to be non-partisan and without political endorsement , but moreso thought - provoking for each and every eye that stumbles across this page .
Perhaps you ’ll find something in my voice that will inspire you to use yours .
Forward this to a friend , tweet it , stumble it , digg it , repost it .
Click away from it .
But as you do any of the above , all I ask is that you form an opinion .
As I can only hope that , like me , you can remain indifferent no longer .
All I ask is the following :
That my government never turns its back on the men and women who serve our country in the Armed Forces .
That my elected leaders choose cabinet members who are as skilled policymakers as their campaign speech writers are at choosing the right combination of words .
That my government allows me to raise my family without legislated religious influence , giving me the credit due for being an intelligent human being and my capability to choose what ’s best for my loved ones within the limits of the law .
That my government spend more time addressing the climate crisis and need for energy reform than it does trying to get into my uterus .
If my social life were as active as the moral majority ’s anti Roe -v- Wade stance , you ’d call me a whore .
That my government enacts policy that will support our public schools and charter schools , paying teachers a wage that allows them to exist above the poverty line .
That if my government is going to preach about the glass ceiling , that it respect the collective intelligence of our nation ’s women in the process .
To excel in society is not a right , but a privilege earned by grasping opportunity .
Speak to our nation about opportunity , not glass ceilings .
Speak to me about those who have earned their achieved rungs on the ladder , as opposed to those who have been perched for show like a beauty queen .
not glass ceilings .
Speak to me about those who have their achieved rungs on the ladder , as opposed to those who have been perched for show like a beauty queen .
Whatever your vision of family may be , that you understand that family begins at home .
Spending more time with your family is never a burden , and perhaps we should lead by example .
No two families are alike and nor can we say any family ’s choice is truly right or wrong .
But if you ’re preaching a party line of family values , make sure that you ’re not talking out of both sides of your red , white and blue mouth .
Is that politicians do not try to delude me in making me think it ’s a Presidential Race .
It is a team race .
We are to vote for a team : President and Vice President .
In this election year where we look to elect the first American of African descent or a 72 year - old man with a troubling medical history to our nation ’s highest office , we must understand both sides of the coin .
Do we trust , fully and honestly , that should we experience the unthinkable — the alternative is capable of leading our nation and working cohesively with Congress and the international leadership community ?

In this election year where we look to elect the or a to our nation ’s highest office , .
Do we trust , fully and honestly , that should we experience the unthinkable — the alternative is capable of leading our nation and working cohesively with Congress and the international leadership community ?
That when I look at my friends , black , Islam , Hindi , white , gay , straight , transgender , Christian , Jewish , Hispanic , atheist , divorced , single , married , widowed , wealthy , middle - class , struggling , employed , unemployed , male or female , that I know each will be able to visit their loved ones in a hospital and join with them legally to make life decisions .
That while socialized medicine may not be the answer to better health opportunities , my government stop speaking and start acting on promoting affordable health care .
I ’m a 35 year - old woman who orders medication from Canada every 90 days because it saves me over $ 100 / month .
I am fortunate for Canada these days .
America – make me fortunate for your health care reform .
That while there will always be hate , intolerance , prejudice and discrimination , that my government will not be the one to promote it through a legislative agenda , no matter how “ morally motivated ” it might be .
Now , I ask that you vote on November 4th .

David Gracer is a guy that thinks consuming insects is both pleasing to the palate and good for the planet .
He ’s a bug eater and likes his creatures sautéed , filleted and roasted .
Most importantly , Gracer thinks we all should do it .
Though most societies associate insects with an unclean creature that cause diseases , entomologist Florence Dunkel said that this is just “ a social aversion ” .
In fact insects are not prone to disease more than cows , pigs , chicken or fish , but they ( all ) require proper preparation .
David Gracer recommends the “ giant water bug ”
Considering that over - fishing may lead to the collapse of global fish stocks in 40 years , we may turn our heads to insects pretty soon .
They provide far more edible proteins per pound of feed as cattle which means it passes the test of being environmental sustainable .
“ Insects can feed the world .
Cows and pigs are the SUV’s , bugs are the bicycles . ”
Gracer said .
We all choose a bicycle over a SUV , right ?
David Gracer also said that from now on it ’s hisduty to persuade ordinary Americans to eat insects .
The diabetes drug Byetta , marketed by Eli Lilly & Company and Amylin Pharmaceuticals , was linked to four more deaths in patients with pancreatitis , adding to two deaths announced by federal regulators last week .
No definite relationship between Byetta and the deaths has been proved , and the Food and Drug Administration was aware of the additional deaths when it made its announcement last week , Amylin ’s chief executive , Dan Bradbury , said on Tuesday .
The company is talking with the F.D.A. about adding warnings on the drug ’s prescribing information .
Byetta is Amylin ’s leading product .

As you may have heard , last night Barack Obama and Bill Clinton had their first phone conversation since the contentious Democratic primary effectively ended .
“ We did not belabor the primary season , ” Obama told reporters today .
“ I think what we both acknowledged is , is that when you ’re in a tough primary battle you say things that afterward you may end up thinking , that may have been a little intemperate .
But that ’s the nature of political campaigns . ”
It ’s understandable that Obama would be oblique , but he should know that the verybill that he supports will continue to allow exactly the kind of wiretapping that we used tothe conversation !
Oh , busted by your own move to the center , Obama .
We ’ve reproduced what we heard below :
Hello ?
Hey Hill , Obama here .
Barack , it ’s three in the morning !
Oh , sorry .
I thought you ’d be prepared .
Anyway , I think it ’s time I cleared things up with Bill , could you put him on ?
Good luck with .
[ Long pause ]
Hello ?!Hey Bill , this is Barack Obama .
Look , I think we should settle our differences so this party can finally unify .
We need you on our side to win in November .
You said a lot of mean things about me , Barack .
You tried to taint my legacy .
You tried to make me out to be some kind of racist .
I was the first black president !
Not literally … Are you calling Toni Morrison a
Barack : Bill , you tried to downplay my viability and broad appeal by comparing me to Jesse Jackson .
Bill :
Now that is a fairy tale .
I never did that .
Barack : Anyway , I think we need to put all of this behind us and move on .
Your wife certainly has .
Bill : Can she be vice - president ?
Barack : Look , Hillary ran a groundbreaking campaign , and created opportunities for millions of women , including my daughters , that were never before possible .
And I respect her service and devotion to her country , and look forward to working with her to achieve the goals that we both have strived so hard for .
Obviously anyone with her accomplishments would be on anyone ’s short list for vice - president , and as I continue to weigh my options going forward —
Bill : Okay , you can stop .
She does n’t want it , anyway .
Barack : Thank God .
Bill :
Well , what about me ?
Barack :
What about you ?
Bill :
What would my role be in your administration ?
Barack : I could send you as a reassuring presence to areas hit by natural disasters around the globe : tsunamis , mudslides , earthquakes , famines …
Bill :
That sounds terrible .
Barack : Yeah , um , how about ambassador to the U.N. ?
Bill : What about Secretary - General of the U.N. ?
Barack : I ca n’t just install you as Secretary - General of the U.N.
I think everyone has to vote on that .
Bill : Fine .
But you ’d better come through — I expect you to follow through on your promises .
[ Pause .
They both crack up . ]
Barack : Woo !
Great .
Listen , Bill , one more thing .
Bill : Yeah ?
Barack :
When you ’re out there campaigning for me , stick to the script , okay ?
Try to stay calm , do n’t fly off the —
Bill :
Fly off the handle , yeah , I know , I know .
Why does everyone keep telling me that ?
Barack : Maybe just try wearing more makeup .
So you do n’t seem so , you know , um …
Bill : Angry ?
Barack : I was going to say , red .
Bill : Now who ’s getting racial ?
Barack : I never thought I ’d say this , but can you please put Hillary back on the phone ?

Contrary to popular myth , the men who signed the Declaration of Independence were not great Americans .
Instead , they were great Englishmen .
In fact , they were as much English citizens as Americans today are American citizens .
It ’s easy to forget that the revolutionaries in 1776 were people who took up arms against their own government .
So how is it that these men are considered patriots ?
Well , the truth is that their government did n’t consider them patriots at all .
Their government considered them to be bad guys — traitors , all of whom deserved to be hanged for treason .
Most of us consider the signers of the Declaration of Independence to be patriots because of their courage in taking a stand against the wrongdoing and tyranny of their own government , even risking their lives in the process .
Yet not even the patriotism and courage of these English citizens constitutes the foremost significance of the Fourth of July , any more than the military victory over their government ’s forces at Yorktown does .
Instead , the real significance of the Fourth of July lies in the expression of what is undoubtedly the most revolutionary political declaration in history : that man ’s rights are inherent , God -given , and natural and , thus , do not come from government .
Throughout history , people have believed that their rights come from government .
Such being the case , people have n’t objected whenever government officials infringed upon their rights .
Since rights were considered to be government - bestowed privileges , the thinking went , why should n’t government officials have the power to regulate or suspend such privileges at will ?
The Declaration of Independence upended that age - old notion of rights .
All men — not just Americans — have been endowed by God and nature , not government , with fundamental and unalienable rights .
Governments are called into existence by the people — and exist at their pleasure — for one purpose : to protect the exercise of these inherent rights .
What happens if a government that people have established becomes a destroyer , rather than a protector , of their rights ?
The Declaration provides the answer :
It is the right of the people to alter or even abolish their government and establish new government whose purpose is the protection , not the destruction , of people ’s rights and freedoms .
The Constitution and the Bill of Rights must be construed in light of that revolutionary statement of rights in the Declaration of Independence .
The American people used the Constitution to bring the federal government into existence but also , simultaneously , they used that document to limit the government ’s powers to those expressly enumerated in the Constitution .
With the Constitution , people limited the powers of their own government in a formal , structured way , with the aim of protecting their rights and freedoms from being infringed upon by that same government .
Why did Americans deem it desirable and necessary to limit the powers of the federal government ?
Because they feared the possibility that their new government would become like their former government against which they had had to take up arms .
While they recognized the necessity for government — as a means to protect their rights — they also recognized that the federal government was the greatest threat to their rights .
By severely limiting the powers of the federal government to those enumerated within the Constitution , the Framers intended to encase the federal government within a straitjacket .
Even that was not sufficient for the American people , however .
As a condition for approving the Constitution , they demanded passage of the Bill of Rights , which emphasized two deeply held beliefs : ( 1 ) that the federal government , not some foreign entity , constitutes the greatest threat to the rights and liberties of the American people ; and ( 2 ) that the enumeration of specific rights and liberties , both substantive and procedural , would better ensure their protection from federal infringement .
On the Fourth of July we celebrate the patriotism and courage of those English revolutionaries who were willing to pledge their lives , fortunes , and sacred honor in defense of the most revolutionary declaration of rights in history — that man ’s rights come from God and nature , not from government .

I picked up a sheet of 1,000 hitsa while back and after it was gone I found 4 hits underneath my desk and set them aside .
The odd thing about this sheet was it was stained peculiarly on the back , and under a black light the lighter stained parts glowed much brighter than others .
I had only taken 2 hits from it and found it disappointingly underwhelming .
Then , last Monday , I found out that a band I liked ( Ratatat ) was playing half a mile away that night .
I 'd been up for 60 hours from insomnia but my friend talked me into going after all .
I needed something to wake me up and remembered that acid while exhausted always wipes the exhaustion away .
Part I : The Come Up9:45 pm : I took 1 hit and took a shower and got dressed .
10:25 pm : I was feeling great and having fun coming up so I took a second .
10:45 pm : Still feeling awesome , I took a third hit .
11:00 pm : My friend backs out of the concert he convinced me to go to because it cost $ 15 and he said that was too much .
From 11 - 12 pm or so I went into my office , put milkdrop on the monitor , and laid back on a futon to enjoy it .
Before long the visuals were coming off the monitor , and shortly after , the entire room was patterned like milkdrop .
Around 12 pm I got up to answer some instant messages .
A few minutes into a conversation I had to tell my friend to hold on because it was hard to read the screen since a song I 'm emotionally connected to was playing .
He mentioned something about synesthesia being neat , and I realized that I really was ' seeing ' the music , to the point that I could n't read the screen during some songs .
I 've never had such synesthesia before .
Around this time my girlfriend ( Demented Faith ) went to bed and I went into the living room where my roommate ( Tacolobster ) was watching television .
I was slowly descending into my own world and beginning to be concerned about the intensity .
I started thinking about acquiring some benzos but held back because I did n't want people to think that * I* needed benzos to control a trip .
This was foolish of me .
As I was descending into complete ego loss , I decided to ask Tacolobster , just as she was going to bed .
I got on aim and tried to ask her quickly .
What came out was :'i'm sorry becky'wwwwwwzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
'The timestamp on that IM marked the precise moment that my mind abandoned our reality and entered a world of its own .
Part II : A Brief ( long ) History of LifeBy 1 am ( + 2:15 ) I was tripping harder from 3 hitsthan I had off of 15 strong hitsBy 1:30 am I had descended into complete , blackout - inducing , ego loss , where I remained until the blackouts finally began decreasing in frequency around 9am .
I had finally begun to come down .
During this period I would frequently black out and come to in a different room of my house , entirely unaware of where I was or what I was doing ( according to third party accounts of my behavior ) .
As best I can tell , I began my journey by reliving the history of life up until the present .
This may sound fun , but it 's a fucking long history .
The first moments of life were terrifying .
The fear and loneliness I felt were overwhelming .
There was confusion , fear , solitude and blackness .
Nothing else .
This went on for a terribly long period of time .
Eventually , other organisms emerged , all feeling the same way .
Some had the courage to venture into the blackness , to grow and expand their influence .
They died .
The next wave ventured more cautiously , seeing the failures before them , and survived to expand .
Survival was tenuous and uncertain  fear was the only emotion life knew in its infancy .
Like this , life slowly expanded until it was no longer so alone .
Single - celled organisms formed groups for survival , some competing , others cooperating .
Specialization began , colonies emerged , and evolution began its slow walk towards humanity .
A new emotion was introduced  a feeling of comfort , a feeling that seemed to say ,  How wonderful it is to not be so terribly alone any more !
All the while I kept the perspective of a single - celled organism , through millions of years as the colony of protests began more and more specialized .
Eventually it outgrew the label of colony as the first species of multi-cellular life emerged .
I started to feel pride in being part of something greater , and pride at how unlikely and how amazing it was that life had survived to reach this stage , against all odds .
When I finally reached the present , I was imbued with a strong , non-verbal thought that did not originate from my mind .
It conveyed , somehow , that : ' This is what it took to get where you are now .
Respect this .' Part III : God , Speaking On The Subject of Life : fuckHaving caught up with the present , my perspective shifted to that of God .
As an aside , I 'm a pantheist and feel very strongly about my beliefs .
Pantheism ( Greek : π , ά , ν , ( ' pan ' ) = all and θ , ε , ό , ς , ( ' theos ' ) = God ) literally means ' God is All ' and ' All is God ' .
It is the view that everything is of an all - encompassing immanent abstract God , or that the universe , or nature , and God are equivalent .
More detailed definitions tend to emphasize the idea that natural law , existence , and the universe ( the sum total of all that is , was , and shall be ) is represented or personified in the theological principle of an abstract ' god ' .
It was around 4 am in the real world by now , I had been alone for 2 - 3 hours when I saw the world through god 's eyes .
The first thought I had as God was ' fuck .
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck .
fucking fuck . '
You see , God fucked up .
He did n't think ahead .
Life had begun , and it was good ... until God realized he had no way to terminate life .
Evolution would proceed , in this universe , indefinitely .
Perfection can never be obtained , and life will just keep running ... forever ... a process begun without a possible end point .
Life , it seemed to God ( me ) , was a program that would never terminate naturally .
I 'd soon find out why this was such a ' fuck ' from God 's point of view .
Part IV : An Eternity Is A Long TimeBy about 5 am I became preoccupied with a thought that would dominate the rest of the trip , and distress me to no end .
I was more God than ever , and aware that as God I consisted of 4 aspects , only 2 of which are visible in my body 's reality ( those two being male and female ) .
The four aspects of God worked together , but each had their own personality .
The female aspect was represented as my girlfriend , the male as myself , and the other two do n't exist in this world and there 's no way I can describe them .
I also saw that reality consisted of 4 quasi - independent and supersymmetrical ' branes ' ( reality bubbles ) .
What happened in one reality had an equal and opposite effect on its complement , keeping the whole in balance .
Hmm
It 's hard to explain further without getting into physics and symmetry ....
There are 3 basic symmetries in the world , C ( particle / antiparticle ) P ( parity ) and T ( time ) .
Charge is particle / antiparticle , parity is the symmetry of interactions under spatial inversion , and Time is just time .
What 's interesting is if you reversed the CHARGE of the universe and reversed the PARITY of the universe and reversed the TIME ( flow ) of the universe , those 3 changes would result in exactly no difference whatsoever ( in terms of the laws of physics ) .
Reversing C and T breaks symmetry , as does P and T , but reversing both C and P ( but not T ) yields a nearly identical universe .
Supersymmetry theorizes that there 's a fourth fundamental symmetry between fermions and bosons ( which may be proven in late 2007 when the new supercollider is finished ) .
I 'd go into more detail but it either gets complicated or I do n't understand it enough to explain it .
Anyway , just as there were 4 aspects of God ( the universe , in my belief system ) , there are 4 fundamental forces and 4 fundamental symmetries , and 4 fundamental realities .
As God , I knew that life began because of the big bang ... because there was a point in time where all 4 aspects of the universe were one , the four parts combined somehow created life ( or the conditions necessary for it ) , just before blowing apart .
This made it impossible for life to be changed once it began , it could only run its natural course .
Furthermore , as God , while I was aware of 4 parts of myself , only the two that exist in our reality were accessible to me ( male / female ) .
The other two , I was aware of them and their doings , but we could n't communicate .
My thoughts , as God , were entirely preoccupied ( to the point of insanity ) with finding a way to change reality so that the four aspects of myself could convene and figure out a way for life to ' end ' .
Let me explain ' change reality '... as God I had access to and control over the history of the universe from the moment following the big bang when we separated until the present .
I could also see the changes in the future that changes in the past / present caused .
My time was consumed with making minute changes to reality and then observing the results ... probing future realities and potential realities to see if there was any possible way to re-unite myself ( and terminate evolution ) in the future .
Every change was a failure , I felt insane , frustrated , tormented and trapped .
During this period I was aware of my identity as a human , and was concerned with the fact that I ( God ) was embodying a vessel that was not mine .
I could remember facts about my human self , but they were like facts about a stranger ... mostly meaningless and disconnected from myself .
Part V : In Which I Grow Closer To RealityBy now it was 8 am , and I was once again seeing my house .
But it was n't my house ... at least , things were wrong .
Things that leaned right leaned left .
The TV was on The Price is Right , but time was moving in a very peculiar ( and disturbing , I might add ) manner .
The episode began with the final spin , at the very end .
Starting at the end , 15 - 30 seconds of the show played normally , and then it would skip backwards about 2 minutes at a time .
I watched the entire episode , final spin to first contestant , in this manner .
As if this werent a disturbing enough Price is Right experience , there was one other facet that wasnt quite right .
Bob Barker , in his infinite wisdom , decided itd be cool if he projected my inner monologue through the television .
From 8 am to 12 pm
I was half in the real world and half out of it .
I kept shifting reality to try to make it right again .
Sometimes I could half - see the other 3 realities superimposed on mine , and the changes my shifts were enacting over there .
Sometimes I 'd change things and nothing much would change .
Sometimes I 'd change things and a cat would go CRAZY .
One time I changed things and the cat tried to mate with me .
I saw where that future went , it was n't a compatible match .
I changed reality again , and again , and again ...
All the while I had with me a horrible fear from the first part of my ego loss .
When life had just begun , a lack of movement eventually led to the cold clutches of death .
I remained terrified of staying still throughout the trip .
When lying down , I moved my legs ( to keep the warmth of friction , and thus life ... ) .
Eventually I shifted reality in a way that felt right .
Suddenly it occurred to me that I had a bottle of anti-psychotics in a drawer .
I took two 5 mg pills of Zyprexa ( olanzapine ) and collapsed .
In thirty minutes I was out and slept for 24 hours with a 2 - hour interruption .
This was around 1 pm , or +14:15 .
Part VI : AftermathIt 's taken me over a week to make enough sense of that trip to even attempt to describe it .
There 's just as much that I left out because it was too weird or too hard to verbalize as there is posted here .
This trip completely fucked my mind up the ass and left it tied naked to a tree in the woods .
I tripped much , much harder off those 3 hits than I did when I tripped off the 15 hits , though many similar themes or identical themes were present .
I feel like acid mind raped me to show me that it still could .
The end for now
( CNN ) -- Pond scum .
The thought typically evokes images that leave most people cringing , but it may one day occupy an important role in the nation 's energy supply .
Algae needs only sunlight , carbon dioxide , nutrients and water to grow .
The current fuel crunch , driven fundamentally by a rising global demand for oil , has spurred debate among consumers , political leaders , academics and entrepreneurs about plausible alternatives .
A good bit of the discussion has focused on biofuels , commonly defined as energy derived largely from plants and crops like corn , soybeans , switch grass among other sources .
" It 's become obvious that the biofuels sector is much more viable now that the prices of oil are high , " said Beth Ahner , an expert in biological and environmental engineering at Cornell University .
Algae , thought of as pond scum by many people , is an intriguing biofuel prospect , some researchers and entrepreneurs say .
CNN.com producer Cody McCloy , who 's driving across the United States in a biofueled diesel - powered vehicle , is a fan of algae - based fuel , after running it much of the day on Monday during his travels through California .
See comparison of different alternative vehicle fuels »
" There 's no difference running algae than there is running any other biodiesel fuel , " says McCloy .
" I 've noticed very little difference in any of the biofuels that I run in this car or in my 1984 diesel Mercedes that I run at home . "
McCloy says he gets a little lower gas mileage occasionally , but biofuel generally runs smoother than diesel .
See McCloy 's road trip blog
Algae does not need arable land , grows quickly and according to experts has low impact on the environment .
Questions remain , however , about the cost of producing algae on a scale large enough to act as a practical alternative to oil for the nation 's energy needs .
The simplest explanation of how it works follows this way :
Some strains of algae contain high concentrations of oil when compared to other biofuel sources .
The specific strains are isolated and then harvested in large quantifies in pond systems or bioreactors .
The oil is then extracted , processed and refined into fuel that has the potential for a variety of uses .
The production of algae has several positives , expert say .
Algae , at the most basic level , needs only sunlight , carbon dioxide , nutrients and water to grow .
And though the pond and reactor systems needed for the mass production of algae require land , algae does not need land to live and grow .
Consequently , a company could set up a facility in land not used for farming , like , say , a desert .
" You 're not taking space that you grow food crops in and converting them over to a biofuel , " Ahner said .
Algae also grows quickly , doubling in size in about a day .
Additionally , it has the potential to help mitigate some of the carbon emissions produced by automobiles , households and industries because it consumes carbon dioxide , its proponents say .
But is algae , the simple - celled legend of grade - school textbooks , suitable for production on an industrial scale ?
" I think that 's the million dollar question , " Ahner said .
There are considerable challenges standing in the way
One is maintaining the " ecological stability " of the algae strains being harvested for oil in pond systems , Ahner said .
The strains can be can be contaminated by bacteria , viruses and other algae .
You want to " control and manage that because one of the last things you 'd want to have happen is a virus come in and wipe out your monoculture , " she said .
The biggest obstacle might be the technical and economic viability of setting up and maintaining the infrastructure need for mass production of algae .
The Colorado - based National Renewable Energy Laboratory , a division of the Energy Department , spent more than 15 years researching the promise of algae - based fuel .
The project closed in 1996 after the NREL concluded the costs were too high for practical use .
The price of oil at the time was about $ 20 a barrel .
A 2004 study by Michael Briggs at the University of New Hampshire , using an NREL model for algae production , estimated a cost of $ 308 billion to build enough farms in the United States to " replace petroleum transportation fuels with biodiesel . "
An additional $ 46 billion would be needed to maintain them , the study concluded .
In the wake of the current energy crisis , those numbers are beginning to look like a bargain .
The United States imported more than 10 million barrels a day last year at an average price of $ 72 a barrel and the average price of crude oil has hovered above $ 100 dollars a barrel for the past few months , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Though large - scale viability remains unclear , big companies and venture capitalists are nevertheless looking in earnest at the possibility of algae - based energy .
Chevron and the NREL announced a joint research venture in October 2007 , and Royal Dutch Shell announced a month later it was building a facility in Hawaii .
In addition , companies like Colorado - based Solix and Massachusetts - based GreenFuel Technologies have been at it for years .
Though Ahner says questions over algae 's viability may not be answered for a few more years , in light of the current energy policy rethink she says , " Now is the time to try and find some solutions . "

For more than five hours on the afternoon of April 4 the man who sees himself as synonymous with the destiny of Zimbabwe , and who has made himself the country ’s dictator to ensure it , remained locked in a meeting in Harare , the capital , with his four - dozen - member politburo .
The man was Robert Mugabe , Zimbabwe ’s president , and the session was taking place in the upper reaches of the ruling party ’s headquarters , Jongwe House .
Everyone in Harare knew that Mugabe had to be up there ; the soldiers of his presidential guard were still lolling around outside , in their distinctive gold berets .
Mugabe was chairing the meeting himself , in a dark suit and polka - dotted tie .
On Mugabe ’s flanks were the men and women who fought victoriously with him 28 years ago to transform white - ruled Rhodesia into black - ruled Zimbabwe .
Now , six days after elections for parliament and president , this group was facing certain defeat .
Although the government had not yet officially announced the results , and despite strenuous efforts to rig the election , it was clear that Mugabe ’s zanu - P.F. party had lost not only its parliamentary majority but the presidency as well .
The purpose of the meeting was to decide whether to accept the loss gracefully and relinquish power to Mugabe ’s bitter rival , the Movement for Democratic Change ( M.D.C. ) , led by Morgan Tsvangirai ( pronounced Chahn - gur - eye ) , or to fight on , manipulating the results so as to force a second round of voting for the presidency .
Mugabe ’s party is divided now between hawks and doves , between hard - liners and conciliators , and it is riven as well by rival succession candidates .
Mugabe ’s clan totem is Gushungo — meaning “ crocodile ” in Shona , the language of most Zimbabweans — and on the occasion of his 83rd birthday , last year , a giant stuffed crocodile was presented to him as a symbol of his “ majestic authority . ”
But even the wiliest crocodiles eventually tire and die , and the word on the street was that he had been stung by the extent of his defeat , and that his young wife , Grace , had urged him to step down and enjoy his last years with their three children in his 25 - bedroom mansion .
The mood in Harare was expectant , even giddy .
I grew up and was educated in Zimbabwe , served as a conscript , and maintain close ties to the country .
Because of these roots I have been able to live and travel there even at times , such as the present , when other foreign journalists have been expelled .
In Harare that afternoon I spent time with friends as the hours wore on .
Finally an old school chum called to say that “ the General ” — his uncle , a politburo member and a former guerrilla commander — had at last emerged from Jongwe House , and that the meeting was over .
The General , Solomon Mujuru , is now considered a “ moderate , ” but he was not ever thus .
Twenty - five years ago , not long after the end of the war of liberation , the General had once put a gun to my heart and threatened to kill me .
The gun was a Russian - made Tokarev with a mother - of - pearl handle .
Odd how you remember such details .
The General had been working his way through a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label at the time , but his grip was steady .
This was in 1984 , during the Matabeleland massacres , when Mugabe unleashed his fearsome North Korea–trained Fifth Brigade into that southern province to crush the opposition .
I had written about the massacres for a British newspaper , which is what prompted the General to draw his gun when our paths crossed .
But now , on April 4 , the General had bad news to report .
In the end Mugabe had decided that he intended to do everything necessary to retain his powers .
Behind the scenes the presidential ballot boxes would be effectively stuffed to indicate that Morgan Tsvangirai , though still winning more votes than Mugabe , had not achieved the 50 percent threshold necessary for election .
( This was possible because there had been a third candidate in the race . )
Further , in the weeks leading up to the runoff , Mugabe would wage a campaign of bloody intimidation to ensure that Zimbabwe ’s voters understood where their self - interest lay .
Indeed , a secret battle plan was actually drawn up , in detail .
A leaked copy dated April 9 was shown to me ; the key section carried the heading “ Covert Operations to Decompose the Opposition . ”
The thing about financial crises is that they never fail to affect everyone .
Just because your entire investment portfolio did n't implode when the dotcom bubble burst does n't mean that you were n't laid off like thousands of other people .
Did n't get sucked into a subprime mortgage ?
Lucky you .
You still need to watch your back , because your fiscal responsibility does n't mean that you 're safe from the crisis fallout .
Our economy is in the midst of a serious slide ( bordering on a full - fledged recession ) .
The causes for it are numerous , but the subprime mortgage crisis is causing some of the most accute problems .
One of these problems is that your credit card company might decide to raise your interest rates .
How is this different from the way credit card companies usually behave ?
The problem is that now , credit card companies are going to start raising interest rates for customers with an excellent credit history .
Why ?
Because banks are hurting financially .
Their problems are two - fold and causal :
Banks are losing millions on defaulted subprime mortgages .
Americans have been running up huge credit card bills in the past few years , with the assumption that a home equity loan could be secured to pay off the personal debt .
Now that home equity loans are difficult to get , credit card delinquencies are on the rise .
This means that banks need to make some money , stat .
How do they plan on doing this ?
They 're going to raise interest rates on new and existing lines of credit and charge you even more in junk fees .
It does n't matter to banks that you 're a good customer with a good credit standing .
What matters to banks is their bottom line , and the only way they can think of to prevent more massive financial losses this year is to rip off their remaining customers .
The result is that banks are looking for reasons to consider you an " at- risk " customer .
Traditionally , at - risk customers are usually customers who run up a huge debt , pay late , only make minimum payments ( although this is a tough one , as banks also LOVE you for only making minimum payments ) , or who have delinquent accounts .
But now that banks and credit card companies are faltering , they 're willing to look for all kinds of other at - risk factors , such as :
Paying for necessities , like food , gas , or your mortgage , using credit .
Buying items that are n't considered high - quality , like retread tires ( that 's right - according to Robert Manning , your credit card company is monitoring your purchases and will raise your rates if they think your purchases indicate that you are entering a time of financial difficulty ) .
Paying your bill too close to the deadline .
This is bad news for people who buy everything on credit in order to earn air miles or other bonus rewards .
It 's also drastically unfair and an incredible invasion of privacy .
It 's also another example of how we all end up paying for the collective financial stupidity of a few rogue investment bankers and mortgage lenders ( yeah , I 'm looking at you , Countrywide ) .
Although you are always supposed to keep an eye on your credit rates , be especially vigilant in the comings months - check every statement for bogus fees and unnecessary rate hikes .
You may consider not purchasing items like groceries with a credit card for the considerable future .
Be sure to call and harangue your credit card company if they try to peg you as at - risk despite a clean payment record .
Try to pay your credit card bill at least three days in advance of the due date , if not significantly sooner .
Tedious though it may be , close monitoring of your statements can save you hundreds of dollars in the long run .
Getting Away With Murder
50 Years of the Armed Forces ( Special Powers ) Act
August 2008 Number 1
They kept on pouring water into my nostrils until the water came out in my ears ; it felt warm inside my ears .
Then they stamped on both my thighs while two persons held my feet while another man sat on my head
They touched the wires  ends to my chest and gave me shocks three times .
Each time I felt as if my whole body had contracted ...
I keep remembering how they used to beat me and see everything that happened to me vividly .
− 14 - year - old child tortured by Indian soldiers in the northeastern state of Manipur1
In August 2008 , India celebrates 61 years of independence and democracy .
But many are lamenting another anniversary : 50 years of the Armed Forces ( Special Powers ) Act ( AFSPA or  the Act ) .
Enacted on August 18 , 1958 , as a short - term measure to allow deployment of the army to counter an armed separatist movement in the Naga Hills , the AFSPA has now been in force for five decades in states in Indias northeast .
Similar laws have also been used in Punjab and in Jammu and Kashmir .
The AFSPA gives the armed forces wide powers to shoot to kill , arrest on flimsy pretext , conduct warrantless searches , and demolish structures in the name of aiding civil power . 
Equipped with these special powers , soldiers have raped , tortured , disappeared ,  and killed Indian citizens for five decades without fear of being held accountable .
The Act violates provisions of international human rights law , including the right to life , the right to be protected from arbitrary arrest and detention , and the right to be free from torture and cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment .
It also denies the victims of the abuses the right to a remedy .
The best 61st Independence Day present for the people of India would be a repeal of this draconian legislation .
The AFSPA is based on a 1942 British ordinance intended to contain the Indian independence movement during the Second World War .
A new ordinance was adopted by the Indian government in May 1958 , then endorsed by parliament in August 1958 , and given presidential assent on September 11 , 1958 .
Concerned legislators warned the Indian government at the time that human rights violations would ensue .
Describing it as a lawless law during the parliamentary debate , Laishram Achaw Singh , a member from Manipur , said that the AFSPA would only harass innocent folk and deteriorate the situation .
2
Initially the AFSPA applied only to the northeast territories of Assam and Manipur and was aimed at containing an armed rebellion by Naga militants .
In a 1972 amendment , the AFSPA was extended to each of the seven new states created in the region : Assam , Manipur , Meghalaya , Nagaland , Tripura , Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh .3
Similar laws were also applied to counter militancy in Punjab from 1985 to 1994.4 A version of the Act has been active in Jammu and Kashmir since 1990.5
The powers that the AFSPA extends to the armed forces come into force once an area subject to the Act has been declared disturbed  by the central or state government .
This declaration is not subject to judicial review .
6
The right to life is violated by section 4 ( a ) of the AFSPA , which grants the armed forces power to shoot to kill in law enforcement situations without regard to international human rights law restrictions on the use of lethal force .
Lethal force is broadly permitted under the AFSPA if the target is part of an assembly of five or more persons , holding weapons , or carrying things capable of being used as weapons . 
The terms assembly  and weapon are not defined .
7
The right to liberty and security of person is violated by section 4 ( c ) of the AFSPA , which fails to protect against arbitrary arrest by allowing soldiers to arrest anyone merely on suspicion that a cognizable offence has already taken place or is likely to take place in the future .
Further , the AFSPA provides no specific time limit for handing arrested persons to the nearest police station .
Section 5 of the AFSPA vaguely advises that those arrested be transferred to police custody with the least possible delay .
8
The right to remedy is violated by section 6 of the AFSPA , which provides officers who abuse their powers under the AFSPA with immunity from legal accountability .
This section of the AFSPA prohibits even state governments from initiating legal proceedings against the armed forces on behalf of their population without central government approval .
Since such a sanction is seldom granted , it has in effect provided a shield of immunity for armed forces personnel implicated in serious abuses .
9
In practice the AFSPA also facilitates violation of the right to be free from torture , and from cruel or degrading treatment .
10 Since the AFSPA provides powers to arrest without warrant and then detain arrested persons for unspecified amounts of time , the armed forces routinely engage in torture and other ill - treatment during interrogation in army barracks .
11
Areas declared disturbed  under the AFSPA over the past 50 years vary significantly according to their conflict history , ethnic constituency , and levels of militancy .
However , all these areas share a common experience of widespread human rights abuses during the imposition of the AFSPA .
The AFSPA has also had the opposite effect to that intended by the Indian government : in each state where the AFSPA has been implemented and soldiers have been deployed , the armed forces have become a symbol of oppression and an object of hate .12
Human rights violations have served to fuel conflicts and act as a recruiting sergeant for militant groups in many parts of the country .
Arbitrary detention , torture , and the killing of peaceful critics have had the effect of closing democratic and peaceful paths of opposition , forcing organizations underground and fueling a growth in militancy .
13
It is estimated that over 70 armed opposition groups may be operating across the northeast alone .
14 While the conflict has died down in Punjab , there are numerous militant groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir .
Many militant groups have been responsible for human rights abuses , including torture , indiscriminate killings with bombs and landmines , hostage taking , and targeted attacks upon civilians regarded as enemies .
Human Rights
Watch has called on all militant groups to cease attacking civilians and ensure compliance with international humanitarian law .
In Arunachal Pradesh , the areas that border with Assam have been declared disturbed .
15 Violence in the state is largely directed toward the Chakma and Hajong tribal populations that migrated from Bangladesh ( then East Pakistan ) in the 1960s .
16
In addition to the local anti-immigrant movement , insurgent groups from neighboring Assam and Nagaland reportedly have a significant presence , particularly in the Changlang district .
Many civilians have been victims of violence committed by militants from neighboring states and by the security forces .
17 For example , Indian security forces assaulted villagers of Borduria during a search for National Socialist Council of Nagaland ( NSCN ) militants on June 5 , 2002.18
Assam
Although parts of Assam came under AFSPA in 1958 , the entire state of Assam was declared a disturbed area in November 1990 when fresh violence started in the state .
19 Militancy first broke out in 1979 with the emergence of the United Liberation Front of Assam ( ULFA ) , established in reaction to large - scale immigration from Bangladesh .
ULFA remains the principal insurgent group in Assam .
A second round of insurgency emerged in the 1980s with the Bodo tribal groups calling for a separate state .
This movement is led principally by the National Democratic Front of Bodoland ( NDFB ) .20 Despite peace processes engaging insurgent groups and the Indian government , violence remains common in Assam .
The armed forces carry out abuses in the name of counterinsurgency operations 21 and are shielded from accountability by the AFSPA .
One of the starkest abuses under the AFSPA in Assam has been the imprisonment of young children .
More than 20 children between the ages of four and 12 have languished in different jails across the state .
The unarmed children and their mothers were first detained by Bhutanese soldiers in a 2003 counterinsurgency operation against militant bases in Bhutan .
They were then handed over to Indian authorities and jailed .
The children have grown up behind bars with their only crime being that they are children of suspected separatists .
22
Children have also suffered sexual violence at the hands of the armed forces .
A 12 - year - old girl was raped by a member of the Assam Rifles in Karbi Anglong on February 7 , 2005.23 Medical tests confirmed that the abuse was sustained after the child was sedated with sleeping tablets .
Fearing a backlash against the military and the AFSPA similar to that which followed the death of Manorama Devi in Manipur ( see below ) , police arrested the accused and his accomplices .
Local womens groups are demanding justice emphasizing that the usual token monetary compensation for such heinous crimes committed by security personnel is unacceptable .
24
Sections of Manipur were declared disturbed areas after the 1958 adoption of the AFSPA , and the entire state of Manipur was brought under the act on September 8 , 1980.25
While Naga tribes in Manipur supported the Naga armed rebellion , other ethnic groups in Manipur also began a separatist campaign against the merging of their state with the Indian Union in 1949 .
The conflict has evolved to include numerous insurgent groups with various ethnic and tribal affiliations .
Conflicts between different tribal and ethnic groups have also emerged , leading to devastating attacks upon civilians and rampant extortion .
Conflict triggers include perceived threats to land distribution , rises in taxes and perceptions of inequity between tribes .
26
Human rights violations by security forces engaged in counterinsurgency operations in Manipur have occurred with depressing regularity over the last five decades .
Torture , which includes beatings , electric shocks , and simulated drowning , is common .
Arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial executions continue .
New disappearances  stopped after the Manipur government introduced a system for providing arrest memos  but at least 17 people remain missing since they disappeared in the 1980s and 1990s.27
Manipuris have long campaigned for the repeal of the AFSPA , a few engaging in acts of desperation including self - immolation and stripping naked in front of an army camp .
Irom Sharmila , a human rights activist , has been on a fast until death since 2000 , kept alive by being force - fed by doctors while in judicial custody .
28
Opposition to the AFSPA came to a head following the killing of Thangjam Manorama Devi in July 2004 .
After being arrested by members of the Assam Rifles , Manorama was found dead near her house in the Ngariyan area the next morning .
29
She had been shot through the lower half of her body , leading to suspicion that bullet wounds had been used to hide evidence of rape .30
For several weeks following Manoramas killing , ordinary Manipuris joined in protest demonstrations calling for repeal of the AFSPA .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh eventually responded by setting up the Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy Committee to review the AFSPA .
The committee recommended repeal of the Act in its report submitted on June 6 , 2005.31
The government has yet to act upon the committees recommendation .
The roots of discord in Meghalaya can largely be attributed to rivalry between tribal residents and the mostly non-tribal immigrants from Bangladesh that began trickling in after the 1947 partition of India .
Militancy erupted in the late 1980s .
A 20 - kilometer - wide belt in Meghalaya bordering Assam was declared a disturbed area in November 1990.32
The armed forces have committed numerous atrocities against civilians in Meghalaya under the auspices of the AFSPA .
During  Operation Birdie in 1997 - 98 , many Khasi tribal women were reportedly raped .
The Assam Rifles also used women as human shields , in violation of the laws of war , in a retaliation attack on the NSCN .
The soldiers placed the muzzle of their guns on the womens shoulders as they battled with the rebels .
33
While the violence in Meghalaya has largely died down , widespread allegations of arbitrary detention , rape , and torture have never been properly investigated .
Mizoram was declared a disturbed area in January 1967.34
Following the signing of a peace accord in June 1986 , the AFSPA is no longer applied in Mizoram , though it remains a sleeping  law.35
A devastating famine in the early 1960s and perceived government neglect resulted in an armed independence struggle by the Mizo National Front ( MNF ) , which was initially formed as a relief organization .
36 During the 20 - year conflict the rights of Mizos were restricted and violated under cover of the AFSPA with widespread allegations of torture , rape , extrajudicial killings , and arbitrary detention .
As in other areas militarized under the AFSPA , women in Mizoram were particularly vulnerable to violations by security personnel , including rape , sexual violence , and arbitrary detention .
For example , a woman named Lianthangvuanga was raped by five soldiers when she was 13 years old .
She managed to escape but then suffered the further trauma of witnessing her father being tortured by the army .
He died as a result of his injuries .
In recounting what had happened 30 years before , Lianthangvuanga revealed that for years she had not talked about her experience with anyone because family members and her community had chosen to forget the experience .
She was left feeling shameful of herself for being violated by the officers .
37
Many ethnic Nagas opposed Indian rule following the British withdrawal from the region in 1947 .
Initially seeking political means to secure self - governance , people of the Naga Hills united under the banner of the Naga National Council ( NNC ) .
While India proclaimed the Naga Territory as part of the Indian Union , the NNC declared independence for Nagaland and embarked upon an armed struggle .
The AFSPA was enacted in 1958 to end the separatist armed campaign .38
The NNC later fractured and was eventually overshadowed by the National Socialist Council of Nagaland ( NSCN ) , which became the main insurgency group in the northeast by 1980 .
The NSCN has since split into two key opposing factions , the NSCN - IM and the NSCN -K , with clashes between the two resulting in many deaths .
The Nagaland population has suffered the most from the armed forces and militant groups operating in the state .
39 As Naga writer Temsula
Ao put it ,  There are no winners , only victims and the results can be measured only in human terms .
For the victims the trauma goes beyond the realm of just the physical maiming and the loss of life their very humanity is assaulted and violated , and the onslaught leaves the survivors scarred both in mind and soul . 40
Civilians in Nagaland complain of the misuse of the AFSPA under which they have lived for 50 years .
41 The presence of the armed forces is a part of their everyday life .
Violence has affected almost every family .
Soldiers have been responsible for untold killings and disappearances ,  and for sexual abuse and rape of women .
42
A particularly disturbing example of the volatile environment that has developed in areas militarized under the AFSPA is the 1995 killings in Kohima city .
Soldiers began shooting indiscriminately after mistaking the sound of a tire bursting for a bomb attack .
Seven civilians , including girls age three and eight , were killed in the hour - long firing that ensued .
A further 22 were seriously injured , including seven children .43
The AFSPA was extended to Tripura state in November 1970.44
At present , the hill district of the state , the Tripura Tribal Autonomous District Council , remains declared a disturbed  area.45 Insurgency in Tripura developed in response to an influx of immigrants from Bangladesh .
The indigenous tribal population was reduced to 31 percent by 1991 , and forced into the hilly interior regions , while immigrants dominated government jobs and local businesses .
A tribal insurgency , led by the All Tripura Tiger Force ( ATTF ) and the National Liberation Front of Tripura ( NLFT ) , continues to the present .
46
Crimes against tribal women by the security forces have been a feature of the conflict in Tripura .
One of the most widely known incidents was the 1988 gang rape of 14 tribal women in Ujanmaidan by the Assam Rifles .47 Rape and sexual violence have continued in Tripura state .
Three tribal women were allegedly gang raped by the Assam Rifles in Dhalai district during a search operation on February 9 , 2006 .
Several girls were also molested .
One of the rape victims was pregnant and suffered a miscarriage following the incident .
48
Punjab
Punjab state was declared disturbed and subject to the Armed Forces ( Punjab and Chandigarh ) Special Powers Act from 1983 to 1997.49 During this period , tens of thousands of people died during a separatist Sikh rebellion and the counterinsurgency launched by the Indian government in response .
Sikh militants were responsible for serious human rights abuses during the insurgency which paralyzed the economy and led to widespread extortion and land grabs .50
To defeat the insurgents , the Indian government ordered counterinsurgency operations that led to the arbitrary detention , torture , extrajudicial execution , and enforced disappearance of thousands of Sikhs .51 Special counterinsurgency laws including the AFSPA contributed to an increase in disappearances  and extrajudicial executions of civilians and militants alike .
To hide the evidence of their crimes , security forces secretly disposed of the bodies , usually by cremating them .
While the insurgency faded over time , families continue to pursue accountability for violations suffered at the hands of security personnel .
Government officials resist any accountability efforts because they claim it would affect the morale of security forces operating in difficult circumstances in other parts of the country .
52
Jammu and Kashmir
Jammu and Kashmir state has been declared a disturbed area since a state version of the AFSPA , the Armed Forces ( Jammu and Kashmir ) Special Powers Act , was adopted in 1990 .
Massive human rights violations have ensued .
Since 1989 , Kashmiris have been trapped in an armed conflict between abusive Indian government forces and armed militant groups waging a brutal separatist struggle with the backing of the Pakistani government .
At least 20,000 Kashmiri civilians have been killed .
Militants and Indian security forces have committed widespread and numerous human rights abuses .
Extrajudicial executions are prevalent .
Police and army officials have told Human Rights Watch that alleged militants taken into custody are often executed instead of being brought to trial because they believe that keeping hardcore militants in jail is a security risk .
53
There have also been widespread complaints of torture and arbitrary detention .
Thousands of people have also disappeared in Jammu and Kashmir since the beginning of the conflict .
54
Many believe they were killed and probably ended up in unmarked graves that security forces say are the burials of unidentified militants .
Human rights groups have long called for an independent investigation and forensic tests to establish the identity of those in the graves , but the government has yet to respond to that demand .
In many other cases Indian security forces have shot civilians under the authority of the Armed Forces ( Jammu and Kashmir ) Special Powers Act .
For example , on February 23 , 2006 , soldiers in Handwara shot at a group playing cricket , suspecting that a militant was hiding among them , and killed four boys , including an eight - year - old.55
Even the army has admitted that the extraordinary powers to shoot have led to mistakes . 
The army described as an error of judgment  the July 2005 killing of three teenage boys in Kupwara who had sneaked away to smoke a cigarette at night and were shot without warning by troops .
56 Such mistakes , which are not uncommon , greatly inflame public passions in Jammu and Kashmir .
Impunity occurs when perpetrators of human rights violations are not held accountable by the state for their actions .
57 Impunity can be divided into two types .
De facto impunity takes place when the state fails to prosecute for lack of capacity or will , often for political reasons , such as state support for the abuses or to protect high - ranking officials or state institutions .
De facto impunity has been rampant in India , where in even well - documented abuse cases there is no political will to prosecute .
The second kind of impunity is de jure impunity , in which laws or regulations providing immunity or amnesty make it difficult or impossible to prosecute a perpetrator for human rights abuses .
India has several such provisions in its laws , aimed at shielding its military personnel and civilian officials from legal accountability .
Such laws are contrary to the right to a remedy and reparation for gross violations of international human rights law.58
Both forms of impunity lead to more human rights violations and undermine faith in the government and security forces ; de jure impunity sends a particularly negative signal to victims about state indifference to and complicity in their suffering .
Among the worst immunity provisions provided under Indian law is the one that protects those operating under the AFSPA .
It is often used to prevent civilian prosecutors from prosecuting soldiers .
AFSPA requires prior approval of the central government for civilian prosecutions of military personnel .
59
That approval is seldom forthcoming .
This has occurred , for instance , in the Manorama case in Manipur and in several well - known cases in Jammu and Kashmir.60
The Indian government claims that the soldiers responsible for human rights violations have to face military courts .
Under the Army Act , the military may transfer a soldier from civilian to military custody for offenses that can be tried by a court martial .
61
However , available information shows scant evidence that the military is fully and effectively prosecuting soldiers and officers for abuses committed by them .
62
One high - profile case that highlights the militarys failure to prosecute its own is the 2000 killing in Pathirabal of five persons whom the army falsely claimed were militants .
Military responsibility for the deaths became evident in 2001 when it was conclusively determined that those killed were local villagers , not militants .
63
In 2006 , the civilian Central Bureau of Investigation filed criminal charges against five military officers for these killings : for more than five years military prosecutors either failed to fully investigate the case or were simply unwilling to bring charges against the officers , whose cases are now pending before civilian courts .
64 Even now , the various procedural obstacles to prosecuting military personnel in civilian courts make a trial in this case uncertain .
65
Human Rights
Watch urges the government of India to repeal the Armed Forces Special Powers Act ( 1958 ) and the Armed Forces ( Jammu and Kashmir ) Special Powers Act ( 1990 ) .
The AFSPA is a symbol of abuse , oppression , and discrimination .
Its application and misuse has fueled a cycle of atrocity and impunity and inflamed passions for militancy in various parts of the country .
The growth of militant groups under the 50 - year application of the AFSPA is evidence that countering armed insurgency with disregard for human rights is ineffective .
Human Rights
Watch is not alone in calling for repeal of the AFSPA .
Human rights groups in India have called for repeal for decades .
Other Indian voices calling for repeal have included the :
B.P. Jeevan Reddy Committee ( 2005 ) ; 66
Administrative Reforms Committee headed by Veerappan Moily ( 2007 ) ; 67 and
and Working Group on Confidence - Building Measures in Jammu and Kashmir headed by Mohammad Hamid Ansari ( 2007 ) .68
Internationally , repeal has been called for by the :
UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ( 2006 ) ; 69
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women ( 2007 ) ; 70 and
and Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ( 2007 ) .71
In 1997 , the UN Human Rights Committee expressed concern regarding the continuing reliance on the AFSPA and at human rights violations by security personnel in areas declared disturbed .
It expressed concern about the climate of impunity  and lack of remedies resulting from the requirement of government approval for legal proceedings against armed forces acting under special powers .
The Committee recommended that this requirement be abolished .
72
Should the AFSPA be repealed , any future legislation aimed at dealing with militancy in areas currently subject to the AFSPA must comply with international human rights and humanitarian law .
Such laws must ensure that the reporting , investigation , and prosecution of unlawful acts by members of the armed forces are not impeded .

JUEVES 11/15/07 , T minus 8 hours .
The ride is about to start
Rewind to the fall of 2004 when the OTB 500 from San Francisco to LA took place .
This was a ride that many of us had always wanted to do , as luck would have it ; we were able to coordinate our legs and schedules to do this epic run .
Shawn , Otto , Hans , and I , rode for 5 days carrying our own supplies and a container full of hummus .
We had a wonderful weather window at a time where major storms were all around us , the ride was an amazing 5 days and 500 miles of camaraderie , good food ( we actually gained weight ! ) and scenery .
The San Francisco to LA trip was the predecessor to road trips in Cuba ( 565 miles ) in the fall of 2005 , Tour of California in 2006 , Tour of 3 National Parks in the fall of 2006 , and Tour of California in 2007 .
We are about to start our road adventure in a few hours , we arrived at our camp at around 8 pm , we are about two miles away from the Tecate border , being so close to the border brings good memories to the Latinos on this trip .
Tonight , the main topic after Hans pre-ride speech was that Julio broke the mold when it comes to packing .
He brought a queen size inflatable mattress , a sleeping bag , a Mexican blanket , and all sorts of stuff that we havent seen yet .
Remember , Hans said , pack light .
There is something special about these long road rides , something that youll have to come and discover on your own .
Now , the story continues , one thing is for sure , well be really tired by Thanksgiving .
Camp roll call :
Hans
Natasha  Support van driver
Claire - Support van driver
Roobik

Total Ascent : 3920 feet
Average Temperature : 76 F
Spanish Words of the day :
Propano = Propane
Estuche = Case
Today will be the last time that Andres makes fun of Julio for bringing a Mexican blanket .
While he was nice and toasty in his tent , Andres spent a cold night with his sleeping bag ; he missed his down bag back at home .
Cereal for breakfast set the stage for a beautiful morning ahead .
We said our good bye to the camp dogs and departed towards the border .
We had a late start while looking for parking to leave the two extra cars that we had .
We started riding in Tecate and easily navigated our way out to Ensenada .
A warm day welcomed us into Mejico , the road conditions were fairly good .
All of the cars and trucks gave us plenty of space to ride in the narrow two way highway , only two truckers made a pass that was too close for comfort .
We had never been so close to a truck with nowhere to go .
We made our way through the Baja Wine Country and hit some nice yankee doodle ( up and down ) climbs with spectacular desert landscapes just like Simi Valley , Otto would be home .
We made one water stop at a local tienda and another stop to watch Julio fix his first international flat , it was a success , for the first time Shawn was not assisting Julio during a flat repair .
No tears were shed .
Our Ensenada arrival was a little more eventful than what we thought , it took a while for us to find our campground , after some off road adventures and hiking through dry creeks we started riding on the Federal Highway to find our camp .
Finally , after 75 miles we arrived at the ocean front campground that Natasha and Claire had found for us .
They had beer , our tents ready , and the location of hot showers scoped out for us by the time we arrived .
It was perfect .
Burgers and veggie burgers were served for dinner ; we had grilled onions , salad , chips , salsa , and cookies for dessert .
Our trip into town got sidelined by true stories by the campfire , we all need the rest , and we have a long road ahead .
Tomorrow we have 100 miles to go .
We do n't know the terrain or what to expect , it should be " epick " ( Ottos spelling of the word ) once again .
SABADO , day 2 , Ensenada to San Matias
Ride stats
Start time : 8:35 am
Distance : 103 miles
Average Speed : 15.5 mph
Ride Time : 6 hours 38 min
Total Ascent : 6360 feet
Average Temperature : 75 F
Spanish words of the day :
No frenar con el motor =
No jake braking
Almohada = Pillow
¿ Julito quieres pancakes ?
= Julio do you want some pancakes ?
( Julio goes back to his moms kitchen to remember the word pancakes in Spanish - no luck on this one )
We slept next to the ocean with the waves crashing by and some truck traffic jake braking by our campsite .
Not as cold as last night , but a good night overall .
We had a strange Elvis sighting by our campsite ; he was sleeping next to our camp with his trusted Mexican hound dog ( he barked in Spanish ) .
Breakfast was served with Andres ' Pato eggs , pancakes , coffee and juice .
We need all the energy that we can get , today will be our longest day in the saddle .
Departing Ensenada was a smooth ride all the way into town , finding our road to leave Ensenada was another story , after a couple of wrong turns we were pointed in the right direction by the locals .
A long climb started towards our destination , a two way road with no shoulder and enough truck traffic to keep our concentration at a maximum .
Today 's diet of choice was climbing ; we basically climbed all day to get to our destination .
Our camp location will have to be scouted by our support team .
Most of the ride was in deserted roads with no stores to get supplies ; we ran out of water but were lucky enough to find a small town store by Heroes de la Independencia .
Water , gatorade , Pedialite , and junk food feel really good at this point .
Somehow , today 's distance is always 90 miles to go .
We keep going and going but our destination does not appear to come soon enough .
Sunset came and went during a flat repair for Roobik ; after the repair , we started using our rear blinkies  since night time was quickly approaching .
As we got close to our calculated distance and meeting point , we made radio contact with our trusted support team who had started search and rescue operations right at sunset .
Natasha and Claire did not find a suitable campground but managed to arrange accommodations outside a restaurant in San Matias .
At Abigails , our host Ruben , prepared quesadillas , burritos , and cooked the fish from our food supplies .
Ruben gave us buckets of hot water to take a bath and made sure that all of our needs were taken care of .
It was another great spot to spend the night in Mejico .
Before going to bed Hans gave Roobik a tent to tent talk on techniques and tips about riding in the paceline .
It was a well intentioned workshop but a chalkboard might work a lot better for future trips .
DOMINGO , day 3 , San Matias to San Felipe
Ride stats
Start time : 8:21 am
Distance : 67 miles
Average Speed : 19.8 mph
Ride Time : 3 hours 22 min
Total Ascent : 540 feet
Average Temperature : 82 F
Technical term of the day :
Goathead =
Something that bikers in Prescott AZ hate , it could kill a small baby .
Question of the day by Prescotts favorite son , Jesse : What s a Yankee Doodle ?
We had another great night in the desert for those of us who brought earplugs .
We heard complaints of trucks jake braking and a local band practicing their drum sessions at late hours of the night .
Elvis might be in town after all .
Ruben prepared a nice breakfast for us : eggs and ham , grilled potatoes , beans ( not for Julio ) , homemade tortillas , and freshly ground coffee .
This great meal and knowing that we have a flat day ahead is great for the groups morale .
The ride out of San Matias was as expected , flat .
Great downhills and desert vistas were welcomed by our legs .
After an easy 32 miles we reached El Chinero and the highway that would take us 35 miles south to San Felipe , our final destination today .
At El Chinero , we ate our peanut butter sandwiches , drank sodas , and chit chatted before hitting the road again .
The ride to San Felipe was very uneventful except for a little heart pain that Shawn was experiencing just before San Felipe .
The team medic , Jesse , and his sexy assistants helped Shawn get back into form .
After some rest and recovery at the local pharmacy / market , Shawn was ready to ride his heart out into San Felipe .
Natasha and Claire must want the MVP for this trip ; they got us a beachside campground with an adjacent Hotel for those of us who dont like sand in their underwear while sleeping .
It was a match made in Baja heaven .
Julio , Shawn , Andres , and Jesse took a room accommodation while Roobik , Natasha , Claire , and Hans pitched their tents in the sand .
Julio gave us a nice house warming present with a bucket of Dos Equis beer , a nice touch anywhere .
While we planned the days activities , El Presidente suggested a historic OTB swim in the Sea of Cortez , what we didnt know was that the low tide had left a lot of small Stingrays buried in the sand .
Jesse and Julio quickly found that out , the sting sent them to a historic OTB visit to the Red Cross .
An off duty lifeguard  upon seeing the bite on Julios foot predicted that he had ten minutes to live , but when he discovered that Julio spoke Spanish , he told him not to worry .
I guess speaking Spanish saved his life .
We were relieved that it was minor , by watching Julios jumps in the water we thought that a shark had gotten into the low tide .
Now that history was made we were ready to hit the town .
We made our way into a bad spot for fish and shrimp tacos but our hunger does not discriminate at this point of the ride , we enjoyed it , we took it all in .
The team had a chance to play a tournament of ping - pong where  Prescotts favorite son Jesse , upset Armenias hope Roobik .
The Armenian delegation was accused of EPO use by the Colombians (? ) and an  Electric Current Resistance Test ( ECRT ) was arranged on the spot .
The results were overwhelming ; due to the high EPO content in his body ;
Hans was able to take as much electricity as a horse in heat .
Andres took only enough electricity to power a small radio .
Once the tournament was over we were hungry enough to hit another place for tacos , this time , we found a great spot .
We decided to start a Taco Eating Championship while we watched  Dancing with the Stars ( Mexican version ) on TV .
Our championship got sidelined by Latin Lovers moves on the small screen , even our waitress forgot about our order ; Latin Lover was that good !
The group split while we took a walk of the towns historic monuments but our beds started calling and our legs were begging us to go to bed at around 11 pm , we still have a long road ahead and we are getting old , no doubt .
LUNES , day 4 , San Felipe to Campo Mayor
Ride stats
Start time : 7:57 am
Distance : 85 miles
Average speed : 18.6 mph
Ride Time : 4 hours 40 min
Total Ascent : 880 feet
Average temperature : 82 F
Spanish word of the day :
Ballena =
Whale ( term used by Pacifico beer for a 40 ouncer )
After a nice night in our $ 60 a night room we started breakfast and pack up operations .
Breakfast was pancakes and bacon with apple juice .
Jesse took care of the peanut butter sandwich assembly line for the road ahead .
Most of our ride should be a flat journey to a campground outside Mexicali which we do n't know where it would be , we only know that it is 70 to 80 miles away .
Our legs are really tired now ; today 's ride is just what we need to recover .
The peloton is riding pretty good together by now .
We are riding north towards Mexicali and the desert landscapes provide a beautiful backdrop for our paceline .
Temperatures are perfect and the wind is just enough to justify drafting each other .
We are quickly leaving the Sea of Cortez , dry lakes on both sides and no places to stop are a good sign that we are deep in the desert of Baja California .
By the time we rode 80 miles our trusted team was nowhere to be seen , we knew that they wouldnt leave us behind , we kept on riding .
By mile 85 a true oasis was ahead ; Natasha and Claire were waiting with a pool table , a good restaurant , ballenas , and a small lake .
We had arrived at Campo Mayor .
Campo Mayor had good cold showers and BBQ pits .
Dinner was prepared by Julio , Roobik and Hans ; the menu included rice , grilled chicken , salad , and cookies for dessert .
After dinner activities included discussions on the best movies ever made and a dice game in which Roobik cleaned the house twice .
EPO test kits were not available .
MARTES , day 5 , Campo Mayor to La Rumorosa
Ride stats
Start time : 8 am
Distance : 80 miles
Average speed : 16 mph
Ride time : 5 hours 2 minutes
Total ascent : 4420 feet
Average temperature : 74 F
Spanish word of the day
Abarrotes = Supplies
We had a nice sleepy time at the " Campo Mayor " , they said that Andres snored , but no evidence could be found .
Some truck noise as the previous nights was heard but not as bad as the karaoke and fisherman fest in San Felipe .
Breakfast consisted of eggs , bacon and apple juice .
After breaking camp we left at 8:00 am .
Today 's plan is to ride between 70 or 80 miles to La Rumorosa and set up camp outside of the city .
We do n't know what to expect in terms of terrain , roads , or elevation gain , we just know that we will find some climbing along the way since La Rumorosa is above 4500 feet and we are departing at sea level .
The ride to Mexicali was very flat with some headwind , but the group is working like a well oiled machine after five days of riding together , everybody is pulling their own weight at the front of the peloton .
Once we arrived in Mexicali the roads took a turn for the worst , pot holes , alligator cracking , truck traffic , glass , micro rocks , and all types of hazards .
All of the riders were on their toes to prevent any mishaps .
Most of our flats occurred in this area with two for Jesse and one for Shawn .
Once we left Mexicali we started making our way towards La Rumorosa , which we knew climbing was a sure thing , after a military checkpoint we saw the big climb ahead , we needed to gain more than 4000 feet of elevation .
The truckers let us know that the climb was twelve grueling miles .
The nice thing was that there were two lanes going up and a nice shoulder to climb on .
This was the nicest road that we have seen during our trip .
The battle of La Rumorosa started at the bottom of the hill with Andres , Jesse , and Julio fighting for the KOM .
This climb was a nice change of pace after two days of flats .
Once we got to the top at the toll booth we were just 1.2 miles away from town .
We got sodas and water at a local restaurant and started our search for our faithful support team .
Natasha and Claire had found a beautiful campsite a few miles outside of town , and as always , a perfect location .
This camp had the coldest shower to date ( read shrinkage ) ; the cold shower was a nice treat after a long day in the saddle .
Dinner was pasta with meat and sauce .
Cookies for dessert and tea next to the campfire marked the end for another perfect day .
Campfire entertainment was provided by Shawn with the question :
Which historical event would you have liked to witness ?
Answers ranged from the Big Bang to Oprahs liposuction but one thing is for sure , Jesus birthplace would have been crowded with OTB members and Shawn wanting answers from little baby Jesus .
We also learned that Julio did not remember too much about his wedding day or it was a lot of fun , since he wants to go back and experience it again .
Jesse might be a suspect of the JFK assassination ; he was at the picket fence .
MIERCOLES , day 6 , La Rumorosa to Tecate
Ride stats
Start time : 8:34 am
Distance : 43.1 miles
Average speed : 19.8 mph
Ride time : 2:10:09
Total ascent : 1560 feet
Average temperature : 62 F
Today it is a very nice morning since it is our last day in the saddle and we have a short 40 mile day ahead .
Oatmeal and juice for breakfast prepared by chef Hans was our last meal in Mejico .
Getting back to the road from the campsite was an interesting trip since were carrying all of the six bikes outside the car and the car had only a rack for four bikes and room for one rider inside , you do the math .
We started our ride on the Federal Highway and it proved to be a Yankee Doodle day all the way .
The paceline was moving fast , it was a very interesting day ; Elvis rode with us all the way to Tecate .
Our only detour was at a toll booth in which we were forced into the old and dangerous Rumorosa road .
After a few rattling miles on it we snuck back into the Federal Highway and made our final descent into Tecate .
After crossing the border without incident we said good bye to Elvis , the chasing dogs , goatheads , Stingrays , Latin Lover and all of those wonderful things that made this trip special .
Just like that , no hugs or tears , no crying babies , we finished our ride and went into a grub fest at the local sandwich shop back in the States .
Total mileage : 453 miles of fun
This is not a true account of this ride ; it is a testament of the spirit that rode free for six glorious days through potholes , sand , and debris .
A spirit that drank beer , ate tacos , got chased by dogs and sang at the wind while the trucks rubbed our sides .
One day , this spirit might need to remember what a perfect day feels like , and I m sure it will smile , just like it did on days like these .
Long live epic rides !
The World from Berlin Presidential Debate Stirs Up German Politics
On Thursday , Germany 's President Horst Köhler announced that he would seek a second five - year term .
But with the Social Democrats weighing a challenge , German commentators say that the country could be in for a nasty fight .
Listen to this post :
Audio : Educating Millennials ,
We are Doing it Wrong
An educated populace is the cornerstone of a successful , affluent culture and a necessity if the United States wants to remain competitive .
Our education system is the framework that enables and prepares America ’s youths to support , lead , and drive America ’s future .
Education , more than any other factor , is responsible for America ’s success .
It is for that reason that the current shift in enrollment and completion rates among males in higher education may be seen as a crisis .
It is immensely disturbing and potentially disastrous .
While there are a lot of theories as to the cause , no one has been able to accurately explain why young male Millennials are abandoning the education system and especially , higher ed .
The lion ’s share of the discourse on the subject has focused on the increased presence of females in higher education , the shifting nature of male ’s roles in society , and other similar concepts .
While these may be factors , I believe they overlook the true cause and scope of the issue .
The Cause
The infusion of brilliant young female minds into higher education is a wonderful thing and there is without question some validity to the observations made that womens ’ aptitudes are better suited to the standard classroom format .
That said , I do n’t believe the introduction of women to higher education is what ’s causing men to drop out .
Rather , we are seeing a surge in the individual student ’s ability to learn and comprehend in a more complex reality .
The issue stems from the way members of the Millennial generation are developing and their use of complex , multi-tasking skill sets that have been honed in the daily practice of video gaming , internet access , chatting , and involvement in online social networks .
Simply put , tech savvy Millennials are not being engaged or challenged by the one - dimensional delivery systems in a majority of today ’s classrooms .
They are not interested in sitting passively and having information spoon fed to them .
Much of this information is not interdisciplinary or connected to the real world .
They can do better on their own in this new , comprehensive ‘ digital classroom ’ .
If we do n’t reevaluate the way we educate Millennials , I expect female enrollment numbers to peak and begin to decline as they become more engaged in technology which follows the trend we are currently seeing among males .
The growth of the internet between 1995 and 2007 has been staggering as evidenced by these NSF diagrams .
The Millennials are a transitional generation .
The oldest Millennials are digital immigrants , while the youngest are digital natives ( as coined by Marc Prensky here ) .
Those of us caught in the middle vary widely .
At 23 , I find myself in the middle of the pack and surrounded by friends who fall near both extremes .
For my part , I consider myself as close to being a digital native as is possible .
At the same time , I have friends my age who have only recently started using the web and engaging in its immersing nature .
The difference between digital natives and digital immigrants is – I believe – what is responsible for the decline of males in higher education .
Historically males have been the early tech adopters .
You ’ve probably heard a joke or two about the improbability of finding a female gamer and you ’ll no doubt agree that when you hear the word “ geek ” the last image that jumps to mind is of a woman .
While these depictions are cultural stereotypes , they have historically been fairly accurate .
For the last 20 years computers , the Internet , and video games have largely been the domain of men .
While that has begun to shift in the last 3 - 5 years – especially in the gaming industry – fully engaged female digital natives are still relatively rare .
To that end , males have been heavily exposed to – and had their social behavior patterns effected by – technology to a far greater degree than females .
The behavioral shift I ’m talking about is fundamental .
It ’s the way these individuals relate to each other and the environment around them .
Where historically most of our interactions were relatively one sided – the news , TV , the classroom , etc. – the modern male has grown up in a highly interactive , immersive environment .
Video games are the most extreme case where this is evident , but the principle applies to the web as well .
To use myself as an example :
I started gaming in 1st grade .
By 1998 I abandoned single - player games and began gaming exclusively online .
By 2007 I abandoned my TV subscription , opting instead for the web and streaming video .
Why ?
Because TV was n’t engaging enough .
It was boring one - way communication .
From YouTube , to Blogs , to Facebook and Reddit , Web 2.0 is how I interact and relate to the world .
I am able to accelerate and pursue my own interactive , interdisciplinary learning style .
I run dual 22 ″ wide screen monitors .
While writing this blog post I have the blog up on one screen , Facebook ( w/ Facebook chat ) , Twitter , Gmail ( w/ Gmail chat ) , iGoogle , and Reddit up as tabs , and at the same time I may have a movie playing which I periodically pause to focus on a thought , or to pull up research for the post I ’m writing … all the while , when I find something I want to explore in greater depth , I go for it .
To someone used to one - way communication this may seem chaotic .
For most , it would seem to be information overload .
For a digital native accustomed to these interactive resources , it ’s not only the norm , it ’s conducive to a productive and enjoyable experience .
I can process information on multiple levels through a diverse range of delivery systems .
Millennials , particularly the digital natives , are able to complete many tasks and extend their understanding of issues well beyond the confines of the typical classroom setting .
Interestingly enough , these skills – this hands - on approach – is what has allowed me to stay competitive at the leading edge of the business world .
It ’s all based on interactivity .
While the news and researchers have historically avoided the subject in favor of running pieces on violence inducing video games and brain rot several recent pieces like this one confirm the positive effects and impact of video games .
From a recent MSNBC article available here , “ One study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors than those who did n’t ” .
To those who are not familiar with these new applications of technology it would be easy to label multi-tasking digital natives as ADD / ADHD or some other label , suggesting that those who ca n’t sit as passive - adaptive students in a classroom suffer from an illness .
Look at the skyrocketing numbers of ADD / ADHD diagnoses over the last 20 years .
It ’s not a virus , it ’s not a sickness .
It is often young males who want to explore the world around them , who need to be engaged on multiple levels , and who want to contribute as much as they receive .
It ’s a generation of males who are developing the behavioral framework that will allow them to not only exist , but to excel in the modern digital era .
These are the skills that will be required in the future to keep America strong .
Research has shown that video games can be used to “ treat ” ADD / ADHD ( example : Online Video Game Therapy For Mental Health Concerns : A Review by Wilkinson , Ang & Goh ) .
Video games may be a key to understand ADD / ADHD .
The skill sets utilized in video gaming are the epitome of the new interactive paradigm which the education system needs to both recognize and embrace .
The young males dropping out of and failing to pursue higher education are n’t stupid .
It ’s not that they ca n’t compete with women .
It ’s that they are disengaged because the current delivery system is not interactive and is quickly becoming significantly less relevant .
The modern male is hardwired for fast - paced , multi - level exchanges .
They are being forced into an education system which still operates on a passive one - way model .
You go to class , you sit down at a desk in a sterile room , and you listen to someone lecture for somewhere between 60 and 180 minutes .
Oftentimes the lecture is little more than a professor reading PowerPoint slides on the screen .
If you ’re lucky you might be in a small class and be able to ask a question or participate in group discussion for part of the class .
All the while you pray you do n’t get called on , because you spent the night before exploring Wikipedia and reading about the Amazon , international business trends , and the history of the windshield wiper instead of reading a dry text and memorizing theory .
Too often the material in the schools is every bit as dead and lifeless as the system delivering it .
Unless he has the family support or long term drive to satisfy the college degree for a quick check - mark on job applications , he ’s not going to stick around any longer than he has to .
The CEOs and Founders of most of today ’s major tech start ups are prime examples of this phenomenon .
Ask yourself how many high tech start ups have historically been founded by women ?
Of those founded by males , how many of the founders are college or high school dropouts ?
How many have masters degrees ?
How many have their doctorate ?
These “ drop outs ” are the individuals at the leading edge , driving international business forward , and the system did not provide what they needed .
They had to leave school to learn and succeed .
The truly scary part is that this is just the beginning .
The crisis in education we ’re seeing today will only get worse over the next several years as the true digital natives begin to come of age .
Make no mistake , it wo n’t be limited to males alone .
Now that the gaming industry and the rest of the classic “ geek ” strongholds have become female - friendly , expect to see similar shifts among women .
The problem is n’t the technology .
It ’s not video games or too much time on the web .
Ironically enough , these are all behaviors we should be embracing and encouraging .
The problem is that our education system has not adapted to serve the population ’s needs in the digital age .
Fundamentally – it ’s failing to educate young males and as a result they are seeking more relevant material and finding delivery systems elsewhere .
It wo n’t be an easy transition and I do n’t have the answers for an easy fix .
I do know that until we recognize the importance of the digital native skill set , the attrition will continue .
On a side note , I ’ve spent over a week contacting the US Census Dept. , Dept. of Education , and various other sources trying to get core enrollment and completion numbers for males since 1990 .
Unfortunately , despite the straight forward and seemingly basic nature of my request , I have not been able to attain usable data .
Most of the data publicly available has been collected in research projects exploring enrollment from particular points - of - view .
It is not useful .
I ’d appreciate your help tracking down valid data and exploring it .

International bankers live in fear .
Not of starvation , disease or war .
These are the concerns of children in the Third World .
Bankers are terrified we might object to paying them billions each year in interest for money they create out of nothing , guaranteed by our taxes .
( The Federal Reserve Board , a private cartel of mostly foreign banks , finagled this monopoly in 1913 .
http://www.savethemales.ca/260602.html)
The bankers are frightened that , like the homeless man 's dog , we might say , " I can do this myself . "
They are scared the government might go even further and " default " on trillions of make - believe " debt . "
They are frightened of losing " control . "
They toss and turn at night .
In order to sleep more soundly , the bankers have taken " steps . "
These precautions help us to understand the world we live in , why it is becoming safer for bankers but less safe and more bizarre for everyone else .
First , people who own money machines tend to have a lot of friends .
The bankers helped their friends establish monopolies in oil , chemicals , pharmaceuticals , transportation , media , etc. and took a healthy stake .
As you can imagine , these people are thick as thieves .
Lawyers , journalists and intellectuals all vie for a piece of the action .
( Servicing this cartel of cartels is what passes for " success " these days . )
The bankers ' first precaution is to buy all the politicians .
The second is to buy the major media outlets in order to promote the illusion politicians make decisions and represent our interests .
The third precaution is to take control of the education system , ensuring that people stop thinking at an early age .
Then the bankers use the government and media to convince us that religion , nationalism and nuclear family are unfashionable , and we want what they want .
We " want " world government ( " globalization " ) .
The bankers need to eliminate nation states , freedom and democracy in order to consolidate their power and streamline their business .
The UN , the IMF and World Bank -- glorified loan sharks and collectors -- will make the laws .
We " want " diversity .
Countries are not allowed to maintain their national identities or traditions .
Last Christmas , my provincial Premier tried to rename the Christmas tree at the legislature a " multicultural tree . "
Diversity is respecting every culture but European Christian .
Every nation must be heterogeneous as a box of Smarties -- no one in a position to challenge the bankers .
Or take " feminism . "
Masquerading as equal rights for women , this ideology is designed to spread lesbian dysfunction .
If women focus on their careers , they give less importance to husband and children .
They have fewer or no children who will be raised in state day cares .
Under the guise of " women's " and " gay " rights we are being re engineered to behave like homosexuals , regarded as easier to control .
Psychological and biological differences between men and women are not " stereotypes . "
But signatories to the latest UN " CEDAW " Convention ( passed by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee ) will be required to " take all appropriate measures to modify all social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women . "
( Article 5 ) This kind of Communist - inspired social engineering is simply persecution of heterosexuals .
It is intended to arrest our natural development : the birth rate has halved while the divorce rate has doubled .
An army of highly paid lawyers , social workers and bureaucrats treat the casualties .
These self - serving do - gooders are the bankers ' biggest constituency .
People -- stunted , love - starved , sex - obsessed -- without family , religious or national identity , are easy to control .
( They 'll join anything ; they 're looking for a family . )
But in case of resistance , the bankers have created a bogeyman , " terrorism " to justify a huge security apparatus .
The Office of Homeland Security is designed to control us -- the domestic population .
Why would this be necessary ?
We 're " in debt " trillions of dollars and the bankers intend that we pay .
One day they will take away our toys .
In case it 's a problem , an Orwellian police state will be in place .
But first , the Muslims must be subjugated and robbed .
Talking about the United States as if it were an independent country is silly .
American politicians pawned U.S. sovereignty in 1913 .
Ever since , U.S. soldiers have been bullyboys for international bankers , and nothing else .
" SUPERPOWER " AS GO'FER The American taxpayer and soldier made the First World War possible .
It started just six months after the establishment of the " Fed " .
Its purpose was to increase debt , cripple the great European nation states , slaughter a generation , and establish two of the bankers ' pet projects : Communism ( Russia ) and Zionism ( Palestine . )
After the war ended , banker world government -- The League of Nations ( a.k.a. , " The League to Enforce Peace " ) was established .
The US did n't enter the Second World War in Dec. 1941 to save Western civilization .
England had stood alone against Germany for more than two years .
The U.S. entered the war just six months after Hitler attacked Russia .
The purpose was to save Communism !
[ I am indebted to A.K. Chesterton ( " The New Unhappy Lords , " 1969 ) for this insight ]
For the same reason , the USSR got $ 5 billion in U.S. lend - lease after the war ended .
After the smoke cleared , Communists instead of Nazis tyrannized Eastern Europe .
Soviet agents / US diplomats Alger Hiss and Harry Hopkins established the United Nations on land donated by John D. Rockefeller .
One of the UN 's first acts was to create the State of Israel .
Ben Hecht ( in " A Child of the Century " ) wrote " the Twentieth Century was cut off at its knees by World War One . "
Before committing suicide in 1942 , Stefan Zweig ( The World of Yesterday ) spoke in the same tones about the demise of Western civilization .
The planet has been hijacked .
Our leaders are dupes , opportunists , traitors or all three .
Almost everything we know about modern history is a hoax .
A stench of moral compromise hangs over our public and cultural life .
Anything promoted by the media , education , or government is suspect .
This is what happens when we deny Moral Order i.e.
God .
This is what our children will inherit , a world that is safe ... for international bankers .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Los Angeles residents are notorious for worrying about their waistlines and if two Los Angeles County Supervisors have it their way , calorie counting while dining out in the city may get easier .
A Los Angeles Police Department helicopter surveys the Hollywood sign in Hollywood , California October 22 , 2006 .

Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Michael Antonovich will present a proposed ordinance to the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors next week that would force fast - food chains and restaurants to display the number of calories alongside the price of items on their menus .
The proposed law is intended to decrease obesity among adults and children in America ’s second - largest city .
While Los Angeles has a reputation as a mecca of diet and exercise crazes , the county ’s Department of Public Health says residents are less fit than many realize .
The percentage of obese adults in Los Angeles County increased 46 percent over eight years , to 20.9 percent in 2005 from 14.3 percent in 1997 , according to the department .
“ The menu should be as informative of what its effect is on one ’s waistline as it is on their pocketbooks , ” Yaroslavsky said .
“ Not ingesting 800 calories in a meal makes a huge difference to one ’s health and quality of life . ”
New York already has a similar ordinance in place .
Fast - food and casual - dining chains in the Big Apple can be fined $ 2,000 for not displaying calorie counts .
The California Restaurant Association , an industry trade group , is skeptical about whether the ordinance will actually tackle L.A ’s obesity problem .
“ If we ’re going to fight obesity we need to teach folks about nutrition and proper eating , ” CRA spokesman Daniel Conway said .
“ I question whether this ordinance will have a real meaningful impact on people ’s behavior in terms of what they eat and how much they exercise . ”
The association has sued two Northern California counties for passing similar laws .
The industry group says its bill , which is to be voted on in the California legislature by the end of the month , will give restaurants statewide the choice of whether to make nutritional information available either on a brochure or in a menu .
“ We recognize our customers do want this information , but most of the customers do n’t want this information forced on them every time .
It ’s as much as a mandate on our customers as it is on our restaurants , ” Conway said .
BAGHDAD -- U.S. and Iraqi negotiators reached agreement on a security deal that calls for American military forces to leave Iraq 's cities by next summer as a prelude to a full withdrawal of combat troops from the country , according to senior American officials .

Yesterday while driving I heard an ad on the radio promoting more state spending on roads .
Besides being a bit overreaching ( " Is my family really safe with our current roads ? " ) the idea of better managed and maintained roads makes some sense and I thought the ad had a decent point — especially as I rumbled over potholes and hoped not to end up in a major traffic jam like last week .
There are potential improvements that can be made to Michigan 's roads just by changing how things are run ( and who runs them ) without necessarily increasing road spending .
Additionally , there are many ways the state could do the same things for less money .
( Check out this Mackinac Center study . )
The radio ad made the point that better roads are safer — OK .
Then it said better roads make it easier for businesses to operate in the state — fine .
But it committed a logical and economic error when it claimed , " State spending on road projects will create jobs and boost our economy . "
That 's only half of the story .
State projects may create jobs , but the proper question is , do they create wealth ?
The state could easily reduce Michigan 's unemployment to 0 % by mandating that every unemployed citizen shovel dirt on some state project without pay .
Employment alone is not a good indicator of economic success ; overall wealth is .
Even if state spending can " create jobs , " creating jobs alone does nothing for our state 's overall prosperity or standard of living .
The question then becomes , do state projects , as the ad claimed , " boost our economy " ?
The answer is no .
Let 's say the state spends $ 1 billion on road projects .
It is easy to see all the laborers and machinery employed to complete the $ 1 billion worth of projects .
It seems all those laborers and the manufacture of all that machinery signify new growth in the economy .
But where did that $ 1 billion come from ?
It came from taxpayers .
What use would that $ 1 billion have been put to had it not been taken by the state and spent on roads ?
One billion dollars divided by the state 's population of 10 million people equals $ 100 per citizen .
What would all of those citizens have done with an extra $ 100 ?
Perhaps some would spend it at the movies , some at the hardware store , some on food , some on clothing , and some may have saved or invested the money .
If every citizen had that money to save or spend , then every movie theatre , retailer , grocer , or investment portfolio would have received more revenue and produced more goods — and hired more people to make and sell them .
How much more ?
$ 1 billion .
But that is not all .
When left in private individuals ' hands , that $ 1 billion will be spent and allocated on the things that are the highest priority for those people .
This will send a series of signals through the market of what things to produce more of and what things to invest more in .
It will produce fierce competition among the suppliers of the various items being purchased , pushing them to find better and better ways to create better and better products for less .
This is how wealth is created .
Competition spurs innovation , which increases productivity .
When government spends money , it simply takes that money from one place ( taxpayers ) and moves it to another ( state employees , roads , etc. ) .
When private individuals spend money , that money always has the potential to create wealth as they choose the best use between competing businesses or banks .
Whatever your feeling on the need to improve state roads , do not let the myth of " job creation " and a " boost to the economy " be the rationale .
LOS ANGELES – The original FPS is coming back .
At the Activision press conference , id 's Todd Hollenshead gave some of the first public details of the company 's revival of Wolfenstein .
Main character B.J. Blaskowicz , which I am sure is spelled wrong , is back , and he 's even more " bad-ass " than ever , says Hollenshead .
He 's locked in another fight with the Nazis over a supernatural weapon .
While there will be a strong single - player story , Hollenshead said , the series ' team - based multiplayer will also be back .
Id promised more details on the game at Quakecon , a fan event that the company will hold later this month .

PARIS 
The prosecutor at the International Criminal Court formally requested an arrest warrant on Monday for Sudan ’s president , Omar Hassan al - Bashir , on charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the past five years of bloodshed in the Darfur region of his country .
The prosecutor ’s pursuit of Mr. Bashir introduced new volatility to the already chaotic situation in Darfur .
While some diplomats and analysts worried that the move would undermine efforts to negotiate peace and provide aid to the millions displaced by violence , others said it offered new leverage to pressure the Sudanese government to end the conflict in Darfur .
Bracing for reprisals , United Nations peacekeepers and aid workers stepped up security in Darfur and pulled out all but the most essential civilians .
Sudan promised not to vent its outrage on them , but said it would unleash a “ diplomatic war ” to try to scuttle the case .
It was the first time the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court had brought genocide charges against anyone .
It was also the first time the prosecutor had brought charges against a sitting head of state since the court opened its doors in 2002 .
Two other presidents , Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Charles Taylor of Liberia , were charged by other international war crimes courts , also while they were in office .
Jagmeet Channa used his colleagues ' identities to access the money A bank clerk who tried to steal almost £ 72 m from the HSBC bank has been jailed for nine years .
Jagmeet Channa , 25 , who worked at the firm 's headquarters at London 's Canary Wharf , used colleagues ' identities to plunder accounts .
A court heard Channa sent 90 m euros ( £ 71,632,807 ) to two accounts , within minutes , in April this year .
Channa , of Church Road , Ilford , east London , admitted conspiracy to defraud and a charge of money laundering .
Sophisticated enterprise Sentencing him at Southwark Crown Court Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC said : " This was no silly prank .
This was a carefully planned and very serious attempt to transfer a fortune in money away , and it almost succeeded .
" Others were involved , perhaps several others , and in the absence of any explanation from you I must assume this was a planned and sophisticated criminal enterprise . "
The court heard how Channa was the inside man in what police described as one of the one of the largest frauds of its kind .
Following the orders of fellow conspirators , and expecting a substantial cut for his " audacious and outrageous " crime , he sent 60 m euros ( £ 47,970,227 ) from a trading account to Morocco .
Minutes later he wired 30 m euros ( £ 23,984,113 ) to a branch of Barclays in Manchester .
Channa worked at HSBC's HQ at Canary Wharf in London
He was eventually found out after forgetting to leave the account he had raided with a zero balance .
The huge debit was discovered by HSBC workers in Malaysia on a Sunday who alerted their colleagues in London sparking an immediate investigation .
Two of Channa 's colleagues , whose passwords were used to carry out and approve the transactions , were initially questioned but soon declared innocent .
A review of security cameras and other inquiries led officials to Channa .
Meanwhile both Barclays and the bank in Casablanca had been contacted , the account frozen and the stolen money returned .
After sentencing Det Sgt Martin Peters said : " This crime is believed to be one of the largest frauds of its kind and it is thanks to the prompt response of the police and the banks that the money was recovered . "

What are these ?
With the full - scale rollout of Japan 's cigarette vending machine age - verification system just around the corner , a Sankei Sports news reporter has confirmed the existence of a minor flaw : magazine photos can be used to fool the age - verification cameras on some machines .
When the reporter went to check out the new age - verifying machines after they were introduced in the Osaka area in June , he soon discovered that the machines equipped with face - recognition cameras would let him buy cigarettes when he held up a 15 - centimeter ( 6 - in ) wide magazine photo of a man who looked to be in his 50s .
The reporter also went to Kobe , where different face recognition hardware is being used .
There , he bought cigarettes using an 8 - centimeter ( 3 - in ) wide magazine photo of a female celebrity in her 30s .
He also reportedly tried to use a 3 - centimeter ( 1 - in ) wide photo , but the machines rejected it .
As part of the age - verification system , most of Japan 's 570,000 cigarette vending machines are being outfitted with RFID readers that check the purchaser 's Taspo age - verification card .
Smokers without a Taspo card can now either buy their cigarettes in person over the counter or use one of 4,000 special machines equipped with face - recognition systems ( these machines do not require Taspo cards ) .
More face - recognition machines are on the way , according to vending machine manufacturer Fujitaka , who developed the face - recognition hardware .
The face - recognition machines rely on cameras that scan the purchaser 's face for wrinkles , sagging skin and other signs of age .
Facial characteristics are compared with a database of more than 100,000 people , and if the purchaser is thought to be well over 20 years old ( the legal age ) , the sale is approved .
If the purchaser looks too young , they are asked to prove their age by inserting a driver 's license .
According to Fujitaka , the machines are 90 % accurate .
Fujitaka admits that people may , on occasion , be able to fool the age - verification cameras with photographs -- but only for the time being .
The company is now working on a more advanced system that will make sure each face belongs to a real human , but they are unable to say when these new machines will be put into place .

You know those moments : your child is on the verge of a meltdown , you ’re away from home , out of food , running late , and you ’re tired and cranky as well ?
They suck , right ?
Even seasoned parents get caught off - guard , and we still have moments , but we ’re getting better at dealing with it .
Beyond bringing water and food with us ( plus numerous washcloths and clothes ) , we try to also have little extras to engage the youngest .
Paper and pen , little toys , her doll …
But all of those things are familiar to her .
So I have the “ papa bag ” .
Actually the “ special papa bag ” .
The special papa bag is just a little canvas bag , about the size of a cellphone case , that lives in the console of my truck .
It has saved our ears from a shrieking two year old on many occasions .
The contents of the bag varies , as it must in order to remain effective .
The items that go into the bag have to be :
things that they have n’t seen before – not new , but new to them .
I find all kinds of random hardware , most of which is kid-friendly once washed .
– not new , but new to them .

things that they do n’t usually get to play with – a tiny flashlight , or tiny tape - measure , some keys or a tiny lock .
– a tiny flashlight , or tiny tape - measure , some keys or a tiny lock .
things that are part of your world , but not part of theirs yet – I put in a tiny level that was a gimme from the hardware store , and when it came out of the bag , it spurred a family conversation that lasted the entire drive , and the toddler was entertained solely by the bubble in the level .

things that “ do something ” – could be anything that moves .
I have a length of bicycle chain just long enough to be fastened into a circle .
It ’s too big to get stuck on a finger , and too small to go over the wrist , so it ’s toddler safe .
Even adults pick it up and play with it .
Go figure .

things that you may think are boring , but can be re-spun to a kid – Credit card offers with a fake card inside can become your child ’s very personal mail ( open it and “ read ” a funny letter addressed to them , handing them the card as a membership in the wiggly ears club , or ??? )
Junk mail can be re-spun and then recycled afterwards , so it ’s re-used and recycled .
The main rule of the papa bag is that it does n’t come out until every other option has been exhausted , and you ’re ready to engage them for two minutes with a sense of humor and wonder at “ What ’s in the bag ? ”
I started mine with a mints tin ( you know the one ) , some magnets , a weird piece of hardware and a tiny rubber chicken .
A jaw harp and a harmonica were popular for a while , and binder clips and rubber bands had their day , but some of the simplest random found objects were the favorites for the longest .
Get a small container , one that ’s easy for kids to open , and fill it up with things from your life , random cool stuff , and stash it in the car or at work .
Have one at home as well , and you ’ll be way ahead when the diaper hits the fan .
The special papa bag has saved the day numerous times , allowing us to at least make it to our own house before totally freaking out .
Make yours today .

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) is a relic of the Cold War .
It was created on April 4 , 1949 as a defensive alliance of Western Europe countries plus Canada and the United States to protect the former countries from encroachments by the Soviet Union .
But since 1991 , the Soviet empire no longer exists and Russia has been cooperating economically with Western European countries , supplying them with gas and oil , and all types of commodities .
This has increased European economic interdependence and thus greatly reduced the need for such a defensive military alliance above and beyond European countries ’ own self - defense military system .
But the U.S. government does not see things that way .
It would prefer keeping its role as Europe ’s patronizing protector and as the world ’s sole superpower .
NATO is a convenient tool to that effect .
But maybe the world should be worried about those who go around the planet with a can of gasoline in one hand and a box of matches in the other , pretending to sell fire insurance .
As of now , it is a fact that the U.S. government and the American foreign affairs nomenklatura see NATO as an important tool of American foreign policy of intervention around the world .
Since many American politicians do not anymore support de facto the United Nations as the supreme international organization devoted to maintaining peace in the world , a U.S. - controlled NATO would seem to be , in their eyes , a most attractive substitute to the United Nations for providing a legal front for their otherwise illegal offensive military undertakings around the world .
They prefer to control totally a smaller organization such as NATO , even though it has become a redundant institution , than to have to make compromises at the U.N. , where the U.S nevertheless has one of the five vetoes on the Security Council .
That is the strong rationale behind the proposals to reshape , reorient and enlarge NATO , in order to transform it into a flexible tool of American foreign policy .
This is another demonstration that redundant institutions have a life of their own .
Indeed , when the purpose for which they have been initially established no longer exists , new purposes are invented to keep them going .
Regarding NATO , the plan is to turn it into an aggrandized offensive imperial U.S. - dominated political and military alliance against the rest of the world .
According to plan , NATO would be enlarged in the Central - Eastern European region to include not only most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact ( Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Bulgaria , Romania , Albania and Hungary ) and many of the former republics of the Soviet Union ( Estonia , Lithuania , Latvia , Georgia and Ukraine ) , but also in Asia to include Japan , Australia , New Zealand , South Korea , and possibly admit Israel in the Middle East .
Today the initially 12 - member NATO has mushroomed into a 26 - member organization .
In the future , if the U.S. has its way , NATO could be a 40 - member organization .
In the United States , both the Republicans and the Democrats see the old NATO transformed into this new offensive military alliance as a good ( neocon ) idea to promote American interests around the world , as well as those of its close allies , such as Israel .
It is not only an idea actively promoted by the neocon Bush - Cheney administration , but also by the neoconservative advisers to both 2008 American presidential candidates , Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama .
Indeed , both 2008 presidential candidates are enthusiastic military interventionists , and this is essentially because both rely on advisers originating from the same neocon camp .
For instance , the rush with which the Bush - Cheney recklessly promised NATO membership to the former Soviet republic of Georgia and American military support and supply is a good example of how NATO is viewed in Washington D.C. by both main American political parties .
For one , Republican presidential candidate John McCain envisages a new world order built around a neocon - inspired “ League of Democracies ” that would de facto replace the United Nations and through which the United States would rule the world .
Secondly , Sen. Barack Obama ’s position is not that far from Sen. McCain ’s foreign policy proposals .
Indeed , Sen. Obama advocates the use of U.S. military force and multilateral military interventions in regional crises , for “ humanitarian purposes ” , even if by so doing , the United Nations must be bypassed .
Therefore , if he ever gains power , it is a safe bet that Sen .
Obama would not have any qualms about adopting Sen.
McCain ’s view of the world .
For example , both presidential candidates would probably support the removal of the no “ first strike ” clause from the NATO convention .
It can be taken for granted that with either politician in the White House , the world would be a less lawful and a less safe place , and would not be more advanced than it has become under the lawless Bush - Cheney administration .
However , it is difficult to see how this new offensive role for NATO would be in the interests of European countries or of Canada .
Western Europe in particular has everything to fear from a resurgence of the Cold War with Russia , and possibly with China .
The transformation of NATO from a North Atlantic defensive military organization into a U.S. - led worldwide offensive military organization is going to have profound international geopolitical consequences around the world , but especially for Europe .
Europe has a strong economic attraction for Russia .
Then why embark upon the aggressive Bush - Cheney administration ’s policy of encircling Russia militarily by expanding NATO right up to Russia ’s doorstep and by placing a missile shields right next to Russia ?
Would n’t it be better for Europe to develop harmonious economic and political relations with Russia ?
Why prepare the next war ?
And as for Canada , under the neocon minority Harper government , it has sadly become a de facto American colony as far as foreign affairs are concerned , and this , without any serious debate or referendum to that effect within Canada .
The last thing Canada needs is to go further on that mined road .
In conclusion , it would seem that the humanist idea of having peace , free trade and international law as the foundations of the world order is being cast aside in favor of a return to great power politics and gunboat diplomacy .
This is a 100 - year setback .
It is a shame .
Unemployment rates in the United States hit a four - year high in July , and inflation rates have risen 1.32 % since January 2008 .
In fact , economists believe inflation is the greatest threat to the US economy and worry the energy - driven rise in prices will become permanent .
Senator Obama ’s response to the dire economic outlook is an “ Emergency Economic Plan ” that would take from rich oil companies experiencing record profits and give back to the American people in the form of stimulus checks , as well as invest $ 50 billion in states and infrastructure .
Obama ’s Emergency Economic Plan
Unlike McCain , who ca n’t remember the price of gas or how many houses he owns , Obama recognizes working Americans are struggling .
In response to the current economic crisis , Obama ’s Emergency Economic Plan offers both long and short term solutions .
In a move reminiscent of Robin Hood , Obama would take from rich oil companies and give to the American people .
The emergency plan also includes a $ 50 billion stimulus package designed to save 1 million jobs .
Specifically , Obama ’s plan includes :
Forcing big oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to help struggling families with direct relief worth $ 500 for an individual and $ 1,000 for a married couple .
The relief would be delivered as quickly as possible to help families cope with the rising price of gasoline , food and other necessities .
The rebates would be fully paid for with five years of a windfall profits tax on record oil company profits .
This relief would be a down payment on Obama ’s long - term plan to provide middle - class families with at least $ 1000 per year in permanent tax relief .
$ 50 billion in immediate measures to turn our economy around and help prevent more than 1 million Americans from losing their jobs : $ 25 billion in a State Growth Fund to prevent state and local cuts in health , education and housing assistance or counterproductive increases in property taxes , tolls or fees .
The fund will also ensure sufficient funding for home heating and weatherization assistance as we move into the fall and winter months .
$ 25 billion in a Jobs and Growth Fund to replenish the highway trust fund ; prevent cutbacks in road and bridge maintenance and fund new , fast - tracked projects to repair schools – all to save more than 1 million jobs in danger of being cut .
McCain ’s Response
McCain would rather help Big Oil than working Americans .
Proposing corporate tax cuts and increased drilling wo n’t feed families .
McCain stated :
Across this country , Americans are hurting and today ’s job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face .
… Unlike Sen. Obama , I do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems .
There is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses .
Raising taxes on Big Oil when they are making record profits only seems fair in these tight times .
Obama is not proposing taxing struggling businesses or working individuals .
When wealth is unevenly distributed , I believe it is the right of government to intervene on behalf of working citizens .
Remember , these are “ windfall ” profits Obama proposes taxing ; however , what happens to permanent tax relief and the State Growth Fund and Jobs and Growth Fund when windfall profits do n’t exist ?
Perhaps a decrease in military spending could be the solution as we pull out of Iraq .
The Effectiveness of Stimulus Checks
How exactly would a $ 1000 stimulus check help American families .
Obama claims it would :
Offset the entire increase in gas prices for a working family over the next four months
Pay for the entire increase in winter heating bills for a typical family in a cold - weather state
The first suggestion is reminiscent of the gas tax holiday proposed by McCain and Clinton that Obama critized as a “ short - term quick fix ” .
Stimulus checks are not a new idea , and I can’t help but wonder if Obama is simply following Bush ’s plan that caused a short term boost to the struggling economy this spring to win votes .
What did you spend your stimulus check on ?
I put mine in an IRA , which is probably what I would do with another one .
I am learning to live more frugally during these times of high gas prices , and one check wo n’t go far enough to change that .
It is important to remember though , that stimulus checks are only one part , and probably the least significant part , of Obama ’s Emergency Economic Plan .

Obama stalls in public polling
In the two months since Barack Obama captured the Democratic nomination , he has hit a ceiling in public opinion polling , proving unable to make significant gains with any segment of the national electorate .
While Obama still leads in most matchups with John McCain , the Illinois senator ’s apparent stall in the polls is a sobering reminder to Democrats intoxicated with his campaign ’s promises to expand the electoral map beyond the boundaries that have constrained other recent party nominees .

That gap between expectations and reality comes as Democrats enjoy the most favorable political winds since at least 1976 .
At least eight in ten Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track .
The Republican president is historically unpopular .
From stunning Democratic gains in party registration to the high levels of economic anxiety , Obama should have a healthy lead by almost every measure .
Yet , in poll after poll , Obama conspicuously fails to cross the 50 percent threshold .
ABC News Polling Director Gary Langer asked , “ If everything is so good for Barack Obama , why is n’t everything so good for Barack Obama ? ”
Obama remains ahead , depending on the national poll , by low to high single digits .
The Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , which randomly interviews at least 1,000 voters each day , has recently found that Obama leads by 3 to 4 percentage points .
In the first full week of the general election , June 9 - 15 , Obama led by between 2 and 7 percentage points .
Just short of two months later , registered voters have not significantly shifted their views , as Gallup finds public opinion still fluctuating between roughly the same margins .
“ What ’s remarkable this summer is the stability of this race , ” Gallup ’s director Frank Newport said .
“ In a broad sense , it is similar to previous elections . ”
In Gallup ’s last national poll prior to the 2004 party conventions , for example , John F. Kerry led President Bush 47 percent to 43 percent .
In 2000 , also in Gallup ’s last national poll prior to the party conventions , Bush led former Vice President Al Gore 46 percent to 41 percent .
Three demographic groups have generally kept Obama ahead in the past two months : African - Americans , youth and Hispanics .
But a lead based on those groups is a tenuous one .
The youth vote , notorious for not meeting expectations , must turn out in significantly higher numbers than in past elections .
Obama must continue to win the black vote nearly unanimously and still turn out new African - American voters .
McCain must continue to underperform with Hispanics by about 10 percentage points compared to Bush in the summer of 2004 .
McCain might also be said to have hit a ceiling himself .
At best , he has statistically tied Obama for fleeting periods this summer .
Yet in this Democratic year , the subject that dominates chatter among pollsters is Obama ’s stubbornly slim lead .
If there is a primary explanation as to why the race has remained close this summer , it is that Obama has failed to make gains overall with white voters , who still cast about three in four ballots on Election Day .
As Gore did in 2000 , Obama nearly splits white women and loses white men by a large margin , according to an aggregate of polling in June and July 2008 and polling in 2000 by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press .
Depending upon the week in June or July , by Gallup ’s measure , Obama has roughly fluctuated between splitting or , at worst , trailing by about 5 percentage points with white women .
In that same period , Obama has won only between 34 percent and 37 percent of white men .
In general — and with men in particular —
Pew 's data shows that Obama 's gains with young whites compared to Gore in 2000 are offset by a weakness with older whites .
Obama also seems to have hit a ceiling with Hispanics .
Latino support fluctuates between 57 percent , by the latest weekly measure , to 68 percent the week before — roughly the margin of Hispanic support that has marked the entire summer , by Gallup 's measure .
What all this suggests is a general election that is much tighter than many analysts predicted and defined by far more stubborn levels of support .
As it stands , on Aug. 3 the RealClearPolitics average of national polling had 46.6 percent of the public supporting Obama , putting him narrowly ahead of McCain .
Exactly two months earlier , on June 3 , that same average had Obama at the exact same level of support — 46.6 percent .
Despite the Republican 's warranted complaints that he receives much less coverage his younger rival , who is attempting to become the first black US president , critics argue that Mr McCain is better off with fewer reports , if that means his errors are ignored .
AudioOdyssey is a prototype for a Wii remote game that enables visually impaired people and sighted people to play together .
Developed by students at MIT and the Singapore - MIT Gambit game lab , it 's a music - based DJ simulation game that requires the players to make crowd - pleasing dance tracks .
The next rev will enable online play .
From MIT News Office :
A recent graduate of MIT 's Comparative Media Studies program , ( Alicia ) Verlager , who is blind , helped with the development of the game .
" As a media studies scholar and a blind consumer , I am very excited to see that Eitan and other game developers are working to make games more available to gamers with disabilities , especially when those games can be shared between players with and without disabilities , " Verlager said .
" The element I probably most envy about gamers is just the way they hang out together and share doing something fun , " she says .
" It 's the social aspects of Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft that I really want to try myself and so hanging out with other gamers playing AudiOdyssey was really fun . "

Lots of old schoolers remember Shadow of the Beast , but not as many suffered through The Killing Game Show .
I use the word " through " loosely , as Doomeru and I were convinced it had no end .
I say “ no end ” not in the “ our princess is in another castle , ” make the ghosts and hotdogs faster sort of way , but in the “ oh shit we forgot to finish programming level two ” sort of way .
The Killing Game Show featured a Robocop 2 - esque mech , which , I assume contained a faceless human contestant that climbed vertically through each board a - la Kid Icarus to win a speedboat , lifetime supply of instant coffee , new pair of legs , or some other corporate - sponsored showcase showdown throwaway .
Only , for reasons memory and nostalgia can’t recall , no toeholds could be found at the middle of the second stage and you ’d just jump up and down on your android chicken legs until being dissolved by a rising vat of acid .
teh acid ... it eats meh !
Doomeru says all British games are extremely difficult because the Queen ’s currency is overvalued and all English people are penny - pinching gits with funny teeth , but I felt this title went a little too far .
Nevertheless it lived up to an ideal of challenge and accomplishment long lost to modern video gaming .
Which brings me to Rondo of Swords .
I ’ve dreamed for years of a turn - based RPG strat that allowed for zero pumping , with even less margin of error when upgrading characters .
Money would be scarce , all items precious , and cold , calculating computer enemies should make you curse your mushy , fallible organic brain .
Let me have a serious gamer ’s game , rife with consequences , but hold the Fire Emblems , please - no one should be that hardcore .
This game is most likely close as I ’m gonna get .
Hopelessly outnumbered from level one , the goal of more than one mission is literally to damn the villagers and run for your fucking life .
All it needs are a couple cylons .
But short of perfection I ’d settle for some usability testing .
You can see the movement range of the enemy fighters hunting you down like a dog , but not the spell or firing range on enemy mages and archers , which leads to a whole lot of dying .
Killed characters are mercifully carried to the next mission , but with “ hurt ” status .
What , exactly , does “ hurt ” mean ?
Do n’t look under “ statuses ” in the instructions or standalone tutorial .
That ’s what the internets are for .
The manual does , however , contain four pages of softcore manga concept art !
Almost every enemy with a name can be recruited by having the right character talk to them , but it 's only somewhat less than arbitrary which character that is , and of course you have to pick which characters to bring before seeing the next level , and who might be recruited on it .
Animations can be skipped but not turned off , enemy turns move fast but ca n’t be sped up , and you can zoom out to look around but ca n’t look around without zooming back in .
On the bright side , Go - Go - Gadget - Self - Destructing - Quick - Saves are available , along with two kinds of mission restarts .
You ’ll need those .
Combat is balanced , albeit impossible , but it takes a lifetime of button jonesing or “ seeing the Christ in people ” to notice .
Core combat involves drawing movement paths for each unit through allies and enemies , but magic users can’t move and cast spells in a single turn , and have no physical defense or attack .
They also have less movement points than everyone else in the party .
Archers , on the other hand , can shoot after moving , but have less range .
look mom , I 'm using my stylus !
Outside of combat , you have to balance enhancement between characters as well as within each individual :
Send a character on three “ card quests ” to get special upgrades ( again , check the internets ... ) , or “ smith quests ” to improve attack , but then they ca n’t earn experience points in the next mission and thus ca n’t raise their class on a " class - raising trial ( quest ) . "
They also ca n’t raise class if someone has n’t been sent on a “ proof quest ” to find the requisite class - raising items .
Characters can’t go on quests if they were “ hurt ” in the last mission , so you ’ll have to drag them along for the next fight with their stats halved , making it all the more likely they ’ll be hurt again .
If quests are n’t taken when they first come up , you ’ll never get a second chance .
And do n’t even bother shopping ( shopping quest ! ) - some other useless character would have to be designated for that .
They ca n’t buy and sell on the same trip , and low - level characters often end up just losing all the money and returning empty handed .
I refuse to play the game with a walkthrough by my side , but I recommend you do .
I made it halfway through and had to start over from the beginning , and still might have to start over again .
It goes without saying that casual gamers need not apply ( and also go fuck themselves ) , but for serious gamers I ’ll reiterate it ’s a dream come true .
I only wonder if maybe we should have dreamed of something else …
At the end of the day , drought tolerance in corn has to equate to good yields and good quality , not just good looks , said a Texas AgriLife Research scientist .
Dr. Wenwei Xu , AgriLife Research corn breeder from Lubbock , is working with crosses between temperate and tropically adapted varieties of corn to find a drought - tolerant plant that performs well under reduced irrigation .
" With the continuing decline of the Ogallala Aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water , the use of drought - tolerant and high - yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation , " Xu said .
A field day was held recently at the North Plains AgriLife Research Station near Etter to demonstrate the differences between the parent plants and the offspring , or crosses .
" We hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent , " Xu said .
Already the AgriLife Research program out of Lubbock has released four inbred lines of corn and numerous others are in the process for release , he said .

" The new multiple - stress - tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to Texas and other southern states , " Xu said .
" They can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments . "
The research station at Etter is one of three test sites in Xu's program .
The others are located at Halfway and Lubbock .
About 500 hybrids are being evaluated this year for either grain yield or silage yield and quality , he said .
Xu said there has been an increasing demand for silage corn in the Texas High Plains , and producers need new hybrids adapted to the local environment .
Corn produced in the U.S. is primarily based on two races of maize , but there are more than 250 races identified around the world , Xu said .
" Most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines , " he said .
" Then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance , agronomic productivity , disease resistance , insect resistance and value - added grain characteristics . "
Xu said some of the experimental hybrids they are working with have produced the same silage yield under irrigation equaling 75 percent evapotranspiration as with 100 percent evapotranspiration irrigation .
advertisement
Evapotranspiration is the loss of water from the soil both by evaporation and by transpiration from the plants , and is reported on a daily basis through the Texas High Plains Evapotranspiration Network .
Bruce Spinhirne , AgriLife Research associate based in Lubbock , said they reduced the irrigation on a few hybrids by 50 percent and had a severe yield and quality limitation , so they followed that by the 75 percent water application .
Those results are due in part to the use of stored moisture in the soil profile , Spinhirne said .
" At 75 percent ( evapotranspiration ) , you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used , where if you are watering at 100 percent , it is wasted , " he said .
The average silage yield of 20 corn hybrids at two locations ( Etter and Halfway ) was 26.84 tons per acre under 75 percent evapotranspiration irrigation , just slightly lower than the 27.49 tons per acre under 100 percent evapotranpiration irrigation , Spinhirne said .
However , he said , there were significant differences among hybrids in each environment .
" One of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent , " Spinhirne said .
" Developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water - saving approach , " he said .
Upgrading WordPress is fairly simple , but there can be a few issues , hassles and annoyances if you do n’t do it right and if you have more than one WordPress installation , it can become a hassle to keep everything up to date , but there are methods to upgrading WordPress fast .
Before upgrading using any method , a smart blog owner will back up both the files and databases relating to the blog so that if an issue arises , a rollback is n’t too difficult to perform .
FTP
One of the easiest ways to upgrade WordPress is through the use of FTP .
This is one of the simplest ways as well , but if you run more than one blog , the upgrade process can start to wear you down as you do the same few steps over and over .
This is much more apparent when WordPress adds new versions often , and you find yourself transferring files on your favourite FTP program more than writing posts on your blog .
One of the biggest mistakes that people make when upgrading WordPress with this method is to not delete the wp-includes and wp - admin folders as files in these folders change from time to time , so overwriting files is n’t good enough as old files will still remain .

Instant Upgrade Plugins for WordPress
There are a few plugins for WordPress that once uploaded , activated and configured correctly , can allow you to easily upgrade WordPress though the WordPress administration panel .
Some people recommend these plugins , others warn caution .
I have n’t much experience with them because I am very anti-plugin .
I would rather use other methods outside of overburdening the plugin architecture in WordPress .
There are two main contenders that I have seen progress in the upgrading of WordPress through a plugin .
The first is InstantUpgrade plugin , which allows you to upgrade to either the latest version of WordPress or a version of your own choosing .
The second plugin is WordPress Automatic upgrade , which has similar features and function .
I would n’t trust either of these plugins with upgrading my blogs because they have had many issues and require file permissions to be really insecure .
For me , these plugins are also slower than many other methods as you have to log into each blog to upgrade it , where other options can save you a huge amount of time if you have more than one blog to upgrade each time Automattic releases a new version of WordPress .
Fantastico
Tools like Fantastico De Luxe have made upgrading WordPress a near , one - click upgrade process , but it is n’t without its downsides .
The Fantastico package does n’t immediately get the newest versions of WordPress , and so you might be stuck on an insecure version of WordPress for upwards of a month before the new version shows up in this tool .
The great thing is that Fantastico will take care of making a backup of your current installation , and then install the latest version of WordPress that it has available .
I have heard of people having issues with Fantastico , so it is always prudent to back up your blog outside of this tool before running it .
This is one of the fastest ways to upgrade your WordPress blog , and is a great way to manage , and upgrade multiple installs of WordPress quickly and cleanly .
Other than the wait time for Fantastico to have the latest versions of WordPress available for upgrading , there are n’t any major downsides that I ’ve ever seen .

Subversion
One of my favourite ways to upgrade WordPress blogs is through Subversion , also known as SVN , but this method requires a fair bit of technical skill .
Especially , if you want to make a Bash script to upgrade all of your blogs from the command line using one command .
Using Subversion , I was able to upgrade over fifty WordPress powered blogs in just a few minutes .
Automattic runs a Subversion server and so if you have Shell access to your web hosting , and they have Subversion installed on it , you can basically drag the latest versions of WordPress down right from Automattic in a very efficient way .
There are many great blog posts on setting your WordPress blog up with Subversion , but one small note from me would be to not install the Trunk version of WordPress as most tutorials would have you do , but instead , pick the most recent stable version and then switch versions as new ones come out .
Trunk is the development code , and can sometimes have errors , or issues , especially since it changes daily .

WordPress 2.7
WordPress 2.7 is due out in a few months ( most likely October ) , and will make many of these options nearly obsolete , as it will include the ability to upgrade WordPress from inside the WordPress administration panel , just like the WordPress plugins , except that it will be supported by the people developing WordPress .
Having the upgrade tool built - in means that we will hopefully get an error free way to upgrade WordPress as the developers have access to change the core code to accommodate the upgrade tool they build .
I am looking forward to seeing the final result .
WordPress.com
If you are sick and tired of upgrading your WordPress blog , or you are just starting out with WordPress and do n’t want to mess with upgrading , then you can always create an account at WordPress.com .
This is a hosted blogging site , run by the people that release WordPress .
You wo n’t have to worry about upgrading , as it all happens behind the scenes , allowing you to focus on your blogging .
Conclusion
No matter which way you want to run and upgrade your blog , it is always important to make backups of your work , as well as keep up to date on the software developments , as the worst thing that can happen is a loss of creative work .
I have lost far too many articles and do n’t wish that on anyone , as they can never be recreated exactly the same as they were .
Enjoy WordPress , and keep it up to date !

Reuters :
Republican presidential candidate John McCain said on Friday he fears that al Qaeda or another extremist group might attempt spectacular attacks in Iraq to try to tilt the U.S. election against him .
McCain , at a town hall meeting in this Philadelphia suburb , was asked if he had concerns that anti-American militants in Iraq might ratchet up their activities in Iraq to try to increase casualties in September or October and tip the November election against him .
" Yes , I worry about it , " McCain said .
" And I know they pay attention because of the intercepts we have of their communications ...
The hardest thing in warfare is to counter someone or a group of individuals who are willing to take their own lives in order to take others . "
Read on ...
The GOP will use Iraq as propaganda regardless of the situation on the ground .
If things are going well , they will tout a victory .
If the tenuous lull in overall violence suddenly surges , McCain will tell us that we can't pull out now because it 's just too dangerous , or as in this instance , accuse AQ of plotting to sway the election -- that 's if the media bothers to cover Iraq at all .
We should be seeing a tape from bin Laden or his # 2 by September or October , and McCain and the Republicans will use it in tee vee commercials and campaign speeches accusing the Democrats of loving the terrorists .
A vote for a Democrat is a vote for Osama , right ?
Reading Code : A Computer Science Curriculum
Date : 19 August 2008
Tags : computing , python
I developed the following ideas about how to teach computer programming during a recent conversation with Daniel Rocco , a professor at the University of West Georgia , and Georgia Tech grad student Derek Richardson , and I wanted to expand on the ideas here on my blog .
I have been heavily influenced by reading Greg Wilson , and , for all I know , he or someone else may have already put these ideas together into something like the outline below .
The first day of class
To teach computer programming , a professor ought to stride into the room on the semester 's first day , explain that a computer program is a text file full of instructions for the computer to follow , and then proceed to check out an example from version control .
His desktop should be displayed on a big screen in front of the class .
He should read through the example program with them , discuss it — it should be a Python program that does something requiring two or three dozen lines , like opening a window and displaying the message , “ Hello , world ! ” — and then run it .
He should demonstrate how to edit the program so that it prints something else instead ( perhaps “ Hello , professor ! ” ) , run the altered version for them , and , finally , check the modified program into version control .
The class now has the tools they need to complete their first assignment .
The students are told that a version - control repository has been created for each of them ; that they have each been subscribed to their repository 's email notification list ; and that , upon returning home from class , their email inbox will already hold a message informing them that their first assignment — the “ Hello , world ! ” program itself — has been checked into their repository by the course software .
By the next class period they are to have checked the assignment out , altered it so that it prints “ Hello ” followed by their own name , and submitted the assignment by checking the program back in .
Hopefully the university will have provided a lab period for the course , in which the TA can show the students how to get Python and the version - control software installed on their own desktops or laptops .
If not , then the professor will have to cover those details in class .
In either case , of course , the same information should be available online on the course web site .
But the important thing is that , from their very first assignment , the students are using the same tools for software development that they will use as professionals out in the wider world .
Test suites , and debugging
That first day of class taught the students to view several dozen lines of code — that , in our example , initialized and opened a window with some text written inside of it — and to dive in and modify a single feature that they understand : the string constant containing the words “ Hello , world ! ”
The next several class periods will , as usual in computer science , move onward from simple string and numeric constants to teach students about expressions , variables , and control structures .
But the manner in which these concepts are taught will immediately induct the young programmers into habits that they will follow for the rest of their lives .
The crucial thing is the introduction , hopefully in the second class period , of the idea of a test suite .
This will prepare them for their second homework assignment , which , as usual , will be automatically committed to their repositories right after class is over .
While they verified the correctness of their first homework assignment merely by running it ( “ Look , it printed Hello , < my name > in a window ! ” ) , every subsequent assignment will be based , instead , on test suites .
They should be doctests , so that they will look just like the professor 's sessions with the Python prompt , but with some accompanying paragraphs for explanation .
One test suite , named before , will succeed against the example program as it is first delivered to their repository .
The second one , named after , will initially fail against the code .
The student completes the exercise by adjusting the program , using their newly learned concept , so that it begins to succeed against the second test suite .
And , of course , they commit the program to their repository when they are ready to turn the assignment in .
For fun — well , actually , not just for fun , because it will provide important cognitive cues as well — the before and after pair of tests should tell a small story about changing requirements .
Imagine an example program that reads in credit card debits , and prints out how much money was spent ; but , the after test explains , Sally now wants it to process her credit card payments as well ( which will be prefixed with a plus sign in the input ) and then print out the current balance in her account .
Ambitious instructors might even create exercises in which a whole series of tests lead the student through several incremental improvements to a single program file .
How should class be conducted ?
I imagine that the actual instruction should include three important ingredients .
First , each concept will first be introduced by explaining why we need it .
I cannot emphasize enough the pedagogical value of motivating each language feature with an explanation of the need that it fills !
My understanding of Taylor polynomials in Calculus III would have been revolutionized if it had occurred to the professor that we might first need an explanation of why Taylor polynomials exist before we would be interested in the proof that they work !
The explanation of a concept so often needs to start with simple information like “ variables exist because programs need to remember things , ” “ control structures help us when we do not know in advance how many times our program might have to repeat a task , ” and so forth .
Second , the professor will illustrate the new language feature by alternating between the whiteboard and the Python prompt — between leading the students to think about the idea , and actually letting them see it work .
Third , short example programs will be shown that do something useful with the new concept .
These programs will often include code that the student does not yet understand , but , in the middle , include a pleasantly glaring and obvious example of the new concept in use .
The professor should not only run these programs from the command line , which , honestly , leaves the students straining to imagine what complex sequence of steps has resulted in the output , but he should run them repeatedly in pdb so that the students can actually watch the variables changing their value , the control statements repeating a loop , and so forth .
It would be most useful if the professor attaches the debugger to an editor that displays the whole program while highlighting the line currently being executed .
Invariants , and further progress
I should pause , and emphasize that the conviction which stands behind my design of this course is that a student is simply not competent to write a Python function until they have read at least , say , one hundred well - designed and fully documented functions written by others .
I mean this with complete seriousness : students should spend weeks reading and modifying good code before they are trusted to produce functions or classes on their own .
By the time a student is asked to write a function from the ground up , they should be so accustomed to docstrings , helpful comments , and informative variable names , that they put these into their own functions as though they were the most natural things in the world .
In fact , the instructor should ideally produce students who are not even aware that Python functions can execute if they do not include a docstring and informative comments !
The same idea lies behind teaching a professional slate of tools — version control , test suites , the Python prompt , and a debugger — right from the start .
We thereby hope to create students that , if ever faced with a project or situation from which these tools are absent , will immediately know that they have been placed at a disadvantage .
They might not , in that future environment , be able to remedy the situation ; but they will at least feel where their wasted hours are going , and know which tool to introduce if they have the opportunity .
The reason , incidentally , that doctests are critically important to this style of instruction is that the student only needs to understand the Python prompt itself to read and comprehend the doctest .
By contrast , even the simplest unit tests usually require quite complicated features , like the import statement and function calls , that could delay the introduction of testing by several class periods at least .
Only doctests allow testing to be introduced early enough for it to be the backbone of even their earliest assignments .
Refactoring and test writing
I would probably keep the students busy modifying ( and , therefore , mostly reading ) code through the entire first half of the introductory curriculum .
They would ascend through adjusting constants and expressions to adding control statements and calculations of their own ; then , learning how to write or rewrite entire functions ; learning input and output programming both to files and the screen ; and , perhaps , if it suited the curriculum and the time available , they would be shown object - based programming , including using and writing object methods .
I would probably make refactoring the final stage of that first half of the course , which might actually be a bit fun for the students because the structure of the assignments would shift .
Through all of the other homeworks , students received both a before and after test suite , and had to make the program run successfully against the latter .
But now , to learn refactoring , will be given only one test suite , that must work on both the initial version of the program and on the improved version that they will create through applying basic refactoring techniques .
Instead of taking a flying leap from a before behavior to a program that they hope now exhibits the after behavior , they can make steps that are as tiny and incremental as they please , checking to make sure that they still satisfy the test suite after each little change .
Incidentally , as I described those “ tiny steps ” in the previous paragraph , I unconsciously was imagining the pleasant task of making little changes to a program and checking each change into version control after checking that the tests still pass .
It is the ability to back up one step if the procedure suddenly goes haywire that can make refactoring leisurely .
Without version control , a series of refactoring steps can become a nightmare wilderness in which all of one 's work has to be thrown away because , at the last step , you bungle the change , cannot figure out what you have done , and can never quite get the program working again without going back to the start .
All of which raises the question : how will the students learn that version control is useful for anything other than handing in assignments ?
I recommend that the professor smuggle a useful version - control stunt into every single class period : he should always plan to illustrate some mistake , or show some failed approach to a problem , then revert the change with version control before proceeding .
The students must be made to feel , from repeated illustrations , that frequently checking in code forms a safety net beneath them that prevents them from losing their work if an inadvertent destructive change ( not to mention something like a hard drive crash ! ) forces them to retrace their steps and start part of an assignment over again .
Test writing should probably also be practiced in the first half of the course — and the student , of course , will be expected to produce tests like the very many that he has already read : each telling a little coherent story that explains , as well as demonstrates , how the program behaves .
I would probably , in each homework set , provide one exercise in which they are given a program that , in fact , has a bug , despite passing its before test !
The exercise will tell a little story about a customer for whom the program is failing , and the student will be required both to write a test case that exercises the bug and reproduces the failure , and then to fix the program itself .
The second half
This curriculum 's second half — which I would imagine being the second semester of a two - course series , but with bright students ( or carefully limited goals ) might fit into the closing weeks of a single semester — is when students would begin to be eased into the blasted wasteland which is the world of software which they will too soon enter .
What wasteland ?
Why , the parched and mottled landscape of uncommented , untested , uncontrolled code with which we have strewn the earth because of the utterly inadequate techniques by which nearly everyone is “ taught to program ” under the current system .
But , again , we must ease the students into how terrible the world is .
First would come an assignment in which , inexplicably , the program they were modifying entirely lacked comments ; the students , if they are properly prepared , will actually gasp when the professor shows them the code .
Perhaps the homework will simply be to check out the program and provide it with comments !
Again , an assignment will appear that entirely lacks a test for some critical feature ; they will have to provide the missing test .
Then a small library will be thrown at them that , unimaginably , lacks tests entirely ; their assignment will be to write them .
You can see that , with each of these rescue - mission assignments , the students are learning a skill which will come in handy as soon as they enter the real world and have to perform exactly such a rescue operation on a code base for which they are made responsible .
Then would come a bit of a relief — a more normal situation ; actually , a wonderful situation to encounter out in the real world !
They will receive , simply , a complete test suite for which no program exists .
For the first time , they will be expected to write an entire code base from the ground up that satisfies the set of tests .
It is really at this point that the instructor will be able to email me and tell me whether this curriculum has done any kind of good at all : do the students write , in response to this assignment , the kind of sham , idiosyncratic , and entirely undocumented code that is typical of first - year programmers ?
Or — hope beyond hopes ! — are some of them actually producing docstrings , and writing comments , and using normal Python idioms , as a result of seeing more than ten thousand lines of code before being entrusted with this most sacred of duties : inflicting entirely new code of their own upon the world ?
The instructor will have at least three questions as he watches the students committing to their repositories .
First , how many students are committing code frequently , instead of committing days of work at once ?
Second , are comments and documentation being checked in with code the first time , or just being added before the code is graded ?
Finally , are test suites being written up front , or thrown together at the last minute once they think that their code is working ?
A final assignment
How should we conclude this curriculum ?
Obviously , by making each student write , all by themselves , both a suitably complex program or library and its entire test suite .
This could even be given a social dimension : the last assignments could be partitioned so as to require cooperative work among the students , or even interaction among the whole class , with some students writing test suites for libraries their code requires , and other students creating the code to satisfy those needs .
Each student will thus learn something about the social dimension of programming : both what it is like to deliver and elaborate a test suite to someone tasked with figuring out what you need , and what it is like to receive a test suite , have to demand clarifications , and then write to it as your specification .
Lessons from teaching language
After reading back over the ideas outlined above , I realize that this computer programming curriculum is startlingly similar to the way that human languages like French or Chinese are taught in modern universities .
And on reflection , I very much like the analogy !
I will , in fact , make the strong assertion that the extent to which programming courses differ from all normal language instruction is , in fact , the extent to which they are misguided .
There is nothing so evident in teaching French than that the student needs to start by reading much more French than they are asked to write .
Can you imagine the disaster if a French teacher taught only the rules of French , tested the students to see if they could write convincing French sentences yet , and responded to their abject failure by drilling them on yet more rules ?
Yet this is exactly how we teach programming !
In the early 1990s , I was a TA for one of Georgia Tech 's introductory programming class , and the code that students produced was uniformly terrible !
But so long as it somehow worked , they were given a passing grade — in fact , an A ! — and hustled on to the next assignment , with absolutely no opportunity to learn that the code they were writing was utter trash — completely disjoint and incomprehensible .
They were , in other words , being taught all of the grammar of computer programming , but without seeing any literature — well - written , clear , fully documented code — that they could imitate .
Perhaps that is the central insight that I want to communicate in this blog post : that writing code is imitation far more than it is the application of rules .
After more than a decade of writing Python code by myself , it was a shock to start working on the Grok project and , in the Zope code repository , begin to see how real professionals wrote their Python code .
I learned more techniques and common idioms in one year than in my entire previous decade !
I should also note that my idea of routinely exposing students to language features that they have not learned yet — like that first assignment where they hunt for the “ Hello , world ! ” string amidst code that opens a window with a text widget — corresponds directly to the modern educational concept of untidy input , where you show students small amounts of “ real French ” even from the first day of class .
By showing them the full complexity of the target language , even at the early stage where all they can do is “ find and circle the subject of each sentence ” , you are beginning to teach them what their writing will look like on that distant day when what they produce is full - fledged speech .
And , critically , you are not allowing them to mistake the crude and lopsided sentences they create in their homework for the real , fluid , and graceful language that is French .
The end of the matter
I should finish with this simple plea : we must stop virtually forcing students to produce ugly , untested , uncommented , and undocumented routines as part of their introductory curriculum .
And we must , at all costs , stop encouraging the delusion that , if they do so , they have written anything that deserves to be called a computer program .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Presidential candidate Barack Obama said President George W. Bush ’s decision to send a senior diplomat to nuclear talks with Iran was a substantive move and should be taken seriously by Tehran .

Obama , a Democrat , has been highly critical in the past of Bush ’s policies toward Iran and has promised that if elected he would pursue a policy of greater engagement aimed at persuading Tehran to abandon its nuclear enrichment program .
But in a rare signal of solidarity with the current Republican administration , Obama told a news conference in Paris on Friday that Iran should not wait for the next U.S. president to try to reach a deal over its nuclear program .
He also praised Bush ’s decision to send senior U.S. diplomat William Burns to talks in Geneva with Iranian officials .
“ Bill Burns is a very serious guy .
And the Iranians should take that gesture seriously , ” Obama told Reuters in an interview on Saturday as he flew back from a weeklong tour abroad .
Obama , who is running against Republican John McCain in the November election , is seeking to burnish his foreign policy credentials .
He traveled to Afghanistan , Iraq , Kuwait , Jordan , Israel , Germany , France and Britain .
Iran was a key topic in many of the meetings he had with leaders of those countries .
Iran has refused demands to freeze sensitive atomic work the West fears is aimed at making bombs .
Tehran says the nuclear program is aimed at the peaceful purposes of generating electricity .
Envoys from the United States , Russia , China , France , Germany and Britain -- the so - called sextet of world powers -- attended the Geneva meeting .
“ I want the Bush administration to be successful in working with the Europeans to get Iran to stand down on its nuclear weapons program , ” Obama said .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted on Iranian state television saying his country has more than 5,000 active centrifuges for enriching uranium , suggesting a rapid expansion of nuclear work .
IMPRESSIONS OF MALIKI , KARZAI
Also in the Reuters interview , Obama talked of his impressions of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and Afghan President Hamid Karzai , both of whom he met during the trip .

“ I think Maliki has made some tough choices , particularly going into Basra and Sadr City to disperse the Shia militias .
I ’m glad to see that he is eager to take more responsibility for his country ’s own security , ” Obama said .
“ I think he recognizes that the Iraqi government both has to become more efficient and more inclusive .
Whether he understands the degree to which that has to happen ... I ca n’t tell , ” he added .
The Democratic candidate said Karzai is “ very smart and charming ” and has a vision for Afghanistan ’s future .
But he said he needed to move to rid his government of corruption and combat the narcotics trade .
“ I told President Karzai that I thought that he needs to really focus on issues of corruption and counternarcotics and to counter the narcotics trade much more aggressively than has been done so far , ” he said .
Obama has called for a renewed focus on Afghanistan , including the addition of two U.S. brigades and has called on European countries to do more to help stabilize the increasingly violent country .
It 's FOX NEWS SUNDAY , which means more idiocy with William the Bloody .
Too bad for Bill that Maliki endorsed Obama 's Iraq plan of withdrawal --- which basically makes him out to look more ridiculous than he normally does .
There are no warmongering mountains too high for William the Bloody to climb .
He 's going way over the top with his attacks of Obama .

Rush to Arctic as warming opens oil deposits Coast Guard to map near Beaufort Sea to back U.S. claims
It 's a scramble for the spoils of global warming as the rapid melting of Arctic sea ice is opening access to previously unreachable deposits of oil and gas , setting off a race by northern nations - including the United States , Canada and Russia - to claim them .
The pursuit of those resources will be underscored this week as the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Healy sails north from Barrow , Alaska , on Thursday to map the sea floor of the Chukchi Cap , an area at the northern edge of the Beaufort Sea .
The maps could bolster U.S. claims to the area as part of its extended outer continental shelf .
The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed last month what the oil industry had long suspected when the agency released an estimate that the area north of the Arctic Circle may hold as much as 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas , or roughly 13 percent of the world 's total undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the undiscovered natural gas .
The dash to stake out territory across the Arctic has accelerated since Russia sent one of its submarines last August to plant the country 's flag on the sea floor beneath the North Pole , provoking an outcry by other nations that viewed it as an unauthorized land grab .
Earlier this month , Canadian officials at a geology conference in Norway detailed their territorial claims to the Lomonosov Ridge , an underseas mountain range that runs beneath the North Pole .
Canada argues that the ridge is part of the North American continent , not part of Siberia , as Russia has asserted .
Denmark backs
Canada
The Danish government joined in backing Canada 's argument , even though those two nations have also clashed over claims in the Arctic .
Why ?
Because Denmark , which controls Greenland , believes Canada 's assertion could boost its own contention that part of the energy - rich ridge should be Danish territory .
These northern powers are all rushing to complete assessments of how far their underseas territory may extend .
Under international law , countries control all natural resources within the " exclusive economic zone , " which extends 200 nautical miles offshore .
But if a country 's continental shelf extends far into the ocean , the nation can claim underseas land up to 350 miles offshore under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea .
The United States has signed the Law of the Sea Treaty , but the Senate has not ratified it .
Margaret Hayes , who directs the State Department 's Office of Oceanic Affairs , said on a conference call Monday that while the United States moves toward ratifying the treaty , it must gather all the scientific data it will need to justify its territorial claims .
During the Healy 's three - week voyage , scientists from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and University of New Hampshire will use a device called an echo sounder to create a three - dimensional map of the sea floor .
The Healy will make a second voyage , from Sept. 6 to Oct. 1 , carving a path through the ice , while a Canadian ship , the Louis S. St. Laurent , follows , gathering seismic data about the thickness of the sediments along the sea floor .
While it 's a scientific mission , USGS scientist Deborah Hutchison acknowledged that oil companies will be eager to see the results , which could yield major clues about the size and location of oil and gas deposits .
" The cruises are not intended to look for energy resources .
...
That is not a primary or even a secondary objective , " Hutchison said .
" However , it 's inevitable because there are so few data in this area ( of the Arctic ) , there will be great interest in using this data " to assess the potential for drilling .
Alaska favors drilling
Alaskan officials , who rely on oil revenue and face declining oil fields along the North Slope , see more Arctic drilling as a way to keep the state 's oil economy afloat .
While the Atlantic and Pacific coasts have been off - limits to drilling under a federal ban for nearly three decades , the Interior Department is already leasing areas of the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea .
Environmentalists warn of the perils of oil exploration in the region .
Critics say that conditions in the Arctic - shortage of natural light in winter , extreme cold , moving ice floes and high winds - make it extremely difficult to respond to an oil spill .
" Ultimately what is going to be needed is a more comprehensive ecological study of that region and some indication as to whether or not any technology that we have today is likely to be able to clean up spilled oil in that set of conditions , " said Richard Charter , a coastal advocate for Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund .
The voyage of the Healy this week is being made possible by the swift melting of the sea ice .
Last year , Arctic sea ice retreated at a record - setting pace .
Northwest Passage open
The Inupiat residents of Barrow were stunned last fall when a cruise ship and 400 Germans showed up in their town .
They had arrived from Europe via the Northwest Passage over Canada , which for the first time in recorded history was ice - free .
Larry Mayer , an oceanographer at the University of New Hampshire who helped lead a similar Arctic trip last summer , said he was shocked at how easily the team could navigate through the region .
He noted the irony that the rapid melting " was bad for the Arctic , but very , very good for mapping . "

Storm could swamp GOP convention
Planners of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul held emergency conversations Wednesday about what to do if a tropical storm continues on its track as a potential Category 3 hurricane threatening New Orleans .
Gustav ’s projected path suggests possible landfall on the convention ’s opening day — Labor Day .

The storm could threaten everything from President Bush ’s Monday night address to the broader Republican message of effective government management .
Local officials fear a Katrina II — a rerun of the storm that ravished New Orleans and badly damaged Bush ’s image .
Aides said Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu planned to leave the Democratic National Convention in Denver and head back home .
The liberal group Progressive Accountability planned to try to embarrass Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) on Friday for his response to the Katrina strike , claiming his was the 40th senator to visit New Orleans afterwards .
“ We will be making sure everyone knows it is not just Bush who has a Katrina problem , ” said the group ’s Eddie Vale .
“ McCain was eating birthday cake with Bush after the levees broke .
And then he voted against oversight , against medicaid for victims , and against unemployment benefits for victims . ”
Government forecasters said the target area runs from south Texas to the Florida Panhandle — including the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts devastated by Katrina .
The president , Laura Bush and Vice President Cheney are all scheduled to speak Monday on the convention ’s opening day .
Friday is the third anniversary of Katrina ’s landfall .
The sloppy government response still haunts the Bush administration , raising questions about whether the president would address a political gathering if the Southeast coast was being battered by another monster storm .
The president is scheduled to fly into St. Paul on Monday , speak at the Xcel Energy Center at 9:40 p.m.
Central time , then fly home to spend the night at Camp David .
Spokespeople for the organizations involved in convention planning said they were not ready to comment .
“ Stay tuned , ” e-mailed an official involved in the conversations .
Home heating assistance bill fails in Senate
Despite having 52 co-sponsors , a bipartisan measure to double home heating assistance to poor families failed in the Senate on Saturday morning , falling victim to the ongoing stalemate over how to address high gas prices .
A vote to take up the popular bill failed 50 - 35 , with 6 Republican co-sponsors voting against taking it up .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) voted against taking up the measure in order to " keep the Democrat leadership at the table until we do something serious about gas prices " arguing that the chamber should focus on crafting a comprehensive plan to address high energy costs before taking up specific pieces of the debate .
McConnell accused Democrats of bringing up the home heating issue as a standalone bill in order to avoid politically troublesome votes on domestic oil drilling , an argument that infuriated Democrats .
" Republicans ’ opposition to this assistance is indefensible , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
" They shoulder the burden of millions of low - income families , senior citizens and those with disabilities who are struggling and suffering to pay their ever - rising energy bills . ”
Republican Sens. John Sununu of New Hampshire and Norm Coleman of Minnesota — both facing difficult reelection campaigns this fall — voted for the measure , despite objections from their leadership .
" To me , this is part of the energy debate , " said Coleman .
" This is central to the energy issue . "
Speaking to reporters after the vote , Reid said he had no plans to bring the bill back to the floor anytime soon .
Reid said Republicans were " walking the plank " by objecting to the bill and would pay the price in November .
And with both sides desperately trying to paint the other into a corner on the energy issue , expect to hear plenty more about this vote in the future .
Folks , this will be explosive .
Stay tuned .
Let 's get on the phone and emails to those committee members telling them to move swiftly .
UPDATE : A friendly reminder ( hat tip to kck ) to tune into CSPAN3 this Thursday for Kyle Sampson 's testimony .
Details :
UPDATE # 2 Speaker Pelosi 's website now includes a non-PDF version of Henry Waxman 's letter .
From her website :
Mr. Abramoff responded : " Dammit .
It was sent to Susan on her rnc pager and was not supposed to go into the WH system . "
Your e-mail to Susan was forwarded to Ruben Barrales and on to Jen Farley , who read it to me last night .
I do n’t know what to think about this , but she said it is better not to put this stuff in writing in their e-mail system because it might actually limit what they can do to help us , especially since there could be lawsuits , etc. ...
Just letting you know what she said . ’
The e-mail exchanges reviewed by the Committee provide evidence that in some instances , White House officials were using the nongovemmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications .
ln one case , Mr. Abramoff sent Ms. Ralston an e-mail on her RNC account asking her to " pass on to Karl that Interior is about to approve a gaming compact ... for a tribe which is an anathema to all our supporters " and requesting " some quiet message from WH that this is absurd . "
This e-mail was forwarded to Jennifer Farley in the White House Office of Intergovemmental Affairs , who apparently then warned one of Abramoff s associates about the dangers of leaving a record of their communications .
According to an e-mail Mr. Abramoff received from his associate Kevin Ring :
Citing evidence that senior White House officials are using RNC and other political email accounts to avoid leaving a record of official communications , Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman sent letters today to the Republican National Committee and the Bush - Cheney ’04 Campaign directing them to preserve the emails of White House officials and to meet with Committee staff to explain how the accounts are managed and what steps are being taken to protect the emails from destruction and tampering .
As noted this morning , such emails were sent in connection to the resignations of US Attorneys , but as Chairman Waxman ’s letters note , they were used in other circumstances as well .
In his letter to Marc Racicot , Former Chairman of Bush Cheney ‘ 04 , Chairman Waxman describes one revealing exchange involving convicted former lobbyist Jack Abramoff :
And the full text of the letter to Governor Racicot , Former Chairman of the Bush Cheney ' 04 campaign :
The Honorable Marc Racicot
Former Chairman , Bush Cheney’04
President , American Insurance Association
1130 Connecticut Ave. NW , Suite 1000
Washington , DC 20036
Dear Governor Racicot :
I am writing about e-mail records in the possession of the Bush Cheney ‘ 04 campaign .
Congressional investigations have revealed that White House officials have used nongovernmental e-mail accounts , including those maintained by the Bush Cheney ’ 04 campaign , to conduct official White House business .
The Committee has questions about who has access to these e-mail records and how the campaign protects them from destruction or tampering .
The Committee also directs you to preserve all such records because of their potential relevance to congressional investigations .
Two congressional investigations - one by the Oversight Committee and one by the House and Senate Judiciary Committees - have uncovered evidence that White House staff have used nongovernmental e-mail accounts to conduct official government business .
Such emails written in the conduct of White House business would appear to be governmental records subject to preservation and eventual public disclosure .
The Presidential Records
Act of 1978 establishes that the records of a president , his immediate staff , and certain units of the Executive Office of the President belong to the United States , not to the individual president or his staff .
The Act further states that the president must " take all such steps as may be necessary to assure that the activities , deliberations , decisions , and policies that reflect the performance of his constitutional , statutory , or other official or ceremonial duties are adequately documented and that such records are maintained as Presidential records pursuant to the requirements of this section and other provisions of law . "
The Oversight Committee first learned of the use of nongovernmental e-mail accounts by White House officials as part of its investigation of White House contacts with convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
That investigation found that many of the e-mail exchanges between Jack Abramoff and White House officials were conducted via nongovernmental e-mail accounts .
In at least one case , the emails indicate that these nonofficial accounts were being used because " to put this stuff in writing in their e-mail system ... might actually limit what they can do to help us . "
The Abramoff investigation found that in multiple instances , Susan Ralston , Karl Rove ’s Executive Assistant , exchanged e-mails with Jack Abramoff regarding official government business while using accounts maintained by the Republican National Committee and the Bush Cheney ‘ 04 campaign . ’
The investigation also found that Barry Jackson , the Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy to the Senior Advisor , used a " georgewbush.com " e-mail account to communicate with Neil Volz , an Abramoff associate who has been convicted of public comrption charges .
The e-mail exchanges reviewed by the Committee provide evidence that in some instances , White House officials were using the nongovernmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications .
ln one case , Mr. Abramoff sent Ms. Ralston an e-mail on her RNC account asking her to " pass on to Karl that Interior is about to approve a gaming compact ... for a tribe which is an anathema to all our supporters " and requesting " some quiet message from WH that this is absurd . "
This e-mail was forwarded to Jennifer Farley in the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs , who apparently then warned one of Abramoff ’s associates about the dangers of leaving a record of their communications .
According to an e-mail Mr. Abramoff received from his associate Kevin Ring :
Your e-mail to Susan was forwarded to Ruben Barrales and on to Jen Farley , who read it to me last night .
I do n’t know what to think about this , but she said it is better not to put this stuff in writing in their e-mail system because it might actually limit what they can do to help us , especially since there could be lawsuits , etc. ...
Just letting you know what she said . ’
Mr. Abramoff responded : " Dammit .
It was sent to Susan on her rnc pager and was not supposed to go into the WH system . "
Evidence of the use of nongovernmental e-mail accounts has also emerged in the investigation of the firing of U.S. Attorneys being conducted by the House and Senate Judiciary Committees .
As part of this investigation , the Department of Justice has released thousands of pages of documents regarding the dismissal of eight U.S. Attorneys in 2006 .
Among the documents released by the Justice Department is an e-mail exchange between J. Scott Jennings , the Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Political Affairs in the White House , and Kyle Sampson , the Chief of Staff of the Justice Department , that discussed how to replace Arkansas U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins with Tim Griffin in a way that " would alleviate pressure / implication that Tim forced Bud out . "
In this e-mail exchange , as well as other exchanges , Mr. Jennings used a " gvtb43.com " e-mail account maintained by the Republican
National Committee .
A recent article in National Journal suggests that the use of nongovernmental e-mails by some high - ranking White House officials may be a common practice .
According to this account , one former White House official said that Karl Rove uses his RNC account for " about 95 percent " of his e-mail .
The National Journal account also raised questions about the preservation of these records .
The article reports that the same former official said that the RNC has a policy of purging all e-mails after a short period of time , though it has chosen to preserve Mr. Rove ’s e-mails .
The e-mails of White House officials maintained on Bush Cheney ‘ 04 e-mail accounts may be relevant to multiple congressional investigations .
For this reason , the Committee directs you to preserve all e-mails sent or received by White House officials using e-mail accounts under your control .
In addition , the Committee requests that you or your designee meet with Committee staff during the week of April 2 , 2007 , to discuss the following five matters :
(l) Who has access to the e-mail accounts maintained by the Bush Cheney ‘ 04 campaign ;
(2) What policies , guidance , and procedures govern the use and preservation of the email accounts maintained by the Bush Cheney ‘ 04 campaign that have been used by White House officials ;
(3) What agreements , if any , did the Bush Cheney ‘ 04 campaign enter into with the White House , the National Archives , or other government agencies regarding the e-mail accounts maintained by the campaign that have been used by White House officials ;
(4) What steps have been taken to preserve the e-mail accounts maintained by the Bush Cheney ‘ 04 campaign that have been used by White House officials ;
(5) What assurance can the Bush Cheney ‘ 04 campaign provide the Committee that no e-mails involving official White House business have been destroyed or altered .
I will appreciate your cooperation in this matter .
If you have any questions about this request , please contact David Rapallo or Anna Laitin of the Committee staff at ( 202 ) 225-5420 .
Sincerely ,
Henry A. Waxman
Chairman

McCain is picking up Bush ’s trick of saying things that just are n’t true .
Last week , it was Iraq .
This week it ’s Katrina .
So , here ’s a little hint for the media :
As with Bush , just because McCain says something , does n’t mean it ’s true .
From the DNC :
During his media availability in Baton Rouge today , John McCain told reporters that he “ supported every investigation ” into what went wrong during Hurricane Katrina .
Unfortunately for the people of Louisiana , that is just not true .
John McCain voted TWICE to oppose a Congressional commission to examine the federal , state , and local response to the disaster : once in September 2005 and again in February 2006 .
McCain ’s outright deception today is the latest in a string of misstatements and distortions on key issues that call into question his willingness to mislead the American people , telling them what he thinks they want to hear instead of the truth .
Just last week , John McCain falsely claimed that our forces in Iraq had drawn down to pre-surge levels , then used a defense that was so misleading , one fact checker called it “ an insult to our intelligence . ”
He falsely claimed Iran was training al - Qaida in Iraq , claimed he could walk peacefully through a Baghdad market despite requiring a massive security escort , and denied he had ever said he did n’t understand the economy–all of which have proven inaccurate .
Core Wars Genetics : The Evolution of Predation John Perry ( jperry@cs.ucla.edu )
I. Introduction
The domain of binary biology , or binology , has enough interesting properties that there is truly no need to go outside of its bounds to provide good A - life experiments .
Processes can be born , die , move , reproduce , communicate , and do a host of other things without having to stretch to doing things like smelling .
The abundance of computer viruses and worms demonstrate the ability of processes to take on characteristics of life .
In fact , these programs are lifelike enough to scare computer users into taking precautions against them as they would against any parasite .
This raises an important issue in the field of binology .
If we are to study processes which may potentially run amok ( and in fact unpredictable behavior is something we often hope for ) , we must be careful not to affect other people 's processes lest we follow the fate of Robert Morris .
One way to keep our experiments leashed is to work on an isolated computer .
The problem with this is that a computer with no hard disk , no network , and no other users that is still reasonably powerful is a hard thing to come by .
A more reasonable way to maintain control is to run our experiments in a controlled environment which is still quite like the overall environment .
Core Wars is one such environment .
II .
Core Wars as a Binological Model
instructions DAT - a data value , non-executable .
MOV - move data from one address to another ADD - add two values and store in the second location SUB - subtract two values and store in the second location CMP - compare two locations and skip an instruction if they contain identical information JMP - unconditional jump to some address JMZ - jump to some address on the condition of some data value being zero JMN - jump to some address on the condition of some data value being non-zero SPL - split into two processes , one starting at the next address and one at a specified address DJN - decrement some data value and jump to some address if the value decremented is now zero addressing modes # - immediate $ - direct @ - indirect < - indirect with predecrement illustration 1 : the Redcode instruction set
Depending on how one wishes to apply it , Core Wars is capable of providing a wide variety of different kinds of A - life experiments .
Steen Rasmussen [ 1990 ] altered the rules slightly and came up with a self - contained evolutionary environment , sort of a binary version of the primordial soup experiment .
A potential result of this type of experiment would be to determine whether reproduction or metabolism tends to evolve first within a random coreworld .
That is , to find out if delineated programs with some function develop first , or auto - associative clusters of code .
Bill Buckley has shown various reactions between warriors , and involving warriors which degenerate to strange attractors over time .
This type of experiment shows that Core Wars warriors are capable of behavior much like the biological process of ontogeny .
Both of these types of experiment use a Core Wars arena as a closed world { 2} , or in other words the whole experiment goes on within the realm of the arena , however it is defined .
An alternative is to view the Core Wars arena as an open world , or more specifically as the visible part of some larger system .
The larger system I have in mind is an evolutionary process .
By applying a genetic algorithm to warrior populations , it should be possible to evolve warriors which perform some desired task .
The most obvious task to attempt to evolve in this domain is survival .
That is , start with randomly generated code and attempt to evolve programs that will thrive in a Core Wars arena .
This survival could be with no other opponent , with a fairly benign opponent , or even with an opponent that is rather savage .
Each of these conditions of the evolution would likely cause different survival strategies to come about .
For my project , I wanted to go one step further .
Rather than evolving something which may have ended up as prey for some other warrior , I chose to evolve a predator .
John Holland , among others , has spoken of a biological arms race ; my goal is to create the world 's first binological arms race .
III .
Evolution in Core Wars
One difficult problem with applying genetic algorithms to Core Wars consists of choosing the level of the gene .
As in biology , it is n't clear what the optimal size is for the smallest information carrying unit of genetic code .
Three distinct levels present themselves as viable candidates for the level of the binological gene :
The bit , the instruction , and the meta - instruction .
By meta - instruction , I am simply referring to an abstract chunk of code which has some function which will show up at the phenotype level .
In biological genetics features like ' blue eyes ' , or ' eight legs ' , or ' black feathers ' would be an example of a meta - instruction , and in fact this is the level at which most work in biological genetics is done .
A binological meta-instruction should consist of more than one instruction since most interesting things that can be done by a computer can't be done by one instruction .
An example of the meta- instruction level with respect to Core Wars is something like ' copy block ' or ' DAT bomb ' { 3} .
The researchers on the Tracker project chose the bit as the gene level .
They could do this because they were representing FSA 's and neural networks , which are fairly robust .
Thus it was difficult if not impossible to generate creatures that would n't execute at all .
In Core Wars and other assembly languages it is much easier to generate illegal code , as changing a single bit can easily create an illegal instruction .
Furthermore , in the initial tracker project the ants were represented by 40 bits , thus allowing 2^40 possible creatures .
In Core Wars , each instruction is 40 bits long , so the space of creatures is considerably larger , depending on how many instructions one allows per warrior ( see appendix A for calculations of the size of the space of my experiment ) .
The best justification for the bit as the gene level of binology is that it is truly the smallest unit of information that one can change on a computer .
On the other hand , single bits are n't always critical in a functional sense on computers .
Changing a bit in an unused data field may make no difference in how the instruction at that address executes , or in the functional performance of the program .
The instruction level is the smallest level of binological representation which assures functional distinction in the phenotype .
For this reason , I chose this level to be the genes in my experiments , but I allow mutations at a sub - gene level .
In other words , when two warriors are being mated , the instruction level is the level of crossover , although mutation works at a bit level .
The Tracker project researchers suggested that assembly language is not robust enough for this type of experiments , but I have to disagree .
Not even humans have achieved a 100 % survival ratio , so why should the things that we 're evolving have that advantage ?
I propose that a high death rate in fact more closely resembles biological life .
Certainly I may evolve a high number of warriors that die after executing only a few instructions , but do n't babies occasionally fall victim to crib - death ?
And yes , two excellent warriors may happen to spawn a warrior that is n't nearly as complex or effective , but do n't birth defects ( mongolism , for example ) still exist in humans and other animals ?
My point is that genetics has never been a very clean process and it will probably always be generating bitter fruit as well as good .
Another problem to consider is how to go about fitness testing .
Obviously it can be done by a MARS , but what is the best thing to fight the evolving warriors against ?
The most realistic thing to do , in an evolutionary sense , is to fight all of the warriors of each generation against each other .
In this way , all warriors would be fighting other warriors of approximately the same evolutionary complexity , and hopefully comparable fighting skills .
Dawkins would like this scheme , since it would have no obvious evolutionary goal .
The problem with this is that it is a fairly slow process , as nature has shown us , and it also requires a great number of battles .
An alternative is to fight all of the warriors against a common opponent , preferably one with fairly good fighting skills .
A previous entry in the Core Wars tournament would be a likely candidate .
This should be considerably faster , both because the number of battles at each generation will be less and because there will be a clear evolutionary goal .
Contrary to what Dawkins might say , this is a realistic strategy since many biological animals in our world have to learn to deal with man- made opponents ( dodging cars , avoiding electric fences , etc. ) .
The next thing to consider is which warrior to choose .
If we choose a warrior that is too weak or too strong it wo n't be useful .
Every warrior gets the same fitness score if they all win or all lose .
It would be better to fight two or three warriors at varying levels of strength , thus allowing the genetic warriors to vary more widely in their fitness scores .
Furthermore , this may keep them from evolving a strategy which is only useful against one specific warrior .
On this same point , it may help to vary some of the warriors between generations , hopefully to provide added diversity of strategies .
In terms of the fitness score itself , it can use the same formula which is used for the tournament : 3 points per win and 1 point per tie { 4} .
This type of fitness scoring has a side effect that it evolves survival as well as predation .
This is actually very helpful , since a program which attacks well , but can't survive is n't as good as one that attacks well and can survive .
IV .
Experiments Conducted
In addition there was a very small percent chance ( .05 % , to be exact ) of mutation for each instruction being copied .
Whereas mutation in Tracker consisted of simply flipping a bit , it was a much more complex process in my experiment .
After discussing this with a few people who had done some similar work , I ended up allowing a small random chance ( 5 % ) of each bit in the instruction to be flipped .
Since there are 40 bits in an instruction , this means that I should have expected about 2 bits to have been flipped in an average mutated instruction .
Holland [ 1975 ] suggested that a dominance change operator could be used reduce the damage done by generation of illegal instructions in situations like this , but I felt that it would n't significantly harm the experiment to allow a few illegal instructions to be generated , since they would only be fatal to the specific warrior containing that instruction , and only if it executes the instruction .
I did all of these described genetic manipulations directly on object code files , but if I want to clarify what a particular piece of code is doing , I can always disassemble it into Redcode source code .
In future experiments there are some things I may change , like the fact that warriors only live for one generation , but in general the paradigm I used is practical because it was easy to understand and apply .
Experiment 1 : the tournament warriors
It turned out to be worse than I thought .
I did the experiment on an IBM PC , which allows a maximum of 200 normal files in a directory .
After this , it allows files to be created in that directory , but it actually stores them all in one file , which slows down their access time considerably .
Since my program generated 1000 warriors for a population , this was very costly in terms of time .
Moreover , my method of fitness testing was n't very successful as well .
I could n't very well run each warrior against every other warrior , as this would amount to 999,000 battles , and I knew this .
My proposed solution was to test the warriors in smaller groups , and then test the ones that had done well in these smaller groups against each other .
I started a round of fitness testing at about 10:00 the first night , and when it was still running in the morning and was only about 2/3 complete , I knew I was in trouble .
I ended up by doing fitness testing by choosing pairs of warriors , competing them , and taking down the results by hand .
I did this for two generations of 80 warriors tested per generation , and then I ran out of time .
I took the two best warriors from the second generation , named C19 and C25 ( child 19 and child 25 ) , and entered them in the tournament .
The results of the tournament were about what I expected ; the two genetic warriors did n't win .
But surprisingly , they did n't finish in last place either .
Actually they placed second and third to last , but this means that they both beat a program that was written by a human who deemed it worthy of entry in the tournament .
Furthermore , C19 beat one of the warriors that made it to the finals in a battle .
This was notable performance for the first genetic warriors ever entered in the tournament , but not nearly as good as I had hoped to achieve .
This experiment was useful in a few ways , mainly as a critical review of my methods for the experiment which in general were crisis motivated and fairly poor .
I used this information to improve my methods for the second experiment , and the results were much better .
One of the bad methods was that my inadequate allocation of time did n't allow me to generate and test large enough populations .
Eighty warriors per generation is not nearly a large enough sample size to even make a dent in the space I am exploring , and it also does n't allow for sufficient variation between populations , somewhat like inbreeding in humans .
Another problem came from my choice of warriors to seed the 0th generation .
Since these warriors were significantly different in their design , they did n't tend to breed well , it was a bit like breeding dogs and sponges , or apples and scorpions .
This meant that there were a vast number of progeny that were non-functional ( i.e. that died after executing only a few instructions ) .
Experiment 2 : the better warriors
I changed the method of fitness testing to test all of the warriors of each generation against a few known warriors , thus allowing me to do larger population sizes of 1000 warriors per generation .
Two warriors which I chose to be used in testing all generations were selected for how they did in the 1990 International Core Wars tournament .
QUARTER2 finished fourth to last , and thereby was chosen to provide an easy kill for the warriors .
I felt this was necessary to get the early generations off the ground , and it worked out rather nicely .
WANG1 was one of the finalists in the tournament ( the finals results are n't out yet ) , and thus it was chosen to sort of play king of the mountain .
Warriors that tied or defeated WANG1 would have to have something going for them .
By battling WANG1 and QUARTER2 against each generation , I provided a consistent yardstick against which successive generations could be measured .
Additional warriors I used for fitness testing included two past winners of the International Core Wars Tournament ( FERRET and COWBOY ) and three of the other four finalists from this years tournament ( PWRBOMB , HYPRAY , and RNDMFIRE ) .
All five of these other warriors were to play a similar role to that of WANG1 , and also to help distinguish between the good and the very good warriors .
By varying which additional warriors competed against the genetic warriors each generation I hoped to evolve more robustness , and greater variety of strategies .
Fitness testing still took a long time to run however , each generation taking about 24 hours to test .
In addition , although the testing was done by the computer , I had to go through the results of the battles by hand , calculate the fitness scores ( 3 points per win and 1 point per tie ) , and determine which warriors would be the lucky parents for the next generation .
This was somewhat time consuming , so I only completed three generations by the time of the writing of this paper .
This is an ongoing project however , and I expect to complete ten to twenty generations before I make any bold statements about the validity of the experiment .
I selected the top 10 % of each generation to be allowed to reproduce , but this was partially an ad hoc process , since there was n't a clear line to break at in most cases between about the top 5 % and 20 % .
In other words , in each generation some warriors did very very well , and many warriors did just pretty well .
To do tie breaking between the ones that only did pretty well , I had to use arbitrary methods of choosing , which usually meant battling them against each other and watching for warriors which were particularly effective against their sibling warriors .
V. Results and Conclusions
On observing some of the later battles I noticed that a sort of speciation occurred .
There were large numbers of certain types of warriors and then a few novel types .
One type of warriors would deteriorate to a single instruction that was executing ( probably a JMP $ 0 , which just jumps to itself ad infinitum ) .
I called this species the hiders .
This strategy gained many ties against warriors that bombed at uneven intervals throughout memory , since they had trouble finding the one location in memory where their opponent was .
Programs that copy themselves around the arena often copied themselves over one of these warriors , and the hider then comes out of its hiding place and mimics the other program .
Hiders tended to get many ties , but only won by some strange chance , like as a side effect of mimicry .
Hiders are particularly susceptible to be killed by warriors that bomb consecutively through memory .
A species that does that very thing are the ones that I have named blind - bombers .
These warriors bomb furiously through memory , usually with a DAT bomb .
If placed close behind a program like FERRET or RNDMFIRE one of these programs could strike quickly and get a kill , but if a program moves out of the way a blind - bomber will eventually bomb around the whole space ( which addresses as a modulus ring ) and kill itself .
A variant of this species which my program evolved is the imp { 5} blind - bomber .
This amazing little program not only bombs consecutively with an imp , but it also evolved an imp stomper to catch the imps it creates .
The fact that it evolved cooperative processes in such a small number of generations is quite a feat .
Another variant of the blind bomber is the blind - JMP - bomber , which bombs consecutively through memory with some sort of jump instructions .
This sounds simple enough , but it caused a few problems for some of the " yardstick " warriors , and also produced unusual battles .
They were probably only unusual to me because this is not a commonly used strategy for human - programmed warriors .
So far , I am pleased with the results of the second experiment and I hope that future generations turn out to be as interesting and enlightening as the first three .
VI . Future Work
One possible experiment would be to test for preadaptation by using only one opposing warrior to test against for many generations and then change the opponent .
It would be interesting to see if the programs that evolved in this situation developed a specific strategy for their long term opponent , and if so , how long they retained any of that strategy after said opponent was gone .
Other interesting experiments would be to attempt to evolve movement or self - reproduction .
The problem with these potential experiments is how to go about fitness testing for self - reproduction or movement .
Perhaps movement could be forcibly evolved by a certain kind of opposing warrior , but self - reproduction is not that simple .
A feature which could enhance the power of this type of Core Wars experiments would be a disassemler .
The speed of my experiments and the size of the population could be vastly increased if I were to run the experiments on a more powerful machine ( say for example a CM2 ) .
This would also generate a whole new set of problems to be solved like how to run the fitness testing in parallel and how to represent an 8 K arena ( 8 K 40 bit words , that is ) in the 8 K bit memory space of each cell .
On the positive side , though , 200 generations in an hour sounds much better than 4 generations in a week .
With a space as large as the one that I am exploring in this experiment , the additional size and speed should be a vast improvement in terms of area of space searched .
If I can get fairly complex warriors in only 3 generations on an IBM PC , just imagine what kind of warriors could be evolved with a CM2 .

Minimum Average Maximum I. Instruction mix of warriors of minimal , maximal , and average size : Initial DATs 0 5 9 Instructions 10 20 30 Final DATs 0 5 9 II .
Number of possible warriors of minimal , maximal , and average size : a ) By number of bits : 2^400 2^1160 2^1848 b)
By legal instructions only : 2^390 2^1140 2^1818 c)
What I actually allowed : 77^10 x 2^300 77^20 x 2^920 77^30 x 2^1476
a) By number of bit -
In this case , the DAT instructions at the beginning and end will have 36 bits of unspecified information ( 4 of the bits indicate a DAT ) and the general instructions will have 40 bits of unspecified information , so :
MIN - 10 instructions @ 40 bits / instr = 400 bits of unspecified data => 2^400 possible warriors
AVG - 10 DAT instructions @ 36 bits / DAT = 360 bits + 20 instructions @ 40 bits / instr = 800 bits = 1160 total bits of unspecified data => 2^1160 possible warriors
MAX - 18 DATs @ 36 bits / DAT = 648 bits + 30 instructions @ 40 bits / instr = 1200 bits = 1848 total bits of unspecified data => 2^1848 possible warriors
b) By legal instructions only - This restriction merely removes certain instruction types which are impossible .
Specifically , there cannot be an immediate addressing mode for the A - fields of the JMP , SPL , DJN , JMZ , or JMN instructions or the B - fields of the ADD , SUB , or MOV instructions , since the former specify addresses to store data at and the latter specify addresses to branch to .
The size of the A - field and B - field are each 16 bits , thus there are 32 bits of data per instruction .
DAT and CMP instructions -
2 different opcodes = 2
36 bits free = 2^36
=> 2 x 2^36 = 2^37 legal DAT or CMP instructions
JMP , SPL , DJN , JMZ , and JMN instructions -
5 different opcodes = 5
3 possible modes for A - field = 3
2 bits for mode for B - field + 32 bits of data = 2^34 => 3 x 5 x 2^34 = 15 x 2^34 legal branching instructions
ADD , SUB , and MOV instructions -
3 different opcodes = 3
3 possible modes for B - field = 3
2 bits for mode for A - field + 32 bits of data = 2^34 => 3 x 3 x 2^34 = 9 x 2^34 legal writing instructions
So for considering all possible legal instructions , there are a total of 2^37 + 15 x 2^34 + 9 x 2^34 = ( 8 + 15 + 9 ) x 2^34 = 32 x 2^34 = 2^39 legal instructions
MIN - 10 instructions @ 2^39 legal instructions = ( 2^39 ) ^10 => 2^390 possible warriors
AVG - 10 DATs @ 36 bits / DAT = ( 2^36 ) ^10 = 2^360 20 instructions @ 2^39 legal instructions = ( 2^39 ) ^20 = 2^780 => 2^360 x 2^780 = 2^1140 possible warriors
MAX - 18 DATs @ 36 bits / DAT = ( 2^36 ) ^18 = 2^648 30 instructions @ 2^39 legal instructions = ( 2^39 ) ^20 = 2^1170 => 2^648 x 2^1170 = 2^1818 possible warriors
c ) What I actually allowed - in addition to the restrictions to generate legal instructions , I also restricted the size of the A and B fields to ( - 8192,8192 ) since the size of the space I 'm working in is 8192 , and thus larger values would be redundant by modulus .
This allows a total of 28 bits for the A and B data fields .
DAT & CMP : 2 opcodes = 2
28 bits of data field + 4 bits of addressing modes = 2^32 => 2 x 2^32 = 2^33 practical DAT or CMP instructions
JMP , SPL , DJN , JMZ , and JMN :
5 opcodes x 3 A - field modes = 15
28 bits of data field + 2 bits of B - field modes = 2^30 => 15 x 2^30 practical branching instructions
ADD , SUB , and MOV :
3 opcodes x 3 B - field modes = 9
28 bits of data field + 2 bits of A - field modes = 2^30 => 9 x 2^30 practical writing instructions
Therefore , considering all possible instructions , we have : 2^33 + 15 x 2^32 + 9 x 2^30 = ( 8 + 60 + 9 ) x 2^30 = 77 x 2^30 practical instructions
MIN - 10 instructions @ 77 x 2^30 practical = ( 77 x 2^30 ) ^10
=> 77^10 x 2^300 possible warriors
AVG - 10 DATs @ 32 bits / DAT = 2^320
20 instructions @ 77 x 2^30 possible instructions = ( 77 x 230 ) ^20 => 2^320 x 77^20 x 2^600 = 77^20 x 2^920 possible warriors
MAX - 18 DATs @ 32 bits /DAT = 2^576
30 instructions @ 77 x 2^30 possible instructions = ( 77 x 2^30 ) ^30 => 2^576 x 77^30 x 2^900 = 77^30 x 2^1476 possible warriors
These figures are slightly misleading .
They represent the number of possible warriors of a particular size , but I weighted my choices so that the range of the data fields of the branching and writing instructions tended to be smaller .
In other words , an instruction that branches is more likely to branch a short distance than a long one , and an instruction that accesses data ( either read or write ) , is more likely to access local data than data which is far away .
I did n't have to do this , but I felt it would make programs that were more likely to have looping structures , and were also more likely to be self modifying .

{ } I was careful not to use the term closed system here , since Steen 's system constantly pumped new random data into the system , thus maintaining an influx of energy in to the system .
{ } Here , ' copy block ' means copying a block of data from one location in memory to another location and ' DAT bomb ' means copying DAT instructions throughout memory .
Both of these are things which are commonly done by warriors .
{ } To be true to Holland 's definition of a genetic algorithm , this value could be normalized by dividing by the maximum value to get a number between 0 and 1 , but I chose not to do this .
My method was actually considerably more ad hoc , and it will be described later .
{ } An imp consists of the single instruction " MOV $ 0 $ 1 " .
This instruction , if executed by a process , will copy itself to the next location in memory .
Then on the next clock cycle , the process will execute that copy and move itself ahead again , and so on .
This is the smallest moving program in Core Wars .
A -G-E-Y-S-V-P-T-S and n-e-g-j-w-a-h-r-x
then if a " crossover " is done at the 3rd gene , they will produce the following pair of child programs :
A - G- E-j-w -a-h-r-x and n-e-g-Y - S- V- P-T-S
The other common reproduction operation is mutation .
In mutation , some piece of one of the child warriors is altered slightly .
Thus if mutation was also applied on the first child in the previous example , the resulting children may look like :
A - G-F-j-w-a-h-r-x and n-e-g-Y - S- V- P-T-S
The object in GAs is to start off with " ramdom " code and to let the GA evolve code to perform a desired task .
Since programs are rewarded for how well they perform on the desired task , each " generation " tends to do better overall on the desired task .
