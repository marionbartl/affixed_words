In a country known for its relatively staid and academic presidential politics , the rise of Francois Bayrou has complicated the usual left - right duopoly of French politics and left observers in a rare state of uncertainty for what the future may hold .
Sharp differences and aggressive campaigning have characterized a melodramatic campaign that seems to place the very future of France in the balance .
But little of the rhetorical fury has been wasted on the subject of trans -Atlantic relationships .
Despite the candidates ’ dramatic calls for rupture and renewal , Americans should not expect a major change in French posture toward the United States — regardless of who wins .
To better understand the contenders ’ likely stance toward the United States , it is worth looking at the forces molding the candidates and their policies .
To convert the process into the American political lexicon , the April 22 runoff elections are in many ways a higher - stakes French version of the American party primaries .
Similar to American primary front - runners , the leading candidates — assuming Mr. Bayrou ’s rise is a sign of widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo — are working double time to mollify their worried bases .
Recent polls now show Mr. Bayrou ’s support flagging as Nicolas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal attack the upstart .
But Mr. Bayrou ’s position — should he make the runoff — remains strong , with several polls predicting he could win by drawing the supporters of the defeated left - or right - wing candidate .
Were Mr. Sarkozy to win the election , France likely would develop a closer relationship with the United States .
Mr. Sarkozy is an admirer of the dynamism of the American economy , and is the rare French politician to seek out a meeting and photo with George W. Bush .
He holds hard - line views on counterterrorism and police matters , and seems tolerant of the Bush administration ’s zealous methods to pursue suspected terrorists .
He strongly supports Israel and seems less interested in continuing Jacques Chirac ’s quixotic attempts to promote France as a mediator and voice of Arab concerns .
Americans who dream of a “ special relationship ” with Mr. Sarkozy , similar to U.S. - British relationship , will likely be disappointed , however .
There is no question the French public views American power with deep skepticism , and Mr. Sarkozy would walk a fine line in many dealings with the United States .
Miss Royal is much more of an enigma than Mr. Sarkozy , having spent little time before her candidacy in the international arena .
During the campaign season , she has refrained from specific foreign policy discussions , and her campaign has sputtered as she has made some gaffes in foreign affairs .
As a Socialist candidate , she does n’t share Mr. Sarkozy ’s admiration of the American economic model and would not be predisposed to seeking a closer relationship with the United States on that basis .
It is also probable Miss Royal will “ run against ” the United States to some degree as a way of attacking the “ pro-U.S. ” Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Bayrou .
It is still worth noting that personalities and style in interactions between world leaders are important — it is unlikely Miss Royal would have the same contentious instincts as Mr. Chirac .
The content of the relationship may not change much , but the tenor of discussion might improve .
One area where Miss Royal has staked an unpopular position is her support for Turkish accession to the European Union , provided the Turks meet certain criteria .
On this one issue her position opposes Mr. Sarkozy ’s and places her on the side of U.S. foreign policy .
This highlights both an uncharacteristic willingness by Miss Royal to depart from safe positions , and perhaps a continuing enthusiasm for the “ European Project ” not shared by the French mainstream .
Her continued support for attempts to revive the European constitution encourages this view .
With Turkey , Miss Royal could be hoping to mobilize young Muslim voters , but she risks conceding to the right the majority that opposes Turkish membership .
Given the unlikelihood of Turkish enlargement passing a promised referendum , Miss Royal may be making a purely political calculation that such a position will give her a whole slice of the electorate while Jean - Marie Le Pen and Messrs .
Sarkozy and Bayrou fracture the majority .
Mr. Bayrou is an unknown quantity — both in his views and his effectiveness as a leader of a coalition government .
One critique he has yet to address in his rapid rise is exactly how he would govern in a country that has essentially been run by two dominant parties .
He is adored by those on the left , tired of the stolid Socialist party .
He also offers an appealing alternative to center - right voters turned off by Mr. Sarkozy ’s hard edges and rhetoric that sometimes verges on xenophobia .
Mr. Bayrou spent some time in the United States and in his something - for - everything style is both an Atlanticist and Europeanist .
But his ability to make sweeping changes , particularly domestically , would depend on the coalition he assembles — one likely to be cobbled from moderates from all parties .
Consequently , his foreign policy would necessarily reflect the attitudes of a country where George Bush and America ’s war on terror remain incredibly unpopular .

C & L caught this observation from Paul Rieckhoff on Countdown the other night :
" One of the things that did happen today that concerned me was that during Bush 's press conference he actually showed a graphic that showed 24 urban military outposts in downtown Baghdad .
I would argue that showing that to the world and potentially to our enemy might compromise moral - might actually compromise operational security .
Our enemies are n't stupid .
They can look at that and figure out a grid coordinate and try and drop mortars on those exact locations . "
George Bush stood up in front of the public with cameras rolling and by all appearances gave away our positions to the enemy .
This was n't a careless slip of the tongue either .
He displayed a prepared map with arrows marking the locations of two dozen new US outposts in and around Baghdad -- with major streets and landmarks thrown in for reference .
Keep that in mind when those locales get hit and the routes leading in and out of them start sporting IEDs ( Which may have already begun BTW ) .
It 's doubtful we will ever know if Bush 's presentation leads directly to American deaths .
Just raising the question would cause the WH and the DoD to go into major spin mode and absolve the Commander - in - Chief of any and all blame a priori .
They would have to deny it until stars burn out , no matter what the evidence .
But stop and think for a second about what kind of full court media press could be bearing down right now on Harry Reid or Barack Obama if either one had displayed that map .
By week 's end Bush had moved on to yet another painfully pathetic claim that the tide is turning :
President George W. Bush on Friday claimed that sectarian murders have dropped by half in Iraq since the latest US military build - up began in February , and said the " direction of the fight is beginning to shift " .
It 's disturbing that our President might be either an exceptionally delusional , fatally arrogant fool , or just a run of the mill pathological liar .
But whatever is going on , it takes a spreadsheet to keep up with all the different ways he can restate the same endless bullshit .
Conversely it 's comforting to think , or hope , or pray , that the episode highlighted by C & L was carefully vetted , or that it represents an isolated example of operational stupidity , one that would not likely be repeated or surpassed by Bush 's fellow neocons .
Then again , those were the same species of bumbling idiots who intentionally posted classified tips on how to make a nuclear bomb on the Internet ... in Arabic .
( Mental Floss ) -- 1 . Dumb as a limestone brick : Indiana 's misguided bid for tourists
The great idea : Turn a small Midwestern town into a tourist mecca for lovers of limestone block .
The great big problem : Limestone block is not as big a draw as you might think .
Cost to taxpayers : $ 700,000
Despite being the undisputed " Limestone Capital of the World , " Bedford , Indiana , always had a hard time figuring out how to parlay its claim to fame into a thriving tourism industry .
That is , until Bedford Chamber of Commerce member Merle Edington came up with a brilliant plan .
In the late 1970s , Edington proposed that Bedford build a Disney - style theme park .
But , instead of cartoon characters , the park 's main attraction would be limestone , featuring a 95 - foot - high replica of the Great Pyramid of Cheops built out of ( you guessed it ) local limestone blocks .
And , on the off chance that a scale model of one world wonder would n't be exciting enough , Edington added plans for an 800 - foot - long replica of the Great Wall of China .
While the power of limestone over the vacationing public is debatable , Edington convinced the Commerce Department 's Economic Development Administration to believe in his dream -- to the tune of $ 700,000 .
Unfortunately , those funds dried up quickly , thanks to Wisconsin senator William Proxmire ( famous for his " Golden Fleece Awards " ridiculing government waste ) , who called attention to the project .
The town was left deep in debt , unable to even pay Edington 's salary .
Today , the abandoned project is little more than a giant rock pile .
2 . How to build a canal in four easy centuries : Dividing and conquering in Florida
The great idea : Build a shipping shortcut through the middle of Florida .
The great big problem :
The plan would effectively turn half the state into an island .
Florida is a peninsula .
Get used to it .
Cost to taxpayers : $ 120 million , in this century anyway .
The Cross - Florida Barge Canal was one of those ideas that refused to go away .
First proposed by Spanish settlers in the 1570s , the canal was supposed to cut through the middle of the peninsula to connect the Atlantic Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico , significantly shortening shipping times .
However , after Florida came under U.S. control in the early 19th century , Congress surveyed the land and decided that any canal that would turn a huge chunk of the state into an island just was n't feasible , and the plan was scrapped .
Fast forward to the Great Depression .
Suddenly , any project that would create 6,000 jobs seemed like a pretty good idea .
President Franklin D. Roosevelt allocated emergency funds to the canal , and digging commenced in 1935 .
A year later , progress stalled due to environmental concerns , then picked back up , then stalled again , and the cycle continued until 1963 , when President Kennedy allocated $ 1 million to the project .
Work began after Kennedy 's death and continued for seven years , but -- yet again -- concerns about the canal 's environmental impact ground progress to a halt .
Finally , in 1991 , the canal ( by this time a $ 120 million partial scar across the middle of the state ) was officially pronounced dead .
The land was converted into a greenway named after Marjorie Harris Carr , the environmentalist who'd led the charge against the canal in the 1960s .
3 . The mess with Texas : Superconducting that 's less than super
The great idea : Build a miracle machine that can replicate the Big Bang , help treat life - threatening illnesses , and maybe even unfold the mysteries of the universe .
The great big problem :
You get what you pay for -- and miracle machines cost way , way too much .
Cost to taxpayers : Roughly $ 12 billion -- and the lives of billions of innocent atoms .
Few government projects have ever been announced with the level of fanfare reserved for the 1980s Superconducting Super Collider .
Housed in a 54 - mile underground tunnel beneath Waxahachie , Texas , the Super Collider was designed to accelerate beams of subatomic particles to fantastic speeds and then crash the particles into one another , purportedly generating huge amounts of energy .
Advocates believed the machine would be able to simulate the conditions present during the Big Bang , thus allowing scientists to gain new insights into the very nature of matter .
But many Super Collider fans made even bolder statements about the machine 's capabilities , pointing out that other devices using similar technology had been used to treat cancer and learn more about HIV .
As potential uses for the machine grew , however , so did the cost ballooning from an original estimate of less than $ 5 billion to just under $ 12 billion .
Finally , in the midst of the 1993 budget - cutting boom , Congress pulled the plug on the project , with less than one - third of the tunnel finished .
For a while , it was used to store Styrofoam cups , but then it was sold off to private businesses for pennies on the dollar .
Although scientists ( and the citizens of Waxahachie ) still mourn the loss of this major research center , there are several other machines in the world that do basically the same thing on a smaller scale .
They 're called particle accelerators , and the largest one is a mere 5 miles in diameter .
4. Building a better future , one spokesmodel at a time : Vanna
White school hits Italy
The great idea :
When creating jobs for the unemployed , cater to the pretty people first .
The great big problem : Regional dignity seems to have gone overlooked .
Cost to taxpayers : 1 million euros ( about $ 1.2 million U.S. )
In 2003 , the European Union came up with a novel solution for lowering soaring unemployment levels among young people in Italy 's Campania region history 's first job - creation program catering solely to the physically attractive .
With a grant of 1 million euros , the EU opened First Tel School , a quasi-educational program designed to train students to become TV game show hostesses .
The eight - month program , labeled " bimbo school " by critics , offered courses on diction , make - up , and other skills necessary to get a job on one of the country 's many popular game and variety shows .
The school 's de facto policy of discriminating against all of Campania 's less toothsome residents aside , First Tel also failed to admit enough students to offer any kind of relief to the region 's unemployed population ( which was estimated to be 50 percent of young people ) .
Fewer than 100 spots were made available to the 1,200 Vanna
White wannabes who applied .
Worse still , even those who did make the cut received a whopping 2 euros for every class attended , as well as auditions for parts in the shows First Tel produced for Italian television stations .
Meanwhile , rejected applicants remained unemployed and got daily , televised reminders of how unappealing they were .
5 . Leave it to beavers : Troubles with the Teton Dam
The great idea : Dam the Snake River in Idaho .
Sounds easy enough .
The great big problem : Holding back the river 's 80 billion gallons of water proved more difficult than engineers thought .
Cost to taxpayers : $ 100 million in construction fees and another $ 2 billion in damage .
The planning and design phase of the Teton Dam in southeastern Idaho took nearly three decades ; the construction took a little more than four years .
The dam 's total collapse , however , took exactly one afternoon .
Realizing you just wasted some serious tax dollars ?
Priceless .
Built for just under $ 100 million between 1972 and 1976 , the Teton Dam was supposed to provide irrigation , electricity , and ( ironically ) flood prevention for the thousands of people living in its 305 - foot - tall shadow .
But as the reservoir reached its full capacity on June 3 , 1976 , several small leaks began to appear in the dam .
Crews were sent to patch the holes , but larger cracks followed , letting through water that eventually engulfed bulldozers and sent workmen fleeing in terror .
Then , on June 5 , the dam suddenly collapsed , sending more than 80 billion gallons of water rushing out of the reservoir and into the valley below .
By the time the water stabilized more than five hours later , 11 people had died and hundreds of thousands of acres of land had been flooded .
Despite the estimated $ 2 billion in damages , officials seriously considered constructing a new dam for several years afterward .
Eventually the idea was abandoned , but more recently , the flood site has gotten some good use as the route of the Teton Dam Marathon .

Three special forces servicemen who were being prosecuted for massacring a group of Chechen civilians in one of Russia 's highest profile criminal trials have gone on the run days before proceedings were expected to draw to a close .
The three men in the Ulman case - named after the officer who controlled the GRU ( chief military intelligence directorate ) unit - had been granted bail despite protests from the victims ' families .
Captain Eduard Ulman , Alexander Kalagansky and Vladimir Voyevodin previously admitted shooting six Chechens , including a pregnant woman , on a mountain road in southern Chechnya in January 2002 , but claimed they were innocent because they were following orders .
Their prosecution has been seen as a test case for attempts to punish war crimes in Chechnya , although critics have questioned why senior officers have not been prosecuted .
A federal warrant was issued for the men's arrest after they failed to appear for two hearings in the southern city of Rostov - on - Don .
Last week prosecutors demanded prison terms of between 18 and 23 years for the soldiers .
Murat Musaev , a lawyer for the victims ' families , said the court had repeatedly refused requests to detain the defendants during their prosecution .
" We were afraid this would happen , " he said .
" It was clear that they would be found guilty and of course no one wants to sit in prison for 20 years . "
Their escape will be an embarrassment for the Kremlin , which has struggled to persuade critics that it is serious about holding war criminals to account after more than a decade of conflict in Chechnya .
The incident that prompted the trial took place near the Chechen village of Dai when the GRU team mistakenly opened fire on a minibus carrying civilians , killing one and wounding two .
The unit was jittery because it was engaged in a sweep designed to capture an Arab warlord , Khattab , fighting on the side of Chechen separatists .
The court heard that after bandaging the wounded Capt Ulman radioed for orders from his superiors , who instructed him to kill the five survivors , apparently in an attempt to cover up the initial blunder .
Mr Musaev said : " By running away these men have shown to the whole world that they know they are guilty . "

Teed off at tax break
Some question the 75 percent exemption given to country clubs Concrete steps leading into Newton 's Cabot Elementary School are crumbling and the building has no handicapped access .
Across town at Fire Station No. 7 , the roof leaks water into the firefighters ' bunk room .
Meanwhile , Charles River Country Club in Newton -- with its rolling fairways and carefully manicured putting greens -- received a $ 381,000 tax break last year under a state law that exempts private country clubs from paying 75 percent of their property taxes .
According to the Newton assessor 's office , Woodland Golf Club also cut $ 301,000 on its tax bill last year and Brae Burn Country Club shaved $ 390,000 from its taxes .
Counting Charles River , that 's more than $ 1 million in taxes that Newton cannot collect from three private , local institutions .
Framingham and Marlborough country clubs also take advantage of the tax break , as do many other private country clubs across the state .
That has outraged Newton Ward 6 Alderwoman at Large Victoria L. Danberg , who said the city could use the money for repairing city schools , fire stations , and other public buildings instead of subsidizing " playgrounds for the wealthy . "
She wants local elected leaders and the city 's legislative delegation to toughen the law .
" We can take them on , " Danberg said .
" I can tell you very few people have sympathy for the poor golfers from these clubs who are crying poverty . "
Historically , few have challenged Chapter 61B of the state tax code , a little - known law enacted in the late 1970s that allows any nonprofit organization to receive a 75 percent reduction in taxes as long as the land is open to the public for " recreational purposes " or owned by a nonprofit organization .
While private country clubs are generally not open to the public , many operate as nonprofit organizations .
The IRS allows the exemption under a provision for " social groups " like country clubs , trade unions , and chambers of commerce .
To qualify , groups must meet exclusively , have a dues - paying membership , and have no written policy that discriminates on the basis of race .
Under the state 's 61B exemption , golf clubs agree to keep their open space undeveloped or repay all tax breaks if their land is ever sold to a developer .
Becky Blaeser , spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Golf Association , which lobbied for the law 's enactment nearly 30 years ago , said the exemption has helped keep many of the state 's smaller golf courses afloat during difficult financial times as well as keeping open space green .
Newton 's three clubs sit on some of the largest undeveloped tracts of land in the city .
Charles River Country Club occupies 219 acres ; Brae Burn is on 193 acres ; and Woodland has 133 acres .
Although only members and their guests are allowed on the grounds , Blaeser questioned whether city residents would want to see the land sold off as a housing subdivision .
" People love to talk about private clubs , but those exemptions are just one piece of this legislation , " Blaeser said .
" You have to look at it like it 's a good thing for the preservation of open land . "
Officials at the state Department of Revenue said they have not calculated the total cost of the tax break across Massachusetts .
But the savings to country clubs can be substantial .
Framingham Country Club , which bills itself online as an " elite " golf course , paid about $ 11,000 in local property taxes for 2007 , according to town officials .
Without the state exemption , the bill would have been in excess of $ 46,000 .
Marlborough Country Club , a relatively modest 61 - acre course in the heart of the city , opens to the public on Mondays and Tuesdays every week .
According to city assessor Anthony Trodella , the land had a market value of $ 9 million this year .
The country club 's board of directors paid the city $ 56,000 in property taxes , saving about $ 168,000 under Chapter 61B .
Club president Michael J. Scafidi of Northborough did not return phone calls .
State Representative Pamela Resor , a Democrat from Marlborough who has filed legislation to make Chapter 61B easier to apply for in recent years , said she appreciates what the law does for conservation , especially in communities that have been overwhelmed by development .
She said she did not pursue an end to the country club exemption , saying it was a trade - off she was willing to accept .
" You take the good with the bad , " she said of the law .
On a recent weekday at Newton Commonwealth Golf Course , many golfers said they appreciated the open space .
What troubled them in general was that they could n't join .
Frank Procopio , a self - described avid golfer , said he could n't afford the initiation fee to belong to one of Newton 's private golf clubs , which run in the tens of thousands of dollars .
He said he would be more sympathetic of a tax break for country clubs if they occasionally opened their doors to the public .
" The way it is now , you 've got to schmooze , or you 've got to know someone , or be the friend of a friend , " he said .
Gerry Goolkasian , a teacher from Lexington , said he was shocked by the tax exemption .
Raised in Newton , he said he worked as a caddy at Brae Burn and saw that membership had its privileges .
" The way money was spent freely by both businessmen and private citizens there makes the idea of it appalling to me , " he said of the exemption .
Danberg , a former finance executive who is running for reelection this fall , said she wants the city 's legislative delegation to take steps to end the exemption .
Earlier this year , she visited some of the city 's country clubs posing as a potential member .
Danberg said Charles River Country Club charged more than $ 50,000 for an initiation fee .
Officials of Charles River did not return calls seeking confirmation of that figure .
To become a member at Newton 's Woodland Golf Club , founded in 1896 , candidates must be sponsored by three current members .
General manager David Garfinkel said a prospective member 's finances , character , and recreational interests are evaluated .
He declined to disclose the initiation fee , but he said the club has a diverse membership .
" It 's important for people to realize we are accessible and not elitist , " he said .
Frannie Capello , president of Newton 's firefighters ' union , said the city 's country clubs will often open up their courses once a year to the city 's firefighters .
While that is much appreciated by firefighters , he said , he did n't think it was worth the revenue lost to the city .
Several city fire stations are in need of repairs and the city has struggled with finding ways to pay for the improvements .
" I 'm kind of taken aback by it , " Capello said of the tax exemption .
" Let 's build on the land and get the tax revenue . "
Dori Zaleznik , chairwoman of the Newton School Committee , said she would also welcome discussion about increasing taxes for the city 's private country clubs .
Many schools need new boilers and other updates .
State Representative Kay Khan , a Newton Democrat , said she was surprised to learn of the exemption and said she would study it further .
Newton Mayor David Cohen , who served multiple terms in the state Legislature , said he would also be interested in discussing the issue further .
State Senator Cynthia Stone Creem , a Democrat from Newton , said in an e-mailed statement that she supported the law because " Chapter 61B has worked to protect open space . "
She did not respond to a request for additional comment by deadline .
Danberg said she would be " very happy to be the lead person crying foul " in an effort to amend the exemption .
She said the worst possible outcome is that country clubs would sell off land to private developers who might build houses -- something she called unlikely .
" I do n't think that would happen , " she said .
" Their membership would say . . . just pony up the rest of the money . "

WASHINGTON ( IPS ) -- Admiral William Fallon , then President George W. Bush 's nominee to head the Central Command ( CENTCOM ) , expressed strong opposition in February to an administration plan to increase the number of carrier strike groups in the Persian Gulf from two to three and vowed privately there would be no war against Iran as long as he was chief of CENTCOM , according to sources with access to his thinking .
Fallon 's resistance to the proposed deployment of a third aircraft carrier was followed by a shift in the Bush administration 's Iran policy in February and March away from increased military threats and toward diplomatic engagement with Iran .
That shift , for which no credible explanation has been offered by administration officials , suggests that Fallon 's resistance to a crucial deployment was a major factor in the intra-administration struggle over policy toward Iran .
The plan to add a third carrier strike group in the Gulf had been a key element in a broader strategy discussed at high levels to intimidate Iran by a series of military moves suggesting preparations for a military strike .
Admiral Fallon 's resistance to a further buildup of naval striking power in the Gulf apparently took the Bush administration by surprise .
Fallon , then Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command , had been associated with naval aviation throughout his career , and last January , Secretary of Defence Robert Gates publicly encouraged the idea that the appointment presaged greater emphasis on the military option in regard to the U.S. conflict with Iran .
Explaining why he recommended Fallon , Gates said , " As you look at the range of options available to the United States , the use of naval and air power , potentially , it made sense to me for all those reasons for Fallon to have the job . "
Bush administration officials had just leaked to CBS News and the New York Times in December that the USS John C. Stennis and its associated warships would be sent to the Gulf in January six weeks earlier than originally planned in order to overlap with the USS Eisenhower and to " send a message to Tehran " .
But that was not the end of the signaling to Iran by naval deployment planned by administration officials .
The plan was for the USS Nimitz and its associated vessels , scheduled to sail into the Gulf in early April , to overlap with the other two carrier strike groups for a period of months , so that all three would be in the Gulf simultaneously .
Two well - informed sources say they heard about such a plan being pushed at high levels of the administration , and Newsweek 's Michael Hirsh and Maziar Bahari reported Feb. 19 that the deployment of a third carrier group to the Gulf was " likely " .
That would have brought the U.S. naval presence up to the same level as during the U.S. air campaign against the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq , when the Lincoln , Constellation and Kitty Hawk carrier groups were all present .
Two other carrier groups helped coordinate bombing sorties from the Mediterranean .
The deployment of three carrier groups simultaneously was not part of a plan for an actual attack on Iran , but was meant to convince Iran that the Bush administration was preparing for possible war if Tehran continued its uranium enrichment programme .
At a mid-February meeting of top civilian officials over which Secretary of Defence Gates presided , there was an extensive discussion of a strategy of intimidating Tehran 's leaders , according to an account by a Pentagon official who attended the meeting given to a source outside the Pentagon .
The plan involved a series of steps that would appear to Tehran to be preparations for war , in a manner similar to the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
But Fallon , who was scheduled to become the CENTCOM chief Mar. 16 , responded to the proposed plan by sending a strongly - worded message to the Defence Department in mid-February opposing any further U.S. naval buildup in the Persian Gulf as unwarranted .
" He asked why another aircraft carrier was needed in the Gulf and insisted there was no military requirement for it , " says the source , who obtained the gist of Fallon 's message from a Pentagon official who had read it .
Fallon 's refusal to support a further naval buildup in the Gulf reflected his firm opposition to an attack on Iran and an apparent readiness to put his career on the line to prevent it .
A source who met privately with Fallon around the time of his confirmation hearing and who insists on anonymity quoted Fallon as saying that an attack on Iran " will not happen on my watch " .
Asked how he could be sure , the source says , Fallon replied , " You know what choices I have .
I 'm a professional . "
Fallon said that he was not alone , according to the source , adding , " There are several of us trying to put the crazies back in the box . "
Fallon 's opposition to adding a third carrier strike group to the two already in the Gulf represented a major obstacle to the plan .
The decision to send a second carrier task group to the Gulf had been officially requested by Fallon 's predecessor at CENTCOM , Gen .
John Abizaid , according to a Dec. 20 report by the Washington Post 's Peter Baker .
But as Baker reported , the circumstances left little doubt that Abizaid was doing so because the White House wanted it as part of a strategy of sending " pointed messages " to Iran .
CENTCOM commander Fallon 's refusal to request the deployment of a third carrier strike group meant that proceeding with that option would carry political risks .
The administration chose not to go ahead with the plan .
Two days before the Nimitz sailed out of San Diego for the Gulf on Apr. 1 , a Navy spokesman confirmed that it would replace the Eisenhower , adding , " There is no plan to overlap them at all . "
The defeat of the plan for a third carrier task group in the Gulf appears to have weakened the position of Cheney and other hawks in the administration who had succeeded in selling Bush on the idea of a strategy of coercive threat against Iran .
Within two weeks , the administration 's stance had already begun to shift dramatically .
On Jan. 12 , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had dismissed direct talks with Iran in the absence of Tehran 's suspension of its uranium enrichment programme as " extortion " .
But by the end of February , Rice had gotten authorisation for high level diplomatic contacts with Iran in the context of a regional meeting on Iraq in Baghdad .
The explanation for the shift offered by administration officials to the New York Times was that the administration now felt that it " had leverage " on Iran .
But that now appears to have been a cover for a retreat from the more aggressive strategy previously planned .
Throughout March and April , the Bush administration avoided aggressive language and the State Department openly sought diplomatic engagement with Iran , culminating in the agreement confirmed by U.S. officials last weekend that bilateral talks will begin with Iran on Iraq .
Despite Vice President Dick Cheney 's invocation of the military option from the deck of the USS John C. Stennis in the Persian Gulf last week , the strategy of escalating a threat of war to influence Iran has been put on the shelf , at least for now .

As Truls Becken remarked in a comment on a previous post , “ when it comes to encapsulation , the very foundation is that all state must be accessible only from inside the object ’s methods . ”
On the one hand , it was loads of fun for us to be able to add methods to our “ obi ” on the fly at run-time .
But on the other hand … those methods would have no clue about the state of the object .
It seemed like a fatal blow to my approach .
Maybe closures were n’t the key to home - grown object orientation in Lisp after all … .
I puzzled over this for a while and tried to think about how I could solve this .
I ’ll never know if I could have figured it out on my own or not because I happened to pick up Peter Norvig ’s Paradigms of Artifical Intelligence Programming last night .
Chapter thirteen is all about objects and it just so happens that closures are the key to making things happen .
Unlike Paul Graham , who began his OOP example from ANSI Common Lisp with inheritance ( and multiple inheritance ! ) , Norvig emphasizes encapsulation ( via closures ) as the cornerstone to his OOP design .
If you ever wondered about the phrase “ Lambda the Ultimate , ” well … this is one example that illustrates why lambda really is the ultimate … uh … thing .
Here is a proof of concept of from the REPL prompt demonstrating that we ’ve solved Truls ’ problem :
CL - USER > ( setf example ( create - obi ) )
#<COMPILED-CLOSURE CREATE-OBI-1 >
CL - USER > ( setf setter ( funcall example ‘ set - size ‘( ) ‘( ) ) )
#<COMPILED-CLOSURE CREATE-OBI -1-1 >
CL - USER > ( funcall setter ‘ huge )
HUGE
CL - USER > ( setf shower ( funcall example ‘ show - size ‘( ) ‘( ) ) )
#<COMPILED-CLOSURE CREATE-OBI -1-2 >
CL - USER > ( funcall shower )
The size is HUGE
NIL
CL - USER > ( funcall setter ‘ extra- large )
EXTRA -LARGE
CL - USER > ( funcall shower )
The size is EXTRA - LARGE
As you can see , the variables referenced in the set - size and show - size methods are the same … and they are protected from general access by the closure .
And here is my current code file .
You ’ll see there that I ’ve been experimenting with reflection and a recursive approach to evaluating long chains of object references .
Nothing earth - shattering , though .
Yeah , I know …
I still need to add class definitions and inheritance into it .
And I know that I ’ve got at least three conflicting strands of thought emerging there right now and that a lot will have to change in the coming iterations .
If you really want to see how to do things right , go read Graham and Norvig .
But what I really wanted to say about all of this is that I ’ve been puzzling over some of Paul Graham ’s remarks for some time .
How is it that closures can be so powerful ?
When I wrote my last post on closures and OOP … it had just come to me in a flash of insight that you could do stuff with closures .
( It was n’t really written to change the world or tell people how they should do things … and I was shocked that it was even read at all , much less taken seriously by anybody . )
And macros .
Yeah …
I could see that you can define looping constructs and so forth … and that such things could n’t be done with a mere function .
But my question always was , when will I ever want to do this ?
I hear lots and lots of people on the web droning on about their lisp - illumination , but I do n’t see so much practical advice on how to get illuminated and what you can do with your new powers once you have them .
I know what the Blub paradox is … but … how do you get out of it ?
Well for me it began when I realized that I could implement my own vision of OOP in Lisp if I wanted to .
( That ’s something that ’s impossible in my professional toolset , now .
And as a result , I think of that as a sort of thing that only ‘ real ’ programmers with hairy chests can ever even think about futzing with . )
And as I first started experimenting , I saw that there was going to end up being a lot of repetitive code to get classes to work right .
And then it sunk in … that I could write some code to write that code for me .
And it would of course be macros that I would use to do that .
And I could make things as elaborate as I wanted and all the work would be done at compile time … my constructs would hardly impact performance at run time .
And that leads inexorably to a third Ah - ha moment .
With lambda , closures , and macros … I can build not just my own implementation of OOP … but I can build anything .
I finally see what Alan Kay meant when he said , “ Lisp is n’t a language , it ’s a building material . ”
Lisp is amazing not because of what the Paul Grahams of the world do with it , but because it allows average programmers to solve problems that they thought were only solvable by geniuses .
So anyway … if you want to get illuminated … what do you do ?
Stay away from the web a bit .
A lot of it will just confuse you unnecessarily .
Stick with the very best books on Lisp … and tackle the hardest problems you can think of .
You know , the one ’s you ’ve always felt were above your abilities .
It will be like starting to learn programming all over again .
But the sinking feeling in your stomach that you get at that realization will be offset by the fact that programming will again be as fun as it was when you were first learning .
If you are bored with your current set of tools , languages , and projects … that ’s a sign that it ’s time for you to start learning Lisp .

The Justice Department yesterday withdrew one of its proposals to tighten restrictions on lawyers representing detainees at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , but said it would continue to press a federal appeals court for a series of other limits on the lawyers .
In a filing Friday morning , Justice Department lawyers said they were no longer asking the appeals court in Washington to limit the lawyers to a total of three visits with detainees at the Guantánamo naval base , where about 380 men are now held .
A series of Justice Department proposals to curtail detainees ’ lawyers drew wide attention and was criticized by legal groups and in Congress , with opponents saying the administration was denying detainees the most rudimentary tools to challenge their confinement .
“ After further consideration of this issue by the Department of Defense , ” the terse filing said , the government “ is no longer seeking to incorporate a three - visit threshold for the number of counsel visits . ”

A porn actress who claimed she performed oral sex on a state trooper who stopped her for speeding lost her chance to avoid the ticket he issued because she failed to appear in court Friday .
Justis Richert , 21 , of Knoxville , must pay the $ 159 ticket within two weeks , but she could have avoided it altogether because the trooper has resigned and was n't in court , officials said .
Traffic charges were dropped against the 16 motorists who did appear in court for tickets issued by Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper James Randy Moss .
" Had she been here , the ticket would have been dismissed , " said Linda Neal , general sessions court clerk .
Under her porn film name " Barbie Cummings , " Richert wrote on her blog that Moss took photos and video of their encounter in May and sent copies to her .
She said she acknowledged having drugs she described as " happy pills , " but claimed the trooper threw them into brush near the highway .
She also wrote that she told the trooper she made " dirty movies " and that they then watched sex videos in his patrol car .
Richert did not immediately return a call Friday .
Moss , 40 , resigned , and prosecutors have said they would seek an indictment charging him with official misconduct and tampering with evidence .
" He 's voluntarily resigned , " Moss attorney Jack Lowery Sr. said Friday .
" It appears to me a situation that should be concluded , but we 'll have to see where it goes . "
Investigators also are looking into more than 25 other traffic stops by Moss ; they said women came forward with their own complaints after hearing publicity on the actress ' stop .
Prosecutors have said some of the women complained that Moss asked to see their breasts when he stopped them .
Richert has continued with her blog , writing this month that she has married , is moving to Los Angeles and plans to continue working in the porn industry there .
She also said she plans to sell the pink Honda she was driving when Moss stopped her .

The villagers , in Guangxi province , reportedly attacked government offices after officials imposed heavy fines on families who had too many children .
The rioting allegedly took place on Friday and Saturday .
Beijing allows urban dwellers to have one child , while villagers can have two if the first child is a girl .
The policy - which was launched in the 1970s - is aimed at controlling population growth in the world 's biggest nation with some 1.3 billion people .
' Property confiscated '
Angry villagers targeted several local government offices in Shapi township in Guangxi , setting fires and destroying public property , local residents were quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
At least one person was injured in clashes after riot police were called in , Hong Kong 's Ming Pao Daily News newspaper said .
" The farmers were really angry because the family planning team was going around to homes and making farmers pay fines if they had too many kids , " one local resident told AFP .
" If the farmers had no money they took things from them , " the resident said .
It was not immediately clear when the fines had been imposed and how many families were affected .
Local and provincial officials have not yet commented on the unrest .
It is the latest in a series of civil disturbances in China which have come to the attention of the international media .
In March , there were riots in the central province of Hunan , provoked by a sharp increase in bus fares .
The two - bedroom house is insulated to lose 60 % less heat than a normal home .
It also features solar panels , a biomass boiler and water efficiency devices such as rainwater harvesting .
The design , unveiled at the Offsite 2007 exhibition in Watford , meets rules to be applied in 2016 that aim to make UK homes more energy - efficient .
The Kingspan Off - Site 's Lighthouse design is the first to achieve level six of the Code for Sustainable Homes - which means the house is carbon neutral .
About a quarter of UK carbon emissions come from homes .
Green pledge
Chancellor Gordon Brown announced in his Budget in March that zero - carbon houses would be exempt from stamp duty .
BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan - Jones said the Kingspan home is the first to reach level six requirements in the UK .
" The home generates all its own energy - and when you 're away on holiday can send electricity back to the National Grid .
The company says its annual energy bill would be £ 31 , as compared to £ 500 for the standard new home of this size , " he said .
Among the features in the house are a biomass boiler , which runs on organic fuels such as wood pellets .
It counts as zero-emission because the carbon dioxide it gives off during the burning process is offset by the amount absorbed when the fuel crop was grown .
It also has a waste separation system that allows combustible waste to be burned to help provide power .
Cost concerns
There will be smart metering so that inhabitants will be able to tell if they are wasting any energy .
While the bills may be cheap , Kingspan , an Ireland - based materials specialist , admits the building cost is 40 % more than the standard home .
But house designer Alan Shingler , of architects Sheppard Robson , was confident that costs would fall when more of the homes were built .
" It gets cheaper when you build , say , 250 of them , " he said .
" For a whole development you can introduce other ways of generating electricity - which is where most of the extra cost comes . "
American preparations for invading Iran are complete , Dan Plesch reveals .
Plus Rageh Omaar 's insights from Iran and Andrew Stephen on fears George Bush 's administration will blunder into war
American military operations for a major conventional war with Iran could be implemented any day .
They extend far beyond targeting suspect WMD facilities and will enable President Bush to destroy Iran 's military , political and economic infrastructure overnight using conventional weapons .
British military sources told the New Statesman , on condition of anonymity , that " the US military switched its whole focus to Iran " as soon as Saddam Hussein was kicked out of Baghdad .
It continued this strategy , even though it had American infantry bogged down in fighting the insurgency in Iraq .
The US army , navy , air force and marines have all prepared battle plans and spent four years building bases and training for " Operation Iranian Freedom " .
Admiral Fallon , the new head of US Central Command , has inherited computerised plans under the name TIRANNT ( Theatre Iran Near Term ) .
The Bush administration has made much of sending a second aircraft carrier to the Gulf .
But it is a tiny part of the preparations .
Post 9/11 , the US navy can put six carriers into battle at a month 's notice .
Two carriers in the region , the USS John C Stennis and the USS Dwight D Eisenhower , could quickly be joined by three more now at sea : USS Ronald Reagan , USS Harry S Truman and USS Theodore Roosevelt , as well as by USS Nimitz .
Each carrier force includes hundreds of cruise missiles .
Then there are the marines , who are not tied down fighting in Iraq .
Several marine forces are assembling , each with its own aircraft carrier .
These carrier forces can each conduct a version of the D - Day landings .
They come with landing craft , tanks , jump - jets , thousands of troops and , yes , hundreds more cruise missiles .
Their task is to destroy Iranian forces able to attack oil tankers and to secure oilfields and installations .
They have trained for this mission since the Iranian revolution of 1979 .
Today , marines have the USS Boxer and USS Bataan carrier forces in the Gulf and probably also the USS Kearsarge and USS Bonhomme Richard .
Three others , the USS Peleliu , USS Wasp and USS Iwo Jima , are ready to join them .
Earlier this year , HQ staff to manage these forces were moved from Virginia to Bahrain .
Vice - President Dick Cheney has had something of a love affair with the US marines , and this may reach its culmination in the fishing villages along Iran 's Gulf coast .
Marine generals hold the top jobs at Nato , in the Pentagon and are in charge of all nuclear weapons .
No marine has held any of these posts before .
Traditionally , the top nuclear job went either to a commander of the navy 's Trident submarines or of the air force 's bombers and missiles .
Today , all these forces follow the orders of a marine , General James Cartwright , and are integrated into a " Global Strike " plan which places strategic forces on permanent 12 - hour readiness .
The only public discussion of this plan has been by the American analysts Bill Arkin and Hans Kristensen , who have focused on the possible use of atomic weapons .
These concerns are justified , but ignore how forces can be used in conventional war .
Any US general planning to attack Iran can now assume that at least 10,000 targets can be hit in a single raid , with warplanes flying from the US or Diego Garcia .
In the past year , unlimited funding for military technology has taken " smart bombs " to a new level .
New " bunker - busting " conventional bombs weigh only 250 lb .
According to Boeing , the GBU - 39 small - diameter bomb " quadruples " the firepower of US warplanes , compared to those in use even as recently as 2003 .
A single stealth or B - 52 bomber can now attack between 150 and 300 individual points to within a metre of accuracy using the global positioning system .
With little military effort , the US air force can hit the last - known position of Iranian military units , political leaders and supposed sites of weapons of mass destruction .
One can be sure that , if war comes , George Bush will not want to stand accused of using too little force and allowing Iran to fight back .
" Global Strike " means that , without any obvious signal , what was done to Serbia and Lebanon can be done overnight to the whole of Iran .
We , and probably the Iranians , would not know about it until after the bombs fell .
Forces that hide will suffer the fate of Saddam 's armies , once their positions are known .
The whole of Iran is now less than an hour 's flying time from some American base or carrier .
Sources in the region as well as trade journals confirm that the US has built three bases in Azerbaijan that could be transit points for troops and with facilities equal to its best in Europe .
Most of the Iranian army is positioned along the border with Iraq , facing US army missiles that can reach 150 km over the border .
But it is in the flat , sandy oilfields east and south of Basra where the temptation will be to launch a tank attack and hope that a disaffected population will be grateful .
The regime in Tehran has already complained of US - and UK - inspired terror attacks in several Iranian regions where the population opposes the ayatollahs ' fanatical policies .
Such reports corroborate the American journalist Seymour Hersh 's claim that the US military is already engaged in a low - level war with Iran .
The fighting is most intense in the Kurdish north where Iran has been firing artillery into Iraq .
The US and Iran are already engaged in a low - level proxy war across the Iran - Iraq border .
And , once again , the neo-cons at the American Enterprise Institute have a plan for a peaceful settlement : this time it is for a federal Iran .
Officially , Michael Ledeen , the AEI plan 's sponsor , has been ostracised by the White House .
However , two years ago , the Congress of Iranian Nationalities for a Federal Iran had its inaugural meeting in London .
We should not underestimate the Bush administration 's ability to convince itself that an " Iran of the regions " will emerge from a post - rubble Iran .

The 2007 Linux Storage and File Systems Workshop

Fifty members of the Linux storage and file system communities met February 12 and 13 in San Jose , California to give status updates , present new ideas and discuss issues during the 2007 Linux Storage and File Systems Workshop .
The workshop was chaired by Ric Wheeler and sponsored by EMC , NetApp , Panasas , Seagate and Oracle .
Day 1 : Joint Session
Ric
Wheeler opened with an explanation of the basic contract that storage systems make with the user : the complete set of data will be stored , bytes are correct and in order , and raw capacity is utilized as completely as possible .
It is so simple that it seems that there should be no open issues , right ?
Today , this contract is met most of the time but Ric posed a number of questions .
How do we validate that no files have been lost ?
How do we verify that the bytes are correctly stored ?
How can we utilize disks efficiently for small files ?
How do errors get communicated between the layers ?
Through the course of the next two days some of these questions were discussed , others were raised and a few ideas proposed .
Continue reading for the details .
Ext4 Status Update
Mingming Cao gave a status update on ext4 , the recent fork of the ext3 file system .
The primary goal of the fork was the move to 48 - bit block numbers ; this change allows the file system to support up to 1024 petabytes of storage .
This feature was originally designed to be merged into ext3 , but was seen as too disruptive .
The patch is also built on top of the new extents system .
Support for greater than 32 K directory entries will also be merged into ext4 .
On top of these changes a number of ext3 options will be enabled by default including : directory indexing which improves file access for large directories , " resize inodes " which reserve space in the block group descriptor for online growing , and 256 - byte inodes .
Ext3 users can use these features today with a command like :
mkfs.ext3 - I 256 - O resize_inode dir_index / dev/device
A number of other features are also being considered for inclusion into ext4 and have been posted on the list as RFCs .
This includes a patch that will add nanosecond timestamps and the creation of persistent file allocations , which will be similar to posix_fallocate ( ) but wo n't waste time writing zeros to the disk .
Ext4 currently stores a limited number of extended attributes in - inode and has space for one additional block of extended attribute data , but this may not be enough to satisfy xattr - hungry applications .
For example , Samba needs additional space to support Vista 's heavy use of ACLs , and eCryptFS can store arbitrarily large keys in extended attributes .
This led everyone to the conclusion that data needs to be collected on how extended attributes are being used to help developers decide how to best implement them .
Until larger extended attributes are supported , application developers need to pay attention to the limits that exist on current file systems e.g. one block on ext3 and 64 K on XFS .
Online shrinking and growing was briefly discussed and it was suggested that online defragmentation , which is a planned feature , will be the first step toward online shrinking .
A bigger issue however is storage management and Ted Ts'o suggested that the Linux file system community can learn from ZFS on how to create easy to manage systems .
Christoph Hellwig sees the disk management issue as being a user space problem that can be solved with kernel hooks and sees ZFS as a layering violation .
Either way it is clear that disk management should be improved .
The fsck Problem
Zach Brown and Valerie Henson were slated to speak on the topic of file system repair .
While Val booted her laptop , she introduced us to the latest fashion : laptop rhinestones , a great discussion piece if you are waiting on a fsck .
If Val 's estimates for fsck time in 2013 come true , having a way to pass the time will become very important .
Val presented an estimate of 2013 fsck times .
She first measured a fsck of her 37GB / home partition ( with 21 GB in use ) which took 7.5 minutes and read 1.3 GB of file system data .
Next , she used projections of disk technology from Seagate to estimate the time to fsck a circa - 2013 home partition , which will be 16 times larger .
Although 2013 disks will have a five - fold bandwidth increase , seek times will only improve about 1.2 times ( to 10 ms ) leading to an increase in fsck time from about 8 minutes to 80 minutes !
The primary reason for long fscks is seek latency , since fsck spends most of its time seeking over the disk discovering and fetching dynamic file system data like directory entries , indirect blocks and extents .
Reducing seeks and avoiding the seek latency punishment is key to reducing fsck times .
Val suggested one solution would be keeping a bitmap on disk that tracks the blocks that contain file system metadata ; this would allow for reading all data in a single arm sweep .
This optimization , in the best case , would make a single sequential sweep over the disk and , on the future disk , reading all file system metadata would only take around 134 seconds , a large improvement over 80 minutes .
A full explanation of the findings and possible solutions can be found in the paper Repair - Driven File System Design [ PDF ] .
Also , Val announced that she is working full time on a file system called chunkfs [ PDF ] that will make speed and ease of repair a primary design goal .
Zach Brown presented some blktrace output from e2fsck .
The outcome of the trace is that , while the disk can stream data at 26 Mb/s , fsck is achieving only 12 Mb/s .
This situation could be improved to some degree without on - disk layout changes if the developers had a vectorized I /O call .
Zach explained that in many cases you know the block locations that you need , but with the current API you can only read one at a time .
A vectorized read would take a number of buffers and a list of blocks to read as arguments .
Then the application could submit all of the reads at once .
Such a system call could save a significant amount of time since the I/O scheduler can reorder requests to minimize seeks and merge requests that are nearby .
Also , reads to blocks that are located on different disks could be parallelized .
Although a vectorized read could speed up the fsck eventually file system layout changes will be needed to make fsck faster .
libata : bringing the ATA community together
Jeff Garzik gave an update on the progress of libata , the in - kernel library to support ATA hosts and devices .
He first presented the ATAPI / SATA features that libata now supports including : PATA+C/H/S , NCQ , FUA , SCSI SAT , and CompactFlash .
The growing support for parallel ATA ( PATA ) drives in libata will eventually deprecate the IDE driver ; Fedora developers are helping to accelerate testing and adoption of the libata PATA code by disabling the IDE driver in Fedora 7 test 1 .
Native Command Queuing ( NCQ ) is a new command protocol introduced in the SATA II extensions and is now supported under libata .
With NCQ the host can have multiple outstanding requests on the drive at once .
The drive can reorder and reschedule these requests to improve disk performance .
A useful feature of NCQ drives is the force unit access ( FUA ) bit which will ensure the data , in write commands with this bit set , will be written to disk before returning success .
This has the potential of enabling the kernel to have both synchronous and non-synchronous commands in flight .
There was a recent discussion about both NCQ FUA and SATA FUA in libata on the linux - ide mailing list .
Jeff briefly discussed libata 's support for SCSI ATA translation ( SAT ) which lets an ATA device appear to be a SCSI device to the system .
The motivation for this translation is the reuse of error handling and support for distribution installers which already know how to handle SCSI devices .
There are also a number of items slated as future work for libata .
Many drivers need better suspend / resume support and the driver API is due for a sane initialization model using a allocate / register / unallocate / free system and " Greg blessed " kobjects .
Currently libata is written under the SCSI layer and debate continues on how to restructure libata to minimize or eliminate its SCSI dependence .
Error handling has been substantially improved by Tejun Heo and his changes are now in mainline .
If you have had issues with SATA or libata error handling , try an updated kernel to see if those issues have been resolved .
Tejun and others continue to add features and tune the libata stack .
Communication Breakdown : I/O and File Systems
During the morning a number of conversations sprung up about communication between I/O and file systems .
A hot topic was getting information from the block layer about non-retryable errors that affect an entire range of bytes and passing that data up to user space .
There are situations when retries are happening on a large range of bytes even when the I/O layer knows that an entire range of blocks are missing or bad .
A " pipe " abstraction was discussed to communicate data on byte ranges that are currently in error , under performance strain ( because of a RAID5 disk failure ) , or temporarily unplugged .
If a file system were aware of ranges that are currently handling a recoverable error , have unrecoverable errors or are temporarily slow , it may be able to handle the situation more gracefully .
File systems currently do not receive unplug events and handling unplug situations can be tricky .
For example , if a fibre channel disk is pulled for a moment and plugged back in it may be down for only 30 seconds but how should the file system handle the situation ?
Ext3 currently remounts the entire file system as read only .
XFS has a configurable timeout for fibre channel disks that must be reached before it sends an EIO error .
And what should be done with USB drives that are unplugged ?
Should the file system save state and hope the device gets plugged back in ?
How long should it wait and should it still work if it is plugged into a different hub ?
All of these questions were raised but there are no clear answers .
The Filesystems Track
The workshop split into different tracks ; your author decided to follow the one dedicated to filesystems .

Michael Halcrow , eCryptFS developer , presented an idea to use SELinux to make file encryption / decryption dependent on application execution .
For example , a policy could be defined so that the data would be unencrypted when OpenOffice is using the file but encrypted when the user copies the file to a USB key .
After presenting the mechanism and mark - up language for this idea Michael opened the floor to the audience .
The general feeling was that SELinux is often disabled by users and that per-mount - point encryption may be a more useful and easy to understand user interface .
Why Linux Sucks for Stacking
Josef Sipek , Unionfs maintainer , went over some of the issues involved with stacking file systems under Linux .
A stacking file system , like Unionfs , provides an alternative view of a lower file system .
For example , Unionfs takes a number of mounted directories , which could be NFS / ext3/etc , as arguments at mount time and merges their name space .
The big unsolved issue with stacking file systems is handling modifications to the lower file systems in the stack .
Several people suggested that leaving the lower file system available to the user is just broken and that by default the lower layers should only be mounted internally .
The new fs / stack .c file was discussed too .
This file currently contains a simple inode copy routines that is used by Unionfs and eCryptfs , but in the future more stackable file system routines should be pushed to this file .
Future work for Unionfs includes getting it working under lockdep and additional experimentation with an on - disk format .
The on - disk format for Unionfs is currently under development ; it will store white - out files ( representing files which have been deleted by a user but which still exist on the lower - level filesystems ) and persistent Unionfs inode data .
B - trees for a Shadowed FS
Many file systems use B - trees to represent files and directories .
These structures keep data sorted , are balanced , and allow for insertion and deletion in logarithmic time .
However , there are difficulties in using them with shadowing .
Ohad Rodeh presented his approach to using b- trees and shadowing in an object storage device , but the methods are general and useful for any application .
Shadowing may also be called copy - on - write ( COW ) ; the basic idea is that when a write is made the block is read into memory , modified , and written to a new location on disk .
Then the tree is recursively updated starting at the child and using COW until the root node is atomically updated .
In this way the data is never in an inconsistent state ; if the system crashes before the root node is updated then the write is lost but the previous contents remain intact .
Replicating the details of his presentation would be a wasted effort as his paper , B - trees , Shadowing and Clones [ PDF ] , is well written and easy to read .
Enjoy !
eXplode the code
Storage systems have a simple and important contract to keep : given user data they must save that data to disk without loss or corruption even in the face of system crashes .
Can Sar gave an overview of eXplode [ PDF ] , a systematic approach to finding bugs in storage systems .
eXplode systematically explores all possible choices that can be made at each choice point in the code to make low - probability events , or corner cases , just as probable as the main running path .
And it does this exploration on a real running system with minimal modifications .
This system has the advantage of being conceptually simple and very effective .
Bugs were found in every major Linux file system , including a fsync bug that can cause data corruption on ext2 .
This bug can be produced by doing the following : create a new file , B , which recycles an indirect block from a recently truncated file , A , then call fsync on file B and crash the system before file A's truncate gets to disk .
There is now inconsistent data on disk and when e2fsck tries to fix the inconsistency it corrupts file B's data .
A discussion of the bug has been started on the linux - fsdevel mailing list .
NFS
The second day of the file systems track started with a discussion of an NFS race .
The race appears when a client opens up a file between two writes that occur during the same second .
The client that just opened the file will be unaware of the second write and will keep an out - of - date version of the file in cache .
To fix the problem , a " change " attribute was suggested .
This number would be consistent across reboots , unit-less and would increment on every write .
In general everyone agreed that a change attribute is the right solution , however Val Henson pointed out that implementing this on legacy file systems will be expensive and will require on disk format changes .
Discussion then turned to NSF v4 access control lists ( ACLs ) .
Trond Myklebust said they are becoming a standard and Linux should support them .
Andreas Gruenbacher is working on patches to add NFS v4 support to Linux but currently only ext3 is supported ; more information can be found on the Native NFSv4 ACLs on Linux page .
A possibly difficult issue will be mapping current POSIX ACLs to NFSv4 ACLs , but a draft document , Mapping Between NFSv4 and Posix Draft ACLs , lays out a mapping scheme .
GFS Updates
Steven Whitehouse gave an overview of the recent changes in the Global File System 2 ( GFS2 ) , a cluster file system where a number of peers share access to the storage device .
The important changes include a new journal layout that can support mmap ( ) , splice ( ) and other system calls on journaled files , page cache level locking , readpages ( ) and partial writepages ( ) support , and ext3 standard ioctls lsattr and chattr .
readdir ( ) was discussed at some length , particularly the ways in which it is broken .
A directory insert on GFS2 may cause a reorder of the extensible hash structure GFS2 uses for directories .
In order to support readdir ( ) every hash chain must be sorted .
The audience generally agreed that readdir ( ) is difficult to implement and Ted Ts'o suggested that someone should try to go through committee to get telldir / seekdir / readdir fixed or eliminated .
OCFS2
A brief OCFS2 status report was given by Mark Fasheh .
Like GFS2 , OCFS2 is a cluster file system , designed to share a file system across nodes in a cluster .
The current development focus is on adding features , as the basic file system features are working well .
After the status update the audience asked a few questions .
The most requested OCFS2 feature is forced unmount and several people suggested that this should be a future virtual file system ( vfs ) feature .
Mark also said that users really enjoy the easy setup of OCFS2 and the ability to use it as a local file system .
A performance hot button for OCFS2 are the large inodes and occupy an entire block .
In the future Mark would like to mix extent and extended attribute data in - inode to utilize all of the available space .
However , as the audience pointed out , this optimization can lead to some complex code .
In the future Mark would also like to move to GFS 's distribute lock manager .
DualFS : A New Journaling File System for Linux
DualFS is a file system by Juan Piernas that separates data and meta data into separate file systems .
The on - disk format for the data disk is similar to ext2 without meta - data blocks .
The meta data file system is a log file system , a design that allows for very fast writes since they are always made at the head of the log which reduces expensive seeks .
A few performance numbers were presented ; under a number of micro- and macro- benchmarks DualFS performs better than other Linux journaling file systems .
In its current form , DualFS uses separate partitions for data and metadata , forcing the user to answer a difficult question : how much metadata do I expect to have ?
More information , including performance comparisons , can be found on the DualFS LKML announcement and the project homepage .
The currently available code is a patch on top of 2.4.19 and can be found on SourceForge .
pNFS Object Storage Driver
Benny Halevy gave an overview of pNFS ( parallel NFS ) , which is part of the IETF NFSv4.1 draft and tries to solve the single server performance bottleneck of NFS storage systems .
pNFS is a mechanism for an NFS client to talk directly to a disk device without sending requests through the NFS server , fanning the storage system out to the number of SAN devices .
There are many proprietary systems that do a similar thing including EMC's High Road , IBM 's TotalStorage SAN , SGI 's CXFS and Sun's QFS .
Having an open protocol would be a good thing .
However , Jeff Garzik was skeptical of including pNFS in the NFSv4.1 draft particularly because to support pNFS the kernel will need to provide implementations of all three access protocols : file storage , object storage and block storage .
This will add significant complexity to the Linux NFS v4 implementation .
Benny explained that the pNFS implementation in Linux is modular to support multiple layout - type specific drivers which are optional .
Each layout driver dynamically registers itself using its layout type and the NFS client calls it across a well - defined API .
Support for specific layout types is optional .
In the absence of a layout driver for some specific layout type the NFS client falls back to doing I /O through the server .
After this overview Benny turned to the topic of OSDs , or object based storage devices .
These devices provide a more abstract view of the disk than the classic " array of blocks " abstraction seen in todays disks .
Instead of blocks , objects are the basic unit of an OSD , and each object contains both meta -data and data .
The disk manages the allocation of the bytes on disk and presents the object data as a contiguous array to the system .
Having this abstraction in hardware would make file system implementation much simpler .
To support OSDs in Linux Benny and others are working to get bi-directional SCSI command support into the Kernel and support for variable length command descriptor blocks ( CDBs ) .
Hybrid Disks
Hybrid disks with an NVCache ( flash memory ) will be in consumers ' hands soon .
Timothy Bisson gave an overview of this new technology .
The NVCache will have 128-256Mb of non-volatile flash memory that the disk can manage as a cache ( unpinned ) or the operating system can manage by pinning specified blocks to the non-volatile memory .
This technology can reduce power consumption or increase disk performance .
To reduce power consumption the block layer can enable the NVCache Power Mode , which tells the disk to redirect writes to the NVCache , reducing disk spin - up operations .
In this mode the 10 minute writeback threshold of Linux laptop mode can be removed .
Another strategy is to pin all file system metadata in the NVCache , but spin-ups will still occur on non-metadata reads .
An open question is how this pinning should be managed when two or more file systems are using the same disk .
Performance can be increased by using the NVCache as a cache for writes requiring a long seek .
In this mode the block layer would pin the target blocks ensuring a write to the cache instead of incurring the expensive seek .
Also , a file system can use the NVCache to store its journal and boot files for additional performance and reduced system start - up time .
If Linux developers decide to manage the NVCache there are many open questions .
Which layer should manage the NVCache ?
The file system or block layer ?
And what type of API should be created to leverage the cache ?
Another big question is how much punishment can these caches take ?
According to Timothy it takes about a year ( using a desktop workload ) to a fry the cache if you are using it as a write cache .
Scaling Linux to Petabytes
Sage Weil presented Ceph , a network file system that is designed to scale to petabytes of storage .
Ceph is based on a network of object based storage devices and complete copies of each object is distributed across multiple nodes using an algorithm called CRUSH .
This distribution makes it possible for nodes to be added and removed from the system dynamically .
More information on the design and implementation can be found on the Ceph homepage
Conclusion
The workshop concluded with the general consensus that bringing together SATA , SCSI and file system people was a good idea and that the status updates and conversations were useful .
However , the workshop was a bit too large for code discussion and more targeted workshops will need to be held to workout the details of some of the issues discussed at LSF '07 .
Topics for future workshops include virtual memory and file system issues and extensions that are needed to the VFS .

Is Stephen Fry really on Facebook ?
As Facebook continues its explosive growth here 's one question troubling me .
Are my friends for real ?
This week I received this intriguing message from a man who moves in London 's new media circles .
He wrote : " I met somebody the other day who told me that online networking was so important , and he did n't have the time , he was paying somebody to be him online .
To blog , network , post etc .
£ 1,000 a month too .
" Apparently it 's a new occupation which he reckons already numbers hundreds of people , paid to be other people ! "
I rang the sender of the message - a real - world friend as well as a Facebook contact - and he gave me more details .
" This guy is a busy entrepreneur and he says that wherever he goes , people marvel at the energy he still manages to put into blogging and networking - and he then tells them it is all being done by a guy he pays to do it . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Networking sites are a great way to get back in touch with friends
Britny Alfonzetti , Elgin
Send us your comments
But are there really crowds of busy executives hiring others to do the online dirty work for them ?
One of the things I like about Facebook is that its users appear to be there under their own identities - rather than the " lonelygirl15 " of YouTube , or " crazyguy1603 " on MySpace .
I started worrying about some of my Facebook " friends " .
Were they who they said they were ?
Busy man
Brent Hoberman , the founder of lastminute.com , has a genuine page
Surely a busy man like him , in the middle of starting up a new online venture , does not have time to update his status on Facebook , ask his friends about their favourite books and films and take part in discussions about TV property programmes ?
When I contacted him he assured me ( via a blackberry message , mind you ) that this was the real Hoberman .
" I think if I could get someone else to manage my e-mail then I could outsource social networking , " he said .
" But I can't , and think one has slightly lost the plot if that happens . "
Good , so he 's the real him .
But what about my dear friend Sir Patrick Moore ?
I joined up with him a couple of weeks ago and was not entirely convinced he was the great astronomer .
His profile said he was here for " random play " and " whatever I can get " and his home town was Pinner .
Seeking reassurance
I happened to know that Sir Patrick lives in Selsey , in Sussex , so I wrote seeking reassurance .
Patrick Moore has a Facebook page - or does he ?
" It is definitely me , " he replied some days later , " extraordinary as it may seem !
I was told about Facebook by some young camera crew I was working with , you see , and I was intrigued how people are able to communicate these days .
" You 're quite right I do live in Selsey , Pinner is the town in which I was born . "
Hmm , still not entirely convinced .
And then there is Stephen Fry .
As an admirer of the great comic writer and actor ( and gadget obsessive ) I was delighted to spot him on another friend 's network .
And even more pleased when my friendship request was accepted .
But his friends list appeared to be growing at an alarming rate , he was busy asking questions , playing rock , paper , scissors , and describing his favourite artists using the " ilike " application .
Surely this was the work of a gifted assistant ?
Then came his latest status update : " Stephen is ... concerned about the number of friendship requests he 's getting .
Do n't want to turn anyone down , but 20 + every hour and rising is getting to be a worry . "
Confirmation , then , that this was the real Stephen Fry , facing one of the dilemmas of modern manners - how to politely decline an offer of online friendship .
The actor has now set up a friendship group as a point of contact for all those strangers who want to be his friends .
But , like millions of others , he seems to have caught the Facebook bug .
sudoku by regex
About a year ago , I proposed a contest on #noise to write a sudoku solver .
LIM wrote us a driver and generator .
Chouser , Mr_Bones_ , and owend wrote solvers .
I started one in LISP but never finished it , to my shame ...
One question that 's always been in my mind is " How could we use a regex to solve a sudoku ? "
The main problem seems to be the input : Regular expressions are a language for searching , so you need the search space expressed in a way that the regex can process it .
The naive approach expresses all the possible puzzles on the input , which is way too much data .
I usually think of a sudoku like this , where zeros are squares that need to be solved :
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 6 3 0 0 0 0 0
The problem with this representation is that the zeros are n't searchable .
The regular expression can't tell that they mean " any number 1 through 9 " .
So for a first step , my solver replaces them :
$ puz =~ s{\d} { $ & ?
$ &. ' ' : ' 123456789'}ge ;
So the massaged input looks like this :
123456789 123456789 123456789 4 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 2 123456789 7 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 4 1 123456789 123456789 123456789 9 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 6 7 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 7 6 3 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789
Now each cell contains the full list of possibilities for that cell .
This is searchable .
And with negative lookahead assertions , it does n't have to waste nearly as much time backtracking .
The final output , after the second substitution , is :
9 8 7 4 6 5 3 2 1 6 5 4 1 3 2 9 7 8 3 2 1 9 8 7 6 5 4 8 6 5 7 9 3 4 1 2 7 4 9 8 2 1 5 3 6 2 1 3 6 5 4 7 8 9 5 3 8 2 4 9 1 6 7 1 9 2 5 7 6 8 4 3 4 7 6 3 1 8 2 9 5
Neat , eh ?
So finally , here are the two scripts implementing this solution .
The first script is the solver itself .
It accepts a puzzle on stdin formatted like the input above , converts it internally to the searchable format , and generates on stdout the solved puzzle .
The second script generates the regular expression which is inserted into the first script .
By the way , while this is n't the fastest solver out there by any means ( it 's just brute force , after all ) , it solves most puzzles in approximate 0.01 seconds .
That 's 1/10 of the time genre.pl takes to generate the regular expression in the first place .
In the movie “ Knocked Up , ” the character played by Seth Rogen has a get - rich scheme to start a Web site that features Hollywood nude scenes , but his plans are dashed when he learns that another site , MrSkin.com , beat him to the punch .
What ’s bad news for the movie ’s protagonist turns out to be good news for Mr. Skin , an actual site , which saw a 35 percent bump in new visitors in June , when the movie was released .
But “ Knocked Up , ” which had permission to feature the site , was not the first to notice it .
Mr. Skin had revenue of $ 5.3 million last year , primarily though $ 29.95 - a - month subscriptions .
With more than 175,000 revealing pictures and video clips of about 15,000 actresses ( yes , only actresses ) , the site drew 2.9 million unique visitors in June , according to comScore , the Web traffic tracker .
“ We do n’t care about cinematography or great acting or anything like that , ” Jim McBride , who favors the title chief sexecutive officer , said on the phone from his company ’s Chicago offices .
“ We ’re concerned about the nudity — who ’s naked , and what they show . ”
Jyllands - Posten , the Danish newspaper that first published the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad that have caused a storm of protest throughout the Islamic world , refused to run drawings lampooning Jesus Christ , it has emerged today .
The Danish daily turned down the cartoons of Christ three years ago , on the grounds that they could be offensive to readers and were not funny .
In April 2003 , Danish illustrator Christoffer Zieler submitted a series of unsolicited cartoons dealing with the resurrection of Christ to Jyllands - Posten .
Zieler received an email back from the paper 's Sunday editor , Jens Kaiser , which said : " I do n't think Jyllands - Posten 's readers will enjoy the drawings .
As a matter of fact , I think that they will provoke an outcry .
Therefore , I will not use them . "
The illustrator said : " I see the cartoons as an innocent joke , of the type that my Christian grandfather would enjoy . "
" I showed them to a few pastors and they thought they were funny . "
But the Jyllands - Posten editor in question , Mr Kaiser , said that the case was " ridiculous to bring forward now .
It has nothing to do with the Muhammad cartoons .
" In the Muhammad drawings case , we asked the illustrators to do it .
I did not ask for these cartoons .
That 's the difference , " he said .
" The illustrator thought his cartoons were funny .
I did not think so .
It would offend some readers , not much but some . "
The decision smacks of " double- standards " , said Ahmed Akkari , spokesman for the Danish - based European Committee for Prophet Honouring , the umbrella group that represents 27 Muslim organisations that are campaigning for a full apology from Jyllands - Posten .
" How can Jyllands - Posten distinguish the two cases ?
Surely they must understand , " Mr Akkari added .
Meanwhile , the editor of a Malaysian newspaper resigned over the weekend after printing one of the Muhammad cartoons that have unleashed a storm of protest across the Islamic world .
Malaysia 's Sunday Tribune , based in the remote state of Sarawak , on Borneo island , ran one of the Danish cartoons on Saturday .
It is unclear which one of the 12 drawings was reprinted .
Printed on page 12 of the paper , the cartoon illustrated an article about the lack of impact of the controversy in Malaysia , a country with a majority Muslim population .
The newspaper apologised and expressed " profound regret over the unauthorised publication " , in a front page statement on Sunday .
" Our internal inquiry revealed that the editor on duty , who was responsible for the same publication , had done it all alone by himself without authority in compliance with the prescribed procedures as required for such news , " the statement said .
The editor , who has not been named , regretted his mistake , apologised and tendered his resignation , according to the statement .

Imagine this scenario :
Yikes !
You just lost your job !
You 've been so busy at * work * that you do n't feel your network is as strong as you would like it to be !
What are you going to do with ( and to ) your network in the next 6 weeks as you begin an aggressive job search campaign ?
And , outside of your network , what job search tactics will you employ ?
Or your best networking tips related to job searches .
That 's the question put to me by Jason Alba as part of a " blog carnival . "
At some point he 'll link to all the people who 've posted on the topic .
When he does I 'll point it out .
But in the meantime , what about those questions ?
It 's hard for me to imagine being in this exact situation since I 've always spent a good deal of time working on my " personal brand . "
I think part of that stems from my start as a university professor .
Professors are very individualistic .
Not too many teams in academia .
You live and die based on the reputation you build as a researcher .
I always tell my students to never confuse their job with their career .
Fifty years ago , that might have worked , but no longer .
All of us know that we 'll probably have multiple jobs , but most do n't like idea .
I believe in embracing it .
So , what Jason 's scenario tells me is that I have n't been speaking much , I have n't been blogging much , and I have n't been to many trade association breakfasts or lunches .
Jason asked that I write this from my point of view :
What would I do ?
First of all , a few pre-requisites :
You should always have a couple months salary on hand for this kind of situation .
You ought to be able to live while you get your next gig .
Consider severance icing on the cake since you do n't always get it -- even when it 's owned to you .
Trust me .
I was talking to Scott Lemon a few days ago about why he always buys his own laptop : you should own your tools .
If you 've got a computer , you can do all kinds of things to get by and reconnect .
If losing your job means losing your computer , then you 've got to go buy one .
Yikes .
With those out of the way , here 's some thoughts about what I 'd do .
Blog .
First thing I 'd do is pick up the blogging pace .
Start writing about things you know and the areas you want to establish your expertise in .
Do n't have a blog ?
Start one .
Update your resume .
I 'd bring my resume up to date with the latest stuff I 've been doing and make sure it emphasizes the areas I 'm interested in pursuing .
Call some headhunters .
Once my resume was up to date , I 'd call all the local head hunters I know and schedule times to go talk to them .
I 'd schedule phone interviews with any who were out of town .
Most of them are eager to talk and get to know you .
Any you 've paid commissions to owe you at least a meeting .
They know who 's hiring and what 's hot .
I 've gotten lots of good advice from headhunters over the years .
Go to conferences .
Local ones are cheap , but even ones out of town are affordable if you can use frequent flyer miles and get a discounted conference fee .
Refuse to be unemployed .
If you 're a programmer or IT professional , do n't think of yourself as unemployed , think of yourself as an independent contractor and go get some work .
I loved the freedom of consulting the 18 months I did it .
I did n't like constantly scrambling for the next gig .
You might enjoy it enough to just consult forever .
Go to events .
There are probably all kinds of industry association events -- formal and informal -- in your area .
I would go to as many of these as I could and start getting to know people .
Offer to speak , take tickets , whatever .
Be involved .
Write a book .
You 've got some time , make you name by writing about what you know .
You'd be surprised what writing a book will do for you as far as employment goes .
It immediately establishes you as an expert .
Doctors said it was not clear how many such patients would benefit from the treatment , in which two wire electrodes are implanted deep in the brain .
The procedure also raises sticky ethical questions about operating on patients who cannot give their consent , they said .
Image Surgeons implanted electrodes deep into the brain of a gravely injured patient in an effort to stimulate new brain activity .

“ We really see this as a first step , but it should open doors that have not been open before for patients like this , ” said Joseph T. Giacino , associate director of neuropsychology at the JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute and the New Jersey Neuroscience Institute , in Edison .
Dr. Giacino performed the study with doctors from the Weill Cornell Medical College and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation .
Other experts familiar with the case have cautioned that study was based on a single patient , and said that the procedure should be seen as experimental .
The researchers , who first described the case last October at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience , say they plan to look at the procedure in 11 other patients as part of a larger study .
Doctors have long used the implant surgery , known as deep brain stimulation , to treat Parkinson ’s disease .
Over the past two decades they have also performed it on a handful of people with brain injuries , including Terry Schiavo , the Florida woman who died in 2005 after her feeding tube was removed amid a national debate over her care .
But in many of those cases , like Ms. Schiavo ’s , the brain was so profoundly damaged that the operation made no difference .
NY Times : White House to Gradually Withdraw Troops from Iraq
The New York Times is reporting that the Bush administration will present a plan to gradually reduce the U.S. troop presence in Iraq beginning next year .
The Times says the White House will use next month 's assessment about the progress in Iraq to unveil the plan .
But the report says the reductions will fall far short of the drawdown demanded by congressional opponents of the war .
Quoting anonymous administration officials , the newspaper says the administration will argue that the troop increase ordered by President Bush has succeeded in improving the security situation in Iraq , and has established the conditions for a new approach that will lead to troop cuts .
Officials say the president will not decide how many troops to withdraw from Iraq until General David Petraeus , the American military commander in Iraq , completes an assessment and presents a range of options on the size of the force and the risks associated with lower levels .
The Times says central to the debate is the extent to which American forces can hand over more security missions to Iraqi forces - something many congressional Democrats , as well as members of Mr. Bush 's own Republican Party , have been demanding .
I looked around for valgrind integration into Emacs recently but I did n’t see anything out there .
I had a great idea ! — compilation - mode should integrate with shell - mode so I can run valgrind and then next - error will walk through the problems .
Well , it turns out this idea is so great that it has been implemented already .
Yay Emacs !
Unfortunately the feature is rather obscure ; I had to dig around in the source to find it , and it was n’t obvious that it handled valgrind — it does , but the valgrind error regexp is the same as one for the JVM , so it is misleadingly named “ java ” .
To enable this , enable compilation - shell - minor - mode in your shell - mode buffer .
It will automatically start highlighting the appropriate messages , and mouse - 2 will go to the source file .
I ’m pretty happy about this idea of using shell mode in this way .
It has that nice , integrated , “ plastic ” feeling I ’ve come to associate with the joy of Emacs .
I ’ve always liked the idea of a “ notebook - like ” shell , where commands and structured , or even graphical , output are intermixed ; this feels a little like that
What ’s left ?
Two things I think … first , Emacs should automatically enable this minor mode when you type “ make ” , “ valgrind ” , “ ant ” , etc , in a shell mode buffer ; meanwhile I ’m just going to enable this from the mode hook .
Second , I think it would be awesome if running gdb in shell mode somehow auto - started Emacs ’ gdb mode .
I generally find it a pain to start ( but not use ) gdb in Emacs , since typically I have a complicated setup on the command line — a particular directory , command line , sometimes an environment ; Emacs could simplify this .
I wrote a minor mode last night that will recognize when you type “ gdb ” in the shell and will automatically run it in Emacs instead …
I ’ll post it soon , or send email if you want it .
For many scientists , the evidence that moral reasoning is a result of physical traits that evolve along with everything else is just more evidence against the existence of the soul , or of a God to imbue humans with souls .
For many believers , particularly in the United States , the findings show the error , even wickedness , of viewing the world in strictly material terms .
And they provide for theologians a growing impetus to reconcile the existence of the soul with the growing evidence that humans are not , physically or even mentally , in a class by themselves .
The idea that human minds are the product of evolution is “ unassailable fact , ” the journal Nature said this month in an editorial on new findings on the physical basis of moral thought .
A headline on the editorial drove the point home : “ With all deference to the sensibilities of religious people , the idea that man was created in the image of God can surely be put aside . ”
Or as V. S. Ramachandran , a brain scientist at the University of California , San Diego , put it in an interview , there may be soul in the sense of “ the universal spirit of the cosmos , ” but the soul as it is usually spoken of , “ an immaterial spirit that occupies individual brains and that only evolved in humans — all that is complete nonsense . ”
Belief in that kind of soul “ is basically superstition , ” he said .
For people like the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins , talk of the soul is of a piece with the rest of the palaver of religious faith , which he has likened to a disease .
And among evolutionary psychologists , religious faith is nothing but an evolutionary artifact , a predilection that evolved because shared belief increased group solidarity and other traits that contribute to survival and reproduction .
Nevertheless , the idea of a divinely inspired soul will not be put aside .
To cite just one example , when 10 Republican presidential candidates were asked at a debate last month if there was anyone among them who did not believe in evolution , 3 raised their hands .
One of them , Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas , explained later in an op - ed article in this newspaper that he did not reject all evolutionary theory .
But he added , “ Man was not an accident and reflects an image and likeness unique in the created order . ”
An unemployed single mom with health problems has renewed her legal challenge of the Recording Industry Ass. of America ( RIAA ) with unseemly new details .
They include accusations that the cartel 's goons tried to contact the woman 's 10 - year - old daughter at school by impersonating the girl 's grandmother on the phone .
RIAA agents pursuing bogus copyright violations also called the apartment of Tanya Andersen looking for her daughter Kylee and demanded they take the girl 's deposition , according to a complaint filed last week in federal court in Portland , Oregon .
Later , during settlement discussions , the RIAA told Andersen she had to abandon all legal rights she may have in a countersuit or the association would once again demand to " interrogate and confront her little girl at the offices of the RIAA lawyers , " according to the suit .
" Defendants ' lawyer threatened persecution of Kylee in an effort to force Ms. Andersen to abandon her counterclaims against the defendant record companies , " Andersen 's complaint claims .
" Their demand for face - to - face confrontation with Ms. Andersen 's then 10 year - old child in a deposition at the offices of RIAA lawyers were also intended to coerce and threaten her . "
Careful readers will remember Andersen , now 44 years old , countersued the RIAA in late 2005 after being accused of illegally downloading gangster rap tunes such as " Shake that Ass Bitch , " " Bullet in the Head , " " I Stab People " and several with titles that even we cannot publish .
Her counterclaims equated the RIAA to thugs that knowingly employed illegal investigative methods and pursued factually flawed charges .
Suing under state and federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization laws designed to target organized crime rings , Andersen became something of a folk hero for her refusal to submit to the 800 - pound gorilla .
The RIAA quietly dropped its lawsuit against Andersen on June 1 of this year , just hours before a court - imposed deadline for attorneys to submit proof that Andersen had illegally downloaded the copyrighted material .
She responded with last week 's action , which reinstates her counterclaims and introduces several new ones .
In 2004 , about the same time she was targeted by the RIAA , Andersen was forced to leave her position with the Department of Justice for unspecified health reasons .
Her suit seeks attorneys fees , which her attorney Lory Lybeck , says are in excess of $ 50,000 , and additional damages , which he declined to estimate .
" All I can give you is a lady that was suffering from some very severe disabilities that was harmed very , very badly by these people , " he said .
Also named is MediaSentry , a firm the RIAA uses to identify individuals suspected of illegally swapping copyrighted music online .
Andersen 's suit claims MediaSentry 's own executives have admitted their investigative techniques are known to misidentify individuals and also can't determine if files made available for download actually contain copyrighted recordings or are mislabeled , inoperative or decoy works .
" Pursuant to a secret agreement , the RIAA , its controlled member companies and MediaSentry conspired to develop a massive threat and litigation enterprise targeting private citizens across the United States , " the suit alleges .
An RIAA spokeswoman declined to comment on the suit .
A spokeswoman for MediaSentry , which this month agreed to be acquired by SafeNet , declined to comment on allegations its methods are flawed .
" Data collected helps clients determine the scale and scope of their piracy problem and measure the success of enforcement campaigns .
From worldwide peering points , SafeNet identifies online piracy in real - time by monitoring online auction communities , IRC networks , newsgroups , FTP sites , peer - to - peer communities and websites , " she said in an emailed statement .
Among other details Andersen provides as evidence of the RIAA 's witch hunt is its attorneys ' refusal to take her up on an offer to inspect her computer for any evidence of the illegal downloads .
Eventually , the court demanded an inspection be conducted , and RIAA investigators were unable to identify any files or file remnants containing the recordings alleged to have been copyrighted .

US has been covertly arming Gulf States since 2004 , officials say Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Thursday August 2 , 2007
Print This Email This $ 20 b arms sale to Saudi Arabia done deal 
A recently disclosed US agreement with Saudi Arabia for a 10 - year , $ 20 billion dollar arms sale is a done deal ,  according to intelligence officials and experts familiar with the negotiations .
Yesterday , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates made a rare joint visit to Saudi Arabia to meet with members of the monarchy , as well as representatives of other Gulf States including the United Arab Emirates , to discuss a $ 20 billion dollar arms deal to deliver weapons , training , and weapons systems upgrades to Saudi Arabia over the next ten years .
Although officially the meeting is to negotiate an agreement , sources have confirmed to RAW STORY that the deal has already been approved .
 It is a done deal .
Everyone who needed to has already signed off ,  said a former National Security Council official , who wished to remain anonymous given the security aspects of the topic .
The deal also includes massive aid packages to Egypt and Israel , which have not yet been formally announced .
Arming the Gulf states According to current and former intelligence officials , however , the Bush administration has been arming Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) states covertly since at least  2004 , a year after the US - led invasion of Iraq in March of 2003 .
The GCC is a union of regional allies , including Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates .
Created in 1981 , it is similar in structure and purpose to the European Union .
Using backchannels and corporate partners , arms have been furnished to the Gulf states to beef up security against what the US sees as an increased risk posed by Iran .
Along with sharing various resources , GCC members have agreed to jointly combine military forces .
According to the NSC official , the current Saudi deal serves two purposes , both of which are a direct result of the US - led war against Iraq and the regional instability it has caused .
One is to support the Saudi rulers , while the other is to isolate Iran .
The most pressing concern for the Saudi royal family is their ability to maintain power .
The Saudi royal family , who are Sunnis , see the election of Shia Muslim Nouri al - Maliki as Iraqi Prime Minister as a signal that the Shia state of Iran could become more powerful and threaten the sovereignty of the House of Saud .
Beyond that , the royals also fear that their own people might overthrow the monarchy should instability in the region continue to worsen .
 The Saudis see Maliki as the cats paw of Iran and they think we are actively supporting Maliki ,  the NSC official said .
 What the monarchy is actively worried about is that guys who got bloodied in Iraq will return home and overthrow them , and that would be very bad for us . 
Not everyone agrees .
In an email to RAW STORY Wednesday , Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , said he believes the deal is unwise .
 I believe that the $ 20B arms package just announced  and the diplomacy accompanying it  is a complete refutation of the Bush / Rice policy of refusing to coddle the autocracies of the Middle East ,  Wilkerson said .
 Because we are afraid of Tehran , we are willing to fund massively regimes whose interests are not only counter to our own but who are actively engaged in covertly undermining U.S. interests , from supporting anti-U.S. elements in Iraq to building and funding thousands of madrassas in volatile places like the Federally Administered Territories in Pakistan . 
Since 1990 , Saudi Arabia has spent over $ 39.6 billion in arming itself against both the threat of Iran and the growing likelihood of a domestic uprising .
The US has also given $ 300 million more in arms during that period through the State Department , making that nation the single largest client of US defense contractors .
Bribing the House of Saud ?
Several military and intelligence sources say that the other major impetus behind the arms deal is the Bush administrations focus on destabilizing and isolating Iran .
Part of that strategy involves cutting Iran off from dealing with companies that also have business dealing with Saudi Arabia and , at the same time , protecting Saudi Arabia from any fallout over US activities against Iran .
According to the Washington Post , separate arms deals have also been approved for both Israel and Egypt to strengthen pro-Western countries against Iran at a time when the hard - line regime seeks to extend its power in the region . 
Another motivation for the arms deal is the Bush administrations need for support to curb the democratically elected Malikis influence while at the same time demonstrating good faith to the Saudis , who have increasingly become disillusioned with US policy in Iraq and mishandling of the Iraq war .
 There is a real fear that the [ Saudi monarchy ] will move towards France and Britain ,  said the NSC official .
A military official pointed out that with the increase in Asian demand for Saudi Arabias largest export , oil , the Arab nation now has more leeway to break away from its long - standing relationship with the United States .
Wilkerson points out , however , that the deal prioritizes aid to just three countries .
 By this recently - announced policy , we have effectively committed more than 80 % of U.S. strategic aid to three countries 
Israel , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia  all of whom are acting in ways fundamentally counter to our interests ,  he said .
 In my view , we are doing this in a futile and desperate attempt to buy their assistance with respect to Iraq , as well as an attempt to enlist their efforts in countering Iran  the latter of which they would do anyway , even without our aid . 
 This is quintessentially a diplomacy of fear and desperation and not of wisdom and confidence ,  he added .
The events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , when 19 men  15 of them from Saudi Arabia  attacked the United States , do not seem to have had much effect on US interest in arming the Saudis .
When asked about this , one intelligence official said ,  It was 14 or 15 guys , not the government of Saudi Arabia . 
Yet there is evidence that the Saudis have transferred or sold US arms to unauthorized partners .
During the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war , the Saudis allegedly gave Iraq 1,500 US 2,000 - pound bombs ( Los Angeles Times , 14 September 1992 ) .
" Inadvertent " transfers of bombs and vehicles to Syria and Bangladesh during the Gulf War have also been reported ( Arms Control Today , May 1992 ) , as well as another that almost took place when an asylum - seeking Saudi F - 15 pilot flew his aircraft to Sudan in November 1990 .
The plane was returned ( Washington Post , 15 November 1990 ) .
Deal with Northrop Grumman alleged A former high level State Department official pointed to at least one company that is providing weapons to the Saudi National Guard : Northrop Grumman subsidiary Vinnell Corporation .
 The Vinnell Corp has been in that business for decades ,  said this official .
The defense giant Northrop Grumman was in talks with the Saudis in March of this year to sell them their E - 2D Hawkeye 2000 , a form of early air warning system .
Vinnell is also the quasi - official security training firm for the Saudis , through a joint Saudi - US enterprise called Vinnell Arabia .
Yet another offshoot of Northrop is Vinnell - Brown & Root , which is a joint venture between Northrop Grumman and Halliburton , the controversial company of which Vice President Cheney was the CEO until the 2000 election .
Vinnell - Brown & Root is also involved in training the Saudi National Guard .
One source familiar with the backchannel sales of weapons to the GCC states said there is a connection between the leadership of the 3rd Infantry Division of the US Army , from Fort Stewart Georgia , and Vinnell Corporation , but would not elaborate .
In April 2006 , Robert Joseph , undersecretary of state for arms control and international security , visited the GCC states in an attempt to broker a deal to install a missile defense system aimed against Iran .
While the arms list for the current deal is still shrouded in secrecy , if former deals are any indication , the Saudis will receive high caliber weapons that are top - of the line system deployed with U.S. forces ,  including M - 1A2 Abrams main battle tanks , M - 2A2 Bradley armored vehicles , F - 15E Strike Eagle attack aircraft and Patriot surface - to - air missiles .
Saudis worry about Iraq fighters coming back
The greatest number of foreign fighters in Iraq are Saudi Arabs , making up roughly 45 percent of all foreign militants .
Though not allied with any specific terrorist group , some Saudis are loosely affiliated with Al Qaeda ; most , however , are simply fighting the Shia government of Iraq , which they perceive as a threat , as well as the US - led coalition , which they see as an even greater concern .
The result of this influx of foreign fighters and pervasive anti-Western sentiments has been a catastrophic radicalization of Muslims in general and Saudi Arabs in particular .
Such fighters , notes the former NSC official , have been radicalized and trained on the streets of Anbar province , and those who might return home to overthrow the Saudi monarchy will be that much more capable .
The Saudi monarchy only came into existence in 1932 and has owed its survival to the United States at every point since .
By 1933 , US oil interests had already offered $ 170,000 in gold for land concessions .
In 1945 the US and King Abd al - Aziz agreed to a deal in which the US would provides military security to the regime in exchange for cheap oil and exclusive rights provided to US oil companies .
Since 1945 the House of Saud has depended almost entirely on the military support of the US government , which has continued to provide arms and training to the Saudi National Guard , a praetorian - like special force that is responsible for the protection of the royal family from coup attempts , assassination attempts , and uprisings by its own people .

Top 10 Most Stolen Cars
Featured , News
on 08/03/2007
Source : Insurance Bureau of Canada
Filed under :on 08/03/2007
Source : Insurance Bureau of Canada Automobile theft is much more than an insurance problem ; it 's an expensive social menace .
Every year automobile theft costs Canadians close to $ 1 billion , including $ 600 million for insurers to fix or replace stolen cars , $ 250 million in police , health care and court system costs and millions more in correctional services expenses .
160,000 vehicles were stolen in Canada in 2005 .
The following is the Insurance Bureau of Canada 's 2006 list of the top ten most - stolen cars .
Canada ’s car insurers announced today that , for the second year running , the 1999 and 2000 Honda Civics SiR 2 - door hold the dubious distinction of topping this year ’s most frequently stolen vehicles list .
The two models also had the third and fourth highest theft claims cost per vehicle .
The highest theft claim cost per vehicle “ honour ” went to the third most frequently stolen vehicle , the 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX / WRX STi 4 - door all - wheel - drive .
The Top Ten Stolen Vehicles are :
1. 2000 Honda Civic SiR 2 - door
2. 1999 Honda Civic SiR 2 - door
3. 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX / WRX STi 4 - door AWD
4. 1999 Acura Integra 2 - door
5. 1994 Honda Civic Si 2 - door Hatchback
6. 1998 Acura Integra 2 - door
7. 1993 Dodge Shadow Convertible
8. 1996 Honda Civic Si 2 - door Hatchback
9. 2000 Audi TT Quattro 2 - door Coupe
10 . 1996 Chev/ GMC
Blazer / Jimmy S Series 2 - door 4WD ž
Once again , none of the vehicles making the top ten most frequently stolen vehicles list had an Insurance Bureau of Canada - approved immobilizer system .
“ The stats prove time and again that theft deterrent systems work .
This year , we see that auto thieves continue to find it easier to steal older vehicles lacking an IBC - approved immobilizer , ” says Rick Dubin , Vice - President , Investigations , IBC .
“ We ’ve seen this trend developing for several years , and these results confirm it , ” adds Dubin .
Electronic immobilizers are systems that prevent a vehicle from starting unless the engine computer recognizes the specific electronic code embedded in the key .
IBC , along with vehicle manufacturers , after - market manufacturers , and other interested stakeholders , developed a Canadian standard for automobile theft - deterrent systems that was approved by the Standards Council of Canada in 1998 .
Many insurance companies provide premium discounts on automobile policies to customers whose vehicles are equipped with an IBC - approved , factory - installed or aftermarket immobilizer system .
“ Immobilizers are highly effective at deterring car thieves .
In terms of this year ’s stats , you have to go down the list to the 28th most - frequently stolen spot to find a vehicle , the 2001 Audi S4 Quattro 4 - door , that registered a high theft frequency despite the fact that it is protected by an immobilizer .
It just underlines the reality that theft is much more likely when a vehicle is not equipped with an immobilizer , ” Dubin adds .
For this reason Transport Canada has made it mandatory that all new cars , light trucks and SUV’s are required to be equipped with an electronic immobilizer as of September 2007 .
In contrast , all but three of the least stolen vehicles last year were models that featured IBC - approved immobilizer systems .
These vehicles were best insurance bets as far as auto theft is concerned .
The Least Stolen Vehicles were :
( tie ) 2000 Saab 9 - 5 4 - door
1. ( tie ) 2002 Volvo S60 4 - door AWD
1. ( tie ) 2002 Pontiac Bonneville 4 - door
1. ( tie ) 1998 Lincoln Continental 4 - door
1. ( tie ) 2001 Ford / Mercury Taurus / Sable Wagon
1. ( tie ) 2001 Pontiac Bonneville 4 - door
1. ( tie ) 2002 Oldsmobile Silhouette
1. ( tie ) 1997 Saturn SW1 Wagon
9. 1998 Toyota Avalon XLS 4 - door
10 . ( tie ) 2000 Lincoln Continental 4 - door
( tie ) 2005 Saturn Ion 4 - door Sedan
( tie ) 1996 Buick Le Sabre 4 - door
The first eight models shared the lowest frequency of theft claims , the vehicle in 9th spot , had the second lowest , and the last three tied for the third lowest frequency .
Data on vehicle theft frequency is based wholly on actual insurance claims information collected from companies that write almost 100 % of all automobile insurance in Canada .
This data is also found in this year ’s edition of IBC ’s How Cars Measure Up , which compares the insurance claim records of the most popular models of cars , passenger vans , SUVs and pickup trucks across the country .
Consumers can also access information on the best and worst models according to collision , comprehensive and theft cost experience .
This information can be extremely useful to consumers before they actually buy either a new or used car .
How Cars Measure
Up is designed to help consumers understand how theft , collision and other claim costs affect insurance premiums .
For more information , visit IBC ’s web site at www.ibc.ca and click on “ How Cars Measure Up ” under “ Quick Links . ”
In 2005 , 160,000 vehicles were stolen in Canada .
Theft of vehicles ( and their components ) costs Canadian policyholders more than $ 540 million annually in insurance premiums and more than $ 1 billion when other costs such as ambulance , police , and court costs are included .
The safety and security of our communities are at risk considering that , on average , 40 people die each year and 65 are seriously injured as a result of auto theft .

Your Comments
In my recent article I was talking about my attempts to find language other that C/C++ for writing GUI applications .
Well , I should admit that last time I did GUI application myself was 5 years ago .
It was written in C++ and used MFC .
All last time I did only server - side programming .
Only now I need to write a new GUI application , and I want this application to be written in programming language other than C/C++ , so I could practice that language .
So , I did n’t GUI programing for long time , so my opinion about languages , libraries and graphical toolkits is not very solid .
But I ’m windows user , and I have my opinion about GUI programs that I use .
For me very important things about GUI program is that UI should look native and be fast , and that it should be small and launch quickly .
That makes external impression about program .
Nowdays almost everybody use some object - oriented wrapper library around Windows ui.dll , because it simplifies development greatly .
I know a good wrapper for C++ , called SmartWin ++ , but I never used it myself seriously .
I ’ve just downloaded it and tried to build example applications .
Executables are small and fast , and UI looks native .
Code for applications is small and clean , especially compared to MFC - oriented applications .
At last , SmartWin ++ could be used with both Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and with MinGW compiler , which is also important for me .
Probably soon they will add support for other compilers .
All those things make me happy with SmartWin ++ library if I choose C/C++ as implementation language .
Making access to Win32 UI library for other languages is more difficult , because there should be a binding to C for each function .
Taking into account size of Win32API it ’s a huge task .
So , people who develop other languages usually do binding to some simplified wrapper around ui.dll .
Microsoft did that for Visual Basic .
Borland did that for Delphi .
Perl , Python and OCaml have bindings to wxWidgets .
Some words about wxWidgets .
It ’s good library , and could be used for fast application development in C++ , because it ’s much simpler to use then raw Win32 UI API , and easier than MFC .
For me the only problem of wxWidgets is that it ’s not just object - oriented wrapper around Win32 UI , but cross- platform library with wrappers around lots of platform - specific toolkits .
I do n’t like this idea , and prefer SmartWin ++.
So , finally , I came to conclusion : when you develop GUI , you do n’t choose the language which you like , but choose the language which has best libraries for that GUI .
In abovementioned article I told that OCaml is very Unix - biased .
I ’m apologising for that , I was wrong .
OCaml has good support for windows sockets and threads in standard library , but it also has good binding to Win32API as additional library .
This makes it perfectly suitable for development of native Win32 UI applications .
However , this path is not easy at the beginning .
Here I whould like to share my own experience , hoping it will save somebody ’s time .
First , few words about OCaml .
For Win32 it ’s available in three flavours : CygWin , MinGW and Microsoft Visual C++.
Initially I thought that it means that those compilers were used to compile OCaml tools .
That ’s right , but also that means that those compilers will be used by OCaml tools themselves to compile your source code .
If you installing MinGW version , you should have MinGW itself installed .
If you installing Visual C++ version , then you should have Visual C++.
Fortunatelly , both compilers are available for free .
This additional requirement for C compiler was not obvious for me , and I ’ve spent some time trying to figure it out .
If you want to use ocam - win32 library , you must have version of OCaml for Visual C++.
I hope someday this library could be also built from MinGW .
Library is available in source form from here .
Unzip it in any place , and you will have lots of sources in both C and Ocaml , together with several small text files .
Those files are not very helpfull , so it ’s not easy to figure out what to do .
Finally I understood that I should make library myself .
The only toolkit I had was MinGW , so I ’ve tried to invoke “ make ” , but received “ delimeter absent ” error , because Makefile used spaces instead of tabs .
After some time I ’ve realized that I need Visual C++.
I ’ve installed free compiler and tried to build it by invoking nmake .
No complains about delimeters this time , but OCaml kept invoking gcc , which complained about compiler keys .
So I undestood that I need version of OCaml built for Visual C++.
That was not obvious .
I ’ve re-installed OCaml , and run nmake again .
Better this time , now it was complaining about missing headers .
It occured that I should have Microsoft Platform SDK installed .
It ’s big , so I ’ve installed only Platform core SDK .
To correctly compile a lots of environment variables should be set correctly .
Include directories should contain both Visual C++ runtime headers and Platform SDK headers .
The same story for libraries .
I was able to do that by first invoking “ set environment ” script of Protocol SDK , then , from same command prompt , invoking vcvars32.bat .
Another attempt to compile , and this time it was complaining about missing “ shlwapi.h ” file .
After some googling I ’ve found that I should install not just Platform core SDK , but also IE SDK .
I did that , and , finally , got the library !
There is a test application , which starts very fast and looks native .
So , now I ’m quite optimistic about usage of OCaml for GUI applications for Win32 platform .
OCaml seems much easier language than C ++.
Many thanks to authors of this library .
I had lots of problems during installation because it ’s a long time since I ’ve last used Visual C++ , and because library is for hackers who know that to do .
Library authours should extend their readme files , and they should also redistribute compiled versions of libraries .
Update : this article is a first one dedicated to GUI programming in OCaml .
See subsequent posts which will describe by progress on the path .
That ’s not a tutorial , just information written by newbie , so do n’t trust me .
Michael Savage went after CSPAN and Brian Lamb because they had the audacity to not cover his .. get this ... the Talker 's Magazine " Freedom of Speech " award ...
The reason was because Savage sent in a DVD of his speech instead of appearing live at the event he was being honored at so CSPAN declined to cover the event ..
During last week 's telecast --- CSPAN showed the vicious and misinformed emails that were sent to Lamb and CSPAN ... And the Savage man is now charging his followers 22.00 bucks to buy the DVD .

The DNC is finally addressing the Republican Party engaging in vote fraud to steal elections .
The following statements were part of a Democratic fund raising E-mail that appeared on my inbox :
Last year , we put DNC staff on the ground all across the country …
Our organizers are still on the ground in all 50 states , preparing for 2008 in every way possible .
And starting this month , they are kicking off an unprecedented voter protection effort , of a scale never attempted by any organization .
While Democrats protect everyone 's right to vote , Karl Rove and the Republican Party have a long history of threatening this right , working to make it harder for Americans to vote .
We 're going to stop them .
Unfortunately , nearly forty - two years after the signing of the voting rights act , millions of American 's are treated like criminals just for trying to vote .
Under the Bush Administration 's politicized Justice Department we have seen an outright attack on voting rights .
In their latest scheme , the Republican Administration has manipulated the mission of the Department of Justice , firing U.S. Attorneys who were unwilling to pursue phony " voter fraud " cases , and politicized the Civil Rights Division .
Over the past several years the GOP has tried everything from phone jamming schemes to vote purging to voter intimidation tactics to try and suppress the vote .
We all know what happened in Florida in 2000 .
We all know what happened in Ohio in 2004 .
So we 're going to meet with every election official in the country , visit every polling place , and make sure that every American will have their vote counted - and we will do it now , instead of waiting to hear about big problems on the news on Election Day 2008 .

Stevey 's Drunken Blog Rants ™ 10 Specific Ways to Improve Your Productivity With Emacs Emacs is the world 's best text editor .
It 's not just the best for editing program source ; it 's the best for any kind of text - editing .
Mastering Emacs will make you more effective at writing and editing email , documentation drafts , blogs , HTML pages , XML files , and virtually everything else that requires any typing .
The tips in this little document are geared towards Emacs power - users .
You should be familiar with the basics of launching and editing with Emacs , and you should already know the essentials of copying stuff into your .emacs file , and debugging things ( or finding a friendly Emacs Wizard ) when something goes wrong .
Not all the tips are customizations to Emacs ; some of them are changes to your desktop environment to make it work more seamlessly with Emacs .
The key to understanding Emacs is that it's all about efficiency , which includes economy of motion .
Any trained musician will tell you that economy of motion is critical to becoming a world - class virtuoso .
Any unnecessary motion is wasted energy and yields sloppy results .
Using the mouse is almost always the worst possible violation of economy of motion , because you have to pick your hand up and fumble around with it .
The mouse is a clumsy instrument , and Emacs gurus consider it a cache miss when they have to resort to using it .
Compared to Emacs Wizards , graphical - IDE users are the equivalent of amateur musicians , pawing at their instrument with a sort of desperation .
An IDE has blinking lights and pretty dialogs that you can't interact with properly ( see Item 6 ) , and gives newbies a nice comfortable sense of control .
But that control is extremely crude , and all serious programmers prefer something that gives them more power .
IDEs also offer Refactoring tools , which are all the rage , because they help you automatically fix your screwed - up code .
This is fine , as far as it goes , but I 'll tell you a secret : Refactoring tools do n't understand English .
They wo n't help you one bit when you 're doing something that the tools were n't designed to handle .
Refactoring tools are cookie - cutter solutions ;
Emacs offers you a level of fine - grained control over your environment that makes you the equal of any editing challenge .
However , as I often point out , this has to be seen to be believed , and even if you believe it , you need to make a serious , lifelong commitment to Emacs in order to master it .
Mastering it involves learning Lisp and customizing Emacs to the finest degree imaginable .
This simply serves to increase your hunger for more control and more automation , so even if you 've mastered Emacs , you 're never really finished extending it .
So it 's not an editor for the faint of heart , and this blog is targeted at people who have already made the commitment , and want to improve their mastery of this elegant , timeless piece of software .
The rest of you : I think your Eclipse just finished launching , so you can get back to work now .
Item 1 : Swap Caps - Lock and Control On Windows and Mac keyboards , the Ctrl key is awkwardly located in the far lower - left position on the keyboard .
The Ctrl key is critical to using Emacs at all times , so you 'll never become an Emacs virtuoso unless you move it to an easier position .
That position should be on Home Row , so Caps Lock is the best choice .
That 's the location of the Control key on most Unix workstation keyboards , for precisely that reason .
To do this on Windows 2000 or XP requires some registry hacking .
From the Start menu , choose Run and enter " regedit " .
In the left - side tree view , click down to : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout Click on the KeyboardLayout entry to give it the focus .
Make sure it has the focus and not one of its children .
Then from the Edit menu , choose New Binary Value , and name it Scancode Map .
It should show as type REG_BINARY .
Then select the new Scancode Map entry you just created , and from the Edit menu ( whose contents should have changed ) , choose Modify Binary Data .
In the dialog box called Edit Binary Value , enter the following data : 0000 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0008 : 03 00 00 00 3A 00 1D 00
0010 : 1D 00 3A 00 00 00 00 00
Select OK to close the dialog , then exit the Registry Editor .
The caps and ctrl keys should be swapped as soon as you log out and back in again .
It may require a reboot .
On Linux in X - Windows , you use the xmodmap utility .
Create a file in your home directory called .xmodmap if it does n't already exist , and put in the following lines : !
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
!
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
Save it , and add the line xmodmap ~/.xmodmap into your ~/.bash_profile .
On Mac OS X ( Panther and Jaguar ) you need to install a modified keyboard driver , which is a little scary , but it seems to work .
Here 's a discussion of the driver .
Alternately , if you 're not using a Mac laptop , there appears to be an XML file you can edit as root ; it 's described here .
This URL has some information on doing it on other systems .
Item 2 : Invoke M-x without the Alt key Alt -x is one of the most frequently typed Emacs key combos , and it involves scrunching your left hand up .
Anything you 're going to do thousands of times should be streamlined , so you want to be able to start a M-x sequence with the Ctrl key ( once you 've completed Item 1 ! )
There 's another very important reason to get in the habit of using a Ctrl sequence : the Alt key is unreliable and nonstandard across platforms .
In particular , when you 're logged in to a remote host via telnet or ssh , Alt -x may or may not work , depending on the system type and the terminal configuration .
Rather than mess with the headache of learning to configure every system you work on to know about the Alt key , it 's easier to use a key sequence that always works .
The key sequence I use is Ctrl-x Ctrl-m .
Note that when you invoke a 2 - key sequence with the same modifier key , you can just hold down the modifier key , then press the 2 keys .
So with this key sequence , invoking M-x involves pressing and holding Ctrl , typing x , then typing m .
To enable the Ctrl-x Ctrl - m sequence add the following lines to your .emacs file : ( global - set - key " \C- x\C-m " ' execute - extended - command )
( global - set - key " \C- c\C-m " ' execute - extended - command )
I add the second line so that Ctrl-c Ctrl -m will also invoke it , which makes the key sequence even more forgiving .
If I miss Ctrl-x and hit Ctrl-c accidentally , it still works .
Neither of these key sequences is bound by default in Emacs , so you 're not biffing any other useful shortcuts by doing this .
You should practice this key sequence until you get used to it , and then you 'll almost never need to use Alt -x again .
( You 'll still use the Alt key for other commands , which I 'll cover later . )
Incidentally , if you want to fine - tune this tip to extraordinary levels , then you probably do n't want to use your ring - finger for typing the x - key when you hit Ctrl-x .
I use my left index finger , since I 'm used to it that way , but you 're probably better off using your left middle finger .
The reason is that your hand is n't technically on home row when your left pinkie is jammed down on the Caps - Lock key that you 've turned into Ctrl .
The point is to use whatever requires the least amount of stretching , followed by the least amount of finger motion .
You should experiment until you find what 's most comfortable for you .
Item 3 : Prefer backward - kill - word over Backspace Emacs Wizards try to avoid hitting the backspace key , because it 's just remote enough from home - row to be annoying .
We make typing mistakes all the time , but if you type faster than about 50 wpm , it 's more economical to kill the entire word and re-type it than to painstakingly backspace to your error .
Here 's what you add to your .emacs file : ( global - set - key " \C-w " ' backward - kill - word )
( global - set - key " \C- x \C- k " ' kill - region )
( global - set - key " \C - c\C-k " ' kill - region )
Note that because Ctrl-w was already bound to kill - region , a very important command , you need to re-bind something else to kill - region .
I chose Ctrl-x Ctrl-k ( and its sloppiness - forgiving companion , Ctrl-c Ctrl-k ) , primarily because that 's the way they did it at my old company , which was filled with wise Emacs Wizards who taught me a lot of what I know .
Rebinding Ctrl-x Ctrl -k means it 's no longer available for edit - kbd - macro , but you 'll use that infrequently enough that it 's not something you 'll miss having a shortcut for .
As an added benefit , many Unix command shells provide Emacs - like command - line editing keys , and Ctrl-w is usually the default binding for backward - kill - word .
So your usage will be consistent in shells .
The faster you type , the more valuable this tip becomes .
You 'll gradually develop a " feel " for the fastest way to back up and correct various kinds of typing mistakes .
In general , here 's how my fingers decide these days :
If I 've mis -typed a character or two in a fairly long word , and my cursor is still located right after the typo , then I 'll use the backspace key .
If the typo is somewhere in the last 15 to 20 characters or so , then I 'll usually backward - kill - word to kill backward over the typo , and re-type the words .
If the typo is further back than that , but still on the same line , I 'll use Alt - B to skip the cursor back to the word with the typo , and Ctrl - b to move it within the word to get to the typo .
For mistakes further away , I 'll use Fast Navigation to get there : Item 4 covers at least part of this technique .
One thing you 'll need to be very careful of if you use Ctrl-w for backward - kill - word : Ctrl-w is hardwired to kill the window in many Windows applications .
Do not pass go , do not collect $ 200 , and in browser windows , do not save the contents of your form fields .
That means if you 're typing out something into an HTML form field , and you accidentally make a typo and hit Ctrl-w , kapow !
All your work will be lost instantly for you by Good Ole Microsoft Windows .
I know of no way to override this horrid behavior .
If you know , please tell me .
Item 4 : Use incremental search for Navigation Moving the cursor around efficiently is one of the keys to becoming an Emacs Wizard .
IDE users spend most of their time fumbling around with the mouse .
They would n't dream of doing it any other way , but they do n't realize how inefficient their motions are .
In the hands of a Master , Emacs becomes the most powerful and efficient text - editing tool on the planet , in large part because it allows you to do almost everything without using the mouse .
Emacs Wizards always have their Emacs sessions as tall as possible , filling the screen vertically , because vertical screen space is such a premium when you 're viewing a document .
When you can view a fair number of lines of text on screen at once , using incremental search is often much faster than any other way of precisely positioning the cursor .
Get in the habit of using Ctrl-r ( isearch - backward ) and Ctrl-s ( isearch - forward ) for moving around in the document .
Whenever you need to jump the cursor backward or forward more than about 5 lines , and you can see the target location , you should be using i-search .
To do it effectively , you do n't necessarily need to search for the exact word where you want to put the cursor .
Let your eye defocus slightly and take in the whole paragraph or region around the target point , and choose a word that looks reasonably unique or easy to type .
Then i-search for it to navigate to it .
You may need to hit Ctrl-r or Ctrl -s repeatedly if your anchor word turns out not to be unique .
But Emacs will highlight all the matches , so if there are more than a couple of them , Ctrl -g out of the search and choose another anchor word .
It 's difficult to overemphasize how powerful this technique is , once you 've mastered it .
Mastering it simply requires that you do it repeatedly until your fingers do it " automatically " .
Emacs eventually becomes like an extension of your body , and you 'll be performing hundreds of different keystrokes and mini-techniques like this one without thinking about them .
It 's comparable to the hundreds of subtle techniques you acquire for driving a car well .
Item 5 : Use Temp Buffers
One of the most powerful things about Emacs is its ability to swiftly generate a new buffer that is n't associated with a file or process .
Once you get used to using this technique , you 'll sorely miss the functionality in other editors and applications .
To create a temp buffer , just switch to it !
Ctrl-x b invokes the command switch - to - buffer , and you just type in adsflj or whatever comes out of drumming on the keyboard .
Instantly you 've got yourself a scratchpad , where you can take notes , dump temporary results , or use it in any way that 's convenient for the problem at hand .
If you plan on keeping multiple temp buffers around , you might give them more memorable names , such as foo , bar , baz , and buh .
If you want to see your temp buffer side - by - side with another buffer , you can split the screen horizontally or vertically .
See Item 6 .
Because your temp buffers are n't associated with a file , you can kill them just as quickly as you created them using Ctrl-x k , the kill - buffer command .
If you decide you want to save the contents of a temp buffer somewhere , just switch to the buffer and Ctrl-x Ctrl-w to invoke the write - file command .
It will prompt you for a filename , and after saving , you can kill the buffer safely and revisit the file contents later .
Item 6 : Master the buffer and window commands
You 'll frequently want to do some editing task and have multiple windows open .
Emacs uses slightly different terminology from most other applications .
A " buffer " is a logical space that contains some text , possibly tied to a file or process .
A " window " is a visible region on screen displaying exactly one buffer ( or part of it ) .
A " frame " is what you call a " window " in OS - lingo : a standalone window with its own title bar and so on .
The most important commands to master are : Ctrl-x 2 : split - window - vertically -- splits your current window into two equal - height windows showing the same buffer ( until you change one of them to show something else . )
-- splits your current window into two equal - height windows showing the same buffer ( until you change one of them to show something else . )
Ctrl-x 3 : split - window - horizontally -- most people do n't use this as often , but it 's occasionally useful .
Splits the window into a left - side and a right - side .
: -- most people do n't use this as often , but it 's occasionally useful .
Splits the window into a left - side and a right - side .
Ctrl-x + : balance - windows -- makes all visible windows approximately equal height .
This is useful if you 've just done Ctrl-x 2 twice in a row , because you 'll have two 1/4 - height windows and one 1/2 - height window .
Ctrl-x + makes them all the same height .
: -- makes all visible windows approximately equal height .
This is useful if you 've just done Ctrl-x 2 twice in a row , because you 'll have two 1/4 - height windows and one 1/2 - height window .
Ctrl-x + makes them all the same height .
Ctrl-x o : other - window -- moves the cursor into the next window in the window list , which usually means moving it to the window below the current one , or wrapping back up to the top .
: -- moves the cursor into the next window in the window list , which usually means moving it to the window below the current one , or wrapping back up to the top .
Ctrl-x 1 : delete - other - windows -- makes the currently focused window fill the entire frame ; the others go away .
Note that the buffers they were visiting stay around in the buffer - list , so it 's always perfectly safe to execute this command .
: -- makes the currently focused window fill the entire frame ; the others go away .
Note that the buffers they were visiting stay around in the buffer - list , so it 's always perfectly safe to execute this command .
Ctrl-x Ctrl- b : list - buffers -- shows a list of all the buffers you have open , in a nicely formatted buffer called " * Buffer List * " .
This buffer 's mode has many convenience keys for manipulating the buffer list .
For instance , typing " d " while the cursor is on one of the entries will flag that buffer for deletion , " x " will kill the buffer , and so on .
Use M-x describe - bindings to view all the Buffer - menu key bindings .
Dialog Boxes : The Root of All Evil Emacs is an incredibly powerful editor , but a few design choices in particular really stand out as being the biggest individual contributors .
One of them is the fact that Emacs has no dialog boxes .
This was actually a requirement in order to give Emacs its full functionality while running in a text - only terminal window .
But by happy accident , it 's also one of the key features that helps make Emacs so insanely powerful .
Dialog boxes suck .
For starters , they always have focus issues , and often cause poorly - designed applications to lock up or fail to refresh while the dialog is open .
And dialog boxes never seem to play along with any customizations to your video mode .
For example , if you set up a dual - monitor display using 2 cards , the application dialogs in Windows will tend to pop up in the wrong window , making the whole experience a really annoying pain in the ass .
Dialogs sometimes come up in unpredictable places even on single - monitor machines .
And even in well - designed applications like the Microsoft Office suite , modal dialogs can still wind up buried behind a bunch of other windows on your screen , which makes the application seem like it 's totally unresponsive until you find the rogue dialog and bring it to the front .
For some strange reason , dialog boxes are often non-resizable .
It 's the opposite for application windows : those are almost always resizable , and app designers usually take great pains to make the UI rearrange to fill the space nicely if you resize the window .
But with dialogs , the default seems to be non-resizable , possibly because on most OSes , dialogs are a screwed - up hack that was added on long after the window manager was designed without dialogs in mind .
( Guess how I know this . )
Hell , they 're even a mess in Java Swing .
And do n't get me started on the buttons .
We 've had dialog boxes in GUIs for at least 25 years , but people still can't agree on a standard set of buttons for them , or even a standard place to put the buttons .
Some dialogs put them in the title bar , some on the bottom , some on the right side .
And it 's rarely 100 % clear what will happen if you use the Window controls in the title bar to close a dialog , bypassing its button choices .
The whole experience is a giant crap sandwich , and everyone knows it intuitively , but it 's just how everyone assumes things have to be .
But the problem with dialog boxes goes even deeper than the focus , sizing and positioning problems .
Dialogs are never , ever full peers of the rest of the application UI .
If you define any keyboard macros ( not just in Emacs -- in any app , such as Excel or Word ) , they wo n't work in dialog boxes .
If the dialog has a scrollable widget , you have no options for navigating other than by using the scrollbar .
To illustrate , fire up Internet Explorer and choose Internet Options from the Tools menu .
Go to the Advanced tab .
There they are : all your pathetic global customization options for IE .
If you want to find a particular option , you have to scroll slowly , looking for it .
You ca n't use Edit / Find because the dialog is , of course , modal .
And the dialog is , of course , also non-resizable .
Most dialogs are like this .
Buffers to the Rescue In Emacs , all output goes into buffers , and all buffers are first - class citizens .
All your favorite navigation shortcuts are available in all buffers , including i-search .
You can select and copy text out of any buffer , and there is no such thing as a " modal " buffer , so you can keep the output around as long as you like , while continuing to work in other windows .
It does n't even have to be visible ; the " dialog " output stays in the buffer list until you dismiss it .
There is nothing else quite like the Emacs buffer experience in all of application - dom .
Once you realize how consistent and powerful this model is , all other applications become slightly distasteful , because you know their UI is just getting in your way .
Once you learn to master those buffers and windows , and sling them around with ease , you 'll be on your way to Emacs Wizardhood .
Item 7 : Lose the UI
You do n't need a menu bar .
It 's just a crutch placed there for disoriented newbies .
You also do n't need a toolbar with big happy icons , nor do you need a scrollbar .
All of these things are for losers , and they are just taking up precious screen real - estate .
Turn them all off with the following code in your .emacs file : ( if ( fboundp ' scroll - bar - mode ) ( scroll - bar - mode - 1 ) )
( if ( fboundp ' tool - bar - mode ) ( tool - bar - mode - 1 ) )
( if ( fboundp ' menu - bar - mode ) ( menu - bar - mode - 1 ) )
You wo n't miss any of it .
We 'll cover how to find your way around in the next tip .
( Notes added Jan 2nd , 2006 ) I recently saw a comment from a person who hated this entire essay because of tip # 7 .
The person expressed a great deal of disgruntlement , evidently being quite attached to his or her mouse and menus , and took affront to being called a " disoriented newbie " .
The person went on to claim that using the mouse has been proven " faster " by countless studies .
So I figure I should elaborate a bit .
The remainder of this tip is All New , thanks to that disgruntled reader 's blog .
First I should observe that I often wish Emacs had a richer rendering engine , enabling it to do GUI and graphics on par with other desktop applications .
It may never happen ; my blog - rant The Emacs Problem talks about this a bit .
But I 'd love to see it .
I bring this up as evidence that I 'm not a thoughtless anti-GUI person .
Scrollbar : optional I usually turn off the scrollbar in Emacs because there are keystrokes that can achieve the same effect .
However , scrollbars have the advantage of providing analog feedback as to how far into the buffer you are , and how long it is .
The digital feedback provided by the %- indicator in the status area is n't as easy to read -- countless studies have proven that .
It 's why the U.S. Navy uses analog gauges in their reactor plants , for instance .
It 's too easy to glance at a digital ( i.e. numeric ) gauge and misread it .
So I have no real problem with scrollbars , if you 're more comfortable with them .
Just be aware that they 'll tempt you to reach for the mouse , but for certain operations ( e.g. jumping to the beginning or end of the buffer ) , it 's much faster to use the keyboard .
No user studies are necessary to justify this claim , either .
Some simple timing experiments should convince even the most skeptical reader .
Keyboard wins for navigation
Let 's say we want to put a row of 80 hyphens at the very beginning and very end of a long buffer , and you 're currently in the middle of the buffer .
It 's slightly contrived , but I 've done it when putting together a " cut here " excerpt containing the buffer contents .
Using the keyboard , I 'm done in under 3 seconds , ready to move on to the next task .
The key sequence I had to type was " C-x t C-u 8 0 - RET C-x e C-u 8 0 - " , or 13 key presses .
There 's simply no way you could do this reliably in 3 seconds with the mouse , since you 'd have to make 2 complete round - trips to the mouse , to grab the scroll button ( aka " thumb " or " elevator " ) and drag it to the top or bottom , then return to the keyboard to type out the text .
A quick trial took me close to 15 seconds .
Scrolling to the top does NOT move the cursor to the first character , so you also have to carefully position the cursor there .
Sure , you could practice it a bit , and maybe get it down to 10 seconds , but why bother ?
If you 're going to do that exact operation frequently , you should write a macro for it .
Mouse use case # 1 of 1 : region selections
There are clearly some operations that will be faster with the mouse .
Interacting with your window system outside Emacs is usually faster with the mouse , as is interacting with other applications that do n't have Emacs - like keyboard navigation .
But inside Emacs , I can only think of one thing that 's faster with the mouse : region selection , particularly if you 're selecting a rectangle .
Sometimes region selection with the keyboard is faster : for instance , setting the mark and holding down Ctrl -n to start selecting lines , or Ctrl -f to grow the selection by a character at a time .
But the keyboard repeat rate , which is set in hardware , can feel annoyingly slow .
I can see about 100 lines of text in a buffer window on my display , and selecting those lines with the keyboard ( assuming I 'm starting with the point somewhere in the middle ) takes about 5 seconds .
Selecting them with the mouse and returning to home row takes about 4 seconds .
So when I just need to select lines in the visible area , the mouse usually is n't worth it .
However , if I need to select a region that 's taller than my window size ( by drag - selecting ) , or I need to select a region whose beginning and end columns both fall mid-line somewhere , then the mouse is the most reliably fast approach , and I 'll use it happily .
Using the mouse for selections is n't turning off the UI , though , so it 's only slightly related to this tip .
The point is that I actually do timing experiments like this once in a while .
My opinions about the GUI in Emacs are backed by 20 years of this kind of experimentation .
And I 'm recommending that you turn off the menus .
Really .
Menus : lose 'em !
Menus are fine for exploration , for learning more about Emacs 's capabilities .
Unfortunately they can easily lull you into thinking the cover everything Emacs can do .
However , many Emacs packages do n't have any menu support -- it 's only the super - meticulous package designer who goes to the effort of adding menu support .
So if you 're using the menus for browsing and exploring Emacs , you 're missing out on a lot of functionality .
Another problem with menus is related to my rant about dialogs earlier : they do n't scale well .
If you want to provide the user with 1500 choices , putting them in a menu will tax the windowing system to the limits of its ability .
Doing it in an Emacs buffer is trivial , and gives you a lot more real - estate in which to do nice layouts and groupings of the choices .
Type M-x list - colors - display or M-x list - faces - display to see some examples of what I mean .
Another ( huge ) problem with menus is that they 're not searchable , and they do n't do auto - completion .
You can easily find yourself digging way down some submenu heirarchy , thinking you 're getting close , but you 're actually barking down the wrong tree .
They 're nowhere near as flexible an exploration mechanism as searchable help -- this is every bit as true in Microsoft applications as it is in Emacs .
And finally , once you 've memorized a menu action , you always have to go back to the menu ( and possibly submenus ) to perform it .
The more often you do the action , the more time you 've wasted compared to using a keyboard shortcut .
So I think Emacs menus are no good .
They do n't show you everything Emacs can do ; they do n't suggest alternatives when you can't find what you want ; they 're not capable of scaling to thousands of choices ( so they 're not a very good general - purpose UI mechanism , compared to something like a tree view ) , and they 're slow to access even when you know how to use them .
In short : turn off those menus !
And as for big shiny buttons , well , gosh .
Anything important enough for a button is important enough for a fast keyboard shortcut .
Item 8 : Learn the most important help functions
To find out all the keyboard shortcuts that are defined for the current buffer , type M-x describe - bindings .
It shows you a list of keys and the commands that they 're mapped to .
If you move the cursor to one of the commands in this list , and hit Enter , it 'll show you the Help for that command .
To find out what a particular key does , use M-x describe - key , and then type the key sequence you 're interested in .
It goes directly to the Help for that key , if the key is currently bound to a command .
If you 're interested in finding a command , and you have a guess as to the name but you are n't sure exactly what it 's called , use M-x apropos , followed by a regular expression ( see Item 9 ) to use for matching command names .
All Emacs commands ( as well as functions variables , and property lists ) are kept in global tables that can be searched with M-x apropos .
If , for instance , you 're looking for a function that sends a buffer all the way to the back of the list , you could type M-x apropos - command buffer , which shows about 200 available commands with the word " buffer " in the command name .
Near the top is a command , bury - buffer , whose documentation says : bury - buffer M-x bury - buffer RET Command : Put BUFFER at the end of the list of all buffers .
Et voila .
Just the command you were looking for .
You can easily winnow the search through large lists by specifying a more restrictive regexp .
Perhaps the most important Help function is M-x info , which brings up Emacs 's interactive , menu - driven Info engine .
You should learn to use Info .
It has thousands of pages of documentation , and it's hyperlinked ( in its own custom way that predates the Web , unfortunately ) , so it 's much easier to navigate than , say , man pages .
Once you 've mastered the navigation keys in Info , it 's faster than navigating HTML help with a browser , even for local static files , in part because of Info 's ability to perform searches across multiple info files , and in part because Emacs simply has better navigation capabilities than any web browser .
Item 9 : Master Emacs 's regular expressions
The best way to do this is to get yourself the Friedl Book , Mastering Regular Expressions .
It 's worth it .
Every programmer should have a copy , no matter what language or editor you 're using .
Emacs 's regular expressions have some idiosyncracies that everyone dislikes , but they 're not insurmountable , and once you 've learned them , it opens up new horizons in editing power .
Two important regexp - related commands are isearch - forward - regexp and isearch - backward - regexp .
These are by default bound to ESC C-r and ESC C-s , respectively .
Those keys are lame , though .
Any sequence that requires hitting the actual Escape key is lame , and Alt - Ctrl -s on my Compaq machine is invisible to Emacs ; it brings up a system diagnostics dialog .
I have the isearch -*- regexp commands bound to Alt -r and Alt -s , since I use them so much .
Alt -s is n't normally bound .
The default Emacs binding for Alt -r is the command move - to - window - line , which you wo n't need , because you 'll use Item 4 for moving around within the window .
Some modes insist on re-binding Alt -r and Alt-s , which is annoying , and I have a bunch of per-mode hacks to re-bind them , but I do n't have all modes covered .
If someone can suggest a way to bind Alt -r and Alt - s in such a way that they can't be overridden by any modes , please let me know -- I 'd be muchly appreciative .
The next two important regexp - related commands are replace - regexp and query - replace - regexp .
They function identically , prompting for a regular expression and a replacement string , but query - replace - regexp prompts you to type y or n for each possible replacement .
I use query - replace - regexp so frequently that I have an alias for it : ( defalias ' qrr ' query - replace - regexp )
That way I can type M-x qrr to invoke the function .
Other useful commands that take regexps are M-x list - matching - lines , which shows you all the lines in a buffer that match some regexp , and M-x apropos , which shows you all commands whose names match a given regexp .
The most Frequently Asked Question about Emacs regexps is : " How do I insert a newline into a regexp or the replacement string ? "
Hitting the Enter key simply tells the command that you 're done entering the regexp , and it starts doing the replacements .
( This is a very good reason for preferring query - replace - regexp over replace - regexp until you 're 100 % confident that your regexps are right on the first try .
I 'm still not there yet . )
The answer is that you need to insert a ^J character , which Emacs uses to represent newlines in functions and commands .
At the point in the regexp or replacement where you need to insert a newline , hit Ctrl -q followed by Ctrl -j .
Ctrl-q is Emacs 's " quote " command : rather than executing the following keystroke , Emacs will insert the key into the current buffer or the minibuffer .
Some other useful things to know about Emacs regular expressions :
You need to double - escape ( " \\ " ) regexp metacharacters in strings in elisp code , but you single - escape them when entering regexps at the minibuffer .
Emacs code does so much matching of parens that Emacs regexps reverse the paren character and metacharacter .
In an Emacs regexp , " ( " and " ) " match actual parens , while " \ ( " and " \ ) " create matching groups .
In the replacement string , use \ 1 , \ 2 , etc. for inserting match - groups from the regexp .
If you enter in a regexp and it does n't work , undo the result if the command actually changed anything .
Then type the command again , and when it prompts you , use the arrow keys to scroll up and down to find your regexp and replacement string , and modify them in place .
This can save you a lot of typing and frustration .
You can yank text into the middle of a regexp you 're typing out with most regexp commands , but NOT in the isearch -*- regexp commands .
Yank does weird things in those .
I 'd love to know how to fix this .
Mastering regular expressions and the commands that use them is one of the most important components of becoming an Emacs Wizard .
Item 10 : Master the fine - grained text manipulation commands Emacs provides many small but useful commands for doing surgery on text .
They add up to laserlike efficiency .
For starters , do n't be tempted to re-bind Ctrl -k to a function that kills the whole line including the newline .
I know that 's the way kill - line works in all other editors .
But it 's clumsy and coarse compared to the way kill - line works by default .
The default behavior , which kills the text to the end of the line but does n't kill the newline , gives you finer - grained control , and leads to more efficient text surgery on the whole .
Trust me : all Emacs users use other applications that only support the fat - fingered kill - whole - line version , so they 've had plenty of opportunity to use both approaches .
There 's a reason the default is the way it is .
Keyboard Macros
I believe I can state without the slightest hint of exaggeration that Emacs keyboard macros are the coolest thing in the entire universe .
They are , in a sense , as fine - grained and special - purpose as it gets , because you create them on the fly to solve specific editing problems .
Whenever you find you need to make a specific , patterned change more than , say , 10 to 15 times , create a keyboard macro .
It 's really easy to do .
First it helps to do a trial run on the macro .
Once you 've done that , put your cursor at at the beginning of the first place to change , and use Ctrl-x ( to start recording the macro .
Make your edits , and make sure to put the cursor in the corresponding place on the next line ( or several lines down , as appropriate ) , so the macro will execute exactly the same pattern every time .
To stop recording , type Ctrl-x ) , and to invoke the macro , use Ctrl-x e ( call - last - kbd- macro ) .
It 's something of an art to define a robust macro -- you learn to use anchors like beginning - of - line and end - of line to make sure the macro is in a stable point before adding another action to it .
And incremental - search is useful for skipping forward to the next place to invoke the macro : if you use isearch within the macro , to find the place to start , then each invocation of the macro later will automatically perform the search each time .
Very convenient .
And it 's OK to make minor navigational mistakes while recording the macro .
Just move the cursor back to where it should be and keep recording .
The mistake will be replayed every time you execute the macro , but it 'll happen so fast you 'll be unlikely to notice .
The trick to getting good at macros is to be persistent : make sure you get the macro working , and do n't give up , even if it means spending more time fiddling with the macro than making the edits manually .
The next time around it 'll be easier , and eventually they 'll become second nature .
Keyboard macros are one of the most powerful features of Emacs , and they can make your life much easier .
One last tip for keyboard macros : typically you 'll play them dozens or even hundreds of times in a file , or across multiple files .
You should bind call - last - kbd - macro to a single keystroke , such as the F5 key .
You 'll usually be " babysitting " the job , pressing the key over and over , watching the changes as you make them to ensure you do n't hork something unintentionally .
So it 's fine to have it bound to a " faraway " key like F5 .
You can set it up like so : ( global - set - key [ f5 ] ' call- last-kbd- macro ) Transpose -* functions
Finally you 'll find the transpose -* commands surprisingly useful once you get used to them , even though they look like gimmicks .
Probably the most useful is transpose - words .
You'd be amazed at how often you find yourself using this command , which is bound to Alt - t .
It has two uses : swapping two adjacent words , and dragging a single word forward or backward in a sentence .
The transpose - words function is aware of mode - specific syntax and word boundaries , so , for instance , putting the cursor between these two words : ( [ this ] ) - is and hitting Alt - t will result in : ( [ is ] ) - this You can transpose words across hyphens , HTML tags , and basically all punctuation .
It 's a pretty handy feature when you need it .
When you transpose 2 words , e.g. " dog food " , the leftmost word swaps with the rightmost ( assuming the cursor is somewhere between the beginning of the first word and the end of the second one ) , resulting in " food dog " .
But the cursor moves so that it 's still to the right of the word that moved to the right .
So if you apply it repeatedly , the word moves along the sentence to the right .
I do n't think there 's a built - in way to make a " drag- word - left " , but it would be easy to write a short function to do it .
The corresponding Eclipse plug - in would be 5,000 lines of code in 60 source files and would take nine days to write and debug .
You can also transpose chars , lines , sentences , and paragraphs .
These are all useful as you perform editing operations on your raw text and even your source code .
Experiment with them and try to remember that they 're there , and eventually they 'll also become second - nature .
Tune in next time ...
At some point I 'll have collected and documented 50 tips , at which point Scott Meyers can just eat his heart out .
I made a valiant effort to do them all in one sitting , but I gave up just now and changed this blog 's heading from " 50 Specific Ways ... " to " 10 Specific Ways ... "
At least I did it this entry all in one sitting of a little over 2 hours .
An Eclipse user would have spent that much time digging through the manuals , looking for a refactoring tool that can write blogs .
Fat chance .
For upcoming tips , a few that come to mind as being particularly useful are : fill - paragraph ( Alt - p ) -- intelligently line - wraps your text for you : an absolute must , and it works inside source - code comments .
gnuserv : automatically open certain document types ( including View Source in your browser ) in Emacs .
M-x Dired : a powerful way to manage your files and directories .
It can do things that NO other tool can do ( at least that I 'm aware of ) , including renaming arbitrary groups of files from one regexp to another .
whitespace - manipulation commands : C-x C-o ( delete - blank - lines ) , delete - trailing - whitespace , tabify and untabify , indent - region , and so on .
nxml - mode : the ONLY way to fly when you 're editing XML .
Authored by XML guru James Clark ; it knocks the socks off any IDE - based XML editor out there today .
picture - mode : the best way to draw ascii art , and useful in a surprising number of situations .
minibuffer management : mastering recursive edits , learning how to abort from various situations , command completions , and other command - entry trickery .
effortless navigation : re-bind a few keys so that you can move the cursor in any direction , by chars or words , by holding down
Alt and just pressing various letter keys .
region management : choosing a non-disgusting color for the highlighted region , covering region - related commands .
rectangle commands : yet another incredibly important set of related commands with no analogues in other editors .
Once again , you 'll wonder how you lived without them .
emacs shells : tips and tricks for getting the most out of a bash command shell running as an Emacs subprocess .
align - regexp : my new favorite command .
just learned it recently , and I use it almost every day .
frame initialization : put Emacs exactly where you want it , every time it starts up , by auto - detecting the screen dimensions and computing where it should be .
using the goal column : things every Emacs power - user should know .
setting the fill column : how to get the most out of fill - region and fill - paragraph .
optimizing OS settings , such as speeding up your keyboard repeat rate , choosing an ideal Emacs font , and so on .
browsing and editing archives : tar , gzip , zip , jar , etc .
Most people have no idea this feature exists , and it 's nothing short of amazing .
advanced keybinding : learn the syntax for binding function keys , home / end , and other oddball keys .
Learn how to make keybindings local to a particular buffer or mode .
mastering the kill ring , including using Derek Upham 's fancy new mode for viewing its contents .
mastering Info : customizing your Info dir , finding and adding in new Info files , and advanced navigation and bookmarking .
using M-x customize : learn how this beast works , and how to use it or avoid it as needed .
utility apps : M-x calendar , M-x calc , and others .
The list goes on and on ... ah , well , I 'll get around to them someday .
And with that , it 's a wrap !
I 'm heading to bed .

Comments
Some random comments :
To yank at the i-search prompt , use M-y instead of C-y .
The emacs info node on Incremental Search talks about the rebinding of C-y , C-w , etc at the i-search prompt .
To repeat execution of the last kbd macro , after hitting C - xe to run it once , keep hitting just the 'e ' key for repeated execution .
Zap - to - char ( M - z ) is incredibly useful if you need to change myDatafileHandler to myStreamHandler and point is at D ( the first char to change ) .
Simple M-z e to zap the " Datafile " part and type in the replacement .
This is not orthogonal to the backward - kill - word ( bound to C - backspace for me since that works in windows browser windows as well as everything else ) so there 's a feel needed for which is optimal when , which for me mostly depends on where point is already .

" Swap Caps - Lock and Control " :
Or you could just get yourself a keyboard that 's already swapped , or that lets you swap them in hardware .
The Happy Hacking Keyboard is an example of the former .
I like the Avant Stellar keyboard for the latter .
" Binding Alt - r and Alt-s " : Try setting up a minor mode with the definitions you want .
Then stick that keymap on the * front * of MINOR - MODE - MAP - ALIST .
Other tips : Use `iswitchb ' mode .
It 's faster for switching between buffers , and it provides more feedback .
Use P4 mode .
But be sure to download a more recent version than what we have installed .
Emacs ' integration with X11 selections is written to work well with xterm 's sucky default policies .
That means it works badly with modern apps and badly over slow network connections ( say , a VPN from home ) .
I have written a new set of commands to make Emacs talk to the clipboard , and they make life much easier .
Posted by : Derek U. at January 24 , 2005 07:37 PM
Doing the swapping of control / cap - lock key can be done in \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER \Keyboard Layout instead of under \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE .

I disagree with your agressive rebinding of keys .
I used to rebind almost all my emacs keys so they would be more familiar to a windows user ( Ctrl + C does copy , Ctrl +V is paste , etc ) .
However , I found myself at a loss when I tried using my neighbor 's computer with the default emacs installed .
Always learn default emacs keybindings first , then over - write them as you find appropriate .
For example , I rebound Ctrl + J to be the goto - line macro .
By default , Ctrl + J enters a newline .
F7 is not bound to anything by default , so I made that bound to the compile macro ( that keybinding actually comes from Visual Studio ) .
That is about the extent of the keybindings I need / use .
And , if I have to use a non-customized emacs , I can still get work done .
Cheers ,

To not pursue aggressive editor and keyboard customizations because other people stick to the standard is a bogus argument , in my opinion .
Firstly , how often do you really use a terminal other than your own ?
And even then , how often do you write just scads of code there ?
When I do this , it 's usually for just a couple of quick edits .
So , why optimize for that 1 % of time when you 're not at your own setup ?
Secondly , if it does annoy me enough to care , I can always just load my rc file remotely .
I use vim and have my .vimrc hardlinked into my / workplace directory so I can just say vim -u / net / ericw / workplace /.vimrc if I really need my magic .
I 'm certain the same can be done in emacs .
Customization is one of the main selling points of powerful editors , and our wrists are two of our most valuable assets as developers , so I do n't understand why people eschew customization just because they fear that small percentage of the time when they wo n't have it .
Posted by : Eric W. at January 28 , 2005 07:34 PM
Brian , I 'm afraid I 'm with Eric on this one .
I have friends who have nonstandard keyboards , in some cases to avoid repetitive - stress injury .
I can't type at their workstations .
I have this little secret , though , that works like a charm .
I say : " uh , you type . "
OK , not much of a secret , but it 's gotten me by .
Everyone customizes their environment .
Some SDEs use fonts so small I actually can't read them .
Some use custom window managers with non-CUA hotkeys and behavior .
People use Windows , Linux , MacOS .
There are different Unix shells with different default keybindings and aliases .
Should we tell everyone they have to use plain - vanilla Windows installations with no customizations ?
You 're effectively arguing that we should all reduce ourselves to the least common denominator of productivity .
This argument has been debunked in other domains ( e.g. should we make people with good vision wear blur - inducing glasses , so nobody feels like they 're at a natural disadvantage ? ) , and it does n't hold water in ours either .
You 're welcome to use the default bindings yourself , of course .
But I would n't get on a bandwagon that tries to discourage people from getting better at their jobs .
It 's a slippery slope that I think you want to avoid .
Anyway , we now issue laptops with wireless iVPNs , so you can even bring your environment with you .
It 's just not an issue anymore .

I just want to know the tips you allude to in number ( 8 ) of your " Tune in next time ... " section .
How do you do the up / down / left / right browsing ?
I 've been trying to train myself to use C-n , C-p , C-f , C - b and friends , but its awkward , and it is n't getting easier .
Also , can I plllleeeeasssseee see your .emacs file :)

Howdy , I know it 's bad form to comment on a blog entry without having read it thoroughly but I will take a chance because your eternal salavation is at stake .
I use C-h for backspace in Emacs and move `help - command ' elsewhere : ( global - set - key " \C- h " ' backward-delete-char-untabify )
( define - key isearch - mode - map " \C- h " ' isearch - delete- char )
( global - set - key [ ( hyper h ) ] ' help - command ) and this also works in the shell along with C-m , C-j , C- i , etc .
Offered for your consideration . :-)

Great article .
Reading section 7 , I became amused by the person who claimed that
" countless studies " ( or whatever ) had proven that the mouse was
faster .
I 'm guessing he never studied GOMS , which is a method of decomposing
UIs into their basic operations and then performing objective
complexity and time analysis .
A quick typist can hit about 10 keys per second , or .1s per key .
To
use a mouse there are four movements involved : move from the keyboard
to the mouse , move the cursor to a location , perform some operation at
the location , then move the hand back to the keyboard .
Moving the hand takes about .4s .
Moving the mouse cursor on the screen
takes .5s .
So without even doing anything , you 've used 1.3 seconds .
A
mouse click takes .1 seconds , and if you 're dragging something , you
measure the click down , the drag , and the release , adding up to
another .7 seconds .
So let 's say I want to highlight a line for copy :
mouse :
. 4 move to mouse
. 5 move cursor to first character
. 1 depress button
. 5 drag to highlight ( and this is optimistic , depending on how good
you are with finicky targets like highlighting )
. 1 release button
. 4 move to keyboard
. 2 copy ( alt - w , ctrl -c , whatever .
count control keys as a separate keypress )
2.2 seconds to perform .
kb scenario 1 : best case : already at beginning of line
. 2 mark ( ctrl- space )
. 2 end - of - line ( ctrl-e )
. 2 copy
. 6 seconds to perform , or nearly 4 times as fast .
kb scenario 2 : worst case : requires navigation : 30 lines down , line
starts with " Reading "
. 9s move to start of line ( ctrl - r readi ctrl-r )
. 2 mark ( ctrl- space )
. 2 end - of - line ( ctrl-e )
. 2 copy
1.5s , still faster
As it turns out , the only thing a mouse is really good for is
something involving a gross motor movement , like moving a window or
the like .
Unless you 're a crappy typist .
Anyway , good article , and I 'm looking forward to reading the rest of
them .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Microsoft Corp. said late Thursday that it will take a charge of up to $ 1.15 billion , due to an expanded warranty program for what it called an " unacceptable " number of repairs required for its Xbox video - game system .
Microsoft MSFT , - 1.04 % said that due to the needed repairs for the Xbox 360 , it will be " enhancing " its warranty policy for the devices , expanding coverage to three years .
The company will " take a $ 1.05 billion to $ 1.15 billion pretax charge to earnings for the fourth quarter that ended June 30 for anticipated costs under its current and enhanced Xbox 360 policies , " it said .
In a conference call with analysts , Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said that the charge will have no impact on the company 's overall guidance for fiscal 2008 .
The entertainment and devices unit president , Robbie Bach , added that the company still Microsoft expects the Xbox business to become profitable sometime in fiscal 2008 , thanks to factors such as the release of the highly anticipated " Halo 3 " in September .
Microsoft specifically cited the " three flashing red lights " error message encountered by Xbox 360 users experiencing hardware failures .
The company said that it will repair or replace devices that experience the " Red Ring of Death " within three years of their purchase .
Previously , Microsoft offered a one - year warranty for Xbox consoles .
Microsoft also said that it will retroactively reimburse customers who have paid for repairs related to the red - light error message .
Hardware issues with the Xbox 360 have been widely reported lately , and the red - light message was dubbed the Red Ring of Death by gamers and bloggers .
Various published reports place the failure rate of Xbox 360 consoles at between 30 % and 33 % .
Liddell said that at the end of June , Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox consoles .
That figure falls short of prior estimates : Liddell said in January that Microsoft expected to have sold 12 million of the consoles by the end of June .
Bach declined to disclose the number of consoles that have experienced failures , though he said that " with a billion - dollar charge ... it 's a meaningful number . "
The online publication DailyTech reported on July 3 that a British game - console repair company has withdrawn its service for the red - light error , citing the high volume of requests for such repairs .
In addition , a blog has been published specifically addressing the Red Ring of Death and offering methods for preventing it .
Visit the blog .
Bach said that no evidence of the red - light error message surfaced during the first months after the Xbox 360's release late last year , but elaborated with the following : " In the last couple of months , we started to see significant increases in repair requests ... and significant attention from people , so we geared up to respond to that . "
The executive added that an alteration already has been implemented in both consoles Microsoft has in its inventory , as well as those now being manufactured .
" We think we have our hands around it at the engineering level . "
“ A blog has been published specifically addressing the Red Ring of Death and offering methods for preventing it . ”
The $ 1.05 billion to $ 1.15 billion charge comes as Microsoft last reported having $ 28.2 billion in cash and short - term investments on hand at the end of its fiscal third quarter ended in March .
Microsoft is due to report fourth - quarter earnings July 19 .
The Xbox constitutes a relatively small portion of Microsoft 's revenue .
The company 's entertainment and devices unit , which includes the Xbox , posted $ 947 million in revenue for the company 's third quarter , compared with $ 5.28 billion in revenue for the Microsoft 's client unit , which includes its flagship Windows operating system .
13 Worst Company URLs Ever : An Analysis
If you are going to conduct business online , you ’re going to need a domain name .
In fact , it ’s one of those pretty important things you ’ll need to get squared away when establishing a website .
In some cases , your domain name can make or break you .
You can potentially obtain better rankings in search engines with the right name .
Or you can attract a better following when you ’ve got a good brand going .
But what happens when you make mistakes ?
Well , bad things can happen ( e.g. you can become the subject of Internet mockery or bad memes ) .
There are , in fact , some unfortunate examples of domain names gone wrong .
Do n’t let the same thing happen to you !
Make sure you give your domain name careful thought before you register it .
By the way , if you ’re going to register a name , try one of the services in our list of our favorite web hosts for online business or this list of cheap web hosting services .
So where does this lead us ?
While this stuff can come across as pretty juvenile , there are lessons to be learned .
There ’s this list ( rehashed below , please read on ) that has been making the rounds of the net with the designation of “ unintentionally worst company URLs or worst URL flops ” but I cannot believe that the troublesome connotation of these names was truly lost to the owners .
So I must ask : are these company URLs for real ?
Really now .
Plus what ’s so hard about changing your name ?
I just did it twice in 3 months so there ’s nothing to it .
Well allow me to clarify : if you ’ve got nothing to lose , then it ’s fine and dandy to change your name .
But you need to do it right away .
When it comes to doing anything online , it ’s pretty important not to make too many mistakes as you can suffer a hit to traffic , revenue or reputation if you do n’t fix your problems right away .
So if you can , then make those changes quickly !
But be prepared to suffer the consequences of long term mistakes if you decide to ignore them .
But what if you come across a website with a weird name but it turns out that it ’s done on purpose ?
So who wants to bet the people behind the following web sites just have a wicked sense of humor or were just ready to try some risque marketing schemes ?
Granted , there are some sites that are no longer there , but for those who have persisted , why would they keep any of these URLs knowing now what brouhaha they ’ve generated ?
4 reasons :
Inertia : too late , too much trouble to change anything , why bother
too late , too much trouble to change anything , why bother Principle : all those people out there just have dirty minds ; it ’s their problem not ours
all those people out there just have dirty minds ; it ’s their problem not ours Controversy :
It ’s an intentional marketing scheme to rile people up and keep them coming , though can you really snare targeted traffic this way ?
Perhaps by casting a wider net ?
It ’s an intentional marketing scheme to rile people up and keep them coming , though can you really snare targeted traffic this way ?
Perhaps by casting a wider net ?
Silver Lining :
It was an honest mistake but the attention and traffic received from all the hype are just too compelling
With that , here is the list in all its glory plus some contributions I ’ve incorporated :
1 . Are you a celebrity or want to be one ?
Maybe you need an agent , lawyer , manager or publicist !
Should you check out Who Represents to help you find an agent ?
Their website is at www.whorepresents.com!
2. Experts Exchange is a resource and destination for programmers who are looking to swap tech information and generate helpful discussion .
Unfortunately , www.expertsexchange.com no longer exists !
3 . Are you shopping for a pen ?
Well then stop by Pen Island for some cool products .
Hmmm …. where is that again ?
It ’s at www.penisland.net.
Wait , uh , this site is now defunct .
Oh well .
4 . Do you need to see a therapist ?
Did you know you can find one online ?
Then check out Therapist Finder at www.therapistfinder.com.
5 . And what about the Italian Power Generator company called www.powergenitalia.com?
These days , an unexciting “ under construction ” page is up .
6 . Then there ’s the Mole Station Native Nursery that ’s located in New South Wales .
www.molestationnursery.com is a redirect now .
7 . If you want to shop for computer software , you can visit www.ipanywhere.com.
Get it ?! 🙂
8 . And what about First Cumming Methodist Church for the faithful .
You ’ll find them at www.cummingfirst.com.
9 . There ’s a site by art designers that has the interesting name : www.speedofart.com.
10 . I love Lake Tahoe !
So to do some research on this awesome vacation locale , I should check out the aptly named website : www.gotahoe.com.
I picked up that rather funny list from various sources including IndependentSources.com .
As I was on a roll , here are more word derivations that I came across and checked out !
11 . Another art site , but this ca n’t be anything but deliberate !
Here it is : www.scentofart.com.
12 . You can find some therapist help over at www.therapisthelp.com.
13 . So I found an alternative to the defunct www.penisland.net.
But it ’s a t - shirt company definitely capitalizing on the notoriety of the original site .
They are hawking pens and t- shirts , but so far only shirts are available .
I wonder why .
www.thepenisland.com
And here ’s a BONUS .
My awesome young bro -in - law ’s decided to get into the eyebrow raising URL business too and he ’s got a strongly worded blog called Flowjob.com , intentionally named that way of course .
He really is nothing like he sounds in it .
Now I was going to hunt for more funky names but then you might think I just have way too much time in my hands .

IN 1995 , Malibu producer Joan Borsten and her husband , the Russian - born actor Oleg Vidov , were poring over a library of animated films produced at Moscow ’s Soyuzmultfilm Studio when they discovered buried among the children ’s classics other films that caught their attention .
These were no Disney - like fairy tales or Russian folk stories .
Instead , these animated short films intended for the Soviet masses painted a sinister portrait of life in capitalist America .

Soviet - era animation :
An article in the Feb .
4 Calendar about a DVD anthology , “ Animated Soviet Propaganda , ” said that famous Russian animator Boris Yefimov , who was interviewed by the anthology ’s producers , had died .
Yefimov , who turned 106 in September , is alive .
“ Black and White , ” produced in 1933 , depicted a highway with an endless row of blacks lynched on telephone poles .
“ The Millionaire , ” made in 1963 , told the story of a rich American woman who leaves $ 1 million to her pet bulldog , who becomes so wealthy and powerful that he eventually is elected to Congress .
And in the 1979 animated short “ Shooting Range , ” a jobless American youth finds work in a carnival shooting gallery only to discover the evil , greedy owner is now charging double -- for people to use the youth as target practice .
These films , rarely seen in the West , are among several dozen included in a four - disc DVD anthology titled “ Animated Soviet Propaganda ” that is being distributed by Kino International and Films by Jove .
The collection retails for $ 89 .

The anthology is divided into categories titled “ American Imperialists , ” “ Fascist Barbarians , ” “ Capitalist Sharks ” and “ Onward to the Shining Future : Communism . ”
The DVDs include interviews with Russian film school professors , directors and animators , including famed animator Boris Yefimov , who was 101 and died two years after being interviewed .
The earliest film in the collection is “ Soviet Toys , ” made in 1924 ; the last is “ History of the Toy , ” an anti-fascist film made six decades later .
Borsten is president of Films by Jove , which acquired worldwide distribution rights to many of the Moscow studio ’s animation library .
“ After the Bolshevik Revolution , about 200,000 [ Communist ] party members inherited a land mass of mostly illiterate people , ” said Borsten .
“ Lenin said film was the best media for propaganda .
Within the film genre , animation was by far the easiest way to say what was bad and what was good . ”

Joseph Stalin , who succeeded Lenin , ordered the building of the state - run animation studio after becoming enamored with a Walt Disney film festival held in Moscow .
But while many of the films produced at the studio beginning in 1936 were based on European and Russian folk tales , some were blatant political propaganda designed to show America and the West in the worst possible light .
New Russian Word , a Russian - language daily published in New York , said in a recent article that one can’t help but chuckle at the 1949 animated short “ Someone Else ’s Voice , ” in which “ Russian traditionalist nightingales hiss and boo ” an “ obnoxious magpie who returns from the West having learnt to sing jazz while on vacation . ”
“ In 1936 , most animation were films for children , ” Borsten said .
“ But while the studio was making beautiful films for children , it was also making propaganda for adults and children . ”
Over the decades , the depiction of capitalists in Soviet animation rarely changed .
Advertisement
They were shown as greedy , racist , cigar - chomping fat cats bent on exploiting the noble worker .
That characterization did n’t change even with liberalization of communist rule .
“ After perestroika , ” Borsten noted , “ Americans who came to Russia to invest were still being called ‘ capitalist sharks . ’ ”
Some of the early works in the collection were produced by Bolshevik collectives ; later works were produced at the Soviet animation studio .
But all of them serve to point out what the Russian people were subjected to during the years of Communist totalitarianism .
Vidov believes the animated propaganda films that he grew up with kept Soviet citizens wary about life outside their borders .
People inside the Soviet Union came to believe that America was a scary place , where there was high unemployment , blacks were routinely beaten , and capitalists had bags of money and were free to abuse those who had less .

“ It was a war between socialism and capitalism , ” Vidov said .
“ Now , there are rich and poor in Russia .
So , now , I do n’t think anybody is talking about it . ”

Police used powerful long - range zoom cameras to keep tabs on Fourth of July celebrations in Orlando on Wednesday , as authorities tightened up security around the country for Independence Day .
The Orlando cops set up seven cameras around Lake Eola , a popular downtown park and monitored " every angle " of the goings - on .
Even from across the lake , the cameras – which one Iraq war veteran present said resembled military equipment – were able to zoom in tight on suspicious faces , a local news channel reported .
Of course , it must be noted that , when it comes to lakes , Lake Eola is a rather diminutive body of water , less than a 1 / 2 mile at its widest .

Damn , it 's amazing how the wingers will just make shit up to keep their own little fake world intact .
In this edition , Sen. Orrin Hatch and Rush Limbaugh claim that fired US Attorney Carol Lam was 1 ) just a law professor with 2 ) no prosecutorial assistance , 3 ) appointed by President Clinton , because 4 ) she was Bill 's former campaign manager in Southern California .
The only problem is that 1 ) Lam was never a law professor , 2 ) had 15 years of prosecutorial assistance , 3 ) was appointed by Bush and 4 ) never worked as a campaign manager .
But what 's a little lying if it helps smear someone ( even if she is a Republican ) who would dare question Dear Leader .
2. Einstein's Brain .
Before he died , über - genius Albert Einstein considered donating his body to science .
Unfortunately , he never put his wishes in writing .
When he passed away in 1955 , Einstein 's family and friends made plans to cremate him , but the pathologist who performed the autopsy , Dr. Thomas Harvey , had a different idea .
Instead , he opted to remove the math man 's brain and then tell the family about it .
For 30 - some years , Harvey had Al 's gray matter tucked away in his Wichita home in two Mason jars .
Naturally , Einstein 's loved ones were n't thrilled when they found out , but they eventually allowed the misappropriated mind to be sliced into 240 sections and disbursed to researchers for examination .
Today , many of the cerebral sections remain in scientific institutions , with the bulk held at Princeton Hospital .
As for Einstein 's body , that was cremated and scattered in a secret location .
DIGG THIS
What a week !
The stock market took a dive to just over 13,000 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from an all - time high of 14,000 less than a month ago .
The worlds major central banks flooded the financial system with tens of billions of dollars to prop up the banks and the mortgage market .
Meanwhile , the unending wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue to drain the U.S. military ; the bills for the Bush - Cheney invasion of two nations that did not attack us or threaten to attack us are rocketing to the one trillion dollar mark .
In other words , we are witnessing the unfolding of the collapse of the welfare warfare fiat - money complex that has ruled America since 1913 , the year the Federal Reserve was created and the Sixteenth Amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution allowing the federal government to impose an income tax on the American people .
Of all the GOP and Democrat presidential candidates , only Representative Ron Paul of Texas has been diagnosing correctly the shortcomings of the welfare warfare fiat - money state .
In fact , last Friday on Larry Kudlows CNBC show Dr. Paul demonstrated once again why he is the only presidential candidate who understands how the Federal Reserve creates financial bubbles that always end in pain and suffering , especially for low and middle income Americans .
Economist Murray Rothbard identified the losers in the inflation race :
Inflation redistributes the wealth in favor of the first - comers and at the expense of the laggards in the race .
And inflation is , in effect , a race  to see who can get the new money earliest .
The latecomers  the ones stuck with the loss  are often called the " fixed income groups . "
Ministers , teachers , people on salaries , lag notoriously behind other groups in acquiring the new money .
Particular sufferers will be those depending on fixed money contracts  contracts made in the days before the inflationary rise in prices .
Life insurance beneficiaries and annuitants , retired persons living off pensions , landlords with long term leases , bondholders and other creditors , those holding cash , all will bear the brunt of the inflation .
They will be the ones who are " taxed . "
And who are the winners ?
Wall Street banks , real estate speculators and others who are the initial recipients of easy money .
So , if we want to end the boom and bust cycle we need to restore sound money  gold and silver as the foundation of our monetary system , as prescribed the U.S. Constitution .
At the very least , the FED should stop creating money out of thin air .
But stopping the inflating of the nations currency would not sit well with the Wall Street crowd , because they are the prime beneficiaries of easy money .
In other words , halting inflation would drop real estate prices in the Hamptons , Aspen and other locations where the beneficiaries of inflation have bid up the price of houses and condos .
And forget about those end - of - year bonuses .
Under a sound monetary system , speculating in currency and other markets would be greatly diminished .
As a student of the Austrian School of Economics , Dr. Paul is familiar with the contributions of Ludwig von Mises , Murray Rothbard , Henry Hazlitt and dozens of others who advocated free markets and sound money .
Professor Mises spent his long academic career warning about the dangers of inflation , the printing of money by central bankers .
Professor Mises long ago showed the relationship between war and inflation , a point Rep .
Paul has reiterated throughout his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination .
 Inflationism , however , is not an isolated phenomenon .
It is only one piece in the total framework of politico - economic and socio- philosophical ideas of our time .
Just as the sound money policy of gold standard advocates went hand in hand with liberalism , free trade , capitalism and peace , so is inflationism part and parcel of imperialism , militarism , protectionism , statism and socialism . 
Mises used liberalism in its original meaning : limited government , low taxes , and free trade .
The term has been hijacked in the 20th century by the proponents of big government .
War , credit bubbles , runaway government spending , a bankrupt entitlement system , are the result of big government liberalism and neo-conservatism .
Last Saturday , Rep .
Paul clearly and passionately spoke the truth about these issues at the Iowa Straw poll conference center .
Coming in fifth place with just under 10 percent of the vote is a great achievement in his long - shot campaign for the GOP presidential nomination .
Once GOP voters realize where inflation and war are taking the country , they will rally around Ron Paul , the only candidate for peace , freedom and prosperity .

The Best of Murray Sabrin
‘ If he ’s so smart , how come you lost Congress ? ’
When the president and Karl Rove delivered brief statements at the White House yesterday , reporters were not allowed to ask questions .
One spoke up anyway .
As Karl Rove embraced President Bush today following an emotional farewell announcement on the South Lawn , the solemnity of the moment was shattered by Bill Plante of CBS , who bellowed to Bush : “ If he ’s so smart , how come you lost Congress ? ”
Now , I consider myself a fairly polite guy , and if the president had just made a statement regarding something truly solemn — about , for example , war casualties — I can understand reporters showing some restraint .
Under truly somber circumstances , the press corps almost certainly should n’t shout cheeky questions .
But Karl Rove is a controversial , nearly - indicted , currently - subpoenaed political advisor .
His departure is not “ solemn . ”
The White House seems to have trained much of the press corps not to disrupt the president ’s preferred media dynamic — reporters are to spoken to , not heard from — but why should they play along ?
What ’s so awful about Plante trying to get a response from officials after public remarks at the White House ?
Reader D.K. alerted me to this CBS News piece today , in which Plante talked about why he asked the question — and the kind of response he got .
As the President and Karl Rove walked away from the lectern after their emotional announcement of Rove ’s resignation , I yelled a question : “ If he ’s so smart , why did you lose Congress ? ”
The President , as usual , did n’t answer .
That ’s OK – he does n’t have to if he does n’t want to .
But judging by some of the reaction , you ’d think I had been shouting obscenities in church !
“ Unprofessional ; ” “ Inappropriate ; ” “ Unbecoming ; ” “ Does n’t show much class ; ” “ you are a total idiot ; ” “ Shill for the liberal Democrats . ”
Apparently it ’s now considered disrespectful for a reporter to ask the president confrontational questions at the White House .
This is silly .
I like good manners as much as the next guy , and I do n’t want to see our public discourse coarsened , but this notion that the White House press corps has to treat Bush and Rove with kid gloves , and with excessive deference , is misguided .
Plante explained and defended his conduct .
There was no time to frame that question because the event this morning was a statement , not a news conference .
So I asked a more direct one .
I thought it unlikely that they would answer , but it ’s always worth a try .
Yes , it is .
If they do n’t answer , they do n’t answer .
A journalist ought to try , right ?
Plante , a veteran reporter , does not appear to be tarnished by partisanship .
Twenty years ago , he shouted a question at Reagan as he left the Rose Garden after the annual Teacher of the Year ceremony .
Ten years ago , he shouted a question at Clinton after an event ( which , in turn , led a red - faced president to respond angrily ) .
The point is that reporters are not [ at the White House ] as guests .
We ’re here to ask questions .
Why ?
Because if we were ever to agree to “ behave , ” we ’d be walking away from our First Amendment role — and then we really would be the shills we ’re so often accused of being .
Sounds right to me .
Polarization , however , is Karl Rove ’s specialty .
He united his own base on one side — and united his opponents on the other .
Al Gore and John Kerry each won 48 percent , the best back - to - back performance by a losing party since the 19th century .
Play - to - the - base politics can be a smart strategy — so long as your base is larger than your opponents ’ .
But it has been apparent for many years that the Democratic base is growing faster than the Republican base .
The numbers of the unmarried and the non-churchgoing are growing faster than the numbers of married and church - going Americans .
The nonwhite and immigrant population is growing at a faster rate than that of white native - borns .
The Democrats are the party of the top and bottom of American society ; the Republicans do best in the great American middle , which is losing ground .
Mr. Rove often reminded me of a miner extracting the last nuggets from an exhausted seam .
His attempts to prospect a new motherlode have led the Republican party into the immigration debacle .
In my brief service as a speechwriter inside the Bush administration , I often wondered why it was that skeptical experts on issues like immigration could never get even a hearing for their point of view .
We took the self - evident brilliance of our plans so much for granted that we would not even meet , for example , with conservative academics who had the facts and figures to demonstrate the illusion of Rovian hopes for a breakthrough among Hispanic voters .
We were so mesmerized by the specious analogies between 1996 and 1896 that we forgot that analogies are literary devices , not evidence .
In 2006 , Republicans and conservatives paid the price for this we - know - best attitude .
I fear that we will pay an even higher price in 2008 .
Building coalitions is essential to political success .
But it is not the same thing as political success .
The point of politics is to elect governments , and political organizations are ultimately judged by the quality of government they deliver .
Paradoxically , the antigovernment conservatives of the 1980s took the problems of government far more seriously than the pro-government conservatives of the 2000s .
The outlook is not , however , entirely bleak for Republicans .
I notice that much of the Democratic party , and especially its activist netroots , has decided that the way to beat Rove Republicanism is by emulating it .
They are practicing the politics of polarization ; they are elevating “ framing ” above policy ; they have decided that winning the next election by any means is all that matters — and never mind what happens on the day after that .
If they follow this path , they should not be surprised when they discover that it leads to the same destination .
The Washington Post reports today that to date , only two of the Republican presidential candidates have agreed to participate in CNN - and - YouTube ’s - hosted September 17 presidential debate .
What a surprise .
The Republicans candidates , even by the admission of experts on their side have so far shown that they ’re not entirely comfortable with the populism and technology of Web - enabled political discourse .
But I believe the issue goes deeper than that .
Most of the Republican candidates have supported President Bush ’s approach to the war in Iraq — but the polls show that most Americans now oppose the war and Bush ’s decision to increase the number of troops there .
Thus it does n’t seem like a great idea for the candidates to potentially expose themselves to graphic and heart - rending videos from soldiers ’ relatives and others who are likely to ask very difficult questions that would cast an extremely negative light on the candidates ’ policy positions .
The Post article notes that so far , only John McCain and Ron Paul have agreed to participate in the debate .
McCain has obviously vigorously stood up for what he believes in and has n’t been shy about his position on the war , and Paul opposes it .
So again , it comes as no surprise that they ’d agree to participate .
The Post article also notes that the leading Republican candidate New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is n’t likely to agree to participate in the September debate .
Again , this is n’t surprising .
I lived in New York when Giuliani was mayor , and he ’s not exactly a touchy - feely guy who responds well to other people ’s opinions and feelings , which is what a lot of the YouTube election is about — how voters feel and demonstrate those feelings on video about the issues .
Yet , these candidates could be making a serious mistake .
Ratings data show that the CNN / YouTube debate received the highest viewership level for the demographic between 18 and 34 since measurement level began in 1992 for a cable news debate .
Research released earlier this year by Harvard ’s Institute for Politics found that — galvanized by the war — this age group showed up at the polls in 2004 at extremely high levels .
As Carl Cannon , a writer for the inside - the - Beltway publication National Journal noted in a May edition of the magazine , " These young people are so little understood that many of the 2006 congressional campaigns ignored them utterly , although the candidates who did paid a price for their inattention . "
Update :
There ’s now a petition to get the Republicans to change their minds .
Also , consultant David All has an emotional response to the news .
And TechPresident has some interesting YouTube user stats that might persuade the candidates .
This is the second leg on the Road to Ruby enlightenment .
It started with tutorials and first steps .
Ruby - talk
From ruby - lang.org I followed some links to the Ruby FAQ .
Like the tutorials I read , the FAQ itself answered only questions regarding the language Ruby but lacked information about ‘ good style ’ or ‘ the Ruby Way ’ .
But the FAQ pointed me to the Ruby Talk Mailinglist .
A few minutes later I was subscribed and messages started to come in [ 1 ] .
There are just too many good posts to single out just a few .
The mailing list archive ( sorry ) sucks , but fortunately the list is replicated via a ML - NetNews gateway with comp.lang.ruby which makes it possible to search for old posts via groups.google.com etc .
Ruby Quiz
After some time I noticed these strange posts to ruby - talk which had a [ QUIZ ] in the subject .
I found the answer on rubyquiz.com :
What Is Ruby Quiz ?
Ruby Quiz is a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers in the spirit of the Perl Quiz of the Week .
A new Ruby Quiz is sent to the Ruby Talk mailing list each Friday .
( Watch for the [ QUIZ ] subject identifier . )
After a 48 hour no -spoiler period has passed , everyone is invited to contribute solutions and / or discussion back to the list .
The following Thursday a Summary will be sent to the list , discussing the quiz , solutions and discussion .
The next day , the cycle begins again .
The quiz is run by James Edward Gray II , who collects the solutions and writes a summary .
A collection of quiz questions and solutions can be found on rubyquiz.com .
My favorites :
PLEAC – Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook
Another link I found via the FAQ was PLEAC - Ruby , a cookbook with a huge number of code samples .
BTW , the PLEAC Project has cookbooks for other languages , too .
Most of the examples were pretty obvious , but I recommend browsing through
Arrays and Hashes , just to see more examples on what to do with them
Patternmatching if you ca n’t remember all the regex magic
Packages etc. and Classes etc .
But like most of the documentation found online , it was more about code and less about style .
Check back later , there is still more to come
[ 1 ] I read my share of mailinglists , but ruby - talk is the only list with such a high volume which still has a low rate of flamewars , bashing , etc .
Keep it up guys , even though I do n’t write much , I really like reading this list .
Senate Judiciary Chairman subpoenas Karl Rove Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 26 , 2007 Print This Email This Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy announced Thursday he had subpoenaed White House adviser Karl Rove and his deputy .
He accused them of stonewalling a widening probe into the firing of federal prosecutors .
" The Bush - Cheney White House continues to place great strains on our constitutional system of checks and balances , " Leahy said in issuing the subpoenas .
" Not since the darkest days of the Nixon Administration have we seen efforts to corrupt federal law enforcement for partisan political gain and such efforts to avoid accountability . "
The Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas to Rove and Deputy White House political director J. Scott Jennings .
The deadline for testimony and documents is Aug. 2 at 10 a.m .
" We have now reached a point where the accumulated evidence shows that political considerations factored into the unprecedented firing of at least nine United States Attorneys last year , " Leahy said , according to The Associated Press .
In a letter to Rove , Leahy lamented that the subpoena he issued was a last resort .
" I have issued this subpoena after exhausting every avenue for voluntary cooperation from you and the White House , " Leahy wrote .
" I hope that the White House takes this opportunity to reconsider its blanket claim of executive privilege , especially in light of the testimony that the President was not involved in the dismissals of these U.S. Attorneys .
I am left to ask what the White House is so intent on hiding that it cannot even identify the documents , the dates , the authors and recipients that they claim are privileged . "
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee also called for a special prosecutor to investigate whether Attorney General Alberto Gonzales lied under oath when he testified before Congress .
" It has become apparent that the attorney general has provided at a minimum half - truths and misleading statements , " four members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote in a letter to Solicitor General Paul Clement .
Sen . Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , has not yet weighed in on the Rove subpoenas , and is expected to speak at a press conference Thursday afternoon .
E-mails released by the Justice Department have shown Rove was involved in discussions over the firing of US Attorneys .
Nine attorneys were dismissed or resigned abruptly last year , and Democrats argue they were dismissed for political reasons .
The White House quickly defended its political brain - trust , accusing Democrats of partisanship in their pursuit of information about the US Attorneys ' dismissal .
" Every day congressional Democrats prove that they 're more interested in headlines than doing the business Americans want them to do , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto told the AP .
" And Americans are now taking notice that this Congress , under Democratic leadership , is failing to tackle important issues . "
But Leahy said the investigation and subpoenas were necessary to maintain transparent , balanced government . " [ A ] n ever - growing series of controversies and scandals have revealed an Administration driven by a vision of an all - power Executive over our constitutional system of checks and balances , one that values loyalty over judgment , secrecy over openness , and ideology over competence , " Leahy said .
The Judiciary Committee earlier this year heard limited testimony from former Rove aide Sara Taylor , who cited President Bush 's executive privilege in refusing to answer some questions .
Former White House counsel Harriet Miers is facing contempt of Congress charges authorized by the House Judiciary Committee after refusing to appear when it subpoenaed her earlier this month .
In his letter to Rove , Leahy outlined the evidence of White House involvement in the US Attorney scandal .
E-mails obtained by the Judiciary Committee show Rove was interested in sacking US Attorneys as early as 2005 and that he raised political considerations in advancing the dismissal of New Mexico US Attorney David Iglesias , Leahy says .
The letter also contends that Rove tried to encourage the Justice Department to pursue voter fraud cases in the run-up to elections .
Such cases are against Justice Department policy because they can influence election results by disenfranchising voters .
" The evidence of untoward White House interference with federal law enforcement threatens our elections and has seriously undercut the American peoples confidence in the independence and evenhandedness of law enforcement , " Leahy wrote .
Britain's most senior generals have issued a blunt warning to Downing Street that the military campaign in Afghanistan is facing a catastrophic failure , a development that could lead to an Islamist government seizing power in neighbouring Pakistan .
Amid fears that London and Washington are taking their eye off Afghanistan as they grapple with Iraq , the generals have told Number 10 that the collapse of the government in Afghanistan , headed by Hamid Karzai , would present a grave threat to the security of Britain .
Lord Inge , the former chief of the defence staff , highlighted their fears in public last week when he warned of a ' strategic failure ' in Afghanistan .
The Observer understands that Inge was speaking with the direct authority of the general staff when he made an intervention in a House of Lords debate .
' The situation in Afghanistan is much worse than many people recognise , ' Inge told peers .
' We need to face up to that issue , the consequence of strategic failure in Afghanistan and what that would mean for Nato ...
We need to recognise that the situation - in my view , and I have recently been in Afghanistan - is much , much more serious than people want to recognise . '
Inge 's remarks reflect the fears of serving generals that the government is so overwhelmed by Iraq that it is in danger of losing sight of the threat of failure in Afghanistan .
One source , who is familiar with the fears of the senior officers , told The Observer : ' If you talk privately to the generals they are very very worried .
You heard it in Inge 's speech .
Inge said we are failing and remember Inge speaks for the generals . '
Inge made a point in the Lords of endorsing a speech by Lord Ashdown , the former Liberal Democrat leader , who painted a bleak picture during the debate .
Ashdown told The Observer that Afghanistan presented a graver threat than Iraq .
' The consequences of failure in Afghanistan are far greater than in Iraq , ' he said .
' If we fail in Afghanistan then Pakistan goes down .
The security problems for Britain would be massively multiplied .
I think you could not then stop a widening regional war that would start off in warlordism but it would become essentially a war in the end between Sunni and Shia right across the Middle East . '
' Mao Zedong used to refer to the First and Second World Wars as the European civil wars .
You can have a regional civil war .
That is what you might begin to see .
It will be catastrophic for Nato .
The damage done to Nato in Afghanistan would be as great as the damage done to the UN in Bosnia .
That could have a severe impact on the Atlantic relationship and maybe even damage the American security guarantee for Europe . '
Ashdown said two mistakes were being made : a lack of a co-ordinated military command because of the multinational ' hearts and minds '
Nato campaign and the US - led Operation Enduring Freedom offensive campaign against the Taliban .
There was also insufficient civic support on , for example , providing clean water .
Ashdown warned : ' Unless we put this right , unless we have a unitary system of command , we are going to lose .
The battle for this is the battle of public opinion .
The polls are slipping .
Once they go on the slide it is almost impossible to win it back .
You can only do it with the support of the local population .
' There is a very short shelf life for an occupation force .
Once that begins to shift against you it is very very difficult to turn it round . '
The warnings from Ashdown and the generals on Afghanistan will be echoed in a report this week by the all - party Commons defence select committee .
MPs will say that the combination of civilian casualties , war damage and US - led efforts to eradicate lucrative poppy crops risk turning ordinary people towards the Taliban .
Stepped - up reconstruction efforts are essential , the MPs will suggest , in order to ensure local residents understand the longer - term aim of the British - led Nato mission - a point echoed , during the committee hearings on Afghanistan earlier this year , by returning British commander General David Richards .
The report is also expected to criticise some Nato members for failing to provide sufficient troops or other support for the Afghan mission .
Adam Holloway , a Tory member of the committee who is a former Grenadier Guards officer , said : ' We are getting to the point where it will be irretrievable .
That 's where we are now .
We are in danger of a second strategic failure [ after Iraq ] , which we cannot afford . '

What is jihad ?
Jihad is a subject that non-Muslims find difficult to understand .
In fact , there is nothing particularly outlandish about it .
All one has to remember is that holy war is not the opposite of pacifism , but rather of secular war - fighting in pursuit of aims lying outside religion .
Whether people are militant or not in its pursuit is another matter .
With that general observation , let me pose the four questions to be addressed in this essay .
They are :
exactly what is jihad , apart from holy war in a broad sense ?
is it true that Islam was spread by force ?
did the pre-modern Muslims ever feel that there was anything wrong about religious warfare ?
what is the relevance of all this to the world today ?
( I must stress that when I get to the fourth topic , I am no longer speaking as a specialist ) .
Patricia Crone is professor of Islamic history at the Institute for Advanced Study , Princeton .
Her recent work includes Medieval Islamic Political Thought ( Edinburgh University Press , 2004 ) published in the United States as God 's Rule : Government and Islam ( Columbia University Press , 2004 )
Also by Patricia Crone in openDemocracy :
 What do we actually know about Mohammed ? 
( 31 August 2006 )
So first , just what is jihad ?
Well , actually there are two kinds , depending on whether the Muslims are politically strong or weak .
I shall start with the type associated with political strength , because that 's the normal type in Islamic history .
I shall get to the second in connection with the question of modern relevance .
The normal type of jihad is missionary warfare .
That 's how you 'll find it described in the classical law - books , from about 800 to about 1800 .
What the Quran has to say on the subject is a different question : the rules it presupposes seem to be a good deal more pacifist than those developed by the jurists and exegetes .
But it is the work of the latter which came to form the sharia - the huge mass of precepts on which the public and private lives of Muslims were based ( at least in theory ) , down to the coming of modernity , which still regulates their devotional lives today , and on which Islamists ( or " fundamentalists " ) would like once more to base the entire arena of public life .
The scholars said that jihad consisted in backing the call to Islam with violence , where necessary .
It was " the forcible mission assisted by the unsheathed sword against wrongheaded people who arrogantly refuse to accept the plain truth after it has become clear " : thus a scholar who died in 1085 .
The idea was that God was the only ruler of the universe .
Humans who refused to acknowledge this were in the nature of rebels , who had to be brought to heel .
At the very least , they had to submit to God politically , by being brought under Muslim government .
But ideally , they would submit to him in religious terms as well , by converting .
Holy warriors worked by making regular incursions into the lands of the infidels order to call them to Islam .
Normally , they would do so as part of an official expedition launched by the state , but they might also operate on their own .
In any case , if the infidels did n't want to convert , they could just surrender politically ( at least if they were Christians and Jews ) .
In that case they were placed under Muslim government , but kept their own religion in return for the payment of poll - tax .
But if they refused both religious and political surrender , they should be fought until they were defeated .
The terms were in that case set by the conquerors , who might kill the men and enslave the women and children ( or so at least if they were pagans ) ; or they might treat them as if they had surrendered voluntarily .
Once an infidel community had been subdued politically , one moved on to the next lot of infidels and did the same to them .
This had to go on until the whole earth was God 's or the world came to an end , whichever would be the sooner .
Missionary warfare was a duty imposed by God on the Muslim community , not on individuals , and it was discharged primarily by the ruler , who 'd typically mount one expedition into infidel territory a year , if he had infidel neighbours .
But it was highly meritorious for private individuals to go and fight as well , and there were always volunteers on the borders .
If you could n't go yourself , you could earn merit by donating money or giving gifts to the cause , like people in 19th - century Europe would make donations in support of the missionaries working in distant countries .
The way that ordinary Muslims thought of jihad in the past can be compared to Christians ' attitude towards those of their co-religionists who chose to become missionaries .
Nowadays the latter are often regarded as interfering busybodies , but formerly they were admired for their willingness to devote their lives to the salvation of benighted natives .
That 's the attitude that prevailed in jihad : it was an extremely noble enterprise .
After all , people risked their own lives for it .
It was the height of altruism .
The Christian missionaries did not themselves fight ; they merely followed in the wake of soldiers .
But a holy warrior was a missionary and a soldier all in one .
He was engaged in something that modern observers would call religious imperialism .
That 's an institution with very long roots in the middle east .
Ancient near - eastern historians call it warfare at the command of a god , and the star example is the Assyrians .
Their god Ashshur endlessly told them to go and conquer .
The god of the Israelites was of the same type .
" I have given into your hands Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land .
Begin to possess it and fight him in battle " , he says to Moses in Deuteronomy , where Moses reports that " We took all his cities and utterly destroyed the men , the women and the little ones " .
In the same vein a Moabite king says in an inscription that " Kamosh ( the deity ) spoke to me and said , Go and take Nebo from Israel .
So I went and fought it ... and took it and killed everybody , 7,000 men , boys , women , girls and slave girls " .
The Muslim God also told his people to conquer , but with one big difference in classical thought , namely that he wanted the victims to convert .
The Assyrians , the Israelites and the Moabites did n't pretend to be doing anything for the good of the victims .
They fought for the greater glory of their own god , and their own community , not to save anyone else .
The same seems to have been true of the early Arab conquerors .
But in classical Islam , the divine command to go and fight is no longer addressed to an ethnic group , only to believers , whoever they may be ; and it is now linked to a religious mission civilisatrice : the believers conquer in order to save souls , not ( or not just ) to glorify their own community .
It is this fusion of religious and political imperialism that makes classical jihad distinctive , for the two do n't usually go together .
The great universalist religions were apolitical and spread by peaceful proselytisation : thus Buddhism , Christianity , and Manichaeism , and also Bahai'ism .
And universalist conquerors are not usually out to save people 's souls : think of Alexander the Great , the Romans , or the Mongols .
But in Islam , religious mission and world conquest have married up .

Was Islam spread by force ?
The second question posed at the start of this essay was : is it true that Islam was spread by force ?
The answer is , in one sense , yes , but even this needs careful qualification .
Warfare did play a major role both in the rise of Islam and its later diffusion .
But some places were Islamised without any war at all , notably Malaysia and Indonesia .
Above all , even where Islam was spread by jihad , it was not usually done the way people imagine .
People usually think of holy warriors as engaging in something like Charlemagne 's forced conversion of the Saxons , war for the extirpation of wrong beliefs throughout an entire community .
But that model is very rare in Islamic history .
The effect of war was usually more indirect .
The scholars said that all infidels had to be brought under Muslim sovereignty , but that Jews and Christians acknowledged the true God and had a revelation from him , so they could be allowed to exist under Muslim protection in return for paying poll - tax .
All other infidels were pagans , so how were they to be treated ?
There is general agreement that the Arabs of Mohammed 's Arabia got the choice between Islam and the sword , and that they did so because they had no religion , as one early scholar put it .
( Paganism did n't count as one . )
That 's the best example there is on the Muslim side of the Charlemagne model , if I may call it that , and it is a juristic schematisation of history rather than rather than historical reporting .
Some jurists insisted that this was how all pagans should be treated : people who did not acknowledge the sole sovereignty of God had no right to exist .
Others said that for one reason or another , the Arabs were exceptional : all other pagans could be granted protection in return for paying poll - tax in the same way as the Jews and the Christians .
This disagreement was enshrined in Muslim law , and modern Islamists typically go for the first view , equating pagans with modern secularists and atheists ( among them is an associate of Yusuf al - Qaradawi , lionised in Europe by some of the very secularists whom his associate would force to convert ) .
In pre-modern practice , tolerance usually prevailed as far as conquered communities were concerned .
The only infidels who could not be allowed to exist in either theory or practice were apostates - who have become a highly sensitive issue today .
But if people were allowed to keep their religion under Muslim rule , how could the jurists define jihad as missionary warfare ?
How was it different from other forms of imperialism , such as the Crusades ( which were fought for the recovery of the holy land , not the conversion of the Muslims ) or secular expansionism ?
The answer is that in effect jihad just was ordinary imperialism , but it was undertaken , or at least justified , on the grounds that it would result in conversion , if not straightaway , then sooner or later - and it usually did so too , in a number of ways .
For a start , the Muslims routinely took a lot of captives .
Male captives were often given the choice between Islam and death , or they might recite the Muslim profession of faith of their own accord to avoid execution .
More importantly , captives were usually sold off as slaves , and slaves almost always ended up by converting because most slavery was domestic .
And above all , back in the conquered area , Muslim rulers would move in along with judges and religious scholars to build mosques , apply Islamic law , place restrictions on the building of non-Muslim houses of worship and introduce other discriminatory measures so that the original inhabitants were reduced to tributaries in their own land .
They were not necessarily persecuted .
The Muslim record of tolerance is generally good .
( Obviously , there are plenty of examples of persecution of one kind or another ; that religious minorities generally speaking did better under Muslim than under Christian rule under pre-modern conditions nonetheless remains true , however hackneyed the claim has become . )
But the non-Muslims would soon have a sense that history was passing them by , that all the action was elsewhere , and this would translate into a feeling that their own beliefs were outmoded .
So they would convert too , and that 's the method that really mattered .
In sum , jihad typically spread Islam in much the same way that 19th - century European imperialism spread western culture ( and / or Christianity ) : nobody was directly forced to accept western modernity , or Christianity , but by moving in as the politically dominant elite , the imperialists gave their own beliefs and institutions a persuasiveness that made them difficult to resist .
Medieval Muslim scholars were well aware of this effect , and unlike their modern successors , they never tried to deny the role of war in the expansion of Islam .

Muslims , morality , and religious warfare
That brings me to the third question : did the pre-modern Muslims never worry about the moral status of religious warfare ?
The answer is mostly no , but sometimes yes .
The scholars insisted that the warriors had to fight with the right intentions , for God , not for booty .
They also debated whether it was right to conduct holy war under a wrongful ruler ( the Sunni answer was yes ) .
But if everything was in order on the side of the warriors , the jurists were satisfied that the enterprise was in the best interests of the victims .
The conquered peoples were being dragged to Paradise in chains , as a famous saying went .
Far from feeling ashamed about their use of war , Muslims often stressed that holy war was something that only they would engage in , meaning that they were willing to do much more for their religion than other people .
They were willing to sacrifice their own lives so that others might live , as they put it .
To them , it proved that only Islam was a truly universalist religion .
But the conquered peoples , above all the Christians , always held the Muslim use of war to be wrong , and this did eventually affect the Muslims .
As early as 634 CE , a Greek tract declared that the so - called prophet must be an impostor because prophets do n't come armed with the sword .
Fifty years later a Christian patriarch supposedly told the caliph that Islam was a religion spread by the sword , meaning that therefore it could not be true .
The Christians were to harp on this theme for ever after .
In the 10th and 11th centuries , the Muslims began to mention this claim , clearly because they were upset by it .
For example , al - Amiri , an Iranian philosopher who died in 996 , takes issue with unidentified people who say that " if Islam were a religion of truth , it would be a religion of mercy , and the one who calls to it would not in that case attack people with the sword to take their property and capture and enslave their families ; rather , he would proselytise with words and guide to it by the force of his explanations " .
In other words , true religion is spread by peaceful mission ; holy war is just a religious cover for rapaciousness , whatever people might say about the purity of their intentions .
It is n't always clear in these texts whether the charges were made by Muslims or non-Muslims , but there were certainly Muslims now who felt the association of warfare and religion to be wrong .
A 10th - century religious leader by the name of Ibn Karram , for example , was said by his followers to have been worthier of prophethood than Mohammed , because he lived an ascetic life and did not conduct war .
And some Muslims ( or ex-Muslims ) rejected all established religions , not just Islam , on the grounds that all prophets , not just Mohammed , were tricksters who used religion to start wars and accumulate worldly power .
So now the concept of holy war had to be defended .
One of the most interesting defences is by this philosopher al - Amiri .
He responded by identifying jihad as defensive warfare .
That 's what many modern apologetes do , too , sometimes writing off offensive jihad - missionary warfare - as an Orientalist invention .
( Orientalism often gets used as a grand trash - can in which modern Muslims dump all the aspects of pre-modern Islam that they have come to dislike . )
Modern Muslims will even go so far as to cast the prophet 's wars and the Arab conquests as defensive , or pre-emptive , but this was more than al - Amiri could bring himself to do .
When it came to the prophet , he fell back on the altruism argument : Mohammed was not in it for material wealth or power .
This is clear from the fact that he suffered for ten years in Mecca before setting up a state in Medina ; he conquered people for their own good , not for his own sake , and the Iranians ought to be grateful to the Arabs for having destroyed the Persian empire ; not only did the Arabs bring the truth , they also freed them from for the oppressive tyranny and rigid social hierarchy that prevailed in that empire .
The Muslims came as liberators on all fronts .
Of course , al - Amiri says , Mohammed would have preferred not to use the sword at all , but since the infidels so stubbornly resisted him , he had no choice .
Al - Amiri's tone here is rather like that of the 19th - century British imperialists who felt resentment against all those uncooperative peoples whose recalcitrance had forced Britain to take them over more or less against its will , as they felt it .
They did n't like war either , but what could one do when the natives refused to see the light .
One had to fight them for their own sake , and the noble purpose elevated the war to a high moral status .
That was al - Amiri 's response in a nutshell .
But what his opponents argued was precisely that on the contrary , the use of war discredited the alleged purpose and proved the religion it was meant to spread to be false .
So the more the Muslims defended jihad by yoking it to the service of religion , the more their non-Muslim opponents reacted by thinking that the religion must be bad .
That 's how Christians and Muslims have been talking past each other for 1,400 years .
Meanwhile , other people defended jihad by observing that religion had two different functions : it organised collective life , and it also offered individual salvation .
At the collective level it was a prescription for socio-political order , with its do 's and don'ts , its morality , its law and its war .
At this level , coercion was indispensable , and holy war was just one form in which it was practiced .
At the individual level it was pure spirituality , and at that level coercion was impossible .
The only jihad you could fight here was the so - called greater jihad against your own evil inclinations .
So for example , the scholars will say that a man who has been converted by force becomes a full member of the Muslim community and must live as a Muslim in public , even though he is not a believer in his inner self .
He had been coerced at the level of social and political affiliation , but one could n't force him to believe .
In fact , they said , one could never know what was going on in people 's inner selves , and it was n't anyone 's business either : it was between the individuals and God alone .
But what people did externally affected others and so had to be regulated .
Having been forced into the Muslim community , the captive would have to live as a Muslim - the rest was up to him .
Eventually , they said , the chances were that he or his children would see the light , become sincere believers of their own accord , and grateful for having been forced .
In this formulation the claim was that jihad was better than secular conquest .
Unlike Alexander the Great , Mohammed incorporated people in a polity in which they had the option of being saved , in which they had the ability to see for themselves , in which they could choose to become true believers .
But it left inner conviction as something over which the individual had full control .
This argument ought to be easy for modern people to understand , or at least Americans , for they also tend to think that war can be legitimated by a high moral purpose - as long as that purpose has n't got anything to do with individual faith .
The moral purposes they have in mind are wholly secular , not the lower level of religion , and the salvation they talk about is in this world .
But they too tend to be eager to rescue other people by enabling them to become more like themselves : richer , freer , more democratic .
What do you do when your fingers are itching to intervene , when you have the power to do it , when you are sure you are right and you are convinced that the victims will be grateful - quite apart from all the advantages that may redound to yourself from intervening ?
Are n't you allowed to use force ?
Indeed , are n't you obliged to use it ?
Is it right to save people against their will ?
Should you force them to be free ?
If you say yes to these questions , you are in effect a believer in jihad .
But will the victims be grateful ?
In the Muslim case , the answer was normally yes .
The scholars mention it time and again , as something everyone knew .
People fell grateful that they had become Muslims , in whatever manner it had happened , voluntarily or by force .
This made it difficult to entertain serious doubts about the legitimacy of jihad .
In the last resort , most people liked the result .
And this is one of the most striking differences between Muslim and European imperialism , which are otherwise so comparable .
The one led to Islamisation , the other to westernisation ; the one dragged you to Paradise in chains , the other to secular modernity .
But people are n't grateful for having been westernised .
In line with this , westerners no longer take any pride in their imperial past .
Today , westerners often hold imperialism to have invalidated the very civilisation it spread .
They have been persuaded by their own arguments against jihad in a way the Muslims never were .
Why this difference ?
It would call for another lecture .
***
Back to top
This leads to the fourth question : what is the relevance of all this to the modern world ?
The Muslims have not practised missionary jihad since the decline of the Ottoman empire , at least not under the sponsorship of states , and to my knowledge there are no serious calls for its return .
What the tradition has left is a strong activist streak , a sense that it is right to fight for your convictions .
" Look at you , you Christians , with your passivity you have turned religion into something that does n't exist " , as demonstrators against Salman Rushdie said in Paris in March 1989 .
But to understand the fundamentalists we need to go to the other kind of jihad , the one practised when the Muslims are politically weak .
What happens when Muslim territory falls under infidel sovereignty ?
Can Muslims stay on and live under non-Muslim rule ?
Some jurists said yes , others denied it on the grounds that Islamic law could only be applied in full under Muslim sovereignty .
If infidels conquered Muslim land , the Muslims had to emigrate , they had to make a hijra to a place where they could practice Islamic law - either an existing Muslim state or a new one set up by themselves - and then they should start holy war in order to reconquer their homeland .
Not all scholars subscribed to this view , but it was upheld by many in response to the loss of Muslim territory in Spain and it also inspired anti-colonial movements in British India , French Algeria and elsewhere .
Imagine an even worse scenario : what happens when not a single Islamic state exists any more , when all political power has turned infidel ?
The answer is the same with greater urgency ( and probably less disagreement too ) .
You must emigrate to a place where you can establish a Muslim state and then you must wage holy war to get it going .
In both cases , the model is Mohammed : first he lived in pagan Mecca , under infidel sovereignty , then he emigrated to Medina where he established a Muslim polity and started jihad and conquered Mecca , which he cleansed and purified ; thereafter his followers began the conquest of the rest of the world , in what eventually turned into missionary warfare .
Jihad for the recovery or actual creation of Muslim sovereignty ( as opposed to its expansion ) : that 's the type that is practised today .
Modern fundamentalists ( or Islamists ) call it defensive jihad , though it is not what the classical Muslims understood by that term .
It makes sense to them , partly because they feel on the defensive ; partly because everyone recognises the legitimacy of defensive war ; and not least , because participation in defensive jihad is an individual obligation , like fasting and prayer , not a communal duty like the missionary type , which you do n't have to undertake as long as others are doing it .
So calling your jihad defensive is good for mobilisation .
Whatever you call it , the missionary element is greatly reduced in this type of warfare .
Of course , you have to convert people to your own beliefs in order to get them together for state formation and conquest , but the emphasis is not so much on saving people as on saving Islam , especially in the more extreme version when no Islamic state is deemed to exist at all .
For Islam can't exist without political embodiment , according to this view .
There has to be a place on earth where God rules .
Without it , collective ( and individual ? ) life ceases to have any moral foundations .
In the past , jihad for the actual creation of Muslim sovereignty was only practised by heretics , for it was only heretics who would deny that existing states were Islamic .
The very first to do so were the Kharijites , who are almost as old as Islam itself .
There were also Shi'ites who did .
But the Sunnis always accepted their own states as Islamic in some ( sometimes minimalist ) sense , at least until the 18th century , and most still do , including the Muslim Brotherhood , and Hamas .
Their jihad is concentrated on the recovery of Muslim territory , such as Palestine , and the defence of Muslims in places such as Chechnya .
They do n't attack infidels elsewhere , nor do n't they believe in fighting Muslim rulers , or not any more .
But other fundamentalists deem all Muslim states , or even all Muslim people apart from themselves , to be infidels .
Al - Qaida is among them .
They direct their efforts against America rather than fellow Muslims because America is deemed to be behind everything wrong in the Muslim world - you can't correct the shadow cast by a crooked stick , as Osama bin Laden is said to have put it .
But when America , the crooked stick , has been removed , it will be the turn of the Muslim world in general , and by that they mean all countries with a Muslim population , which is in effect the whole earth by now .
So as far as al - Qaida is concerned , the old distinction between the abode of Islam and the abode of war has disappeared .
The extreme fundamentalists can't see any difference between living in Egypt , for example , and living under non-Muslim rule , thanks to the all - pervasive influence of the modern state .
In the old days the political domain was also worldly and corrupt , but the social domain was still shaped by Islam .
Nowadays , however , it is the state that regulates marriage , divorce , inheritance , trade , finance , work , health , childcare , schooling , higher education , and so on , often with attention to what the sharia says , but freely reshaping it to fit modern , secular aims which originate in the infidel and politically dominant west .
So one way or the other , Muslims are ruled by the west wherever they live , not just politically but also socially and culturally .
Wherever they are look , they are being invaded by so - called western values - in the form of giant billboards advertising self - indulgence , semi-pornographic films , liquor , pop music , fat tourists in indecent clothes and funny hats , and politicians lecturing people about the virtues of democracy .
Religion does not actually shape the social realm any more , except rhetorically .
All that religion shapes in modern Muslim societies is voluntary associations such as Sufi orders , Muslim brotherhoods , and fundamentalist cells , which fall short of being whole societies , let alone states , and which you can set up in non-Muslim countries too .
So in effect , as the fundamentalists see it , all Muslims have become diaspora Muslims .
Some Muslims are happy with this .
They want the socio-political order to be secularised ; they want religious affiliation to be voluntary .
They are the secularists , the people we have no trouble understanding .
But to the fundamentalists , or rather to the extremists among them , all Muslims are now living in a new age of ignorance ( jahiliyya ) such as that which prevailed in pagan Arabia before the rise of Islam .
This is why one must get together to reenact Mohammed 's career and save Islam .
Establishment religious scholars often compare such fundamentalists to the Kharijites of the early Islamic period , and with good reason .
They are amazingly similar .
There is the same declaration of other Muslims to be infidels , the same sense of fighting for God rather than for people - God has to rule even if the whole world is going to perish in the attempt - the same utter ruthlessness too .
The Kharijites allowed assassinations , indiscriminate slaughter , the killing of men , women and children alike , much like Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
Their missions were often suicidal , too , not in the sense that they 'd set out on individual missions bound to result in death , but rather in the sense that tiny numbers would take on huge forces bound to exterminate them , inspired by a quest for martyrdom .
They had sold their souls to God , as they put it , and got a good price for them , too , namely Paradise ; they went into battle intending to collect the price .
And then as today , women would fight along with the men .
There is of course no direct link whatever between the Kharijites and modern fundamentalists .
People like Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri do n't even seem to know their own tradition all that well .
Rather , they have stripped Islam of practically everything that most Muslims consider to be their religion .
What 's left is an archetypal monotheist of the confrontational type : a separatist and militant zealot .
In the view of such zealots , God 's people can't live together with infidels , they must have their own political space .
Right and wrong must be embodied in separate communities , and every Muslim must fight to bring this about .
The history of Islam starts with a great separation of God 's people from the rest of mankind by force of arms , and Islamic history thereafter is punctuated by regular attempts to restore the separation , to get rid of all the complexity that obscured the simplicity of the original vision .
Those who engaged in such attempts tended to come from the more peripheral areas of the middle east , often from a tribal background , and they were always minorities .
The fundamentalists , too , are only a small minority today .
But you do n't need an awful lot of people of this kind for an awful lot of trouble .

Hooking up online has become much more common since internet technology has allowed for a safer dating alternative and it is now just as common as the standard dating practices we have used for years .
It may be a different medium , but many of the effective dating strategies have stayed the same .
Here are some things to keep in mind that will help you embrace the similarities as well as the differences .
Tips For Hooking Up Using Dating Websites
Look , if you want to successfully hook up with people then you need to know how to use dating websites the right way .
I ’ve created a list of tips that should help you out a bit .
Do n’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket
The first thing that you should realize is that your probability of successfully hooking up online rises when you spread your efforts across multiple prospects .
Do n’t focus all your attention on the first couple of potential mates that show interest .
You run the risk of wasting a lot of time on dead ends .
Strike up a conversation with as many matches as possible , just be sure not to confuse them with one another .
Talking to multiple prospects at once also increases your chances of finding the most compatible mate , or the mate that gives the highest level of satisfaction .
Creating an Attractive Profile
Another key component of hooking up online is giving the best presentation possible .
Just as you would put your best foot forward when looking for a date in person , you must present yourself in a manner that will attract your ultimate mate .
Post your best pictures that depict your best look , but are also realistic .
Many people make the mistake of posting pictures of themselves younger or skinnier .
If you show up to a date looking wildly different , you will come off as disingenuous and lower your chances of hooking up from the start .
Not to mention , you look absolutely pathetic trying to portray something that you are not .
Cool it hot shot , stick to the basics and be genuine .
It ’ll go a lot further for you , I promise .
Finding Your Ideal Match
Besides talking to multiple prospects and posting the right pictures , you will greatly increase your chances of finding your ideal match if you fill your profile out completely with all your major interests and passions .
The more mutual interests that a potential match sees on your profile , the more likely they will be to respond to your advances .
Sites like eHarmony make you literally spend hours taking quizzes to match you with dates .
Do n’t give everything away , though .
Indicate the interests that most depict what kind of person you are and save the details for your correspondence with them .
Patience is a Virtue
Probably the worst thing you can do when trying to hook up with someone online is to rush the situation or appear more eager than they are .
If you get overly flirty and the flirting is not reciprocated , do n’t continue to push the issue .
Back off and take it slower or try to step up the flirting with another one of your matches .
Knowing When to Make Your Move
It ’s important to be patient when hooking up online , but it ’s also important to know when to make your move .
Do n’t be afraid to take your flirting to the next level if they are responding to it .
If your advances are reciprocated ; feel free to step up your game according to how well they respond .
Did you ever make a bacon tuxedo ?

The Big Ripoff : How Big Business and Big Government Steal Your Money by Timothy P. Carney ( Hoboken , N.J. : John Wiley & Sons , 2006 ) ; 285 pages ; $ 24.95 .
Frédéric Bastiat called it legal plunder when the state expropriated one set of property owners for the benefit of another .
Whether it loots the workers to benefit the farmers , the farmers to benefit the workers , or everybody to benefit Boeing , the state damages and impoverishes society .
That is partly because once the process of legal plunder is allowed to begin , it becomes extremely difficult to stop it , as more and more groups employ state machinery to loot or cripple others — or simply to compensate for the loot and plunder being carried out by their rivals .
The result is a society in a constant condition of low - intensity civil war , in which ever more energy is diverted from productive activity and toward frenetic lobbying for political favors .
The general public has been led to believe that the business class favors the unhampered market and wants government only to stay out of the way of its accumulation of wealth .
The truth , of course , is that those who populate the business world possess the same moral foibles as the rest of us , including the inclination to seek after wealth with the least possible exertion .
That is exactly what the state makes possible : instead of earning a living by satisfying the needs of your fellow man , you can enrich yourself far less strenuously by employing the state machinery to loot him .
What Tim Carney shows in The Big Ripoff is that in plenty of cases big business actually welcomes government regulation and taxation , typically because for one reason or another it thereby expects to acquire a competitive edge against its competitors .
Company spokesmen do n’t put it quite that way , of course , all too happy to cloak their support for new regulation in the idiom of the common good , to which they claim to be selflessly devoted .
In the course of a brief history of American business , Carney shows that such support for government intervention has been far too common to be written off as mere curiosities or historically uninteresting deviations from the norm .
He also quotes a great many examples of journalists and reporters expressing surprise at the discovery that some business interest was pushing for a particular tax or regulation .
In their world , things are elegantly simple : wicked and selfish businessmen are brought into line by the wise regulation of the public sector ’s selfless crusaders for justice .
Carney muddies these waters with ( among other things ) the revealing anecdotal point that in the 2002 congressional campaign , leftist Barbara Lee ( D - Calif . ) collected four times as much money from business PACs as did the resolutely pro-market Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .
The real Enron story
Carney ’s coverage of the Enron scandal is the proverbial chapter that ’s worth the price of the book .
Opponents of the market economy had a field day when Enron ’s financial shenanigans came to light .
A liberal San Francisco Chronicle columnist , claiming that  the Enron scandal makes it clear that the unfettered free market does not work ,  summed up what so many were saying in 2001 and 2002 .
He added that  Enron makes that whole Ayn Rand ‘ Fountainhead ’ thing look a little silly , too .
Who is John Galt ?
Ken Lay . ( John Galt appears in Atlas Shrugged , not The Fountainhead , but never mind . )
The Cato Institute ’s Jerry Taylor was closer to the truth when he described Enron on balance as an enemy , not an ally of free markets .
Enron was more interested in rigging the marketplace with rules and regulations to advantage itself at the expense of competitors and consumers than in making money the old - fashioned way — by earning it honestly from their customers through voluntary trade . 
Building on this observation , Carney shows that Enron , far from being a creature of the free market , was a strong supporter of a variety of government regulations , and reached the heights it did largely thanks to government favors .
Even some of its strange accounting practices had been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( thereby giving the public a false sense of security regarding Enron ’s actual health ) .
Thus , Ken Lay , the wicked capitalist , made high - profile appeals in favor of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming , describing it as a tremendous opportunity to stimulate realistic climate solutions .
He wrote in an e-mailed message that Kyoto would do more to promote Enron ’s business than almost any other regulatory initiative outside of restructuring the energy and natural gas industries in Europe and the United States . 
Since Enron was primarily an energy broker , it could easily become the major trader of CO2 credits that Congress would very likely have created in order to help American industry come into compliance .
On top of that , since Enron owned natural gas pipelines and dealt mainly in natural gas — far cleaner than coal or oil in terms of CO2 emissions — the Kyoto restrictions would give it a competitive edge .
Enron , Carney shows , was on the receiving end of countless waves of government subsidies .
It also manipulated the bizarre regulatory thicket that was the California energy market in grotesquely anti-social ways that enriched Enron at the expense , quite literally , of everyone else .
The whole story has to be read to be believed .
But it ’s one that could not have occurred in a free market .
Corporate tax cuts and welfare
Big business has also opposed tax cuts or supported tax increases , according to Carney .
For example , Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have been portrayed in the media as selfless benefactors for opposing the elimination of the estate tax .
As men of wealth themselves , the media line goes , these men ought to favor the abolition of the tax , but instead they have publicly campaigned for its retention .
What men of the people these are !
Carney suggests that there may be more to the Gates / Buffett stance than meets the eye .
For one thing , the estate tax will never hit Microsoft , since , as a publicly held corporation , its owner will never die .
Moreover , if repeal of the estate tax is made revenue - neutral , additional taxes to make up the shortfall will very likely fall on corporations .
A family - owned business is liable to be devastated by the estate tax .
A son inheriting the family business — whose plant and equipment are worth , say , $ 2 million — from his father and who has been running the business for five years could be hit with a tax bill of $ 500,000 , an amount he could n’t possibly pay out of the company ’s annual profits .
He has to sell , and fast .
It so happens that an avid buyer of businesses desperate to sell in the face of a massive estate - tax bill is — surprise ! — Warren Buffett .
In addition to the Buffalo News , Carney tells us , other motivated sellers facing the estate tax who have found a willing buyer in Warren Buffett [ include ] Dairy Queen , a Utah furniture store , and a Nebraska jeweler . 
Now it could be that Buffett ’s support for the estate tax has nothing at all to do with self - interest , and instead derives from a pristine devotion to egalitarian ideology .
But should n’t some of these facts at least be mentioned in media coverage of Buffett and his pro-tax crusade ?
It would be difficult to discuss corporate welfare without mentioning Boeing .
In 2005 Carney wrote an article for Canada ’s Financial Post called  Subsidy Queens ,  criticizing both Europe ’s Airbus and America ’s Boeing for the government assistance each had received .
( Between 1998 and 2005 , Boeing was awarded $ 33 billion of the Export - Import Bank ’s $ 63.5 billion in loans and long - term guarantees . )
Boeing vice president Thomas Downey wrote to the Post congratulating Carney for refuting the weary arguments used by Airbus and the European Union to defend their direct subsidies for developing new airplane models . 
Downey was n’t quite so happy about Carney ’s criticism of Boeing — whose assistance from the Export - Import Bank , Downey insisted , should n’t be considered a subsidy :
 These guarantees do indeed help foreign customers secure the private - sector loans they need to buy American goods , but they are not exclusive to Boeing or airplanes — nor are they prohibited by the World Trade Organization . 
If there is an argument in there for why these subsidies are n’t subsidies , it certainly is n’t clear .
Downey is right that these subsidies do n’t go to Boeing or airplanes alone — though he might have acknowledged that 52 percent of all Ex - Im loans go to Boeing in particular .
Of all the tales of corporate welfare and looting that Carney has to tell , though , my personal favorite involves the Union Oil Company of California ( Unocal ) .
Unocal secured a U.S. patent for its method of reducing harmful emissions from gasoline - powered vehicles .
Several months after getting the patent , Unocal received more good news : the California Air Resources Board had released its final clean gasoline rules , and it turns out that in order to comply with California law you had to use the very method of emissions reduction for which Unocal had just received a patent .
Oh , and the CARB knew that was the right method to use because … Unocal told them so .
Unocal helped to draft California ’s clean - air rules at the very moment it had a patent pending on the method it was proposing for universal adoption .
And that , in turn , meant that Unocal could demand licensing fees from anyone who was legally selling oil in California .
A lawsuit by Exxon , Mobil , Chevron , Texaco , Shell , and other refiners came to naught as Unocal successfully counter - sued for patent infringement .
On top of all this , Unocal also benefited from the new regulations because they disproportionately harmed its smaller competitors , despite the longer period of time they had been granted in order to comply with the rules .
( Unocal had lobbied against even this minor allowance , by the way . )
With The Big Ripoff , Tim Carney has shown the hidden truths that can be uncovered when the skills and instincts of a good journalist combine with an informed understanding of political economy .
If only our historians had the same acumen , for then we might at last puncture the comic - book , public - heroes - versus - private - villains version of American history that has done so much to obscure the true dynamics at work among state , business , and market .

Still , Mr. Lampros received a satisfactory rating five of the six times administrators formally observed him .
He has master ’s degrees in both statistics and math education and has won awards for his teaching at the college level .

“ It ’s almost as if you stick to your morals and your ethics , you ’ll end up without a job , ” Mr. Lampros said in an interview .
“ I do n’t think every school is like that .
But in my case , it was . ”
The written record , in the form of the minutely detailed charts Mr. Lampros maintained to determine student grades , supports his account .
Colleagues of his from the school — a counselor , a programmer , several fellow teachers — corroborated key elements of his version of events .
They also describe a principal worried that the 2006 graduation rate of 72.5 percent would fall closer to 50 or 60 percent unless teachers came up with ways to pass more students .
After having failed to graduate with her class in June 2006 , Miss Fernandez , who , through her mother , declined to be interviewed , returned to Arts and Technology last September for a fifth year .
She was enrolled in Mr. Lampros ’s class in intermediate algebra .
Absent for more than two - thirds of the days , she failed , and that grade was left intact by administrators .
When second semester began , Miss Fernandez again took the intermediate algebra class , which fulfilled one of her graduation requirements .
According to Mr. Lampros ’s records , she missed one - third of the classes , arrived late for 20 sessions , turned in half the required homework assignments , failed 11 of 14 tests and quizzes , and never took the final exam .
Two days after the June 12 final , Miss Fernandez told Mr. Lampros that she had a doctor ’s note excusing her from school on the day of the exam , he said .
On June 18 , she asked him if she had failed the class , and he told her she had .
The next day , the principal summoned Mr. Lampros to a meeting with Miss Fernandez and her mother .
He was ordered , he said , to let her retake the final .
Mr. Arocho , the assistant principal , wrote in a letter to Mr. Lampros that Miss Fernandez had a doctor ’s note , issued March 15 , permitting her to miss school whenever necessary in the spring .
Mr. Arocho did not respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment .

Now , any survey of this type is n't designed to get at some sort of mythical objective truth about the Internet 's effects on English ; it 's designed to come up with a handy top - ten list that journalists can use to pad out slow news days .
As such , it 's just a measure of people 's pet peeves , so this seems as good a time as any to share a few of my own that did n't make the official list .

The results of Valve 's latest Steam hardware survey , begun on May 30 , have just been released to the public .
Over 330,000 unique samples have been received so far , and the results — while self - selecting — are useful to anyone interested in the type of computing hardware a typical PC gamer is sporting these days and his or her OS of choice .
Valve has been running these surveys over Steam since 2004 and has always provided the results back to the public .
The 2007 version reveals that only 2.08 percent of users are still chugging away on a 56 k modem , with the majority ( 33.43 percent ) enjoying broadband with speeds over 2 M bps .
In terms of CPU power , 21.71 percent of respondents had two CPUs available ( either two sockets or dual - core chips ) with only 0.20 percent boasting quad CPU goodness .
The line was split fairly evenly between Intel and AMD , with 51.37 percent using the former and 48.63 percent using the latter .
The rivalry between ATI and NVIDIA was more one - sided , with 58.58 people using NVIDIA graphics cards compared to only 36.38 percent with ATI .
Integrated graphics chipsets comprised a mere 5.03 percent of users .
53.19 percent of gamers had a graphics card which defaulted to DirectX 9's Shader Model 3 ( GeForce 6xxx and above , ATI Radeon X1xx and above ) while only 21.67 percent defaulted to the older DX9 Shader Model 2 ( older ATI Radeons ) and gamers limited to DirectX 8 and 7 paths represented only 15.5 and 6.01 percent of the total , respectively .
DirectX 10 ?
Only 1.21 percent of users have both DirectX10 and a DirectX 10 - capable video card .
In terms of operating systems , Windows XP again led the pack with 93 percent .
Only 5.27 percent of respondents had upgraded to Windows Vista , with the rest on Windows 2000 or Server 2003 .
The low uptake of Vista even among high - end gamers will undoubtedly make some developers rethink whether or not to invest heavily in DirectX 10 , which is Vista - only .
Many gamers reported that they tested Vista but went back to XP for various reasons — when DirectX 10 - capable graphics cards become more mainstream and Vista graphics drivers achieve higher levels of maturity , the Vista numbers should increase .
Surprisingly , the leading sound " card " in the survey was the lowly Realtek AC97 integrated audio chipset ( 24.21 percent ) , with the once - proud Sound Blaster line living on in less than ten percent of gamers '
PCs .
Not good news for Creative , who have been struggling as of late .
76.86 percent of users reported having microphones installed , which should be an indication to the PC gaming industry that it is probably time to include integrated voice chat support across the board .
Gamers love their large displays , but the uptake of widescreen monitors has so far been relatively modest ( 13 percent of the total ) and even for standard 4:3 displays , the majority of units are of the 17 - inch category ( 50.54 percent ) .
Only 2.82 percent of respondents are using multiple monitors .
The most popular primary display resolution was 1280 x 800 at 41.79 percent , although given the relative paucity of widescreen monitors , it seems likely that this was a typo in the results , and the real value is 1280 x 1024 .
Fully 37.64 percent are still hanging on at 1024 x 768 .
Improving home efficiency can mean many things .
You could get a more efficient heater , perhaps you install new CFL light bulbs , maybe you get some weather sealing around the doors .
Making your home more efficient will save you money , and make your house more comfortable to live in .
With this in mind , we recently had Bruce Torrey , from Building Diagnostics ( you might have seen him on This Old House a couple of weeks ago , the episode is still playing in some areas , do a google search to find it in your area ) .
He brought his blower , and his thermal camera , and a lot of experience .
We live in a really old , and drafty , home .
We have already sealed up most of the “ obvious ” problems .
We have had the attic insulated , the foundation sealed up , the doors weather stripped and a lot of cracks sealed .
Yet it was still cold and drafty in the winter , we also wanted to save some cash on heating fuel .
We knew that the remaining problems were going to be harder to find , so Bruce went to work .
The first thing we did was crank the heat up to 72 .
This was because it was getting warm outside and we needed a temperature difference between the inside and the outside so that the thermal camera would work better .
Next Bruce set up the blower door .
The blower causes the home to have a negative pressure , letting us see with the thermal camera ( and in many places feel with our hands ) the cold air from outside rushing in .
We set the blower to maintain a constant pressure .
This allows us to see just how much air the house is exchanging with the outside .
This will give us an idea of just how “ leaky ” the home is .
Obviously you want some air to come and go , but if its too much it could mean a lot of cracks that need sealed up .
Once we let the blower run for a while and had achieved negative pressure with the outside , we got out the thermal camera .
While many of the drafts were very easy to detect with your hand ( a lot of air was coming in , no wonder the kitchen was always so cold ! ) , some were impossible to find without the camera .
For instance a closet in the upstairs that never had any drafts needed a lot more insulation .
The dark areas represent “ cold ” and the white “ hot ” , as you can see the studs are the warm white lines .
They are transmitting heat from the inside to the outside , the dark areas are the cold air from outside flooding into the closet ( also note the non-CFL light , which has since been changed to a CFL , we had no idea one of these guys was still in there , yet another benefit to getting your home evaluated ) .
Most walls show the opposite , with the studs being “ cold ” and the walls “ hot ” .
This is because in a well insulated wall the studs are the easiest way for the heat to be transmitted outside , hence they show up colder .
We also discovered some interesting facts .
For one between the first and second floor there is no insulation around the outside of the home .
This means that all around the outside of the house cold air is seeping in and causing the home to be cooler .
This will be fixed by blowing insulation in around the outside of the home .
You can also find “ interesting ” construction practises from long ago .
For instance this corner in the upstairs room seems to be leaking cold air across the wall , most likely from an “ interesting ” configuration of the 2X4’s on the outside wall .
Without the thermal camera we would have never found this ( without ripping the walls off ) .
without camera
with camera
You can clearly see the black “ cold ” seeping in .
All over the house we found little cracks that need to be sealed up with painters caulk , some blown in insulation , or some weather sealing .
We found that the windows were in pretty bad shape .
But the good news is the window casings are still pretty solid , that means we can put plastic over the windows and achieve a sizable reduction in heating cost , as we try and find some money to replace the windows .
Bruce is an expert when it comes to this sort of thing .
Reading a thermal image camera takes experience .
If you are interested in getting a similar test done in your area make sure the contractor has done this sort of thing before .
The report Bruce prepared for us tells us exactly what needs to be fixed , he even recommended some local people to do the job .
I will keep you updated .
Another Friday , another document dump from the DOJ .
As I was scanning through this set , I came across this one from Monica " I plead the Fifth " Goodling .
Notice the instruction in boldface ( see below the fold for full size image ) :
Yes , that 's an instruction to delete documents .
And notice the date : February 12 , 2007 .
That 's well after Congress began investigating this matter .
I do n't believe any subpoenas or document requests had yet been issued ( someone please correct me if I 'm wrong about that ) , but it was pretty clear by then that document requests were likely .
Let 's review the timeline .
On January 17 , 2007 , Senators Feinstein and Leahy grilled Alberto Gonzales on the recent spate of U.S. Attorney firings .
On January 25 , 2007 , Senator Schumer announced that he was going to hold hearings on the firing of U.S. Attorneys .
And on February 6 , Schumer held the first set of hearings , in which Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty testified that Bud Cummins was not asked to leave for " performance - related " reasons , but rather to make way for Karl Rove protege Tim Griffin .
That damaging testimony helped propel this story to the front pages .
And two days later , on February 8 , 2007 , Senators Durbin , Schumer , Murray , and Reid sent a follow up letter to Alberto Gonzales asking all sorts of questions arising out of McNulty 's testimony , including a number of questions about the replacement of Bud Cummins with Tim Griffin .
It is in this context that Monica Goodling , four days later , sends out the above - displayed email , which attaches updated talking points re : Griffin / Cummins and various other U.S. Attorney related issues and instructs the recipients to delete prior versions of the documents .
As a litigator , I can tell you , that 's a real no - no .
You never instruct people to delete documents that are relevant to a pending investigation .
Never .
That 's true even when the investigating body has n't yet got around to requesting those documents .
It smacks of obstruction .
Indeed , the Obstruction of Congress statute , 18 U.S.C § 1505 , specifically prohibits any attempts to obstruct " the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House , or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress . "
The penalty is up to 5 years in prison .
I 'm not sure if 18 U.S.C § 1505 has been interpreted to apply to the destruction of documents that have not yet been formally requested -- I suspect it has n't -- but it is , at the very least , incredibly dodgy to be instructing people to delete documents that relate to a pending Congressional inquiry .
If an employee of a private entity were caught giving such an instruction after an investigation had been initiated , it would incur the everlasting wrath of the government agency or prosecutor 's office conducting that investigation .
It would be a real mess .
That 's why the first piece of advice a private entity receives from its lawyers when it learns that it is being investigated is to issue a document preservation notice to all employees .
The last thing you want is to have the government request a document and then learn that it was deleted or destroyed AFTER the investigation was initiated .
Just ask the people who used to work for Arthur Anderson .
The sad demise of that once proud firm is all the reminder you need that the Justice Department does n't react too kindly to post-initiation - of - investigation destruction of evidence .
Which makes it all the more ironic that Monica Goodling , a high - ranking Justice Department official , is instructing other high - ranking Justice Department officials to delete documents that are relevant to an ongoing Congressional inquiry .
Now to be fair , from the context of the email , it seems likely that Goodling 's primary purpose in asking people to " delete prior versions " of the documents was to make sure that everyone was on the same page and not working off of outdated materials .
In other words , I do n't think she was motivated by a desire to destroy documents that Congress might want for their investigation .
That said , as an attorney , she should have known better than to make such a request .
If there is any kind of litigation or investigation underway or even contemplated , you do n't instruct people to delete documents .
It does n't matter if that 's your normal practice and you 're just trying to keep people from getting confused ; it just looks bad , and it can get you and your organization in a lot of trouble .
Goodling is not some low - level administrator .
She was a senior legal counsel at the Justice Department .
That Goodling would make such a request despite the budding Congressional inquiry into the matter is , at best , indicative of carelessness and sloppy practices .

It ’s not the economy .
That may sound like an unusual way to begin an every - other - week column on economics and politics , but this is a pretty unusual election .
Questions of prosperity and the health of the economy , which usually are at the top of the list of voters ’ concerns and often play a huge role in determining the outcome — Exhibit A : Bill Clinton in 1992 ; Exhibit B : Ronald Reagan in 1980 ; Exhibit C : just about every other election in recent memory — are clearly overshadowed by the war in Iraq .
The nearest parallel to today is 1968 , when the Vietnam War similarly overwhelmed every other issue .
Now , from the admittedly parochial point of view of those of us who closely follow economic developments , this would seem to be a fairly dispiriting turn of events .
Sure , many Americans are worried about everything from high gasoline prices to the cost and availability of health insurance to the widening disparities in incomes .
Still , if the economy does n’t much matter to the voting public right now , is n’t all the attention paid to it mostly hot air ?
But this lack of focus on the current state of the economy could actually prove to be a good thing .
That ’s because American presidents , for all their efforts to claim credit for a growing economy or avoid blame for a slump , do n’t really have much influence over such ups and downs .
Almost none , in fact .
Yet the tendency to attribute such God - like powers to the occupant of the White House obscures what Washington can actually do to improve the way the economy performs over the longer run .
And it masks what is at stake once the election is over and the process of governing begins , when attention turns mostly to rewarding favored constituencies and leaving others to fend for themselves .

Energy Return on Energy Invested ( EROEI ) * is a problematic concept .
As Cutler J. Cleveland has noted , “ It is impossible to precisely identify and quantify all those factors [ that contribute to the energy input to energy production ] , or to unequivocally categorize them as either physical or economic factors . ” [ 1 ]
Despite this difficulty in calculation , the importance of the figure is clear : it is axiomatic that if EROEI is less than 1 — that is , if it takes more energy input than the produced energy output — then substantial reliance on that form of energy is not a valid foundation for modern civilization .
* I have chosen the term “ Energy Return on Energy Invested ” over its analogs “ Energy Return on Investment ” ( EROI ) and “ Net Energy ” ( which is equal to EROEI – 1 ) .
The terms are interchangeable ( with the noted adjustment for “ Net Energy ” ) .
My rationale is that EROEI explicitly spells out what it stands for better than the other two terms — EROI risks confusion with financial return on investment , and Net Energy is similarly not self - explanatory .
That said , the intent of this disclaimer is this : the terms are essentially interchangeable , so use whichever you prefer , I do n’t claim that one ( let a lone the one that I have chosen ) is the only correct term . . . let ’s avoid arguing over terminology and discuss the concept .
The principle difficulty in calculating EROEI is the desire to define a boundary of energy inputs that will be included in calculations .
At one extreme , only the direct energy inputs to energy production may be considered — e.g. , the energy required to lift oil from its reservoir to the surface .
This approach has the clear advantage that the considered energy inputs are finite and readily quantifiable .
The downside is an EROEI figure that fails to accurately represent the actual energy surplus or deficit of process .
On the other extreme , the string of energy inputs can be regressed infinitely : e.g. , the energy to grind the rice to feed the farmer to raise the chickens to feed the merchant captain who piloted the ship that transported the molybdenum used in the manufacture of the oil rig is a necessary prerequisite to producing the resulting oil !
While this infinite regression approach ( of which the above example is only a simple example ) theoretically captures the true energy inputs for accurate EROEI calculation , it is also clearly impossible to quantify .
Howard Odum attempted to address this problem with his attempt to calculate “ Emergy ” ( embodied energy ) , originally intended to address ecosystems , but also applicable to human society and economies . [ 2 ]
While attempts to implement the emergy methodology to produce an empirical figure have met with some success in balancing the need to incorporate energy inputs with the need to limit those inputs within quantifiable boundaries , confusion continues in the specific methodology of emergy . [ 3 ]
While at one point there was an effort to create an ISO standardized methodology for emergy accounting by the London Group on Environmental Accounting , this effort seems to have failed . [ 4 ]
Despite the assertion that emergy provides a global , standardized means to account for energy inputs , and therefore to calculate an accurate value for EROEI , no such standard has emerged . [ 5 ]
Ultimately , this failure of a methodology to practically AND accurately account for energy inputs is testament to the fundamental tension between the demands of infinite regression of energy inputs and the need to limit accounted energy inputs to within a practicable boundary .
A standardized , yet accurate and implementable method of calculating and comparing the EROEI of energy sources is critical to our energy future — understanding Peak Oil , evaluating alternatives to oil , and proposing viable policy measures all depend on at least some resolution of this issue .
Where ( if anywhere ) can we draw the line , beyond which energy inputs do n’t need to be counted ?
Can we effectively use proxies to model the totality of energy inputs without actually counting all of them individually ?
The next two installments in this series of short articles on EROEI will address those issues .

Okay , so JetBlue , after deciding to resist Bill O'Reilly 's pressure last night , just decided to back down .
Let them know what you think about that .
As for my part , I 'm cancelling my JetBlue American Express card and will be looking at alternative options for my future travel .
Too bad .
Unfortunately , JetBlue just told me ( and the rest of us ) that they accept O'Reilly 's bullshit smears .
What 's really interesting about this whole affair is that the most aggressive pushback is coming from Hillary Clinton 's camp .
JetBlue may have just exacerbated their PR problem , but at least we 're seeing that the days when Democrats would 've followed suit are behind us .
Update : Oh , and JetBlue advertises with Fox .
You see , it 's okay to support the likes of Ann Coulter .
Update II : JetBlue wants me to note that they did n't pull the tickets they donated to the event .
So the sponsorship remains , but they are too afraid to let anyone know that they donated those tickets .
Does n't this seem the worst of all worlds .
Will right wingers be appeased considering that JetBlue is still giving yKos free tickets ?
Way to piss off everyone ...
They had it right the first time , saying that they'd be happy to sponsor events from all ends of the ideological spectrum .
That 'd be more than fair enough .
Fox News host who sniped at Raw Story had us as ' favorite site '
David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Thursday June 28 , 2007 Print This Email This
( Update : Gibson once picked Raw as a favorite website of his )
Michael Roston 's analysis yesterday of the office of the vice president ( Does America need a vice president ? ) caught the attention of Fox News ' John Gibson , host of the afternoon talk show The Big Story .
In his " My Word " segment , Gibson said that " far lefties " are contemplating " extremely radical solutions to the ' Bush problem , ' " and specifically cited Roston 's article .
" Today , Raw Story  a leftist blog on the Internet that traffics in hating both Bush and Cheney  floated the idea of abolishing the office of vice president , " he said .
" I realize this is a blog that not all that many people read , but this is how ideas get started on the left , and I expect we will see it pop up elsewhere soon . "
Gibson said that the Roston 's thesis was " even shot down by the constitutional expert he interviewed . "
It should be noted , however , that Raw Story 's piece was an analysis of an idea advanced by " some critics of the Bush administration " and the article described the notion as a " radical " one .
Despite Raw Story being read by " not all that many people , " Gibson nevertheless thinks the idea to abolish the vice presidency will gain traction on the left as a result of the article .
Gibson calls doing away with the office of the vice president a " truly bad idea , " but still thinks it will " take on real currency and [ prompt ] serious discussions . "
Last September , Gibson had kinder things to say about RAW STORY .
In a column posted at the Fox News website , he singled out the site as one of his favorites .
The following video is from Fox 's The Big Story , broadcast on June 28 .
At 16 , Elliot Castro began a five - year orgy of credit card fraud that took him , first class , from Bond street to Rodeo drive ... to prison .
Here , he tells his story .
Keith Olbermann delivered another stunning special comment tonight , this time attacking Bush 's Rose Garden press conference from last Friday .

Olbermann : Finally tonight , a Special Comment about the Rose Garden news conference last Friday .
The President of the United States owes this country an apology .
There are now none around him who would tell him - or could .

An apology is this President 's only hope of regaining the slightest measure of confidence , of what has been , for nearly two years , a clear majority of his people .
Rough transcript below the fold .
Finally tonight , a Special Comment about the Rose Garden news conference last Friday .
The President of the United States owes this country an apology .
It will not be offered , of course .
He does not realize its necessity .
There are now none around him who would tell him - or could .
The last of them , it appears , was the very man whose letter provoked the President into the conduct , for which the apology is essential .
An apology is this President 's only hope of regaining the slightest measure of confidence , of what has been , for nearly two years , a clear majority of his people .
Not " confidence " in his policies nor in his designs nor even in something as narrowly focused as which vision of torture shall prevail -- his , or that of the man who has sent him into apoplexy , Colin Powell .
In a larger sense , the President needs to regain our confidence , that he has some basic understanding of what this country represents -- of what it must maintain if we are to defeat not only terrorists , but if we are also to defeat what is ever more increasingly apparent , as an attempt to re-define the way we live here , and what we mean , when we say the word " freedom . "
Because it is evident now that , if not its architect , this President intends to be the contractor , for this narrowing of the definition of freedom .
The President revealed this last Friday , as he fairly spat through his teeth , words of unrestrained fury ...
... directed at the man who was once the very symbol of his administration , who was once an ambassador from this administration to its critics , as he had once been an ambassador from the military to its critics .
The former Secretary of State , Mr. Powell , had written , simply and candidly and without anger , that " the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism . "
This President 's response included not merely what is apparently the Presidential equivalent of threatening to hold one 's breath , but -- within -- it contained one particularly chilling phrase .
Mr. President , former Secretary of State Colin Powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism .
If a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former secretary of state feels this way , do n't you think that Americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether you 're following a flawed strategy ?
BUSH : If there 's any comparison between the compassion and decency of the American people and the terrorist tactics of extremists , it 's flawed logic .
It 's just -- I simply can't accept that .
It 's unacceptable to think that there 's any kind of comparison between the behavior of the United States of America and the action of Islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective .
Of course ** it 's acceptable to think that there 's " any kind of comparison . "
And in this particular debate , it is not only acceptable , it is obviously necessary .
Some will think that our actions at Abu Ghraib , or in Guantanamo , or in secret prisons in Eastern Europe , are all too comparable to the actions of the extremists .
Some will think that there is no similarity , or , if there is one , it is to the slightest and most unavoidable of degrees .
What all of us will agree on , is that we have the right -- we have the duty -- to think about the comparison .
And , most importantly , that the other guy , whose opinion about this we cannot fathom , has exactly the same right as we do : to think -- and say -- what his mind and his heart and his conscience tell him , is right .
All of us agree about that .
Except , it seems , this President .
With increasing rage , he and his administration have begun to tell us , we are not permitted to disagree with them , that we can not be right .
That Colin Powell can not be right .
And then there was that one , most awful phrase .
In four simple words last Friday , the President brought into sharp focus what has been only vaguely clear these past five - and - a - half years - the way the terrain at night is perceptible only during an angry flash of lightning , and then , a second later , all again is dark .
" It 's unacceptable to think ... " he said .
It is never unacceptable ... to think .
And when a President says thinking is unacceptable , even on one topic , even in the heat of the moment , even in the turning of a phrase extracted from its context ... he takes us toward a new and fearful path -- one heretofore the realm of science fiction authors and apocalyptic visionaries .
That flash of lightning freezes at the distant horizon , and we can just make out a world in which authority can actually suggest it has become unacceptable to think .
hus the lightning flash reveals not merely a President we have already seen , the one who believes he has a monopoly on current truth .
It now shows us a President who has decided that of all our commanders - in - chief , ever ... he , alone , has had the knowledge necessary to alter and re-shape our inalienable rights .
This is a frightening , and a dangerous , delusion , Mr. President .
If Mr. Powell 's letter - cautionary , concerned , predominantly supportive -- can induce from you such wrath and such intolerance -- what would you say were this statement to be shouted to you by a reporter , or written to you by a colleague ?
" Governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed .
That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government ... "
Those incendiary thoughts came , of course , from a prior holder of your job , Mr. Bush .
They were the words of Thomas Jefferson .
He put them in the Declaration of Independence .
Mr. Bush , what would you say to something that annti-thetical to the status quo just now ?
Would you call it " unacceptable " for Jefferson to think such things , or to write them ?
Between your confidence in your infallibility , sir , and your demonizing of dissent , and now these rages better suited to a thwarted three - year old , you have left the unnerving sense of a White House coming unglued - a chilling suspicion that perhaps we have not seen the peak of the anger ; that we can no longer forecast what next will be said to , or about , anyone ... who disagrees .
Or what will next be done to them .
On this newscast last Friday night , Constitiutional law Professor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University , suggested that at some point in the near future ... some of the " detainees " transferred from secret CIA cells to Guantanamo , will finally get to tell the Red Cross that they have indeed been tortured .
Thus the debate over the Geneva Conventions , might not be about further interrogations of detainees , but about those already conducted , and the possible liability of the administration , for them .
That , certainly , could explain Mr. Bush 's fury .
That , at this point , is speculative .
But at least it provides an alternative possibility as to why the President 's words were at such variance from the entire history of this country .
For , there needs to be some other explanation , Mr. Bush , than that you truly believe we should live in a United States of America in which a thought is unacceptable .
There needs to be a delegation of responsible leaders -- Republicans or otherwise -- who can sit you down as Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott once sat Richard Nixon down - and explain the ** reality ** of the situation you have created .
There needs to be ... an apology from the President of the United States .
And more than one .
But , Mr. Bush , the others -- for warnings unheeded five years ago , for war unjustified four years ago , for battle unprepared three years ago -- they are not weighted with the urgency and necessity of this one .
We must know that , to you ... thought with which you disagree -- and even voice with which you disagree - and even action with which you disagree -- are still sacrosanct to you .
The philosopher Voltaire once insisted to another author , " I detest what you write , but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write . "
Since the nation 's birth , Mr. Bush , we have misquoted and even embellished that statement , but we have served ourselves well , by subscribing to its essence .
Oddly , there are other words of Voltaire 's that are more pertinent still , just now .
" Think for yourselves , " he wrote , " and let others enjoy the privilege to do so , too . "
Apologize , sir , for even hinting at an America where a few have that privilege to think -- and the rest of us get yelled at by the President .
Anything else , Mr. Bush , is truly ... unacceptable .
They sit at the top of the piracy pyramid and inhabit shadowy areas of the internet , hidden behind encrypted connections .
Hunted by law enforcement agencies worldwide , they 're the first suppliers of the latest movies , music and software .
Getting any members of ' The Scene ' to break cover is a difficult task , so getting an interview with a member is a rare event .
The history of ‘ The Scene ’ can be traced back to the 1980 ’s when enthusiasts set up BBS ‘s to facilitate the trading of small pieces of software and documents with other like - minded individuals .
As bandwidth became more readily available , the next 20 years saw the availability of ‘ Scene ’ material explode to encompass full length movies , music , software and games , many made available before their official street dates .
Whether they like it or not ( and many members do n’t ) ‘ The Scene ’ became the number one unofficial supplier of unauthorized media to the internet , distributed by others via P2P protocols and networks such as BitTorrent and ed2 k .
This position attracted a lot of unwanted attention from law enforcement and resulted in high profile busts such as those in Operation Fastlink and Operation Buccanner .
The existence of ‘ The Scene ’ was no longer a closed secret , with people even making internet TV shows about it .
In an interview with a Scene releaser ( a person who puts the content onto a server called a ‘ Topsite ‘ ) we get an insider ’s view of The Scene and get some interesting comments about P2P .
The Interview ( loosely translated from German )
Q : The scene is regarded of many people as the “ Warez Scene ” .
What is the “ scene ” for you ?
For me the scene is like a competition , the best group has the highest status .
The real scene is just a small elite group .
Most of the “ scene web sites ” have nothing to do with the scene .
They only try to make as much money as possible , and bring the real sceners in danger .
Q : How did the scene recover after the large busts in the middle of 2005 ?
The scene does not only go back a few years , it goes back to the 1980’s .
What I mean by this is that the scene can be weakened but after a short time it can regain its strength .
Old groups go and new ones replace them .
Q : Since then did the competition between the Groups grow or decrease ?
As I said , after the busts in 2005 new Groups came .
Many disappeared but nevertheless some turned into well - known Groups ..
The competition remained about the same .
Q : How does it look with the servers ?
The servers that were seized at that time , were great machines .
What about the 11 Tb monster ?
These servers stand abroad and with the most wondrous methods to hide them from the law .
Some interesting hiding methods circulated before the raids .
Q : To your knowledge , how many people were arrested ?
Actually none .
Every now and then so - called “ szeneNfo ” files circulate in which people are warned .
That prevents people from getting arrested .
Q : Is the rumor true that a married couple were condemned because they were both group members ?
I hear the rumor today for the first time however why should not that not have passed ?
Q : Why did the groups start getting attention ?
In former times as the releases did not leak onto file - sharing networks , no - one was really interested in us as we were just a few computer enthusiasts exchanging material in a small circle .
Since then everything leaks to P2P and the public gets access , so we are hunted [ by the authorities ]
Q : Are there any measures to prevent releases for leaking ?
Briefly after the raids we made some coded releases , there were no leads however .
Thank you .
Those were my questions , now come the visitor ’s questions .
Q : Joe :
Where do the programs and movies come from ?
They come to the hands of the Groups in many diverse ways .
Either someone buys the things , or maybe they work at the manufacturing company or obtain it from a rental company .
Q : Jackbox :
In which countries are you hosted ?
Actually in all .
But to use a server in countries like Germany or Austria is highly dangerous .
Q : Jackbox : How did you become a member of The Scene ?
A good friend invited me as thanks for helping with the group .
Q : Rene :
Is there a big chance of being caught ?
It all depends how one behaves .
Someone who has servers in Germany and sell copies has a bigger chance of getting caught than someone who is more careful , has its server abroad , and does n’t get involved with people he or she barely knows .
Q : Denis :
How do you ensure that the names or data associated with persons involved do not become available , as everyone leaves traces on the internet , even when surfing ?
I would leave this gladly unanswered .
What I can say however , is that naturally the servers do not have any log files .
Q : Denis :
Why would someone be involved in this activity when it is such high risk ?
Is it money ?
Power ?
Fun ?
The latter .
Money ?
No .
This “ power ” does not bring me in my material life anything .
Thus , it is the fun that makes this “ hobby ” makes so interesting .
Q : Denis :
As a site admin , I am interested in how the servers are secured ?
Host the server in a “ safe ” country abroad , do n’t keep any server logs , and make sure the non removable disks are encrypted .
Q : Robert :
How is it possible to guarantee that no - one infiltrates the group ?
There is no one way to do this , it ’s down to experience .
One should know each group member over time and work together .
Q : Robert :
Is there any software which one could not crack yet ?
Clearly .
But since I am not active in this area , I can not give you any information .
Q : Robert : How much traffic do you register on your servers ?
It ’s naturally different from server to server , but the traffic runs into tens of Terrabytes .
Q : Robert :
Is there competition between the different groups and if so , how does this manifest itself ?
Clearly there is competition , and everyone wants to be the best and fastest .
This is apparent from the NFO files which show that the groups do not greet each other in a particularly nice way .
Q : Robert :
What do you think about the claims of the software industry which say they have huge losses from piracy ?
Each clear - thinking person will probably believe me that these “ losses ” are not due to the scene .
Just because someone downloads an expensive piece of image editing software it does not mean that the person would have purchased it .
But the software industry states that each pirate copy is equal to one lost sale .
Q : Christoph :
Why is it not possible to close the holes in the Scene which allow the releases to leak to P2P networks ?
Since there are many people in the scene , there are naturally also many leaks .
That is probably the largest disadvantage of the scene becoming so large .
The releases are uploaded to P2P networks without the consent of the Group .
Q : Christoph :
It is clear that the Scene has a hatred for P2P .
What do you think about the FXP and invite - only torrent sites ?
The FXP scene mostly release only into the P2P nets .
These “ invite only torrent ” sites belong just as little to the scene as other warez sites .
They make money with the fact and bring the Groups into danger .
Q : Cyberfreak77 : What will happen if one day copy protection is abolished and it is possible to copy content without concern of being punished ?
The release groups will still try to be the fastest to release !
Q : Cyberfreak77 : Do you think that the content owners quietly realise that illegal copying and file - sharing gives publicity to increase DVD sales ?
I do not think this is impossible .
If I see a good film then later I will buy it .
I download to test the film to see it is worthy of being bought .
On Sunday came news from the U.N. inspectors on the ground that Iran has made a breakthrough in the enrichment of uranium .
It was previously thought that the Iranians were having trouble developing the tight engineering and high speeds needed to get their centrifuges to produce nuclear fuel .
But inspectors , on a short - notice visit , came upon 1,300 centrifuges merrily spinning away and churning out the raw ingredient for massive carnage .
“ We believe they pretty much have the knowledge about how to enrich , ” said Mohamed ElBaradei , the director general of the U.N. agency that won the Nobel Prize after getting it right about Saddam Hussein ’s nonexistent WMD program .
That makes his current alarm all the more credible when he warns about Iran ’s enrichment program breakthrough : “ From now on , it is simply a question of perfecting that knowledge .
People will not like to hear it , but that ’s a fact . ”
Great .
Tehran ’s religious fanatics have moved closer to the potential for nuclear conflagration , and what can bully - boy Bush do about it ?
Nothing .
He shot his wad gambling on the invasion of Iraq , a nation that did n’t pose a WMD threat , and now needs Iran — which the United Nations fears may pose a real threat — to bail us out in Baghdad .
Now it is bluffing time , with the Bush administration making all the appropriate warning noises about Iran ’s nuclear program while cozying up to Tehran to help our puppet government in Baghdad pretend to be in power .
That Bush is dependent on Iran ’s ruling ayatollahs to salvage a modicum of face - saving stability in Iraq also was made clear on Sunday when , despite new concerns about Iran ’s nuclear potential , the White House confirmed an upcoming Iran - U.S. meeting in Baghdad in the next few weeks to discuss Tehran taking a “ productive role ” in Iraq ’s security .
“ You could expect a meeting in the next few weeks with Ambassador [ Chester ] Crocker and Iranians , ” said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
His lame excuse for formal talks after a 25 - year break in diplomatic relations with Iran : “ The purpose is to try to make sure that the Iranians play a productive role in Iraq . ”
A blunter assessment of the dark codependency motivating these talks was provided by Iraq ’s Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari : “ The U.S. is a major player and so is Iran , and there will be a room for some substantial discussions for the stability of Iraq . ”
Sure there will , but it will be on Iran ’s terms , and soft - pedaling U.S. opposition to that country ’s nuclear program is a given .
So is the acceptance of a version of Iran ’s theocratic model , exported to formerly secular Iraq .
Talk about desperation .
To bring peace to Iraq , Bush now turns to the very “ rogue regime ” he accuses of threatening the survival of the planet with its nuclear weapons program , not to mention support of worldwide terrorism .
But what choice does he have ?
Many of the key players Bush installed in power in Iraq were trained during decades of exile in Iran , and key Shiite militias , according to U.S. military commanders , are increasingly supplied with deadly explosives from Tehran .
The serious subtext here , rarely noticed by pundits , is that the United States created a vacuum for the vast expansion of Iranian influence throughout the Mideast .
In the creation of a new hegemony , the fervid goal of the neoconservatives led by now - disgraced World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz , our nation appears en route to becoming Tehran ’s junior partner .
Although a military strike against Iran is certainly a continually examined possibility , such action would ignite an anti-American tidal wave in the region , beginning with Iraq .
Of course one should never underestimate the ineptitude of the Bush administration .
The big losers in all this are the ordinary citizens in Iraq and throughout the Mideast who were promised an infusion of democratic ideals in the wake of the invasion .
Instead , they have been left with a widespread resurgence of religious fanaticism .
Never have those fundamentalist forces , which produced 9/11 , been more popular in the Mideast — particularly in Iraq , where al - Qaida was ruthlessly suppressed by Saddam Hussein .
It was particularly odd , writing this on a day when a special World Bank committee issued its devastating report on Wolfowitz ’s corruption of bank standards , to read Vice President Dick Cheney ’s defense of his main henchman in engineering the Iraq invasion .
Cheney described Wolfowitz , the leader in hyping regime change in Iraq as the avenue to democratization , as “ one of the most able public servants I ’ve ever known . ”
Takes one to know one in that strange alchemy of Bush ideologues , where stunning success is the inevitable product of abysmal failure .

The Army is creating a new breed of super - sniper to take on insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan who use innocent women and children for cover .
Until recently the Army 's regiments had an average of just four snipers each and they were taught the basics of their role within their units .
But now senior officers have decided to double the number of snipers - and to train them to a far higher standard on an intensive eight - week course at the Army 's weapons training ground in Brecon , Mid Wales , where they will learn the kind of advanced skills previously limited to units such as the SAS .
More follows ...
To complete their transformation into super - snipers , they will be trained to use a devastating new weapon - the British - made L115A1 rifle which can bring down an enemy target nearly three - quarters of a mile away with remarkable accuracy .
Army insiders say its great advantage is that snipers will be able to kill with a single shot , avoiding the " collateral damage " of hitting innocent bystanders .
Although the L115A1 will not officially be used by regular soldiers until next year , Army sources admitted last night that a small number would probably be trialled in the two war zones in the next few months .
The weapon will replace the less powerful L96 sniper rifle , which has a shorter kill range of just over half a mile .
Most frontline soldiers use the standard Army issue SA80 rifle , accurate only to about a quarter of a mile .
The doubling of sniper numbers will bring the total in the Army to just under 300 .
Depending on military needs , snipers could be seconded between regiments to maximise efficiency .
Sniping has become a vital skill in Iraq and Afghanistan as insurgents increasingly use groups of women and children for cover while launching attacks on British troops .
The new super - snipers will be able to eliminate the gunmen while minimising any risk to the innocent civilians surrounding them .
Top brass believe they will also be able to tackle Iraqi snipers who have been using high - power Russian weapons to target British soldiers in the Basra area .
In a deadly game of cat and mouse , insurgent snipers hide their weapons under their clothes and move around in innocent - looking cars or trucks , melting into a crowd after firing at troops .
Tory MP Patrick Mercer , a former infantry regiment commander , said last night : " The crucial thing is one shot , one kill , with no collateral damage to civilians who may well be used to shield enemy gunmen .
" Sniping is a desperately important skill that requires as much time and resources as the Army can give it . "
Scores of soldiers are clamouring to join the new sniping course .
The first , earlier this year , attracted 20 soldiers .
The current course had 56 men applying for 40 places .
Thirty - nine names are already down for July and 25 per cent of the November course is full .
As well as marksmanship , snipers are also taught how to get into enemy territory without being detected , how to move to a firing position and then how to escape .
The course also covers map reading , observation skills , physical fitness and stalking .
Major Marcus Braithwaite - Exley of the Scots Guards , commanding officer of the Direct Fire Division at Brecon 's Support Weapons School , said that the high - intensity operations in Iraq and Afghanistan had led to the central sniping course being introduced .
Major Braithwaite - Exley said : " Snipers must be able to get into enemy territory without being detected , move to a firing position and escape .
" And while soldiers will be used to firing the SA80 weapon , here they will be equipped with the L96 rifle , which has more sophisticated sights .
" People are very quickly realising the importance and lethality of the sniper on military operations . "
An MoD spokesman said : " Sniping is a vital soldiering skill and we need as many trained snipers as possible . "
Tory Shadow Defence Minister Mark Harper said : " Any improvement in operational capabilities is good news .
" Hopefully this development will start dealing with the threat from insurgent snipers . "
Lithuania 's citizens are shown voting in Vilnius , in this October 10 , 2004 file photo .

VILNIUS ( Reuters ) - Lithuania aims to follow fellow Baltic state Estonia and use the Internet for voting in elections , the government said on Wednesday .
Estonia in March became the first country in the world to allow voting via the Internet in a national parliamentary election .
Other countries are studying the idea .
Lithuania said it hoped to launch its system in time for elections in 2008 .
“ I hope that in this area we will catch up with Estonia , and by doing this we will surpass most European Union states , ” Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas told a news conference .
The government said it approved a program to pave the way for Internet voting at a cost of about 580,000 euros ( $ 797,400 ) .
In Estonia , 3 percent of the 940,000 eligible voters used e-voting .
IMAM DERI ( Swat ) , July 21 : Seven - year - old Shireena is playing in a stream with some other children at a somewhat unusual pre-noon time on a busy working day .
Normally , she stays in her classroom at this hour except during weekends , but today she is not .
She is among more than 2,000 unfortunate girls of the area whose parents have decided to take them out of the schools after cleric Maulana Fazlullah issued an edict declaring girls ’ education ‘ un - Islamic ’ .
According to some locals , a majority of the girls stopped by their parents from attending schools , were the first in their families to have had the opportunity of getting formal education and Shireena was one of them .
The female education ratio in Imam Deri and the nearby Koza Banda , Bara Banda , Kabal and Char Bagh villages is very low .
And things are likely to remain the same with little chances for many families to send their girls to schools after the edict .
Perhaps it was because of the very low literacy rate and vulnerability of the locals to religious propaganda that Maulana Fazlullah chose Imam Deri to build his first markaz — where he wanted to establish his first religious school , his FM radio station and all the facilities to gather people for sermons .
Fazlullah got a befitting response from parents in the area after he declared girls ’ schooling un -Islamic .
According to local journalists and some elders , thousands of parents across Swat followed his edict and stopped girls from attending schools .
The maulana has adopted a successful method of putting various villages into competition .
He announces a fatwa on his radio station and gives the task to a single village to follow it .
Then he announces the number of people from that village who follow the edict and promises them heavenly rewards for taking a step towards the implementation of sharia in the country .
Then he gives the challenge to another village to surpass the first one and the response is always more positive .
“ He is playing with the psyche of simple Pakhtuns who want to be ahead of their neighbours in anything that is meant to spread the cause of Islam , ” says Hidayatullah Khan of the nearby Kanjo village .
When Fazlullah announced recently that polio vaccination was un -Islamic , he followed the same method and the response was amazing .
On the very first day , parents of about 5,000 children refused to get their sons and daughters vaccinated .
The maulana congratulated all those parents on his radio station and appealed to more families to win heavenly rewards .
The next day , the anti-polio teams were denied permission to administer the vaccine to 8,600 children .
The third day saw attacks on vaccination teams in many villages .
The same method enabled Fazlullah to collect donations amounting to about Rs400 million for his markaz project , some locals told Dawn .
They said the money was never deposited in any bank and , till recently , kept in the basement of the under - construction markaz .
They said a large number of women had donated their jewellery for the project .
The radio station has been installed in the building for over a year .
Even after the deployment of 5,000 army and FC men in the Malakand region , the maulana was able to broadcast his recorded messages on Wednesday night , in which he termed the deployment un -Islamic and told the people to wait for his ‘ very important ’ announcement to be made shortly .
Many people in the nearby Mingora city believe that the maulana will keep on giving edicts on various issues as long as he is in control of the radio station and the markaz .
Fazlullah has vanished from the scene after the army deployment but everything is still in his control .
Though Shireena will tell you how she liked her school and wanted to become a doctor , an increase in girls ’ education in the area will remain a dream as long as the maulana is there , issuing edicts , the locals said .
Conyers hints at Bush leak on spying to save Gonzales Michael Roston
Published : Monday July 30 , 2007

In a request for information Monday , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers suggested the Bush administration may have leaked classified information on US spying programs in order to rescue embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales from perjury charges .
" [ W ]e are concerned that this disclosure , stemming from ' current and former officials briefed on the program , ' may simply be an effort to respond via Administration leak of potentially classified information designed to rehabilitate previous controversial testimony by you , " Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , wrote to the Attorney General .
He went on , " In this regard , we would inquire whether you or anyone in your front office has any knowledge or involvement in these leaks , and if so , who and the nature thereof . "
Rep. Conyers was referring to Sunday stories in the Washington Post and New York Times .
The reports suggested that the ' intelligence activities '
Gonzales insisted before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week were distinct from the National Security Agency 's ' warrantless wiretapping ' or Terrorist Surveillance Program were part of a broad data mining effort .
" A 2004 dispute over the National Security Agencys secret surveillance program that led top Justice Department officials to threaten resignation involved computer searches through massive electronic databases , according to current and former officials briefed on the program , " New York Times reporters Scott Shane and David Johnston wrote on Sunday .
The Washington Post 's Dan Eggen and Joby Warrick offered further details about the legal concerns over the data base program .
" One source familiar with the NSA program said yesterday that there were widespread concerns inside the intelligence community in 2003 and 2004 over how much Internet and telephone data mining could occur , as well as about the NSA 's direct intercepts of communications without court approval , " they wrote on Sunday .
If Conyers ' apparent allegation is correct , the leak was conducted in order to protect Gonzales from charges that he perjured himself before Congress last week .
Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey disclosed his 2004 clash with Gonzales , then White House Counsel , over the legality of a surveillance program , but would not identify the program in question .
Conyers also implicitly criticized the administration for allowing this information to leak when they failed to comply with other Congressional requests for information .
" [ A] t a time when the Administration is seeking to make changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , it is imperative that all members of the House Judiciary Committee be fully apprised of these controversial , and possibly unlawful , programs , and any related programs , " he wrote to the Attorney General .
" It is difficult to craft appropriate legislative responses unless we have all of the relevant facts concerning these programs . "
Conyers subsequently asked for " all opinions , memoranda , and background materials , as well as any dissenting views , materials , and opinions regarding the same , concerning the data base program disclosed by the media yesterday . "
The letter from Conyers was also signed by Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) , Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties , and Rep. Robert C. Scott ( D - VA ) , Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism and Homeland Security .
Krugman : Bush led us to war with ' unseemly eagerness '
RAW STORY
Published : Monday May 28 , 2007 Print This Email This
As the nation mourns its fallen troops this Memorial Day , it is important to remember the headlong rush into war that was pursued with " unseemly eagerness " by President Bush and his neoconservative cabal of war architects , New York Times columnist Paul Krugman argues .
" Now that war has turned into an epic disaster , in part because the war 's architects , whom we now know were warned about the risks , did n't want to hear about them , " Krugman wrote in his column Monday .
" Yet Congress seems powerless to stop it .
How did it all go so wrong ? "
The liberal columnist notes that President Bush conflated unrelated enemies in his first State of the Union address after the nation 's worst domestic terrorist attacks when he grouped Iran , Iraq and North Korea -- " three countries that had nothing to do with either Sept. 11 or with each other " -- together in the " axis of evil . "
The Bush administrations scare tactics continue today , as the president warns that Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda , which were not in Iraq before the war started , will be victorious if US troops withdraw from Iraq now that the US invasion has turned the country into a breeding ground for terrorists , Krugman argues .
Noting that Bush mentioned the terrorist leader only seven times in 2003 when he was selling the American public his Iraq invasion snake oil , Krugman says the reemergence of bin Laden 's name in Bush rhetoric proves politicians are not yet convinced that voters will punish his fear - mongering .
Krugman says the 2006 elections expressed Americans ' desire to extricate the country from the disaster that the Iraq war has become , but the politics of fear continues .
Excerpts : #
Here 's the way it ought to be :
When Rudy Giuliani says that Iran , which had nothing to do with Sept. 11 , is part of a " movement " that " has already displayed more aggressive tendencies by coming here and killing us , " he should be treated as a lunatic .
When Mitt Romney says that a coalition of " Shia and Sunni and Hezbollah and Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood and al - Qaida " wants to " bring down the West , " he should be ridiculed for his ignorance .
And when John McCain says that Osama , who is n't in Iraq , will " follow us home " if we leave , he should be laughed at .
But they are n't , at least not yet .
And until belligerent , uninformed posturing starts being treated with the contempt it deserves , men who know nothing of the cost of war will keep sending other people 's children to graves at Arlington .

The Bush - Cheney regime is America ’s first neoconservative regime .
In a few short years , the regime has destroyed the Bill of Rights , the separation of powers , the Geneva Conventions , and the remains of America ’s moral reputation along with the infrastructures of two Muslim countries and countless thousands of Islamic civilians .
Plans have been prepared , and forces moved into place , for an attack on a third Islamic country , Iran , and perhaps Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon as well .
This extraordinary aggressiveness toward the US Constitution , international law , and the Islamic world is the work , not of a vast movement , but of a handful of ideologues  principally Vice President Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Lewis Libby , Douglas Feith , Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle , Elliott Abrams , Zalmay Khalilzad , John Bolton , Philip Zelikow , and Attorney General Gonzales .
These are the main operatives who have controlled policy .
They have been supported by their media shills at the Weekly Standard , National Review , Fox News , New York Times , CNN , and the Wall Street Journal editorial page and by " scholars " in assorted think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute .
The entirety of their success in miring the United States in what could become permanent conflict in the Middle East is based on the power of propaganda and the big lie .
Initially , the 9/11 attack was blamed on Osama bin Laden , but after an American puppet was installed in Afghanistan , the blame for 9/11 was shifted to Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein , who was said to have weapons of mass destruction that would be used against America .
The regime sent Secretary of State Colin Powell to tell the lie to the UN that the Bush - Cheney regime had conclusive proof of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
Having conned the UN , Congress , and the American people , the regime invaded Iraq under totally false pretenses and with totally false expectations .
The regime ’s occupation of Iraq has failed in a military sense , but the neoconservatives are turning their failure into a strategic advantage .
At the beginning of this year President Bush began blaming Iran for America ’s embarrassing defeat by a few thousand lightly armed insurgents in Iraq .
Bush accuses Iran of arming the Iraqi insurgents , a charge that experts regard as improbable .
The Iraqi insurgents are Sunni .
They inflict casualties on our troops , but spend most of their energy killing Iraqi Shi’ites , who are closely allied with Iran , which is Shi’ite .
Bush ’s accusation requires us to believe that Iran is arming the enemies of its allies .
On the basis of this absurd accusation  a pure invention 
Bush has ordered a heavy concentration of aircraft carrier attack forces off Iran ’s coast , and he has moved US attack planes to Turkish bases and other US bases in countries contingent to Iran .
In testimony before Congress on February 1 of this year , former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski said that he expected the regime to orchestrate a " head - on conflict with Iran and with much of the world of Islam at large . "
He said a plausible scenario was " a terrorist act blamed on Iran , culminating in a ‘ defensive ’ US military action against Iran . "
He said that the neoconservative propaganda machine was already articulating a " mythical historical narrative " for widening their war against Islam .
Why is the US spending one trillion dollars on wars , the reasons for which are patently false .
What is going on ?
There are several parts to the answer .
Like their forebears among the Jacobins of the French Revolution , the Bolsheviks of the communist revolution , and the National Socialists of Hitler ’s revolution , neoconservatives believe that they have a monopoly on virtue and the right to impose hegemony on the rest of the world .
Neoconservative conquests began in the Middle East because oil and Israel , with which neocons are closely allied , are both in the Middle East .
The American oil giant , UNOCAL , had plans for an oil and gas pipeline through Afghanistan , but the Taliban were not sufficiently cooperative .
The US invasion of Afghanistan was used to install Hamid Karzai , who had been on UNOCAL ’s payroll , as puppet prime minister .
US neoconservative Zalmay Khalilzad , who also had been on UNOCAL ’s payroll , was installed as US ambassador to Afghanistan .
Two years later Khalilzad was appointed US ambassador to Iraq .
American oil companies have been given control over the exploitation of Iraq ’s oil resources .
The Israeli relationship is perhaps even more important .
In 1996 Richard Perle and the usual collection of neocons proposed that all of Israel ’s enemies in the Middle East be overthrown .
" Israel ’s enemies " consist of the Muslim countries not in the hands of US puppets or allies .
For decades Israel has been stealing Palestine from the Palestinians such that today there is not enough of Palestine left to comprise an independent country .
The US and Israeli governments blame Iran , Iraq , and Syria for aiding and abetting Palestinian resistance to Israel ’s theft of Palestine .
The Bush - Cheney regime came to power with the plans drawn to attack the remaining independent countries in the Middle East and with neoconservatives in office to implement the plans .
However , an excuse was required .
Neoconservatives had called for " a new Pearl Harbor , " and 9/11 provided the propaganda event needed in order to stampede the public and Congress into war .
Neoconservative Philip Zelikow was put in charge of the 9/11 Commission Report to make certain no uncomfortable facts emerged .
The neoconservatives have had enormous help from the corporate media , from Christian evangelicals , particularly from the " Rapture Evangelicals , " from flag - waving superpatriots , and from the military - industrial complex whose profits have prospered .
But the fact remains that the dozen men named in the second paragraph above were able to overthrow the US Constitution and launch military aggression under the guise of a preventive / preemptive " war against terrorism . "
When the American people caught on that the " war on terror " was a cloak for wars of aggression , they put Democrats in control of Congress in order to apply a brake to the regime ’s warmongering .
However , the Democrats have proven to be impotent to stop the neoconservative drive to wider war and , perhaps , world conflagration .
We are witnessing the triumph of a dozen evil men over American democracy and a free press .
Sen . Dick Durbin made a passioned plea in Congress on the Iraq war .
He called out the Republicans obstructionism on the war and Mitch McConnell 's 60 vote straw - man argument .
Also , CNN called it a " theatrical " event by the Democratic Party .
We 're talking about war and hell and these idiots are bringing in Broadway .

Durbin :
Once again I would ask the minority leader from KY , please look at the record .
What you said earlier on the floor is not accurate ....
One of the critics of this recently called it a stunt .
A stunt !
A stunt that we would stay in session .
A stunt that we would have a sleepless night for Senators .
I do n't think it 's a stunt .
I think it reflects the reality of this war .
How many sleepless night have our soldiers and their families spent ?
( Full rough transcript below the fold . )
MR. DURBIN : THANK YOU , MR .
PRESIDENT .
AND I WANT TO THANK THE
SENATOR FROM RHODE ISLAND FOR HIS HARD WORK WITH THE SENATOR
FROM MICHIGAN IN PREPARING THIS BILL ON DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION .
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE REPUBLICAN MINORITY LEADER , THE
STATEMENT THAT HE MADE EARLIER ON THE FLOOR IS NOT ACCURATE .
THE REPUBLICAN MINORITY LEADER SAID THAT ON ISSUES RELATING TO
IRAQ , WE HAVE REQUIRED 60 VOTES .
I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE
REPUBLICAN MINORITY LEADER THAT THE VOTE ON THE TIMETABLE , ON
THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION
BILL WAS A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE .
IT WAS NOT A 60 - VOTE THRESHOLD .
THE MOST IMPORTANT IRAQ VOTE OF
THE YEAR DID NOT REQUIRE 60 VOTES ON THE FLOOR OF THE SE
SENATE .
IT PASSED THE SENATE WITH A BIPARTISAN ROLL CALL 51 OR
52 MEMBERS SUPPORTING IT AND IT WAS SENT TO PRESIDENT BUSH FOR
ONE OF HIS ONLY THREE VETOES SINCE HE'S BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT .
I 'M SURE THAT THE MINORITY LEADER FROM KENTUCKY REMEMBERS IT
WAS NOT A 60 - VOTE REQUIREMENT .
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL HERE .
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL .
ONCE AGAIN , I WOULD ASK THE MINORITY LEADER FROM KENTUCKY , PLEASE LOOK AT THE RECORD .
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER ON THE FLOOR IS NOT ACCURATE .
IN THE LAST DEBATE ON THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL , THERE WERE TWO IRAQ AMENDMENTS OFFERED .
ONE BY SENATORS LEVIN AND REED , ANOTHER BY SENATOR KERRY .
BOTH RELATED TO THE WAR IN IRAQ AND
BOTH REQUIRED ONLY A MAJORITY VOTE .
THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY HAS NOT ACCURATELY PORTRAYED WHAT OCCURRED ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE EITHER WITH OUR SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL OR THE PREVIOUS DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL .
NOW , FOR THOSE WHO ARE FOLLOWING THIS DEBATE WONDERING WHY ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HOW MANY VOTES ARE REQUIRED , THIS IS WHAT THE SENATE IS ALL ABOUT .
THE QUESTION IS , WILL THIS SENATE SPEAK ON THE ISSUE OF THE POLICY IN THE WAR IN IRAQ .
THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY
UNDERSTANDS , BECAUSE HE'S BEEN A VETERAN OF THIS BODY , THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE SENATORS SUPPORTING HIS POSITION OR THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT BUSH .
AND SO HE STARTED THIS DEBATE BY SAYING , WE WON'T ALLOW A MAJORITY VOTE T. WILL TAKE 60 VOTES -- VOTE .
IT WILL TAKE 60 VOTES , 60 % OF THE SENATE TO CHANGE THE POLICY ON THE WAR IN IRAQ .
THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY IS BETTING THAT HE CAN HOLD ENOUGH REPUBLICAN SENATORS BACK FROM VOTING FOR A CHANGE IN POLICY ON THE WAR IN IRAQ TO
DEFEAT OUR EFFORTS TO START BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS HOME .
THAT IS HIS PROCEDURAL APPROACH TO THIS .
HE HAS STOOD BY IT .
BUT HE SHOULD CONFESS IT FOR WHAT IT IS .
IT IS A DEPARTURE FROM WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ON THE DEBATE ON IRAQ , BOTH ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL AND ON THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL .
AND , MR .
PRESIDENT , IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND IT'S WRONG .
IT IS WRONG TO REQUIRE 60 % OF THIS BODY TO VOTE THIS WAY IF TRADITIONALLY ON THIS WAR IN IRAQ WE'VE REQUIRED ONLY A SIMPLE MAJORITY .
I
SUPPOSE IT'S ENCOURAGING TO US THAT MORE THAN 60 % OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET IT .
THEY UNDERSTAND HOW FAILED THIS POLICY HAS BEEN OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION , THE POLICY THAT'S BEING SUPPORTED BY THE MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE .
THEY UNDERSTAND IT .
THEY WANT US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT .
BUT THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY HAS THROWN THIS OBSTACLE IN OUR PATH .
HE HAS CREATED THIS PROCEDURAL ROADBLOCK .
HE HAS FILIBUSTERED -- STARTING A FILIBUSTER TO STOP THE DEBATE ON THE WAR IN IRAQ .
NOW , I'VE BEEN HERE FOR FOR A FEW YEARS AND I HAVEN'T -- NOW , I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A FEW YEARS , AND I HAVEN'T SEEN A FULL - THROATED , FULLY IMPLEMENTED FILIBUSTER , THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE RECALLED FROM " MR .
SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON , " WHEN JIMMY STEWART STOOD AT HIS DESK UNTIL HE CRUMPLED IN EXHAUSTION , FILIBUSTERING A BILL TO STOP IT .
OVER THE YEARS , OUR GENTILITY HAS LED TO US A DIFFERENT KIND OF FILIBUSTER .
IT 'S A FILIBUSTER IN NAME ONLY , WHERE ONE SIDE SAYS , WELL , WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP THIS DEBATE GOING ON INDEFINITELY AND THE OTHER SIDE SAYS ,
WE'LL BRING THE DEBATE TO A CLOSE , A MOTION FOR CLOTURE , BRINGING IT TO A CLOSE AND WE'LL SEE YOU IN 30 HOURS .
HAVE A GOOD TIME .
NEIGHBOR YOU WANT TO GO BACK AND HAVE A NICE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS .
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING .
WELL , WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT PROCEDURE THIS WEEK .
SINCE THE REPUBLICAN SIDE HAS DECIDED THAT THEY WANT TO FILIBUSTER OUR EFFORT TO DEBATE THE WAR POLICY ON IRAQ , WE HAVE DECIDED ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REAL FILIBUSTER .
ONE OF THE CRITICS OF THIS RECENTLY CALLED IT A STUNT , A STUNT THAT WE
WOULD STAY IN SESSION , A STUNT THAT WE WOULD HAVE A SLEEPLESS NIGHT FOR SENATORS , A STUNT THAT WE WOULD INCONVENIENCE SENATORS AND STAFF AND PRESS AND THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE PROCEEDINGS .
I DON'T THINK IT'S A STUNT .
I THINK IT REFLECTS THE REALITY OF THIS WAR .
HOW MANY SLEEPLESSNESS OF NIGHTS HAVE OUR SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES SPENT WAITING TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEY'LL COME HOME ALIVE .
HOW MANY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS HAVE THEY SPENT PRAYING THAT AFTER THE SCPEKD THIRD REDEPLOYMENT
THAT THEIR SOLDIER WILL STILL HAVE THE COURAGE AND SENG TO BEAT BACK THE ENEMY AND COME HOME TO HIS FAMILY ?
IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR THE SEND TO SPEND AT LEAST ONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT .
MAYBE IT'S ONLY A SYMBOL BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL FOR THE SOLDIERS AND FAMILY T. REALLY GOES TO THE NATURE OF -- FAMILY .
IT REALLY GOES TO THE NATURE OF SACRIFICE .
I GUESS I WAS RAISED AS A LITTLE BOY READING ABOUT WORLD WAR II AND REMEMBERING THE KOREAN WAR WHEN MY TWO BROTHERS SERVED .
THERE WAS A SENSE OF NATIONAL COMMITMENT IN THOSE WARS .
PEOPLE BACK
HOME AS WELL AS THOSE ON THE FRONT FELT THEY WERE IN IT TOGETHER .
SACRIFICES HAD TO BE MADE IN YOUR DAILY LIVING HABITS AND THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU COULD BUY AND RATION CARDS AND BUYING U.S. SAVINGS BONDS .
AMERICA WAS REALLY ONE UNITED NATION IN THOSE WARS .
WE ACCEPTED THAT SHARED SACRIFICE .
WE WERE BETTER FOR THAT SHARED SACRIFICE .
BUT THIS WAR , SAD TO SAY THIS PRESIDENT HAS NOT SUMMONED THAT SAME SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE .
HE'S BASICALLY TOLD US THAT THIS WAR CAN BE WAGED WITHOUT INCONVENIENCING THE LIVES OF MOST AMERICANS .
OUR SOLDIERS GO
THROUGH MORE THAN INCONVENIENCE .
THEY GO THROUGH HARDSHIP AND DEPRIVATION .
MANY OF THEM FACE INJURY AND DEATH IN SERVING OUR COUNTRY .
BUT FOR MOST OF US , LIFE GOES ON AS NORMAL .
THIS PRESIDENT HAS NOT ASKED GREAT SACRIFICE FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO EVEN SUPPORT THESE TROOPS .
WHEN I VISITED IRAQ , IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A MARINE OR SOLDIER OVER LUNCH SAY TO ME , " SENATOR , DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO OVER HERE ? " " DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST ? " IT 'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION .
WE FOCUS ON THESE SUPERFICIAL STORIES IN THE PRESS
THAT DON'T MEAN A THING AND FORGET THE OBVIOUS .
AND THE OBVIOUS IS THIS , MR .
PRESIDENT .
EVERY MONTH -- EVERY MONTH WE ARE LOSING AMERICAN LIVES .
ABOUT 100 AMERICAN SOLDIERS DIE EACH MONTH IN THIS WAR IN IRAQ .
1,000 ARE SERIOUSLY INJURED .
WE SPEND $ 12 BILLION EACH MONTH .
THAT'S THE REALITY .
I KNOW THAT THERE'S FRUSTRATION BY THESE SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT WE AREN'T PAYING CLOSE ENOUGH ATTENTION .
BUT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THIS FAILED POLICY FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS TO -- THAT THIS FAILED POLICY FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS TO COME TO AN END .
WASN'T IT INTERESTING OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER OF IRAQ INVITED US TO LEAVE AND SAID , YOU CAN TAKE OFF ANY TIME YOU'D LIKE , AMERICA ; WE'LL TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN PROBLEMS ?
PRIME MINISTER AL MALAKI , THE MAN WE HOPE -- HELPED TO BRING TO OFFICE , THE ONE WE'RE HOPING WILL SHOW THE LEADERSHIP IN IRAQ FOR ITS FUTURE HAS ASKED AMERICA TO PICK UP AND GO WHENEVER THEY'D LIKE TO .
WHAT DO THE AMERICAN -- WHAT DO THE IRAQI PEOPLE THINK ABOUT OUR PRESENCE ?
69 % OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE SAY OUR PRESENCE IN IRAQ TODAY WITH OUR TROOPS MAKES IT MORE DANGEROUS TO LIVE THERE .
MORE THAN 2 MILLION OF THOSE SOLDIERS -- OF THOSE IRAQIS HAVE LEFT THAT COUNTRY AS REFUGEES .
MILLIONS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES .
THOUSANDS -- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NUMBER -- HAVE BEEN INJURED AND KILLED .
AND THEY WANT US TO LEAVE , THIS OCCUPATION ARMY OF AMERICANS .
WHAT DO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS OCCUPATION IN IRAQ ?
THEY WANT IT TO END AS WELL .
THEY DON'T SEE ANY END IN SIGHT .
THEY DON'T HEAR FROM THIS PRESIDENT THE KIND OF STRATEGY OR DIRECTION THAT LEADS THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL END WELL OR END SOON .
AND THEY WANT OUR TROOPS TO START COMING HOME AND I AGREE WITH THEM .
I DON'T BELIEVE THE IRAQIS WILL STAND UP AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRY UNTIL WE START LEAVING .
IF THE IRAQIS KNOW THAT EVERY TIME THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THEIR COUNTRY , THEY CAN DIAL 911 AND BRING ON 20,000 OF OUR BEST AND BRAVEST SOLDIERS TO QUELL THE VIOLENCE IN THEIR STREETS , WHAT KIND OF INCENTIVE IS THAT FOR THEM TO PROTECT
THEIR OWN COUNTRY ?
WHAT KIND OF INCENTIVE IS THAT FOR THEM TO MAKE THE CRITICAL POLITICAL DECISIONS WHICH MAY LEAD ONE DAY TO STABILITY ?
I LOOK AT THIS CORNYN AMENDMENT , WHICH WAS JUST FILED , AND I RESPECT MY COLLEAGUE FROM TEXAS .
BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING .
HE'S ASKING FOR TOO MUCH .
HE'S ASKING THE UNITED STATES TO STAY IN IRAQ TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT IT SUCCEEDS .
NOW , HOW LONG IS THAT GOING TO BE ?
HOW LONG WILL THAT GO ON ?
Other philosophers disagree on the degree and nature of such “ freedom . ”
Their arguments partly turn on the extent to which collections of things , whether electrons or people , can transcend their origins and produce novel phenomena .
These so - called emergent phenomena , like brains and stock markets , or the idea of democracy , grow naturally in accordance with the laws of physics , so the story goes .
But once they are here , they play by new rules , and can even act on their constituents , as when an artist envisions a teapot and then sculpts it — a concept sometimes known as “ downward causation . ”
A knowledge of quarks is no help in predicting hurricanes — it ’s physics all the way down .
But does the same apply to the stock market or to the brain ?
Are the rules elusive just because we can’t solve the equations or because something fundamentally new happens when we increase numbers and levels of complexity ?
Opinions vary about whether it will ultimately prove to be physics all the way down , total independence from physics , or some shade in between , and thus how free we are .
Dr. Silberstein , the Elizabethtown College professor , said , “ There ’s nothing in fundamental physics by itself that tells us we can’t have such emergent properties when we get to different levels of complexities . ”
He waxed poetically as he imagined how the universe would evolve , with more and more complicated forms emerging from primordial quantum muck as from an elaborate computer game , in accordance with a few simple rules : “ If you understand , you ought to be awestruck , you ought to be bowled over . ”
George R. F. Ellis , a cosmologist at the University of Cape Town , said that freedom could emerge from this framework as well .
“ A nuclear bomb , for example , proceeds to detonate according to the laws of nuclear physics , ” he explained in an e-mail message .
“ Whether it does indeed detonate is determined by political and ethical considerations , which are of a completely different order . ”
I have to admit that I find these kind of ideas inspiring , if not liberating .
But I worry that I am being sold a sort of psychic perpetual motion machine .
Free wills , ideas , phenomena created by physics but not accountable to it .
Do they offer a release from the chains of determinism or just a prescription for a very intricate weave of the links ?
And so I sought clarity from mathematicians and computer scientists .
According to deep mathematical principles , they say , even machines can become too complicated to predict their own behavior and would labor under the delusion of free will .

If by free will we mean the ability to choose , even a simple laptop computer has some kind of free will , said Seth Lloyd , an expert on quantum computing and professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
XMLHttpRequest 2
Since the first version of XMLHttpRequest is now more or less stable ( last XMLHttpRequest draft published three days ago ) I have been thinking a little bit about what type of enhancements we can make for XMLHttpRequest version 2 .
Here is one thing I have been thinking about :
// start " script block " var r = new XMLHttpRequest ( uri ) ; // uri argument causes implicit invocation of r.open ( " GET " , uri ) r.setRequestHeader( " Accept " , " text / html " ) r.onload = function ( ) { … } r.onerror = function ( ) { … } r.onabort = function ( ) { … } // end " script block " causes implicit invocation of r.send ( )
This is similar to how new Audio ( uri ) works in HTML5 and I think it is rather elegant .
I think some browser extensions such as overrideMimeType to set the MIME type and responseBody to get a byte array of the response will also be added and maybe a way to better determine what exactly made the request fail .
We will also be looking into integrating it with the Progress Events draft so you can track uploading and downloading of data more accurately .
Finally , in combination with the Enabling Read Access for Web Resources draft we can allow cross domain requests as I mentioned earlier .

Common sense dictates that you should never fully rely upon someone else to do fact checking for you .
But who has time for common sense ?
If you ’re reading this page , chances are you ’re here because something about one or all of the entries in The Repository Of Lost Legends ( TROLL ) section of this site struck you as a tadge suspect , if not downright wrong .
If any or all of the stories in this section caused your internal clue phone to ring , we hope you did n’t let the answering machine take the call .
That niggling little voice of common sense whispering to you in the background was right — there was something wrong with what you read .
You ’ve just had an encounter with False Authority Syndrome .
Everything in this section is a spoof .
Mister
Ed was no more a zebra than the origin of the nursery rhyme Sing a Song of Sixpence had anything to do with pirates on a recruiting drive .
As for Mississippi ’s doing away with teaching fractions and decimals in its school systems because kids find them too hard to master , that ’s no more true than Kentucky ’s imposing a licensing fee on uses of its name , Edgar Rice Burroughs ’ naming his celebrated apeman after the city he lived in ( other way around , actually ) , George Bernard Shaw ’s penning a poorly - attended play called Closed For Remodeling , passengers on the Titanic viewing a 1912 silent version of The Poseidon Adventure while their doomed ship was sinking out from under them , the design of California ’s flag being the result of “ pear ” being taken for “ bear , ” or mobile homes having gained their name from the city in which they were first manufactured .
What is the point of the Lost Legends section , you say ?
Is it merely an exercise in creative writing , perhaps a way to blow off steam when the pressure of having to be mind - numbingly factual about everything gets to us ?
Does it provide us with a gratuitous opportunity to guffaw at how easily folks are duped into believing outrageous things ?
Or are we suicidally intent upon giving our valued readers good reason to doubt the credibility of everything else on the site ?
Granted , a small part of the motivation to create such a section stems from our need to let a sense of whimsy get the better of us once in a while , and yes , some days the grind of having to be utterly factual about everything does weigh on us a bit .
But the Lost Legends actually serve a higher purpose than merely existing as an out - of - the - way pasture a couple of writers can occasionally have a good frolic in .
This section graphically demonstrates the pitfalls of falling into the lazy habit of taking as gospel any one information outlet ’s unsupported word .
We could have put up a page saying “ Do n’t believe everything you read , no matter how trustworthy the source , ” but that would n’t have conveyed the message half as well as showing through direct example just how easy it is to fall into the “ I got it from so - and - so , therefore it must be true ” mindset .
That ’s the same mindset that powers urban legends , the same basic mistake that impels countless well - meaning folks to confidently assert “ True story ; my aunt ( husband , best friend , co-worker , boss , teacher , minister ) told me so . ”
No single truth purveyor , no matter how reliable , should be considered an infallible font of accurate information .
Folks make mistakes .
Or they get duped .
Or they have a bad day at the fact - checking bureau .
Or some days they ’re just being silly .
To not allow for any of this is to risk stepping into a pothole the size of Lake Superior .
It ’s just as much a mistake to look to a usually - reliable source to do all of the thinking , judging , and weighing as it was to unquestioningly believe every unsigned e-mail that came along .
Far too many have transferred the same breathlessly unbounded faith they used to accord various bits of e-tripe to those who make it their life ’s work to get to the bottom of crazy stories .
It ’s sad to say , but the behavior of abdicating responsibility remains the same even though who is being believed has changed .
It ’s still an abdication .
“ You just keep on thinking , Butch ; that ’s what you ’re good at , ” works as a life philosophy only if you ’re the Sundance Kid .
And most of us ai n’t .
What does this mean , then — do n’t believe anything , no matter who researches and presents it ?
Hardly .
When facts are needed , it ’s still right to turn to news and information outlets that have a proven track record for providing good information .
The trick is to recognize the dividing line between “ reliable ” and “ infallible ” and thus learn how to avoid throwing oneself bodily across it .
Or , in other words , do n’t throw the common sense out with the bathwater .
Common sense dictates that a black - and - white quadruped is still going to look like a zebra on a black - and - white TV , and all the authoritative - looking cites to the contrary should n’t persuade one otherwise .
Next time you ’re tempted to believe something that runs contrary to common sense just because someone knowledgeable touts it , remember Mister Ed .
More folks than it bears thinking about turned their backs on their own common sense rather than disbelieve an outlet they ’d lazily come to have unshakeable faith in .
The world is filled with information and misinformation , and picking a path through this minefield will never amount to finding the One True Authority to utterly rely upon .
Figuring out which way is up will always require the use of common sense because , as we ’re about to see , even the authorities one would otherwise count on to always be dealing off the top of the deck will sometimes get it horribly wrong .
Professors sometimes pass along unverifiable rumor as if it were the truth ( e.g. wild - ass speculation about a well - known actress ’ genetic makeup is routinely offered to biology classes as a factual example of a particular medical condition ) , and sometimes they impart off - the - wall claims to their students as the plain unvarnished truth .
Textbooks themselves frequently include numerous factual errors .
Although seeking an education from those provably more knowledgeable is a good thing , allowing that education to amount to “ my teacher told me this , so it must be true ” is a mistake of breathtaking magnitude .
Teachers are people too , and they sometimes fail to do all the checking they should before presenting an informative tidbit to a class .
Or they ( like anyone else ) rely on the certainty of a friend who imparted that particular tidbit .
Either way , there ’s room in this formula for bad information to come from a good source even when the source has nothing but the purest of intentions .
Likewise , members of the clergy , police officers , and anyone else you might instinctively view as inherently trustworthy authority figures have time and again proved they were just as capable as anyone of passing along misinformation as if it were fact .
Examine the statements made by Father Michael Kennedy about a possible AIDS Mary in his parish for examples of the clergy taking a hand in furthering legends .
Try to imagine from how many pulpits the Madalyn Murray O’Hair , Procter and Gamble , and “ gay Jesus film ” scares were delivered from .
As for the police , a quick look at the history of the Lights Out !
hoax reveals how often this canard was passed along as 100 % fact by the very group one would hope not only is always protecting us but also knows more about these matters than anyone .
Some policemen have also over the years chosen to present impossible urban legends as incidents that happened to them ( e.g. , the RV Siphoner tale ) .
Okay , you say , so you ca n’t trust individuals placed in positions of authority to always filter out every bit of misinformation that comes their way before passing it along to their students , parishioners , patients , and citizens .
People are fallible , and it ’s reasonable to assume that at some future unspecified date any one of these presumed paragons will pass along as rock - solid fact some specious bit of knowledge they failed to first properly vet on your behalf .
But what about monolithic entities such as wire services , highly respected newspapers , and television news shows ?
They have fact checkers on staff , and these news outlets are in the business of providing information you can trust , after all .
Are n’t they perfectly reliable ?
The answer is no .
Even the best of the best of them will at times drop the ball .

Okay , so even the big boys have fallen off the beam at times , thus proving it ’s a mistake to worship at even their feet .
What ’s an aspiring skeptic to do when common sense whispers one thing and a trusted source shouts another ?
The answer is startlingly simple : Look for more information .
That internal taffy - pull should be interpreted as a sign that more legwork is needed before a position — pro or con — can be adopted .
Rather than arbitrarily throwing belief in either direction ( “ My teacher would n’t lie ” versus “ My teacher must be wrong about this ” ) , make the effort to find out which is right , this time by consulting a variety of sources .
Among other things ( including providing a good read and some wonderful belly laughs ) , we hope this site helps our visitors learn to judge the quality of information presented to them .
We ’d like to think those who stop by here learn a little something about what steps to mentally take when pondering the eternal “ hoax or true ? ” question .
As wonderfully gratifying as it is to be regarded as infallible , we ’d much rather see our visitors discover the key to their own abilities .
Are we being a bit too strident in our warning against succumbing to the allure of relying on others to do all of the vetting of suspect tales ?
Perhaps , but based on the number of puzzled messages we ’ve received from incredulous readers who were surprised to discover that , in spite of what they read here , Mr. Ed was n’t really a zebra , we do n’t think so .
What 's in your wallet ?
What 's a paltry one million dollars to a member of Congress ?
Well , apparently not enough to know if an organization about to receive that big block of cash actually exists .
Republican Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona , the fiscal crusader who 's never met an earmark he likes , questioned Democratic Rep. Peter J. Visclosky of Indiana on the House floor Tuesday about whether the Center for Instrumented Critical Infrastructure actually exists - since , hey , it 's getting like a million bucks or something .
Visclosky , who chairs the spending subcommittee responsible for the project , had to admit that , well , he did n't have a clue .
After a lengthy back - and - forth , Flake , complaining that his staff could n't find a website for the center , asked Visclosky , " Does the center currently exist ? "
" At this time , I do not know , " the Indiana Democrat replied .
" But if it does not exist , the monies could not go to it . "
And who could possibly be the sponsor of such an earmark ?
Yes , you guessed it , the man Republicans love to hate , Pennsylvania Democrat John P. Murtha .
Despite the money 's uncertain destination , the House rejected Flake 's measure to strike the funds , 326-98 .
And the Visclosky bill also sailed through , 312 - 112 .
As I said , what 's one million dollars to a member of Congress ?
UPDATE : I failed to report last night that a certificate filed with the requested funds says the money is actually earmarked to Concurrent Technologies Corporation , a nonprofit technological consulting firm .
A brief search of campaign finance records shows CTC President and CEO Daniel R. DeVos , of alternately Central City and Johnstown , Pa. has contributed $ 7,000 to Murtha 's reelection campaign since April 2002 .
Dealing with past trauma is not an easy task , especially when some try to invent it themselves .
Unfortunately , many believe that the only way to deal with trauma is to ignore or block their memory ;
There are no healthy or long - term ways to deal with such trauma .

SawStop is a safety feature that immediately stops and retracts a spinning saw blade if it comes in contact with anything that even remotely resembles your finger .
Check out the startling video above , where it practically self - destructs in order to save this innocent hot dog 's life .
If that were actually your finger , you would escape with just a scratch and maybe need a stitch or two rather than running around your woodshop looking for your finger .
How does it work ?
The SawStop safety system includes an electronic detection system that detects when a person contacts the blade .
The system induces an electrical signal onto the blade and then monitors that signal for changes .
The human body has a relatively large inherent electrical capacitance and conductivity which cause the signal to drop when a person contacts the blade .
Wood has a relatively small inherent capacitance and conductivity and does not cause the signal to drop .
A fast - acting brake stops the blade when contact is detected .

This invention has been around for a half a decade , but we 're wondering why every saw in the world does n't have this technology on board .
It 's not a retrofit ; a saw must be built around this mechanism .
How many fingers have been lost since its invention , because manufacturers were afraid the extra $ 100 it would add to the cost of the saw might drive buyers away ?

Aggressive wars are immoral : mass murder is unforgivable , and our foreign policy of global interventionism puts us in the same moral class as any of the European imperialist powers that blundered their way through Africa , East Asia , the Americas , and the Middle East .
Anti-imperialism is , first and foremost , a moral position , especially for Americans , who have always utilized the world stage to dramatize their own virtue .
Yet the question of how , when , and if we ought to intervene abroad , either militarily or in some other , less obtrusive manner , can also be settled in its own terms .
The case against interventionism can be made in a purely practical , empirical framework : i.e. it can be shown that it just does n’t work .
Not because the wrong people are in charge , not due to incompetence , the wearing of ideological blinders , or some other disability or shortcoming on the part of policymakers  but because it is simply not possible , no matter who is in charge .
What rules out any really effective foreign intervention , either military or economic ( i.e. taxpayer - funded “ aid ” programs of one sort or another ) , is the sheer complexity of the terrain we find ourselves on .
There are just too many factors to fit comfortably into convenient equations , too many layers of historical debris to uncover and clear away , too many ancient disputes that can only be dimly understood by outsiders .
The common complaint , by war critics and the neocons , is that there was n’t enough “ planning ” done by the administration , that insufficient resources made available to the Iraq war effort , etc. , etc .
Yet no amount of resources deployed under the constraints of even the most meticulous , well - thought - out plan can achieve what we set out to do in Iraq , i.e. create a stable democratic ally , or even a stable replacement for the despotism we upended .
To take just one example , close at hand , take a look at the reporting done on the horrific bombing of a village outside Mosul in northern Iraq , in which the death toll may rise to 500 .
The village was populated almost entirely by Yezidis , members of an obscure pre-Islamic sect the origins of which are lost in the mists of time .
The death toll from this series of suicide bombings was so high because the desperately poor Yazidis live packed very close together in mud-brick compounds .
The U.S. government is pointing to al Qaeda as the perpetrator of this horrendous atrocity , while Patrick Cockburn attributes it to “ Sunni Arab Jihadi insurgents , ” , and we have yet a third explanation from a commenter on Juan Cole ’s blog , who sees the dispute rooted in the land question and the displacement of Yazidi and Arab settlers , and points to a different culprit :
“ The Yezidis captured a video of Izzat ad - Duri meeting with Saddam Hussein in 1998 or so in which he suggested eliminating the Yezidis in Sinjar completely .
Saddam allegedly demurred , but Izzat ad - Duri is feared and reviled by the Yezidis .
The authors of this bombing may well be linked to the reorganized Ba’ath , under Izzat ad - Duri , even if they managed to find some foreign youths to drive the vehicles and blow themselves up . ”
The administration has targeted al Qaeda as the reason we ’re in Iraq , and so every major atrocity must be attributed to them , and yet the reality is much more complex than this paradigm allows .
And the question arises : if we ca n’t know with reasonable certainty who or what was behind this latest atrocity , the biggest single mass killing since the invasion itself , then what can we know ?
How much can we know about what is really going on in Iraq ?
This is really the crux of the matter : it ’s irrelevant how much planning we do , or how vast are our resources , because it boils down to a knowledge problem  one that has no solution .
The truth is that there are too many factors , too much history , too many past injustices to rectify , and no way of either gaining or integrating such a massive quantity of knowledge and applying it to the decision - making process .
Cockburn warns that the northern part of Iraq , including parts of Kurdistan , is the next site of violent conflict : tensions are rising over possession of oil rights , centered around Kirkuk , and land rights disputes rooted in Saddam Hussein ’s population transfer programs , which pit Arabs against Kurds .
Caught in the middle are the Yazidis , who have traditionally tried to play off the various ethnic and religious factions against each other and thus protect themselves .
I offer this capsule description of a complex situation in the full knowledge that it provides only a shadow of the true picture , which is infinitely more variegated and rich than I could possibly communicate in anything less than a three - volume treatise .
I am not conceited enough to believe that I truly understand what the situation is on the ground , nor am I convinced that , even if I went to live there for a time , that I , as an outsider , born in a very different set of circumstances , could ever truly comprehend what the region ’s conflicts are all about , let alone how best to navigate them .
The conceit that we can understand , let alone decisively influence for the better , the complex interplay of historical , religious , and cultural factors operating in Iraq is what motivates the War Party to soldier on .
What ’s interesting is that this has been recognized by conservatives as a conceit , and a potentially fatal one , when it is exercised on the home front : massive social engineering projects like the so - called Great Society , the New Deal , etc. , have traditionally been rejected by American conservatives , who see the dead hand of government as hopelessly incompetent and dangerously empowered by these ultimately quixotic gestures .
Yet , today , they have their own New Deal for the Middle East .
Bush ’s New Deal for Iraq , a program of military occupation and economic “ reconstruction , ” is failing not because insufficient money is being spent  at a price tag of two trillion , our investment is considerable  and not due to incompetence or bad planning , but because we have reached the outer limits of American power .
We are simply not qualified to sit in judgement and decide the age - old disputes of the Yazidi versus the Muslims , the Arabs versus the Kurds , the Sunnis versus the Shi’ites , not to mention the conflicts between various clans , tribes , and sub-clans .
Yet , as the de facto authority in Iraq , that is precisely what we must do , and it can only lead to a bottomless quagmire .
Which is precisely where we find ourselves today .
As a libertarian , I am opposed to central planning on principle : it could n’t work in Iraq for precisely the same reasons it did n’t work in the Soviet Union , and does n’t work anywhere .
However , at least the domestic advocates of economic planning in the US are reasonably close to , and knowledgeable about , the people whose fates they would hold in their hands .
In the case of our “ conservative ” planners , who would map out the future of a foreign country on their drawing boards , they are treading on largely unknown terrain , without any first - hand knowledge or experience to guide them even provisionally .
This is worse than hubris : it is sheer stupidity .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Our summer fundraising campaign is faltering , and I ’m beginning to panic .
Yes , I know , we ’ve always made it , but there ’s always a first time  and , believe me , our first time will be our last .
Because if we do n’t make our fundraising goal , I ca n’t assure you that this column will continue  or that Antiwar.com will continue , for that matter .
We depend entirely on the large quantity of typically small contributions that our readers and supporters send in , four times a year , to keep our heads above water .
But the water , I ’m afraid , is rising quickly , and we ’re already gasping for air .
So , c’mon , let ’s get cracking : the last thing we need is the loss of Antiwar.com .
That would sure make the War Party inordinately happy  and with good reason .
They would n’t have us calling them out on their lies , their shameless profiteering , their endless political maneuvering  and that would be , for them , quite a relief .
Look , we do n’t need much : comparable nonprofits our size require a lot more .
We do a lot with much less .
Help us get what we need to continue one of the most cost - effective activist efforts ever  send in your 100 % tax - deductible donation today .
Oh , and by the way : I m writing regularly for Taki ’s Top Drawer , and the latest is my analysis of the post - Ames GOP : check it out .
This document follows on from this page which uses R to analyse an Acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) microarray dataset , producing a heatmap ( with dendrograms ) of genes differentially expressed between two types of leukemia .
On this page I deal with how to do this using Python and RPy .
Before we start ...
As explained on this page , I am assuming you have :
a recent version of R ( from The R Project )
a recent version of rpy 1.x ( not the new rpy 2.x which would require updating the examples )
BioConductor
The acute lymphocytic leukemia dataset , installed as the R ALL package .
I 'm also assuming you have read through the example in pure R .
Heatmaps from Python - Plan ( A )
So , how can we do that from within Python ?
One way is using RPy ( R from Python ) .
We can do the analysis part and the draw the heatmap by calling all the R functions from within Python :
from rpy import * set_default_mode( NO_CONVERSION ) r.library ( " ALL " ) r.data ( " ALL " ) r( 'eset <- ALL [ , ALL$mol.biol %in % c(" BCR / ABL " , " ALL1 / AF4 " ) ] ') r.library ( " limma " ) r('f <- factor ( as.character(eset$mol.biol ) ) ' ) r( ' design <- model.matrix ( ~f ) ' ) r( ' fit <- eBayes ( lmFit( eset , design ) ) ' ) r( 'selected <- p.adjust( fit$p.value [ , 2 ] ) < 0.05 ') r( 'esetSel <- eset [ selected , ] ' ) rpy_exprs = r( ' exprs( esetSel ) ' ) def patient_colour ( mol_biol ) : if mol_biol == " ALL1 / AF4 " : return " # FF0000 " # Red else : return " #0000 FF " # Blue # Get r('esetSel$mol.biol ' ) as a python list ... set_default_mode( BASIC_CONVERSION ) patient_colours = map( patient_colour , r('esetSel$mol.biol ' ) ) r.heatmap( rpy_exprs , cexRow=0.5 , ColSideColors = patient_colours , col = r.topo_colors ( 50 ) )
We end up with this :
Again the ColSideColors option is used to assign colours ( Red and Blue ) to the patients ( columns ) .
We are also using the cexRow option to reduce the size of the row captions - otherwise they do overlap each other .
For comparison , the published figure from Gentleman et al. 2004 once again :
Tip :
If you see a load library error complaining about being unable to load shared library C : \Program Files\R\rw2011\modules\lapack.dll at the lmFit step ( on Windows ) , and you are using rpy - 0.4.6 or earlier , make sure that the R bin folder is on the path .
Now while that does work , its a bit of a cheat - its not really using Python for anything other than generating the patient colours list ( and I 'm sure there is an easy way to do that in R ) .
We have almost literally retyped the R commands , and have kept all the objects in the R format ( mode NO_CONVERSION ) rather than having RPy translate them into their python equivalents .
Heatmaps from Python - Plan ( B )
So , as an alternative example , we will do the analysis in R , and save the results to a file which we will load from Python .
This time we will only be using python data types - so we will be passing heatmap a python array , and the labels to match - rather than an R dataframe with row / column captions built in .
In theory this example could be adapted to show a heatmap of any data you already have accessible to you in existing python programs .
Watch out for things like automatic scaling of your data by rows , which may not be appropriate ( see the previous section ) .
From within R , we can use the write .
table command to output the expressions table as a file .
I 'm using a TSV ( tab separated variable ) file which can be loaded into a spreadsheet like Excel - a blank entry is included using the col.names argument to make the column headers line up properly :
> write.table( exprs(esetSel ) , sep = " \t " , quote=FALSE , col.names = NA , file = " all_exprs.tsv " )
You can download the resulting file , Selected ALL expression data file ( ALL_exprs.tsv ) .
We can also export the patients ID ( esetSel$cod ) and associated molecular biology results ( esetSel$mol.biol ) , as just two columns of text :
> write.table(cbind(as.character(esetSel$cod ) , as.character(esetSel$mol.biol ) ) , sep = " \t " , quote=FALSE , col.names = FALSE , row.names=FALSE , file=" all_mol_biol.tsv " )
For some reason this strips the leading zeroes off the patient ID 's , so I fixed those lines by hand .
You can download the resulting file , Selected ALL molecular biology data file ( ALL_mol_biol.tsv ) .
Now we can load these two files in Python , and generate our heatmap .
The example script is here : rpy_heatmap.py .
The final steps are as follows - notice we are writing graphics to files , rather than just to an onscreen window .
from rpy import * print " Heatmap as PNG , " , r.png ( " heatmap_from_python.png " , width=600 , height=589 ) r.heatmap( exprs_as_array , cexRow=0.5 , labRow=row_names , labCol=col_names , ColSideColors = patient_colours , col = r.topo_colors ( 50 ) ) r.dev_off ( ) print " Done " print " Heatmap as PDF , " , r.pdf ( " heatmap_from_python.pdf " ) r.heatmap( exprs_as_array , cexRow=0.3 , labRow=row_names , labCol=col_names , ColSideColors = patient_colours , col = r.topo_colors ( 50 ) ) r.dev_off ( ) print " Done "
We end up with this PDF figure , and the ( same ) PNG image
Note that in R , the expression data object contained the row and column names .
This is n't possible with python arrays , so we have to use the labRow and labCol options to supply the names separately .
Again the ColSideColors option is used to assign colours ( Red and Blue ) to the patients ( columns ) , and the cexRow option to reduce the size of the row captions to prevent them overlapping each other .
Sample files :
ALL_exprs.tsv - selected ALL expression data file
ALL_mol_biol.tsv - selected ALL molecular biology data file
rpy_heatmap.py - Python program
- Python program heatmap_from_python.png - sample output
- sample output heatmap_from_python.pdf - sample output
And finally , here is a quick further snippet of code ( based on Heatmaps in R - More Options ) , which uses the heatmap .
2 function to include a colour key , and uses the redgreen colour scheme ( red to black to green , low to high ) :
r.library ( " gplots " ) r.heatmap_2(exprs_as_array , labRow=row_names , scale= " row " , labCol=col_names , ColSideColors=patient_colours , col=r.redgreen ( 75 ) , key =True , symkey =False , density_info= " none " , trace = " none " , cexRow=0.5 )
As before , when done purely in R , this yields :
This was all written and tested using Windows XP , Python 2.3.3 , R - 2.1.1 with rpy - 0.4.6 , and it should all work on other platforms .
You may need to adjust the capitalisation of the filenames , and convert them from MS - DOS style newlines to unix style newlines ( using dos2unix or something similar ) .
After doing this , the example code also ran perfectly on Ubuntu 5.10 , Python 2.4.2 , R - 2.1.1 with rpy-0.4.3

The user revolt at Digg and elsewhere , over attempts to take down the now - famous “ 09 F9 … ” number , is now all over the press .
( Background : 1 , 2 ) Many non-techies , including some reporters , wonder why users care so much about this .
What is it about “ 09F9 … ” that makes people willing to defend it by making T - shirts , writing songs , or subjecting their dotcom startup to lawsuit risk ?
The answer has several parts .
The first answer is that it ’s a reaction against censorship .
Net users hate censorship and often respond by replicating the threatened content .
When Web companies take down user - submitted content at the behest of big media companies , that looks like censorship .
But censorship by itself is not the whole story .
The second part of the answer , and the one most often missed by non-techies , is the fact that the content in question is an integer – an ordinary number , in other words .
The number is often written in geeky alphanumeric format , but it can be written equivalently in a more user - friendly form like 790,815,794,162,126,871,771,506,399,625 .
Giving a private party ownership of a number seems deeply wrong to people versed in mathematics and computer science .
Letting a private group pick out many millions of numbers ( like the AACS secret keys ) , and then simply declare ownership of them , seems even worse .
While it ’s obvious why the creator of a movie or a song might deserve some special claim over the use of their creation , it ’s hard to see why anyone should be able to pick a number at random and unilaterally declare ownership of it .
There is nothing creative about this number – indeed , it was chosen by a method designed to ensure that the resulting number was in no way special .
It ’s just a number they picked out of a hat .
And now they own it ?
As if that ’s not weird enough , there are actually millions of other numbers ( other keys used in AACS ) that AACS LA claims to own , and we do n’t know what they are .
When I wrote the thirty - digit number that appears above , I carefully avoided writing the real 09F9 number , so as to avoid the possibility of mind - bending lawsuits over integer ownership .
But there is still a nonzero probability that AACS LA thinks it owns the number I wrote .
When the great mathematician Leopold Kronecker wrote his famous dictum , “ God created the integers ; all else is the work of man ” , he meant that the basic structure of mathematics is part of the design of the universe .
What God created , AACS LA now wants to take away .
The third part of the answer is that the link between the 09F9 number and the potential harm of copyright infringement is pretty tenuous .
AACS LA tells everyone who will listen that the discovery and distribution of the 09F9 number is no real threat to the viability of AACS or the HD - DVD / Blu-ray formats .
A person getting the 09F9 number could , if he or she is technically skillful , invest a lot of work to get access to movies .
But there are easier , less tech - intensive ways to get the same movies .
Publishing the number has approximately zero impact on copyright infringement .
Which brings us to the civil disobedience angle .
It ’s no secret that many in the tech community despise the DMCA ’s anticircumvention provisions .
If you ’re going to defy a law to show your disagreement with it , you ’ll look for a situation where ( 1 ) the application of the law is especially inappropriate , ( 2 ) your violation does no actual harm , and ( 3 ) many others are doing the same thing so the breadth of opposition to the law is evident .
That ’s what we see here .
It will be interesting to see what AACS LA does next .
My guess is that they ’ll cut their losses , refrain from sending demand letters and filing lawsuits , and let the 09F9 meme run its course .
The government is being urged to promote condom use
The Terrence Higgins Trust said the competition was a " magnet " for sexual activity and could lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases .
The charity urged the government to use the event to promote sexual health .
A spokeswoman for London 2012 said it was planning a health promotion drive before and during the Olympics .
The Terrence Higgins Trust said competitors at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utah , used 250,000 condoms during a 10 - day period .
And at the Sydney 2000 Olympics , an extra 20,000 condoms had to be ordered after the initial supply of 70,000 ran out , the charity said .
Unwanted pregnancies
Paul Ward , the charity 's deputy chief executive , told the Health Service Journal that , with thousands of athletes and hundreds of thousands of visitors flocking to the games , organisers must promote sexual health - for example by making condoms easily available .
" Unless there 's a very positive step taken to promote good sexual health we could see increasing levels of STIs ( sexually transmitted infections ) " , he said .
" We have to have a strong focus at the time of the Olympics promoting condom use and promoting the risks of STIs .
Mr Ward said that , with unwanted pregnancies and STIs at an all - time high in the UK , the Olympics should be used to encourage condom use .
" Given that there will be a global focus to the Olympics , there is a good opportunity for the government to provide international leadership on HIV , " he added .
A spokeswoman for London 2012 said : " We already have a Chief Medical Officer ( CMO ) and a Medical Services Manager in place who will be working on plans to address all aspects of sexual health for spectators , workers , volunteers and athletes at Games - time , as well as looking at anti-doping issues .
" The CMO will be putting a medical team in place and will be working closely with the NHS and other agencies in this area . "

Following up on yesterday 's post , I thought I 'd share some video footage comparing a robot bird and an actual bird .
It 's good to be able to distinguish them so that you do n't make the mistake of approaching a robot and activating its self defense system .
The above footage was taken moments before the mechanical impostor supplanted the alpha bird .
This is kind of a family site , so for the sake of good taste I 've cut out the footage of the robot bird 's displacement routine .
Kids get more than enough of that kind of violence already .

Status , as of January 12 2007 :
Much of what is described here is working today .
However , it is in pieces , and some parts are not implemented at all .
Expect a public beta by April 2007 , with early - adopter downloads and source code control coming much sooner .
This project is not a toy , but intended for serious use in the real world .
I run a business , and I use this codebase extensively in my work , so it 's important to me that this project moves efficiently and the code be well tested and stable .
Eventually , I want to hire developers to help me work on the code .
So it 's also important to me that the code be well designed and well documented .
I hope you enjoy this sneak preview as I bring the code up to these standards .
Thanks ,

the framework : scarlet lambda
In ancient times , functional python programmers were shunned , and forced to wear the scarlet lambda as a symbol of their heresy ...
Well okay , not really , but that 's what I 'm calling this thing : scarlet lambda , or scarlet for short .
Scarlet is a very lightweight framework built on top of wsgi :
based on generators :
In wsgi , your handlers yield strings .
Scarlet adds to this by letting you yield strings or generators .
This allows for a cleaner style , better testability , and also for lightweight asynchronous concurrency via microthreads .

future directions
I 'm trying to stick to features I personally need for the initial release , and not just to do things just because they 're cool .
But some ideas are worth keeping , so here 's the someday / maybe list :
proper tail calls
type annotations
port the whole haskell prelude
erlang style processes with candygram
parrot like virtual machine ( since we already have pirate )
first order continuations
morphic interface based on wxOGL and sping
formalize do and return around monads

If you could make anything you wanted , what would it be ?
For me , that 's not a rhetorical question , because right now I 'm staring at my own personal fabricator .
It 's eMachineShop , an application that produces a physical 3 - D copy of almost anything I draw .
" You know the machine on Star Trek ?
The replicator ?
That 's what I was aiming for , " says Jim Lewis , the guy who created this tool .
The concept is simple : Boot up your computer and design whatever object you can imagine , press a button to send the CAD file to Lewis ' headquarters in New Jersey , and two or three weeks later he 'll FedEx you the physical object .
Lewis launched eMachineShop a year and a half ago , and customers are using his service to create engine - block parts for hot rods , gears for home - brew robots , telescope mounts - even special soles for tap dance shoes .
" Designing stuff used to be just for experts , " Lewis says .
" We 're bringing it to the masses . "
I 'm going to test that claim .
I have no experience in design and can barely draw a convincing stick figure .
If I can manage to engineer a product , then he 's right :
Any idiot can do it .
I launch eMachineShop 's software and stare at the blank screen .
What to make ?
I consider and discard several ideas .
I 'd love to create a tricked - out mobile phone , but after doing some research , I realize that installing the electronics are beyond my ken .
A futuristic MP3 player would be easier - but too obvious .
Then it hits me :
Ever since I began playing electric guitar as a teen , I 've wondered what it would be like to make my own instrument .
I begin tentatively sketching shapes , using eMachineShop 's box drawing tool to sketch some chunky outlines .
Unfortunately , boxy edges make for a rather dorky - looking guitar ; everything I 'm producing seems like it was designed with a hatchet .
I poke around for another hour , with equally ungainly results .
Finally , I stumble upon a tool in the software that lets me draw swooping , Stradivarius - like curves .
This is more like it !
In a flurry of creativity , I dash off a dozen concepts , stunned at how easy it suddenly is .
I remix various classic guitar designs by drawing the outlines of famous models , like the Fender Stratocaster and the Gibson Les Paul , then stretching and skewing their outlines to make my own mutations .
As I finish each concept , I click a button and up pops a lifelike 3 - D view of my design .
I spin it around to view it from all angles .
Seeing a virtual version of each creation floating in space is very cool .
I quickly discover that amateur engineering gives me the same rush as playing a round of Halo .
I even lose track of time , obsessively tweaking and refining my guitars until I look up and realize it 's way past midnight .
After a week of experimentation , I settle upon my favorite - a curvy , amoeba - like adaptation of a Flying V guitar .
I had originally hoped to have it cut out of pine , like a normal guitar body , but when I explore the options for materials , I find that eMachineShop does n't stock wood thick enough .
The software offers me several possibilities , and each time I swap in a new material , it reprices the entire job , down to the penny .
In the end , I opt to have a 3 - D milling machine carve my design out of a single block of clear acrylic , with unbuffed raw aluminum for the faceplate .
A guitar made of metal and Lucite :
This is going to look like something beamed down from a UFO .
It 'll cost $ 880 for the two parts and take about a week to make them .
Then all I have to do is snap them together and bolt on the neck , bridge , and a few electric components .
At 2 in the morning on a Tuesday , I finally hit the Place Order button .
My design shoots off to Lewis ' farm of roboticized fabrication machines .
I 've just printed a guitar .
MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld calls it the fab revolution - every bit as important as the invention of the personal computer , he says .
Cyberspace and PCs made bits flexible ; fabrication technology is doing the same thing to atoms .
Eventually , he claims , you wo n't even need a middleman like eMachineShop , because every house will have its own personal fabricator .
Every house ?
That 's rather sci-fi .
But Gershenfeld , director of MIT 's Center for Bits and Atoms , makes a reasonably good case and has already taken an important step :
He has shrunk the personal fabricator down to a single room 's worth of off - the - shelf tools , all of which are available right now .
" You can make essentially anything , " he tells me .
Gershenfeld has developed a universal theory of fabrication , plus a shopping list of what you 'll need .
It goes like this :
First , there are subtractive tools , devices that can cut through materials with computer - guided , down - to - the - micron accuracy .
Gershenfeld opts for a $ 1,900 Roland CAMM - 1 CX - 24 sign cutter ; it works like a dot matrix printer , except the head is a knife that can slice through thin sheets of materials like vinyl or copper and is thus suitable for chopping out precision circuit board elements and bendable plastic .
For thicker materials , he suggests the $ 15,000 Epilog Legend 24TT laser cutter .
It uses a 35 - watt carbon dioxide laser to slice through wood and acrylic as thick as an eighth of an inch .
Though the cutters sound complex , they 're both guided by ordinary desktop drawing programs like CorelDraw , so " you can learn them in about an hour , " Gershenfeld says .
Anything you can sketch onscreen , the cutters can create , with tolerances as fine as one - thousandth of an inch .
That 's so exacting you can punch out 2 - D shapes that simply press - fit together , like six panels to form a box .
" And that 's key , because it means you can move much , much faster when you 're making something , " he says .
" In a few seconds , you can transform a two - dimensional sheet of acrylic into a three - dimensional object . "
To produce even more - complex 3 - D shapes , like an engine - block part , you need a different sort of subtractive tool - something that can cut up entire chunks of metal , working the way a sculptor chisels a figure out of a block of marble .
Gershenfeld has a $ 4,500 Roland Modela MDX - 20 , a milling machine that uses a computer - guided drill bit that can move in three dimensions .
The MDX - 20 is small enough to sit on your desk and can handle materials - from plastic to light metals like aluminum and brass - with precision of up to two - thousandths of an inch .
Then there are the " additive " tools , machines that fab stuff from the ground up , the way a potter or bricklayer might do .
The $ 18,000 Formech 660 vacuum - former can take any object and mold a quarter - inch - thick sheet of hot plastic around it , quickly producing shapes like bowls or computer mouses .
For more exactitude , you have the $ 16,500 WASP injection - molding Mini-Jector # 55 , which melts plastic pellets and squeezes them into a metal mold - perfect for making things like cases for electronic devices .
The final group of tools consists of circuits and chips to give your creation " intelligence . "
Atmel AVR microprocessors cost about a buck apiece , but they 're robust enough to control sophisticated robotics and can be programmed using simple languages like Python , Basic , and Logo .
Roland 's CAMM - 1 sign cutter and Modela milling machine can quickly produce circuit boards .
Pop in the chips and you 're ready to go .
Using this lineup of machines , Gershenfeld has set up seven " fab labs " in towns around the world : Boston 's South End ; Takoradi , Ghana ; Solvik Gérd , Norway ; Pabal and Bithoor , India ; Cartago , Costa Rica ; and most recently Pretoria , South Africa .
After each lab opened , locals swarmed to fab a spectacular variety of stuff .
A Norwegian sheepherder built GPS - enabled tags to track his flock ; an Indian businessman created an electrode - driven device that measures the fat content of milk ( he wanted to make sure he was n't being sold watered - down stock ) ; and a Boston teen created a motion - detector security system to protect her diary .
This , Gershenfeld says , is the peculiar genius of personal fabrication :
It fills the gaps in the mass market , helping people build idiosyncratic one - offs that no company would bother with .
" Fab is about making the things you can't find at Wal - Mart , " he says .
" It 's stuff for a market of one . "
Still , can you really call fab a democratizing technology when laser cutters cost $ 15,000 and require special venting to remove the noxious fumes they generate while hacking through plastic ?
Predictably perhaps , Gershenfeld invokes Moore 's law .
He maintains that in two decades - maybe even one - the marketplace will produce a single , $ 1,000 device that sits on your desk and does everything one of his fab labs can .
All you 'll need to do is feed it raw materials , like wood , metal , and plastic .
" Even microchips , " he says , which are now a commodity akin to ink in a printer .
In Gershenfeld 's vision of the fab future , when you break the remote control to your fourth - generation TiVo , or the handle on your fridge , you wo n't go out and buy a new one .
You 'll just download the specs , put in your order , and have it fabbed at Kinko's or Home Depot .
Eventually you 'll just make one yourself at home .
Toddlers today will grow up in a world where using 3 - D engineering software to make a custom object will seem as routine as formatting a term paper in Microsoft Word or posting to a blog .
They 're already living that future in a small warehouse in Emeryville , California .
It 's the headquarters of Squid Labs , run by a gang of five MIT alums who by day create prototypes of new technologies for outside firms - and by night fabricate weird gizmos just for fun .
" Everything I own is basically one of a kind , " says a cheery Saul Griffith , one of the cofounders , as he crouches on the floor of his dust - covered workshop , rooting through an enormous bucket of metal brackets and bolts .
A tall , shaggy Australian , he 's wearing ragged flip - flops and a pair of cargo pants so stained with oil and grime that I can't determine their original color .
Dozens of his group 's inventions lie scattered about : a Frisbee embedded with microchip - driven LEDs , a set of robots precision - cut from plastic , a bunch of helmet - mounted laser - and - GPS sensors designed to help firefighters locate one another in a blazing house .
Today , Griffith is building a " hybrid electric bicycle " with a hidden battery compartment inside the bike 's 4 - foot - long , chopper - style front forks .
To hold the forks in place , he spent the morning designing a bracket , then cut out a flat template for it on Squid Labs ' laser cutter .
Now , with that template as a guide , he hacks the shape out of quarter - inch steel , using a terrifyingly loud metal cutter .
" I 'm really into this ' tractor ' aesthetic , getting everything to look like industrial machinery ! " he hollers over the cutter 's shrieks , while a 3 - foot cone of orange sparks flies up and ricochets off his face .
Every few minutes , Griffith pauses to snap a photo of his progress .
When done , he 'll write up a comprehensive guide on how to build his project .
This , he argues , is the next crucial step in fab culture : getting hobbyists to carefully document their plans and share them online .
Squid Labs is hoping to kick - start such sharing this fall when it launches Instructables.com - an open database of interesting projects and fab techniques , " kind of like a Wikipedia for making stuff , " Griffith explains .
If people want to build his electric hybrid chopper bicycle , they 'll be able to download the CorelDraw design of the bracket and send it someplace like eMachineShop to have their own copy printed .
" We got inspired when we looked at all these guys who 'd engineered these incredible , modded parts for their Harleys .
They'd have amazing photos of them , but they 'd never post the CAD image , " Griffith says .
" We were like , Why not go open source ? "
Later that day , I get a taste of how weirdly transformative this idea is .
I 'm hanging out with Dan Goldwater - another Squid Labs cofounder - and admiring one of his inventions .
It 's a pair of plastic gears that sit on a bike pedal and power a tiny generator .
As you ride , you can run LED lights or a radio .
I tell him I 'd love to have a version of it myself .
So a couple of Squid Labs guys go over to the laser cutter , pull up the design , and a few minutes later hand me exact copies of Goldwater 's gears .
Design once , print often .
" Pretty cool , eh ? " Goldwater grins .
Griffith imagines that fab tools could produce new economic models for creators .
Suppose a hobbyist made a cool plastic exterior for an MP3 player .
Suppose she put the design online , and 700 people downloaded the file and had it printed at eMachineShop .
" At what point , " he asks , " would a manufacturer say , Hey , there 's a market here - and offer to buy the design from her ? "
So , sure , soon we 'll be able to build anything .
But should we ?
" Let 's say everyone suddenly can make their own hood ornaments .
What if they actually do that ?
The real world would look like the Internet in 1996 , when people started making their own Web sites . "
Griffith shudders .
" Remember those hideous - looking psychedelic backgrounds and stupid animations ?
And blinking tags ? "
" Rainbow dividers , " Goldwater adds .
It 's a good point - and it makes me anxious about my guitar .
Sure , it looked fine onscreen .
But what if it turns out to be a monstrosity in my hands ?
Recalling my decision to use clear acrylic for the body , I break into a nervous sweat .
It 's going to look like something from a mid-'80s , big - hair heavy - metal band !
What the hell was I thinking ?
Griffith interrupts my panic to announce that his chopper is ready .
He wheels it onto the street , all five Squid Labbers in tow .
Eric Wilhelm , a lanky designer , offers to be the test pilot .
He straps on a helmet and mounts the seat .
" Does it have brakes ? " he asks .
" Sort of , " Griffith says .
" It 's amazing how often brakes are an afterthought , " Wilhelm sighs .
Then he hits the electric starter and peels off .
After a week of suspense , I get an email from Lewis at eMachineShop telling me my guitar body is ready .
Too impatient to wait for FedEx , I drive out to his office in New Jersey and sit down with him at his desk , which is crowded with six computers and dozens of metal parts .
Amid the mess , I notice a brass saxophone mouthpiece , a bunch of finely wrought metal blocks , and a thin strip of brass with incomprehensible hieroglyphics laser - cut into the surface .
( " That ?
Oh , that 's a headband for a robot , " Lewis says . )
He offers to show me how the guitar was fabbed .
The eMachineShop software , he explains , includes artificial intelligence that operates like a " virtual machinist . "
In the background - invisible to the user - it runs a precise emulation of the real - world machines that fabricate parts , to determine whether the job is possible and how much it 'll cost .
He pulls up the image of my guitar and clicks a button to show me the hidden emulator .
As I watch , an onscreen animation of the spinning bit on a 3 - D milling machine approaches the guitar body slowly from the left side , pauses at the edge , and begins to roam diligently along the contours , adhering precisely to the curves I drew .
" It makes several passes , cutting deeper each time until it gets to the specified depth , " he explains .
When the outer shape of the body is done , the robot grabs a smaller milling bit and deftly drills a constellation of holes in the body , where I 'll be attaching the guitar neck and the electronics .
Lewis points to the screen , where a timer shows that the fabrication would take 44 minutes .
Now for the guitar 's unveiling .
Smiling uncertainly , I wait in a conference room while Lewis fetches it from storage .
I 'm still wondering whether I 've produced a freakishly nasty aberration .
Then the door opens and he lays it on the table .
At first , I 'm amazed that the damn thing even exists .
I 've seen it only as a virtual object , so there 's something surreal about its abrupt teleportation from my imagination to reality .
Then I realize with relief that it looks kind of cool .
The clear acrylic gleams like an otherworldly brick , and the brushed aluminum has precisely the sort of industrial flavor I 'd hoped for .
When I lay the pickguard down on the body , every hole for the pickups and electronics is precisely where I 'd specified .
There 's only one problem .
" It 's kind of heavy , is n't it ? "
Lewis asks delicately .
He 's right .
Worried that the acrylic would n't be strong enough to sustain deep milling , I 'd made the guitar body far thicker than I should have .
When I pick it up , I realize with horror that it 's much heavier than a conventional guitar .
I 'm going to give myself spinal damage trying to play this thing .
I 'm reminded of a stern lecture Griffith delivered about the dangers of designing solely on computers :
When you 're operating in a virtual realm , it 's hard to feel any consequences .
It really is too much like a videogame .
" You learn a lot from actually holding your materials in your hands , " he told me that day at Squid Labs .
" That 's when you have to grapple with your design . "
The computer screen is forgiving ; the real world is n't .
I push on and spend the weekend assembling the rest of the guitar .
I remove the neck from a cheap $ 99 Fender Squier and bolt it onto my custom body .
I solder in the electronics ; since this thing is probably doomed to look like a guitar from an ' 80s metal band , I buy a Seymour Duncan Dimebucker pickup , which according to the manufacturer 's description will produce the tone of a " searing , crushing , metal massacre . "
As the final pieces come together , I find I 'm getting excited again .
For all its imperfections , my creation looks surprisingly close to my original vision - less a straight - head guitar than a piece of mildly psychedelic Soviet machinery .
When I attach the strap and sling it around my neck , it has the heft of a weapon .
Maybe this is the ultimate appeal of the fab revolution :
When you create something from scratch , even the flaws are charming .
So I plug it in , turn on my amp , and start to rock .
Clive Thompson ( clive@clivethompson.net ) wrote about farming genetically modified stem cells in issue 13.06 .
A state - of - the - art research study published in October 12 , 2006 issue of The Lancet ( the most prestigious British medical journal ) concluded that -- as of a year ago -- 600,000 Iraqis had died violently due to the war in Iraq .
That is , the Iraqi death rate for the first 39 months of the war was just about 15,000 per month .
That was n't the worst of it , because the death rate was increasing precipitously , and during the first half of 2006 the monthly rate was approximately 30,000 per month , a rate that no doubt has increased further during the ferocious fighting associated with the current American surge .
The U.S. and British governments quickly dismissed these results as " methodologically flawed , " even though the researchers used standard procedures for measuring mortality in war and disaster zones .
( They visited a random set of homes and asked the residents if anyone in their household had died in the last few years , recording the details , and inspecting death certificates in the vast majority of cases . )
The two belligerent governments offered no concrete reasons for rejecting the study 's findings , and they ignored the fact that they had sponsored identical studies ( conducted by some of the same researchers ) in other disaster areas , including Darfur and Kosovo .
The reasons for this rejection were , however , clear enough : the results were simply too devastating for the culpable governments to acknowledge .
( Secretly the British government later admitted that it was " a tried and tested way to measuring mortality in conflict zones " ; but it has never publicly admitted its validity ) .
Reputable researchers have accepted the Lancet study 's results as valid with virtually no dissent .
Juan Cole , the most visible American Middle East scholar , summarized it in a particularly vivid comment : " the US misadventure in Iraq is responsible [ in a little over three years ] for setting off the killing of twice as many civilians as Saddam managed to polish off in 25 years . "
Despite the scholarly consensus , the governments ' denials have been quite effective from a public education point of view , and the few news items that mention the Lancet study bracket it with official rebuttals .
One BBC report , for example , mentioned the figure in an article headlined " Huge Rise in Iraqi Death Tolls , " and quoted at length from President Bush 's public rebuttal , in which he said that the methodology was " pretty well discredited , " adding that " six - hundred thousand or whatever they guessed at is just ... it 's not credible . "
As a consequence of this sort of coverage , most Americans probably believe that Bush 's December 2005 figure of 30,000 Iraqi civilian deaths ( less than 10 % of the actual total ) is the best estimate of Iraqi deaths up to that time .
Counting how many Iraqis the occupation has killed
These shocking statistics are made all the more horrific when we realize that among the 600,000 or so victims of Iraqi war violence , the largest portion have been killed by the American military , not by carbombings or death squads , or violent criminals -- or even all these groups combined .
The Lancet interviewers asked their Iraqi respondents how their loved ones died and who was responsible .
The families were very good at the cause of death , telling the reporters that over half ( 56 % ) were due to gunshots , with an eighth due each to car bombs ( 13 % ) , air strikes ( 13 % ) and other ordinance ( 14 % ) .
Only 4 % were due to unknown causes .
The families were not as good at identifying who was responsible .
Although they knew , for example , that air strike victims were killed by the occupation , and that carbomb victims were killed by insurgents , the gunshot and ordinance fatalities often occurred in firefights or in circumstances with no witnesses .
Many times , therefore , they could not tell for sure who was responsible .
Only were certain , and the interviewers did not record the responsible party if " households had any uncertainly " as to who fired the death shot .
The results are nevertheless staggering for those of us who read the American press : for the deaths that the victims families knew for sure who the perpetrator was , U.S. forces ( or their " Coalition of the Willing " allies ) were responsible for 56 % .
That is , we can be very confident that the Coalition had killed at least 180,000 Iraqis by the middle of 2006 .
Moreover , we have every reason to believe that the U.S. is responsible for its pro rata share ( or more ) of the unattributed deaths .
That means that the U.S. and its allies may well have killed upwards of 330,000 Iraqis by the middle of 2006 .
The remainder can be attributed to the insurgents , criminals , and to Iraqi forces .
And let 's be very clear here : car bombs , the one source that was most easy for victims ' families to identify , was responsible for 13 % of the deaths , about 80,000 people , or about 2,000 per month .
This is horrendous , but it is far less than half of the confirmed American total , and less than a quarter of the probable American total .
Even if we work with the lower , confirmed , figured of 180,000 Iraqi deaths caused by the occupation firepower , which yields an average of just over 5,000 Iraqis killed every month by U.S. forces and our allies since the beginning of the war .
And we have to remember that the rate of fatalities was twice as high in 2006 as the overall average , meaning that the American average in 2006 was well over 10,000 per month , or something over 300 Iraqis every day , including Sundays .
With the surge that began in 2007 , the current figure is likely even higher .
Why do n't we know about this ?
These figures sound impossible to most Americans .
Certainly 300 Iraqis killed by Americans each day would be headline news , over and over again .
And yet , the electronic and print media simply do not tell us that the U.S. is killing all these people .
We hear plenty about car bombers and death squads , but little about Americans killing Iraqis , except the occasional terrorist , and the even more occasional atrocity story .
How , then , is the US accomplishing this carnage , and why is it not newsworthy ?
The answer lies in another amazing statistic : this one released by the U.S. military and reported by the highly respectable Brookings Institution : for the past four years , the American military sends out something over 1,000 patrols each day into hostile neighborhoods , looking to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists .
( Since February , the number has increased to nearly 5,000 patrols a day , if we include the Iraqi troops participating in the American surge . )
These thousands of patrols regularly turn into thousands of Iraqi deaths because these patrols are not the " walk in the sun " that they appear to be in our mind 's eye .
Actually , as independent journalist Nir Rosen described vividly and agonizingly in his indispensable book ,
In the Belly of the Green Bird , they involve a kind of energetic brutality that is only occasionally reported by an embedded American mainstream journalist .
This brutality is all very logical , once we understand the purpose and process of these patrols .
American soldiers and marines are sent into hostile communities where virtually the entire population is supports the insurgency .
They often have a list of suspects ' addresses ; and their job is to interrorgate or arrest or kill the suspect ; and search the house for incriminating evidence , particularly arms and ammunition , but also literature , video equipment , and other items that the insurgency depends upon for its political and military activities .
When they do n't have lists of suspects , they conduct " house - to - house " searches , looking for suspicious behavior , individuals or evidence .
In this context , any fighting age man is not just a suspect , but a potentially lethal adversary .
Our soldiers are told not to take any chances : in many instances , for example , knocking on doors could invite gunshots through the doors .
Their instructions are therefore to use the element of surprise whenever the situation appears to be dangerous -- to break down doors , shoot at anything suspicious , and throw grenades into rooms or homes where there is any chance of resistance .
If they encounter tangible resistance , they can call in artillery and / or air power rather than try to invade a building .
Here is how two Iraqi civilians described these patrols to Asia Times reporter Pepe Escobar :
" Hussein and Hasan confirm that the Americans usually ' come at night , sometimes by day , always protected by helicopters . '
They " sometimes bomb houses , sometimes arrest people , sometimes throw missiles ' "
If they encounter no resistance , these patrols can track down 30 or so suspects , or inspect several dozen homes , in a days work .
That is , our 1,000 or so patrols can invade 30,000 homes in a single day .
But if an IED explodes under their Humvee or a sniper shoots at them from nearby , then their job is transformed into finding , capturing , or killing the perpetrator of the attack .
Iraqi insurgents often set off IEDs and invite these firefights , in order to stall the patrols prevent the soldiers from forcibly entering 30 or so homes , violently accosting their residents , and perhaps beating , arresting , or simply humiliating the residents .
The battles triggered by IEDs and sniper attacks almost always involve the buildings surrounding the incident , since that is where the insurgents take cover to avoid the American counter - attack .
Americans , therefore , regular shoot into these buildings where the perpetrators are suspected of hiding , with all the attendant dangers of killing other people .
The rules of engagement for American soldiers include efforts to avoid killing civilians , and there are many accounts of restraint because civilians are visibly in the line of fire .
But if they are in hot pursuit of a perpetrator , their rules of engagement make it clear that capturing or killing the insurgent takes precedent over civilian safety .
This sounds pretty tame , and not capable of generating the statistics that the Lancet study documented .
But the sheer quantity of American patrols -- 1,000 each day -- and the sheer quantity of the confrontations inside people 's homes , the responses to sniper and IED attacks , and the ensuring firefights add up to mass slaughter .
The cumulative brutality of these thousands of patrols can be culled from the recent inquest into the suspected war crimes committed in the city of Haditha back in November 19 , 2005 .
The investigation seeks to ascertain whether American marines deliberately murdered 24 civilians including executing with point blank head shots nineteen unarmed women , children and older men in a single room , apparently in retribution for the death of one of their comrades earlier in the day .
These horrific charges have made the incident newsworthy and propelled the investigation .
But it is the defense 's version of the story that makes the Haditha useful in understanding the translation of American patrols into hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths .
First Lt. William T. Kallop , the highest ranking officer in Haditha that day , told the military hearing that he had ordered a patrol " to ' clear ' an Iraqi home in Haditha after a roadside bomb had killed a Marine " earlier in the day .
Later , after the firefight that this action generated , he went to inspect the home and was shocked to discover that only civilians had been killed :
" He inspected one of the homes with a Marine corporal , Hector Salinas , and found women , children and older men who had been killed when marines threw a grenade into the room .
" ' What the hell happened , why are n't there any insurgents here ? '
Lieutenant Kallop testified that he asked aloud .
' I looked at Corporal Salinas , and he looked just as shocked as I did . '
It is important to keep in mind that Lt. Kallop would not have been shocked if there had been one or more insurgents among the dead .
What made the situation problematic was that all the fatalities were clearly civilians , and it led to the possibility that they had not been in hot pursuit of an enemy combatant .
Later , however , Lt. Kallop decided that even this situation involved no misbehavior on the part of his troops , after questioning Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich , who had led the patrol and commanded the military action :
" Sergeant Wuterich had told him that they had killed people [ in that house ] after approaching a door to it and hearing the distinct metallic sound of an AK - 47 being prepared to fire .
" ' I thought that was within the rules of engagement because the squad leader thought that he was about to kick in the door and walk into a machine gun , ' Lieutenant Kallop said . "
According to Kallop , the soldiers were thus following the rules of engagement because if the squad leader " thought " that he was going to be attacked ( based on recognizing a noise through a closed door ) , he was authorized and justified to use the full lethal force of the patrol ( in this case a hand grenade ) , enough to kill all the people huddled within the apartment .
The critical distinction has to do with intentionality .
First Lieutenant Max D. Frank , sent to investigate the incident somewhat later , explained this logic : " It was unfortunate what happened , sir , " Lieutenant Frank told the Marine prosecutor , Lt. Col .
Sean Sullivan , " but I did n't have any reason to believe that what they had done was on purpose . "
Translated , this means that as long as the soldiers sincerely believed that their attack might capture or kill an armed insurgent who could attack them , the rules of engagement justified their action and they were therefore not culpable of any crime .
Note here that other alternatives were not considered .
The soldiers could have decided that there was a good chance of hurting civilians in this situation , and therefore retreated without pursuing the suspected insurgent .
This would have allowed him to get away , but it would have protected the residents of the house .
This option was not considered , even though many of us might feel that letting one or two or three insurgents escape ( in a town filled with insurgents ) might be acceptable instead of risking ( and ultimately ending ) the lives of 19 civilians .
Later in the hearing , Major General Richard Huck , the commanding officer in charge of the Marines in Haditha , underscored these rules of engagement in more general terms , -- and also ignored the unthinkable option of letting the insurgents get away -- when he explained why he had not ordered an investigation of the deaths :
" They had occurred during a combat operation and it was not uncommon for civilians to die in such circumstances .
' In my mind 's eye , I saw insurgent fire , I saw Kilo Company fire , ' Huck testified , via video link from the Pentagon , where he is assistant deputy commandant for plans , policies and operations .
' I could see how 15 neutrals in those circumstances could be killed . ' "
For General Huck , and for other commanders in Iraq , once " insurgent fire " -- or even the threat of insurgent fire -- entered the picture ( and it certainly had earlier , when the American soldier was killed ) , then the actions reported by the Marines in that Haditha home were not just legitimate ( if they reported them honestly ) , but exemplary .
They were responding appropriately in a battlefield situation , and the death of " 15 neutrals " is " not uncommon " in those circumstances .
Let 's keep in mind , then , that the United States undertakes something over 1,000 patrols each day , and lately this number has surged to over 5,000 ( if we also count patrols by the Iraqi military ) .
According to U.S. military statistics , again reported by the Brookings Institute , these patrols patrols currently result in just under 3,000 firefights every month , or just under an average of 100 per day ( not counting the additional 25 or so involving our Iraqi allies ) .
Most of them do not produce 24 Iraqi deaths , but the rules of engagement our soldiers are given -- throwing hand grenades into buildings holding suspected insurgents , using maximum firepower against snipers , and calling in artillery and air power against stubborn resistance -- guarantee a regular drumbeat of mortality .
It is worth recording how these events are reported in the American press , when they are noted at all .
Here , for example , is an Associated Press account of American / British patrols in Maysan province , a stronghold of the Mahdi army :
Well to the south , Iraqi officials reported as many as 36 people were killed in fierce overnight fighting that began as British and Iraqi forces conducted house - to - house searches in Amarah , a stronghold of the Shiite Mahdi Army militia .
This brief description was part of a five paragraph account of fighting all over Iraq , part of a review under the headline " U.S. and Iraqi forces Move on Insurgents . "
It contained brief accounts of several different operations , none of them presented as major events .
There were 100 or so engagements that day , and many of them produced deaths .
How many ?
Based on the Lancet article , we could guess that on that day -- and most days -- the incident in Amarah represented perhaps one - tenth of all the Iraqis killed by Americans that day .
Over the course of June , the accumulated total probably came to something over 10,000 .
During the hearing about Haditha one of the investigators addressed the larger question that emerges from the sacrifice of so many civilians to the cause of chasing and catching insurgents in Iraq .
Lieutenant Max D. Frank , the first officer to investigate the deaths , characterized is an " unfortunate and unintended result of local residents ' allowing insurgent fighters to use family homes to shoot at passing American patrols . "
Using a similar logic , First Lt. Adam P. Mathes , the executive office of the company involved , argued against issuing an apology to local residents for the incident .
Mathes advocated that instead they should issue a warning to Haditha residents , that the incident was " an unfortunate thing that happens when you let terrorists use your house to attack our troops . "
The Merriam Webster dictionary defines terror as " violent or destructive acts ( as bombing ) committed by groups in order to intimidate a population .
... "
The incident at Haditha was just such a violent act , and was one of about 100 that day that Lt. Mathes hoped would intimidate the population of Haditha and other towns in Iraq from continuing to support insurgents .

JENNIFER LOPEZ has abruptly quit the much - anticipated big screen remake of classic 1970s show DALLAS .
The MAID IN MANHATTAN actress was set to star opposite JOHN TRAVOLTA - who will play JR EWING - as his alcoholic wife SUE ELLEN .
SHIRLEY MacLAINE is in talks to star as Ewing family matriarch MISS ELLIE and LUKE WILSON is rumoured to be taking on the role of BOBBY EWING .
Lopez 's representative LESLIE SLOANE ZELNICK confirms to American publication Star , " She is out of Dallas . "
This is n't the first report of trouble regarding the film - earlier this year ( 06 ) , LEGALLY BLONDE director ROBERT LUKETIC quit the project citing " creative differences " and was reportedly unhappy with casting choices .
BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM director GURINDER CHADHA is now attached to direct the film .
The role of LUCY EWING has also been the subject of much speculation , with many of Hollywood 's top young actresses vying for the part including JESSICA SIMPSON , LINDSAY LOHAN and KRISTIN CAVALLARI .
The role ultimately went to 19 - year - old KATIE CASSIDY , who stars in the US family drama 7th HEAVEN .

I normally do not read comp.lang.c , but Jim McKie told me that ``Duff 's device ' ' had come up in comp.lang .c again .
I have lost the version that was sent to netnews in May 1984 , but I have reproduced below the note in which I originally proposed the device .
( If anybody has a copy of the netnews version , I would gratefully receive a copy at research ! td or td@research.att.com . )
To clear up a few points :
The point of the device is to express general loop unrolling directly in C. People who have posted saying `just use memcpy ' have missed the point , as have those who have criticized it using various machine - dependent memcpy implementations as support .
In fact , the example in the message is not implementable as memcpy , nor is any computer likely to have an memcpy - like idiom that implements it .
Somebody claimed that while the device was named for me , I probably did n't invent it .
I almost certainly did invent it .
I had definitely not seen or heard of it when I came upon it , and nobody has ever even claimed prior knowledge , let alone provided dates and times .
Note the headers on the message below : apparently I invented the device on November 9 , 1983 , and was proud ( or disgusted ) enough to send mail to dmr .
Please note that I do not claim to have invented loop unrolling , merely this particular expression of it in C .
The device is legal dpANS C. I cannot quote chapter and verse , but Larry Rosler , who was chairman of the language subcommittee ( I think ) , has assured me that X3J11 considered it carefully and decided that it was legal .
Somewhere I have a note from dmr certifying that all the compilers that he believes in accept it .
Of course , the device is also legal C++ , since Bjarne uses it in his book .
Somebody invoked ( or more properly , banished ) the `false god of efficiency . '
Careful reading of my original note will put this slur to rest .
The alternative to genuflecting before the god of code - bumming is finding a better algorithm .
It should be clear that none such was available .
If your code is too slow , you must make it faster .
If no better algorithm is available , you must trim cycles .
The same person claimed that the device would n't exhibit the desired speed - up .
The argument was flawed in two regards : first , it did n't address the performance of the device , but rather the performance of one of its few uses ( implementing memcpy ) for which many machines have a high - performance idiom .
Second , the poster made his claims in the absence of timing data , which renders his assertion suspect .
A second poster tried the test , but botched the implementation , proving only that with diligence it is possible to make anything run slowly .
Even Henry Spencer , who hit every other nail square on the end with the flat round thing stuck to it , made a mistake ( albeit a trivial one ) .
Here is Henry replying to bill@proxftl .
UUCP ( T. William Wells ) :
>>... Dollars to doughnuts this >> was written on a RISC machine .
> Nope . Bell Labs Research uses VAXen and 68Ks , mostly .
I was at Lucasfilm when I invented the device .
Transformations like this can only be justified by measuring the resulting code .
Be careful when you use this thing that you do n't unwind the loop so much that you overflow your machine 's instruction cache .
Do n't try to be smarter than an over - clever C compiler that recognizes loops that implement block move or block clear and compiles them into machine idioms .
Here then , is the original document describing Duff 's device :

Consider the following routine , abstracted from code which copies an array of shorts into the Programmed IO data register of an Evans & Sutherland Picture System II :
send ( to , from , count ) register short * to , * from ; register count ; { do * to = * from ++ ; while (-- count > 0 ) ; }
( Obviously , this fails if the count is zero . )
The VAX C compiler compiles the loop into 2 instructions ( a movw and a sobleq ,
I think . )
As it turns out , this loop was the bottleneck in a real - time animation playback program which ran too slowly by about 50 % .
The standard way to get more speed out of something like this is to unwind the loop a few times , decreasing the number of sobleqs .
When you do that , you wind up with a leftover partial loop .
I usually handle this in C with a switch that indexes a list of copies of the original loop body .
Of course , if I were writing assembly language code , I 'd just jump into the middle of the unwound loop to deal with the leftovers .
Thinking about this yesterday , the following implementation occurred to me :
send ( to , from , count ) register short * to , * from ; register count ; { register n=( count + 7 ) /8 ; switch ( count %8 ) { case 0 : do{ * to = * from ++ ; case 7 : * to = * from ++ ; case 6 : * to = * from ++ ; case 5 : * to = * from ++ ; case 4 : * to = * from ++ ; case 3 : * to = * from ++ ; case 2 : * to = * from ++ ; case 1 : * to = * from ++ ; }while (-- n>0 ) ; } }
It amazes me that after 10 years of writing C there are still little corners that I have n't explored fully .
( Actually , I have another revolting way to use switches to implement interrupt driven state machines but it's too horrid to go into . )
Many people ( even bwk ? ) have said that the worst feature of C is that switches do n't break automatically before each case label .
This code forms some sort of argument in that debate , but I 'm not sure whether it 's for or against .

The Death Of US Air Power
" The end result is that the U.S. Air Force now flies 45 - year - old aerial refueling tankers using a plane retired by commercial airlines a quarter - century ago ; its F - 22 fighter ( pictured ) program has been cut 75 percent even though the aging fighters it would replace are so old they operate under flight restriction ; its production lines for C - 130 and C - 17 transport planes are scheduled for closure despite lack of adequate airlift ; and the service has canceled its planned family of aircraft for replacing cold - war radar and reconnaissance planes .

Now that America has an Islamo - centric security posture , any danger that does n't fit within the counter - fundamentalist framework tends to be ignored .
That 's sort of ironic , since the biggest military threats to democracy in the last century came from atheists .
Five years into the " global war on terror , " the evidence suggests that Islamic radicals are real good at blowing each other up , but not so good at projecting power abroad .
As long as western nations maintain halfway decent domestic security arrangements , the fundamentalists seem to be hobbled in repeating their one major success of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Given that fact -- five years and counting without a second big terrorist attack in America -- maybe we ought to be paying more attention to the kinds of state - based challenges that roiled the world so much in the past .
But we are n't .
No one gives much thought to Russia 's vast nuclear arsenal , which could still obliterate America in a few hours , even though that nation is reverting to authoritarian rule .
Nobody seems to care about China 's buildup of naval forces , its development of long - range missiles , or its new fighter .
And nothing decisive has been done to prevent North Korea 's march towards an indigenous nuclear arsenal .
Each of these countries wields far more destructive power than the handful of nuts scattered across Arabia that we call al - Qaida .
But because al - Qaida is a current irritant and other concerns seem less pressing , the capacity of U.S. forces to cope with state - based challenges is allowed to atrophy .
The decay is most pronounced in the U.S. Air Force , the service that would have to take the lead in coping with urgent threats posed by Russia , China and other industrialized countries .
After 20 years of neglect , the Air Force 's fleet of combat aircraft is older than the Navy 's fleet of warships .
During his four - year stint as defense secretary , current Vice President Dick Cheney killed the service 's cold - war fighter programs , terminated the next - generation B - 2 bomber at a mere 20 planes , slashed the future C - 17 cargo plane program , and decimated every other facet of U.S. air power .
Clinton 's defense secretaries added back some planes that Cheney had cut , but delayed and decreased the next - generation F - 22 fighter that was the centerpiece of plans for future air dominance .
Then Preident Bush 's long - serving Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld launched the entire U.S. Department of Defense on a leap - ahead trajectory to military transformation that ignored air power for another six years .
The end result is that the U.S. Air Force now flies 45 - year - old aerial refueling tankers using a plane retired by commercial airlines a quarter - century ago ; its F - 22 fighter program has been cut 75 percent even though the aging fighters it would replace are so old they operate under flight restriction ; its production lines for C - 130 and C - 17 transport planes are scheduled for closure despite lack of adequate airlift ; and the service has canceled its planned family of aircraft for replacing cold - war radar and reconnaissance planes .
The only bright spot on the horizon is the tri-service F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , but Navy efforts to slash funding for JSF suggest the Air Force can't even count on that program coming to fruition .
Air Force pilots have a favorite story they tell that captures the meltdown of American air power over the past 20 years .
Brig .
Gen. David Deptula was flying his F - 15 over northern Iraq in 1999 when cockpit gauges went haywire and the fuel reading plummeted to zero .
It turned out insulation on the plane 's wiring had rotted away with age , shorting out the electrical system .
The punch - line of the story was that Gen. Deptula was flying the same F - 15 he had flown 20 years earlier as a young captain .
But most of the people who tell the story do n't know it has a new punch - line : Gen .
Deptula 's son , a first lieutenant , is now flying the same plane in the Pacific -- nearly 30 years after it was built .
Maybe it's time the Air Force finally gets some new planes , before a real threat comes along .

Occasionally , I like to pick a random interesting topic that ’s entirely unrelated to my work , and read up on it .
Recently , it has been polynomial factoring and computer algebra in general , which I ’d like to post about when I have the time .
As a side note , I ’ve also been meaning to write a quick expository article on Dantzig ’s simplex algorithm for linear programming , and use Haskell as a sort of a specification language for it .
Unfortunately , I ’ve been rather busy as of late ( what else is new ) , so here ’s something else entirely .
I was reading up on DES while waiting for a gigantic Perforce sync over VPN , and something struck me as interesting : DES is a Feistel network , and so is any number of other moden ciphers .
This suggests abstraction : can we write a generic Feistel network , and then implement a variety of ciphers in terms of that ?
This post is basically the result of posing that question .
I wanted to cover both DES and AES in a single post , but just presenting DES took a fair bit of text , and then I realized that AES is not Feistel .
The post does , however , present a complete implementation of DES and 3TDES , and I ’d like to follow it up with other ciphers later on .
As a word of caution , literally all I know about cryptography , DES , Feistel ciphers , or anything else in that field comes from about two days ’ worth of reading up on it while waiting for builds and syncs .
Feistel networks rely on a cryptographically - strong pseudorandom function .
An incorrect implementation of that function may let you encrypt and decrypt plaintext , but do so in a way that ’s potentially cryptographically useless .
If you use any of the code here ( or in any other of my posts , for that matter ) for anything remotely sensitive , please make sure that you verify it against a description of the algorithm that is known to be correct .
A Feistel network is a block cipher : that is , it ’s a cipher that acts on fixed - length blocks .
It ’s described by the number of rounds ( iterations ) , a set of subkeys , one for each round ( also called a key schedule ) , and two functions : (+ ) and f .
The former is commonly bitwise addition modulo 2 ( exclusive OR , in other words ) , while f is the so - called round function , which we ’ll talk about shortly .
Thus specified , the resulting Feistel network is a process that takes a block , splits it into two equal halves , call them L_0 and R_0 , and proceeds to apply the following iterations to it , one per round :
If n is the number of rounds , then is the final ciphertext , which we ’ll usually merge back into a single number .
The process can be interpreted as follows : at each iteration , the right half R crosses into the left half L , and the left half L is scrambled using (+ ) and f , and crossed into R .
One half is always “ more ” encrypted than the other , by one round .
The idea is that the round function f is something weird and non-invertible — to be precise , f is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function with as the seed .
Michael Luby and Charles Rackoff showed that if this is the case , then four rounds are sufficient to make the corresponding Feistel network a strong pseudorandom permutation , meaning that it remains pseudorandom even if the inverse permutation is discovered .
This is a good property to have , since otherwise you ca n’t publish the algorithm ; besides , cryptographers appear to be fond of providing hypothetical adversaries with access to an omniscient oracle who knows the details of the algorithm .
After four rounds , the oracle does n’t help .
Plain DES uses 16 rounds .
Triple - DES uses 48 .
The ability to decrypt a ciphertext hinges on the definition of (+ ) , in that we need to be able to reverse the process as follows :
The reason this works is that (+ ) is picked so that if one of the parameters is held constant , the function is its own inverse — so we ’re backtracking from the last subkey back to the first .
Exclusive OR works here , but we could pick other functions as well ( although , it seems that anything more complex than XOR could as easily be absorbed into f instead — do Feistel ciphers exist that have a mixing function other than XOR ? ) .
Alternatively , we can reverse the process by reversing the key schedule K , swapping L and R , and using the same network as we did for encryption .
DES swaps the L and R halves before joining them into the final ciphertext , so it can be inverted by simply reversing the key schedule .
Any generic description of a Feistel cipher is going to be a higher - order function , since it takes the functions (+ ) and f as arguments .
Let ’s write it :
feistel :: ( Bits a ) => ( a -> b -> a ) -- Mixing function -> ( a -> k -> b ) -- Round function -> a --
Block to be encrypted -> [ k ] --
Key schedule -> ( a , a ) -- ( L , R ) feistel ( + ) f block keys = foldl rnd ( l , r ) keys where ( l , r ) = split block half half = ( bitSize block ) `div` 2 rnd ( l , r ) k = ( r , l + f r k ) split n k = ( n .&. ( 2 ^ k - 1 ) , n `shiftR` k ) merge l r k = ( r `shiftL` k ) .|. l
As a side note , in C++ , I would write the above as an abstract base class with pure virtuals for (+ ) and f .
That sort of translation seems to crop up fairly often .
The above is hopefully a fairly straightforward implementation of the verbal description .
We want to parametrize our Feistel implementation over all fixed - width types with bitwise operations on them , so we require that the type of a data block is in Bits .
We then ask for the mixing function (+ ) , the round function f , the block itself , and the key schedule .
We split the block in half , and apply the iterations as described earlier ( note that we infer the number of rounds from the key schedule ) .
Since each round takes the results of the previous round , a straightforward way to implement the process is to describe a single round , and then left - fold the key schedule over it .
Finally , to make the bit fiddling easier for subsequent applications , we generalize splitting a block into halves and merging it back , by writing the functions split and merge .
A Feistel cipher is , more generally , a type of a product cipher .
Product ciphers are block ciphers that execute , in sequence , a series of relatively simple transformation of the plaintext block .
Commonly , these transformations include bitwise permutations ( P - boxes ) , substitutions ( S - boxes ) , and linear mixing ( our (+ ) function ) .
In the case of DES , there is a handful of P - boxes , 8 S - boxes , and XOR for mixing .
A permutation box is simply a bitwise permutation : we shuffle the bits around according to some table .
Most of the permutation boxes in DES are invertible , but some are not .
Let ’s write the code for applying a permutation box in general .
permute :: ( Num a , Bits a ) => [ Int ] -> a -> a permute table key = foldl shuffle 0 ( zip table [ 0 .. ] ) where shuffle k ( n + 1 , b ) = k .|. ( is Set n `shiftL` b ) isSet n = if testBit key n then 1 else 0
Note the ( n+k ) pattern in shuffle : the DES documentation I ’ve read uses the convention that LSB is bit 1 , not bit 0 , and I did n’t want to have to convert each table .
This is fairly straightforward as well , but if you do n’t read Haskell , the idea is as follows .
We take a table of bit positions , presented as a list : so [ 4,2,1 ] means that bit 1 is shuffled into position 4 , bit 2 remains the same , and bit 3 is moved to position 1 .
We decorate that table with the bit positions , by saying zip table [ 0.. ] , which evaluates to a list of pairs ( destination_bit , source_bit ) .
Finally , we run over that list , and set bits as appropriate .
The above is almost everything we need to implement DES , and we have n’t even discussed the algorithm .
I ’ll use the implementation of single - block encryption as a way of introducing the process .
des keys block = applyFp ( merge ' $ feistel xor f ( apply Ip block ) keys ) where f r key = let bs = take 8 $ unfoldr ( Just .
shift ) nr nr = xor ( ebitSelect r ) key shift k = ( k .&. 0x3 f , k `shiftR` 6 ) in pPerm ( applySboxes bs ) merge ' ( l , r ) = merge r l 32
Let ’s go through this step by step .
To get some of the undefined functions out of the way , applyIp and applyFp are P - boxes , where Ip stands for Initial Permutation , and Fp stands for Final Permutation ( also called Inverse Initial Permutation ) .
Similarly , ebitSelect and pPerm are P - boxes which are applied at various stages of computation of f .
Finally , applySboxes applies , as the name suggests , the S - boxes .
The details of box implementations mostly consist of table data , so we ’ll concentrate on the algorithm first .
First , feistel is evaluated , with xor as the mixing function , f as the round function , block with “ Initial Permutation ” applied as the data block , and the input key schedule ( note that we have n’t yet discussed how the key schedule is computed either ) .
The crux of the algorithm is then the round function f .
As specified by feistel , the function takes R_i and K_i , and does something dodgy to them .
The process is this :
a ) Permute R_i using the ebitSelect P-box .
b ) XOR the result with K_i .
c ) Split the resulting 56 - bit value ( see below ) into eight 6 - bit values B_1 … B_8 .
d ) Run B_1 … B_8 through the corresponding S - boxes .
e ) Run the result through the pPerm P- box .
As I mentioned in the introduction , my knowledge of cryptography is limited to what I ’ve read in the past couple of days , so I can’t , unfortunately , detail the requirements on the specific P - boxes or the S - boxes — I understand that the combination of them needs to make f a cryptographic PRNG in K_i , but I do n’t know enough about PRNGs to comment on why those particular transformations , in that particular sequence , are the right thing to do .
My guess is that the S - box values are picked to avoid short cycles , and the two permutations lengthen the cycles further .
Once the Feistel network is applied , we apply another P - box , applyFp , the “ Forward Permutation . ”
This is the inverse of “ Initial Permutation . ”
In addition to this , we use a new function , merge ’ , to merge the results into a single ciphertext block while swapping L and R — which is a simple but subtle detail .
Recall how while discussing the deciphering stage of a Feistel network , we noted that deciphering can be done by simply reversing the key schedule , and swapping L and R .
Since the swap is performed at this stage , the decryption function is simply the encryption function with the key schedule reversed .
This is nice , because des keys encrypts a block , while des ( reverse keys ) decrypts it .
We can write a group of functions to make the above actually usable :
-- Encrypts a text message encryptDES key = map ( encryptBlock key ) .
preparePlaintext --
Decrypts a DES - encoded message decryptDES key = readPlaintext . map ( decryptBlock key ) --
Encrypts a block encryptBlock key = des ( keySchedule ( pc1 key ) ) --
Decrypts a block decryptBlock key = des ( reverse $ keySchedule ( pc1 key ) )
Here , pc1 is yet another P - box , called “ Permuted Choice 1 . ”
Several new functions have made an appearance : functions to prepare the plaintext ( convert it to 64 - bit words ) , read plaintext from a list of 64 - bit words , and compute a key schedule from a key .
We ’ll jump ahead a little bit and divulge a major detail of the pc1 P - box .
The original DES algorithm operates on 64 - bit keys , but the top bit of every byte is used as a parity bit , thereby reducing the actual key size to 56 .
This is why the S - box step was dividing the key into eight 6 - bit blocks : 8*6=56 .
The key schedule splits that 56 - bit value into two 28 - bit halves , rotates them 1 or 2 bits to the left depending on a table , merges the result into a key , and feeds that into the next iteration .
There are 16 iterations total :
key Schedule key = schedule bits l r where bits = [ 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 1 ] ( l , r ) = split key 28 schedule [ ] _ _ = [ ] schedule ( n : ns ) l r = let l' = rotateL l n r' = rotateL r n k' = merge l' r' 28 in pc2 k ' : schedule ns l' r'
Here , we see our final P - box : pc2 , which stands for “ Permuted Choice 2 . ”
We ’ve reused split and merge from earlier .
All that ’s left is the plaintext conversion functions :
preparePlaintext :: [ Char ] -> [ Word64 ] preparePlaintext text = text64 ( to64 text ) where to64 = map ( fromIntegral . ord ) text64 [ ] = [ ] text64 ns = let ( x , rest ) = splitAt 8 ns w64 = foldl1 shiftOr ( reverse x ) shift Or k r = ( k `shiftL` 8 ) .|. r in w64 : text64 rest readPlaintext :: [ Word64 ] -> [ Char ] readPlaintext text = concatMap to8 text where to8 = map ( chr . fromIntegral ) . take 8 . from64 from64 = unfoldr ( \ k ->
Just ( k .&. 0xff , k `shiftR` 8 ) )
The first function takes a list of characters and converts them into a list of 64 - bit words .
The second function reverses the process .
Ideally , this would be bit - width aware ( in order to support different character encodings ) , and probably work on ByteStrings instead of [ Char ] , but those are trivial changes .
With the exception of the tables for P - boxes , the only bit left is the S - box implementation .
The S - box process is slightly weird in DES .
Recall that we called applySboxes on a list of 6 - bit words , B_1 through B_8 .
There are eight S - boxes , call them S_1 through S_8 .
Each S_k is a 4×16 array of values .
The “ substitution ” part of the S - box comes from the fact that we substitute each B_k for S_k [ i ] [j ] , where i is the 2 - bit value composed of the first and last bit of B_k , and j is the 4 - bit value in the middle .
These substitutions are then combined to recreate a 56 - bit value .
The above can be stated as follows :
applySboxes :: [ Word64 ] ->
Word64 applySboxes bs = foldr1 ( \ r k -> ( k `shiftL` 4 ) .|. r ) ( apply bs sboxes :: [ Word64 ] ) where apply [ ] [ ] = [ ] apply ( b : bs ) ( s : ss ) = let i = ( ( b .&. 0x20 ) `shiftR` 4 ) .|. ( b .&. 1 ) j = ( b `shiftR` 1 ) .&. 0xf in ( ( s ! i ) ! j ) : ( apply bs ss )
And , with the exception of the actual P - box and S - box data , we ’re done .
The data is given below , but first , a quick test :
* Crypto > encryptDES 0x0E329232EA6D0D73
“ This is an encrypted message ”
[ 13285721053034039710,15909830152601400232,6882462973091073748,1916557633710311361 ]
* Crypto > decryptDES 0x0E329232EA6D0D73 it
“ This is an encrypted message \NUL \NUL \NUL\NUL ”
Cool , no ?
Here ’s the really cool part : Comparatively speaking , DES is not very secure at all .
Triple DES is very secure .
To turn our DES implementation into triple DES , we simply triple the key schedule :
-- Encrypts a text message encryptDES3 keys = map ( encryptBlock3 keys ) .
preparePlaintext --
Decrypts a DES - encoded message decryptDES3 keys = readPlaintext . map ( decryptBlock3 keys ) -- Encrypts a block encryptBlock3 ( k1 , k2 , k3 ) = des ( keySchedule ( pc1 k1 ) ++ keySchedule ( pc1 k2 ) ++ keySchedule ( pc1 k3 ) ) -- Decrypts a block decryptBlock3 ( k1 , k2 , k3 ) = des ( reverse $ keySchedule ( pc1 k1 ) ++ keySchedule ( pc1 k2 ) ++ keySchedule ( pc1 k3 ) )
Everything infers the number of rounds from the key schedule , so by pasting three different key schedules on top of each other , we get triple DES with no further work .

Gonzales uses US Attorney appointment power that Congress banned Michael Roston
Published : Thursday June 14 , 2007 Print This Email This
In a Senate Judiciary Committee business meeting Thursday morning , Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) revealed that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales once again used an interim appointment authority at the heart of the US Attorneys controversy that Congress banned in a bill sent to the President for signature on June 4 .
" Senator Feinsteins U.S. Attorney bill .... repeals that portion of the Patriot Act Reauthorization that had allowed the Attorney General to circumvent advice and consent with respect to U.S. Attorneys .
That bill , the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007 , has been on the Presidents desk since June 4 .
It seems he just cannot bring himself to sign it .
Instead , we were informed yesterday through the Justice Department that the Attorney General has used the power that we have voted to repeal , again , " said Senator Leahy , the committee 's chairman .
Tracy Schmaler , a spokeswoman for Senator Leahy , clarified the situation in an e-mail to RAW STORY .
" It just so happens the committee got notice yesterday , that on June 16 , George Cardona 's 210 days as Acting U.S. Attorney in the Central District of California will have run out and the Attorney General will appoint him as an interim U.S. Attorney at that time .
( i.e. still using the end - run authority because Bush has slow - walked signing the bill ) , " she wrote .
RAW STORY could not reach the Justice Department for comment at press time .
On June 4 , the Congress sent S. 214 , the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007 , to President George W. Bush .
The bill overturned a measure stealthily passed by the Republican - led Congress in 2006 that allowed the Attorney General to indefinitely appoint US Attorneys on an interim basis .
Critics said the provision was intended to do an end - run around the standard Senate confirmation process for US Attorneys .
The bill passed the Senate by a 94 - 2 margin on March 20 , and also cleared the House of Representatives by a 306 - 114 vote on May 22 .
The President has yet to sign or veto the bill .
DEVELOPING ...
The call sheet for the final day of shooting on J.J. Abrams produced , Matt Reeves directed Cloverfield has been released on the Internet , and while it does n't give away the entire ending , it does reveal quite a bit of detail about the individual scenes , particularly the final scene of number one hundred and sixty .
The call sheet shows various scenes to be filmed on day thirty - three of thirty - three , and has details of some of the final scenes of the film .
Unfortunately I 've had to remove the direct link and reference to them as I 've just received a letter from the lawyers of Paramount Pictures who are claiming that since I 've linked to it on the web and mentioned the content that I am liable for improper receipt of a corporate document .
Despite Paramount 's clear rights to the Paramount Properties , Paramount has learned that you are reproducing , displaying and distributing the " Cheese " call sheet on your website at http://www.filmstalker.co.uk/.
You are hereby put on notice that the reproduction , display and / or distribution by you of Paramount Properties constitutes copyright infringement as well as an unauthorized misappropriation of a protected corporate document .
Further , your conduct would constitute an improper receipt of a corporate document .
Paramount hereby demands that you immediately remove the " Cheese " call sheet from your website .
I 'm keeping the original story for now and editing this as I really need to get to my bed and can't have a lawyer shutting the site down while I 'm sleeping - as has been done to a number of websites in the past by studios - so instead I 'll keep the links to the sites that are carrying the story .
I believe I am neither reproducing , displaying or distributing the content , I 'm merely linking to another sites pages , and if they have content which is being displayed illegally then surely the lawyers should get them to remove it .
Mind you , I guess I 'm the easier target .
NY Magazine has the call sheet through / Film which even carries the shooting details for an alternative ending for Cloverfield .
I would guess that they are filming two versions so that they can try and keep the secret going longer .
However with insiders revealing such things as these call sheets I wonder if they really can keep the secret that long .
Update : I responded to the letter last night , some six hours ago , and I 've heard nothing back .
Interestingly both SlashFilm and NY Magazine still retain the details on their site .
So I guess Paramount were going after the little fish rather than those that actually had the information .
NY Magazine still have the call sheet displayed with all the details .
I 'm still struggling to see what the big deal is , especially as nothing is given away in it .
Could this all be part of the ruse ?
Update :
It seems that Slash Film were contacted by the lawyers too and have removed the content , NY Magazine still have not , good for them .
It seems that this piece of information was n't one that the makers of Cloverfield wanted leaked out .
I still do n't understand why as the call sheet gives nothing away , and they 've already revealed to us that the start of the film will be after the attack is over .
Perhaps all the media and blogs should just print exactly what Paramount want about a film , press release after press release , and they could stop " leaking " content through " scoopers " and " insiders " for their own marketing on their own terms ?
They love what we do one minute and then the next they 're sending threatening letters .

I was sitting here today , and was trying to discern why the government - run health care issue made me more nervous than other government welfare programs .
I get ticked off , for example , about the horrendous rates of return ( think negative interest rates ) paid out by Social Security on what are nominally our retirement account premiums .
But I do n't get nervous .
Why ?
I think because unlike other welfare proposals that [ just ] cost us a ridiculous amount of money , the current plans for providing universal health care imply that my personal health care and health care options will get much worse .
When government provided housing , my housing did not get worse .
When government provided a ripoff retirement plan , my personal non-government retirement savings did not take a hit .
In all these cases , we paid out tons of money to provide some terrible base - level services for the poor and the true - government - believers in the middle class , but my options did not get worse .
However , in the case of health care , most proposals on the table will very likely result not only in much higher taxes , but also in my personal health care options getting worse .
The government will not want to provide multiple levels of service , and can't afford anything beyond " crappy " , so as a result we will all end up with crappy service ( Insert Rush song " trees " here ) .
A lot of crap is written about how great all these other socialized medicine services are , but thousands of people travel from other countries to have medical procedures in the states , and about zero travel the other way .
More on the topic of closing coverage gaps at the price of making your own personal care worse here .
More on why these gaps are not as large as advertised here .
Update : Quick proof --
My chosen health plan is now illegal in Massachussetts
I spoke to Prashant Sridharan , group product manager for Visual Studio .
He told me that Visual Studio 2008 , formerly codenamed Orcas , is set to ship by the end of the year , which probably means November or December .
Among many new features , he highlighed LINQ ( Language Integrated Query ) , which he classified as a productivity feature , new optimization and analysis tools , and scalability and performance improvements in Team System .
SQL Server 2008 will be supported .
We will also get designers for WPF ( Windows Presentation Foundation ) , and in due course for Silverlight as well .
Shridharan said that the final Silverlight designer might not make the initial release , but will be available shortly after at worst .
I am still puzzled as to why it has taken Microsoft a year from the release of .
NET Framework 3.0 , which was released with Vista , to come up with non -beta designers for WPF .
Shridharan did not really explain the delay , but commented that .
NET Framework 3.0 was really an interim release ; Visual Studio 2008 will ship more or less simultaneously with .
NET Framework 3.5 .
I asked whether the direction established with the free Express tools is likely to continue .
Shridharan says that it will , but that he feels the current Express line is too complex and confusing for its target novice users .
The 2008 range will be similar , but it may be further simplified in subsequent releases .
I am not sure how to decode this message .
Is it really that the tools are confusing for novices , or is Microsoft giving too much away and wants to draw back a little ?
The complexity problem is real , but chopping out a few features will not improve it much ; it would take radical re-thinking of the whole development approach – think PopFly , which I ’ve just noticed also uses the Express word in its slogan , “ Express yourself . ”
See also the note on commoditization below .
I also touched on the question of software factories , about which Jack Greenfield enthused at the architecture conference I attended in March .
Will this be surfaced at all in Visual Studio 2008 ?
Well , one thing which was apparent from my chat to Greenfield was that Microsoft ’s software architecture strategy is vulnerable to the musical chairs of internal reorganization .
Shridharan did say that the Patterns and Practices team is now integrated with the Visual Studio team , which should mean that more of its ( most interesting ) work is surfaced in Visual Studio itself .
That sounds good ; but what of Greenfield ’s vision for how software factories can transform software development ?
It does n’t seem to be one shared by Shridharan , who observed that all the Visual Studio designers are software factories and was vague about future developments in this area .
That may mean he is the wrong person to talk to about this , or it might suggest a more conservative approach than Greenfield hopes for .
In any event , it seems that it wo n’t be this release which delivers radical changes in the modeling or software factories area .
Finally , I asked Sridharan about the commoditization of development tools , and whether Microsoft might one day give away Visual Studio in order to promote its platform .
He prevaricated a bit .
“ We ’re not a profit centre in the same way as Office .
We do make a sizeable chunk of revenue of out Visual Studio … you can have co-existence of free tools with a high - end product on which you drive revenue . ”
All true , but the free tools are improving and the trend is in that direction .
“ We are I think close to an infexion point , but I do n’t think we ’re quite there yet , in terms of the commoditization around tools , ” says Sridharan .
“ We ’re very close .
Within Microsoft that gets a lot of debate , and we ’re investigating actively .
You ’re certainly not going to see anything happen in Visual Studio 2008 , but over time , who knows ? ”

A mandible from a 40,000 - year - old early modern human skeleton found in China and being studied by Erik Trinkaus Ph.D. , the Mary Tileston Hemenway Professor of anthropology in Arts & Sciences .
Researchers at WUSTL and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology ( IVPP ) in Beijing have been studying a 40,000 - year - old early modern human skeleton found in China and have determined that the " out of Africa " dispersal of modern humans may not have been as simple as once thought .
The research was published in the Proceedings of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences on April 3 .
Erik Trinkaus , Ph.D. , the Mary Tileston Hemenway Professor of anthropology in Arts & Sciences , his colleague Hong Shang , and others at the IVPP examined the skeleton , recovered in 2003 from the Tianyuan Cave , Zhoukoudian , near Beijing City .
The skeleton dates to 42,000 to 38,500 years ago , making it the oldest securely dated modern human skeleton in China and one of the oldest modern human fossils in eastern Eurasia .
The find could help explain how early man moved across Europe and Asia towards the East , a movement that is not completely understood by anthropologists .
The " Out of Africa " theory proposes that modern humans evolved in Africa and then spread throughout the earth somewhere around 70,000 years ago , replacing earlier humans with little or no interbreeding .
The specimen is basically a modern human , but it does have a few archaic characteristics , particularly in the teeth and hand bone .
According to Trinkaus , this morphological pattern implies that a simple spread of modern humans from Africa is unlikely , especially since younger specimens have been found in Eastern Eurasia with similar feature patterns .
According to Trinkaus and Shang , " the discovery promises to provide relevant paleontological data for our understanding of the emergence of modern humans in eastern Asia . "
They argue that the most likely explanation for the mix of features is interbreeding between early modern humans and the archaic populations of Europe and Asia .

Fun little easter eggs and hacks to view webcams and download any file
Fun little easter eggs and hacks to view webcams and download any file
We live in a world of constant connection where the products of our existence interrelate in such a way that we rarely leave a clean slate behind us .
Many people fail to see the correlation between technological convenience and disruption of privacy .
Even when nobody is watching , it is quite plausible that a computer somewhere is .
The data tracks we leave behind are traceable , and when the dots are connected , the trail leads right back to us .
I have compiled a list of 6 digitally traceable tracks we unconsciously leave behind as we trek through our daily routines .
I have also included a hypothetical example of how easy it can be to track someone down online by tracing their online affiliations and dabbling with the information that is found .
1. Username or Alias –
While passwords are always private , usernames are generally available to the public .
Many people use the same username on every single digital account they access .
Likewise , many usernames also double as online aliases used for identity on various searchable social media sites , discussion forums , etc .
This means that you can Google someone ’s username , discover other websites where they ’ve used it , and see if any of these other sites publicly associate an email address with the username .
The email address can then be Google ’d in an effort to uncover the real name of the individual who owns it .
Another option would be to send the person a well crafted email in hopes that that they will reply from an email client that includes their real name in the headers .
2. IP Address –
When you connect to the Internet you are assigned a unique Internet Protocol ( IP ) address that allows your computer to communicate with others .
Unless you use an anonymizing service such as Tor , or a free anonymous web proxy , your IP address is fairly easy to trace .
Your IP address is logged by every web server you visit and associated with every email you send .
There are numerous websites that offer free IP lookup services capable of telling someone the city , state and Internet service provider for any given IP address .
How do you think the RIAA tracks down all those vicious ( just kidding ) 14 year old peer to peer music pirates ?
3. Mobile Phone Transmission –
As you drive around town chatting on your mobile phone your signal is being handed off from one mobile phone tower to the next .
Most urban areas have several towers serving the vicinity .
If you are near at least three towers your exact whereabouts can be pinpointed to within a few hundred feet via a measurement process called triangulation .
Your location can usually be measured within a mile or so even in rural areas lacking three available towers .
Many large service providers make these capabilities widely known .
Sprint / Nextel calls it “ Mobile Locator “ .
Newer phones that include GPS capabilities can make the tracking process even easier .
4. Vehicle Telematics and GPS Monitoring –
These systems are used for a variety of purposes including , but not limited to , stolen vehicle tracking , emergency collision notification , mechanical diagnostics reporting , and driver navigation assistance .
General Motors ’ OnStar service is one of the more mainstream examples of a vehicle telematics system .
OnStar can instantly transmit detailed vehicle data back to their support center , including information about the mechanical condition and exact location of the vehicle .
Advocates say vehicle telematics systems provide an essential driver security service .
Critics say it ’s a major privacy concern , comparing it to that of “ Big Brother ” tracking your every move .
One thing is for sure , with vehicle telematics you ’re leaving digital tracks everywhere you go .
5. Public Transit Cards –
Most urban areas with public transit systems now rely on some form of passenger payment card to keep track of passenger fares .
Each card is equipped with a data strip and serial number unique to that specific card .
The transit computer systems use the serial number and data strip to keep track of the prepaid fare balance on each card .
Frequent passengers typically recharge the dollar balance on their transit cards automatically via a credit card , thus tying the passenger ’s full name and credit info to the unique serial number on their card .
When a passenger swipes their transit card to board a public transportation vehicle the location and timestamp are recorded in the transit system ’s computer database .
Although access to these records is restricted , police often use them to tie criminals to the time and place of a crime .
6. Malware – Malware ( also called spyware or adware ) is a generalized term describing computer software programs that automatically download and install themselves onto your computer without your permission or knowledge .
Much like a Trojan horse , malware can be hidden on malicious web pages or within other computer programs .
A user is infected when they use the web page or infected application .
The most common kind of malware will keep track of the websites you visit in order to target relevant pop-up ads to display on your computer as you browse the web .
Many of these same malware applications will also send your web browsing habits back to the creators for statistical evaluation purposes .
There are also more ruthless malware Trojans that record your keystrokes , steal your passwords , and even allow your computer to be remotely controlled by a computer cracker ’s botnet .
If you ’re not using a decent anti-malware suite your computer could be silently spilling your every move to the bad guys .
BONUS : Tracking Someone Down Online – I thought it would be fun to give a brief example of how a complete stranger could track someone down using the seemingly innocuous data we all regularly leave behind online .
I ’m not suggesting that anyone should actually do this ; it would be pretty darn creepy and stalker - like .
The point here is not to create paranoia , but to instead spread awareness .
Most people do n’t realize how easy it is phish out pieces of information online and connect the dots .
Consider the following hypothetical scenario :
You ’ve been chatting online with someone via MySpace for a couple of weeks now .
You decide you want to find out more about them .
Without asking them any personal questions , you take the following steps :
You type their exact MySpace username / alias into Google .
Google returns a variety of results including a series of posts on a discussion board forum .
The discussion board has a user profile page that displays basic information on the user including the user ’s email address .
You could now Google the email address , but instead you decide to run it though the Flickr Friends search tool .
This tool will tell you if a Flickr account has been opened using a specific email address .
Flickr is a popular photo sharing site .
Lo and behold , an account exists that matches the email address .
You visit the user ’s Flickr page which has various photo galleries of people at social gatherings .
After awhile you find a photo tagged with captions from a first - person perspective .
The caption clearly indicates which person in the photo owns the gallery , whom also happens to be the target you ’re tracking down .
Now you know what they look like .
Hmmmm …. interesting .
You create a free Gmail account with a username similar to one of the aliases found on either your target ’s MySpace friends list or their Flickr contacts list .
You craft a well written email to the target claiming to be the person whose alias you stole .
The goal is to get the target to reply to your email .
This email also contains an HTML embedded photo that you placed in a very obscure place on your public web server .
You placed it in an obscure place so that no body else would accidentally find it .
Your target checks the email and believes that you probably are who you claim to be , so they happily reply .
The email they send back to you has a “ From : ” header that includes their full name .
In the process of checking the email they also opened / accessed the random embedded photo housed on your web server .
You check your web server logs to see what IP address accessed the photo .
( Note : You may also be able to get their IP address from the full headers in the reply email . )
You take their IP address and plug it into the WhatIsMyIP IP Lookup tool which returns the geographic location and city where their IP address originates .
So let ’s recap …
You started off knowing only a person ’s online alias , but now you know their full name , city and location , email address , and you have their photo .
Finding their physical street address at this point is a cakewalk .
One could make the argument that not everyone is quite this easy to track down online .
But you do have to wonder , how people actually are ?
I bet there are thousands of them … and I ’m also pretty confident that you know a least a few of them personally .

The way wars are reported in the western media follows a depressingly predictable pattern : stage one , the crisis ; stage two , the demonisation of the enemy 's leader ; stage three , the demonisation of the enemy as individuals ; and stage four , atrocities .
At the moment we are at stages two and three : efforts to show that not only Osama bin Laden and the Taliban are fanatical and cruel but that most Afghans - even many Muslims - are as well .
We are already through stage one , the reporting of a crisis which negotiations appear unable to resolve .
Politicians , while calling for diplomacy , warn of military retaliation .
The media reports this as " We 're on the brink of war " , or " War is inevitable " .
News coverage concentrates on the build up of military force , and prominent columnists and newspaper editorials urge war .
But there are usually sizable minorities of citizens concerned that all avenues for peace have not been fully explored and although the mainstream media ignores or plays down their protests , these have to be dampened down unless they gain strength .
We now enter stage two of the pattern - the demonisation of the enemy 's leader .
Comparing the leader with Hitler is a good start because of the instant images that Hitler 's name provokes .
So when George Bush Sr likened Iraq 's takeover of Kuwait with the Nazi blitzkrieg in Europe in the 1930s , the media quickly took up the theme .
Saddam Hussein was painted as a second Hitler , hated by his own people and despised in the Arab world .
Equally , in the Kosovo conflict , the Serbs were portrayed as Nazi thugs intent on genocide and words like " Auschwitz - style furnaces " and " Holocaust " were used .
The crudest approach is to suggest that the leader is insane .
Saddam Hussein was " a deranged psychopath " , Milosevic was mad , and the Spectator recently headlined an article on Osama bin Laden : " Inside the mind of the maniac " .
Those who publicly question any of this can expect an even stronger burst of abuse .
In the Gulf war they were labelled " friends of terrorists , ranters , nutty , hypocrites , animals , barbarians , mad , traitors , unhinged , appeasers and apologists " .
The Mirror called peace demonstrators " misguided , twisted individuals always eager to comfort and support any country but their own .
They are a danger to all us - the enemy within . "
Columnist Christopher Hitchens , in last week 's Spectator article , Damn the doves , says that intellectuals who seek to understand the new enemy are no friends of peace , democracy or human life .
The third stage in the pattern is the demonisation not only of the leader but of his people .
The simplest way of doing this is the atrocity story .
The problem is that although many atrocity stories are true - after all , war itself is an atrocity - many are not .
Take the Kuwaiti babies story .
Its origins go back to the first world war when British propaganda accused the Germans of tossing Belgian babies into the air and catching them on their bayonets .
Dusted off and updated for the Gulf war , this version had Iraqi soldiers bursting into a modern Kuwaiti hospital , finding the premature babies ward and then tossing the babies out of incubators so that the incubators could be sent back to Iraq .
The story , improbable from the start , was first reported by the Daily Telegraph in London on September 5 1990 .
But the story lacked the human element ; it was an unverified report , there were no pictures for television and no interviews with mothers grieving over dead babies .
That was soon rectified .
An organisation calling itself Citizens for a Free Kuwait ( financed by the Kuwaiti government in exile ) had signed a $ 10 m contract with the giant American public relations company , Hill & Knowlton , to campaign for American military intervention to oust Iraq from Kuwait .
The Human Rights Caucus of the US Congress was meeting in October and Hill & Knowlton arranged for a 15 - year - old Kuwaiti girl to tell the babies ' story before the congressmen .
She did it brilliantly , choking with tears at the right moment , her voice breaking as she struggled to continue .
The congressional committee knew her only as " Nayirah " and the television segment of her testimony showed anger and resolution on the faces of the congressmen listening to her .
President Bush referred to the story six times in the next five weeks as an example of the evil of Saddam 's regime .
In the Senate debate whether to approve military action to force Saddam out of Kuwait , seven senators specifically mentioned the incubator babies atrocity and the final margin in favour of war was just five votes .
John R Macarthur 's study of propaganda in the war says that the babies atrocity was a definitive moment in the campaign to prepare the American public for the need to go to war .
It was not until nearly two years later that the truth emerged .
The story was a fabrication and a myth , and Nayirah , the teenage Kuwaiti girl , coached and rehearsed by Hill & Knowlton for her appearance before the Congressional Committee , was in fact the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States .
By the time Macarthur revealed this , the war was won and over and it did not matter any more .
So what should we make of the stories in the British press this week about torture in Afghanistan ?
A defector from the Taliban 's secret police told a reporter in Quetta , Pakistan , that he was commanded to " find new ways of torture so terrible that the screams will frighten crows from their nests " .
The defector then listed a series of chilling forms of torture that he said he and his fellow officers developed .
" Nowhere else in the world has such barbarity and cruelty as Afghanistan . "
The story rings false and defectors of all kinds are well - known for telling interviewers what they think they want to hear .
On the other hand , it might be true .
The trouble is , how can we tell ?
The media demands that we trust it but too often that trust has been betrayed .
 Phillip Knightley is the author of The First Casualty , a history of war reporting ( Prion ) .
Dry fit of the CDs over the fluorescent bulb indicated that it is just a little bit too big .
Goes over the electronic prong but not the bulb itself .
I will have to make the hole bigger .
I was hoping to avoid that !
This is the center of a CD before it is enlarged .
To enlarge the hole on the CD I used a tapered grinding bit .
Placed CDs on a piece of Styrofoam to prevent scratching .
The drill press made this fairly easily .
The tapered grinding bit would self center the hole which also helped the process .
Grind a little bit on one side then flip it over and grind a little bit on the other side .
Every CD seamed to be made of a different quality or type of plastic .
Some would melt more than grind away .
It just meant using a little less pressure and some more time .
After it looked right I would test each one on the bulb to make sure it would fit .
This is the center of a CD after it is enlarged .
Only a small difference .
After enlarging the center I had to make another hole for a wire to connect to the top of the bulb .
I made a jig for the drill press to do this .
I wanted the hole the same distance from the center each time .
To create the jig I drilled a 1/ 4 " hole all the way through a board .
then drilled another one larger to an exact depth so that enough of the grinding bit poked out to align the CDs .
From June 2005 to March 2006 , the Center for Media and Democracy documented television newsrooms ' use of selected video news releases ( VNRs ) and satellite media tour ( SMT ) " interviews . "
While these 36 examples represent less than one percent of VNRs offered to newsrooms each year , this report provides the most comprehensive survey of fake TV news to date .

占いの結果を気にするタイプもいますし、まったく信用しない人もいます。性格的なものもあるようですが、私は、どちらかと言うと信じるタイプ。沢山の占いがありますが、私達の目に一番触れやすいのは、星座占いでしょう。朝のテレビ番組には、必ずと言って占いコーナーがあります。今日の運勢を見て出勤する人もいます。運勢が悪ければ、自分の行動に注意することもあります。運勢が良ければ、一日はどことなくうれしい気持ちになります。
雑誌にも占いのページがあります。これは毎日の占いではなくて、今月の占いみたいな感じ。ついつい、それを見てしまいます。鑑定結果がよかったら気持ちもアゲアゲになってしまう。単純なのかもしれませんが、そんな人も意外と多いのではないでしょうか？
悪い結果が出た場合はどうしていますか？私は、それほど気にしません。何か良くないことが起きても、冷静に対応できるからです。心構えができる……そんな感じですから、ありがたいアドバイスと考えているわけです。一日をすごすヒントや指針にもなっています。そんな不思議なパワーを持っている占いは大好きです。
人生に迷ったときには占いを
人は生きていくうちに自分で自分のことがわからなくなることがあります。
それも一度や二度ではなく、頻繁に訪れることもあるものです。
そんなとき、どうすればいいのか、自分はおかしくなってしまったんじゃないかと慌てたり悩んだりするかもしれませんが大丈夫、これはごく当たり前のことなんです。
逆にこういった状況にならないほうが、人として成長できない理由ともなりえるのですから。
ただ問題は、そのような状況になったときの対処法です。
状況はどうしようもないのですが、そのまま放置していては前に進むことはできません。
したがって自分自身でその時考えられる最良の方法を試してみることが大切です。
その方法のひとつとして挙げられるのが、占いです。
こういった状況の時にはほとんどの場合、気分的には落ち込んでいるはずです。
占いをしてもらうことで、新たな道筋も開けることでしょう。
また、自分では気づいていなかった事柄を指摘されて前進することもあるかもしれませんよ。
今ではインターネットには多くの占いサイトが存在していますし、その中には無料で占ってもらえるところも少なくありません。

Hindsight
Speaking to you today marks a milestone in my life .
I am 40 years old .
22 years ago , when I was in your seat , I never , ever thought I would be 40 years old .
The implications of being your speaker frightens me .
For one thing , when a 40 year old geeser spoke at my baccalaureate ceremony , he was about the last person I 'd believe .
I have no intention of giving you the boring speech that you are dreading .
This speech will be short , sweet , and not boring .
I am going to talk about hindsights today .
Hindsights that I 've accumulated , in the 20 years from where you are to where I am .
Do n't blindly believe me .
Do n't take what I say as " truth . "
Just listen .
Perhaps my experience can help you out a tiny bit .
I will present them ala David Letterman .
Yes , 40 - year old people can still stay up past .
# 10 : Live off your parents as long as possible .
When I spoke at this ceremony two years ago , this was the most popular hindsight - except from the point of view of the parents .
Thus , I knew I was on the right track .
I was a diligent Oriental in high school and college .
I took college - level classes and earned college - level credits .
I rushed through college in / 2 years .
I never traveled or took time off because I thought it would n't prepare me for work and it would delay my graduation .
Frankly , I blew it .
You are going to work the rest of your lives , so do n't be in a rush to start .
Stretch out your college education .
Now is the time to suck life into your lungs - before you have a mortgage , kids , and car payments .
Take whole semester off to travel overseas .
Take jobs and internships that pay less money or no money .
Investigate your passions on your parent 's nickel .
Or dime .
Or quarter .
Or dollar .
Your goal should be to extend college to at least six years .
Delay , as long as possible , the inevitable entry into the workplace and a lifetime of servitude to bozos who know less than you do , but who make more money .
Also , you should n't deprive your parents of the pleasure of supporting you .
# 9 Pursue joy , not happiness .
This is probably the hardest lesson of all to learn .
It probably seems to you that the goal in life is to be " happy . "
Oh , you maybe have to sacrifice and study and work hard , but , by and large , happiness should be predictable .
Nice house .
Nice car .
Nice material things .
Take my word for it , happiness is temporary and fleeting .
Joy , by contrast , is unpredictable .
It comes from pursuing interests and passions that do not obviously result in happiness .
Pursuing joy , not happiness will translate into one thing over the next few years for you : Study what you love .
This may also not be popular with parents .
When I went to college , I was " marketing driven . "
It 's also an Oriental thing .
I looked at what fields had the greatest job opportunities and prepared myself for them .
This was brain dead .
There are so many ways to make a living in the world , it does n't matter that you 've taken all the " right " courses .
I do n't think one person on the original Macintosh team had a classic " computer science " degree .
You parents have a responsibility in this area .
Do n't force your kids to follow in your footsteps or to live your dreams .
My father was a senator in Hawaii .
His dream was to be a lawyer , but he only had a high school education .
He wanted me to be a lawyer .
For him , I went to law school .
For me , I quit after two weeks .
I view this a terrific validation of my inherent intelligence .
# 8 : Challenge the known and embrace the unknown .
One of the biggest mistakes you can make in life is to accept the known and resist the unknown .
You should , in fact , do exactly the opposite : challenge the known and embrace the unknown .
Let me tell you a short story about ice .
In the late 800s there was a thriving ice industry in the Northeast .
Companies would cut blocks of ice from frozen lakes and ponds and sell them around the world .
The largest single shipment was 200 tons that was shipped to India .
00 tons got there unmelted , but this was enough to make a profit .
These ice harvesters , however , were put out of business by companies that invented mechanical ice makers .
It was no longer necessary to cut and ship ice because companies could make it in any city during any season .
These ice makers , however , were put out of business by refrigerator companies .
If it was convenient to make ice at a manufacturing plant , imagine how much better it was to make ice and create cold storage in everyone 's home .
You would think that the ice harvesters would see the advantages of ice making and adopt this technology .
However , all they could think about was the known : better saws , better storage , better transportation .
Then you would think that the ice makers would see the advantages of refrigerators and adopt this technology .
The truth is that the ice harvesters could n't embrace the unknown and jump their curve to the next curve .
Challenge the known and embrace the unknown , or you 'll be like the ice harvester and ice makers .
# 7 : Learn to speak a foreign language , play a musical instrument , and play non-contact sports .
Learn a foreign language .
I studied Latin in high school because I thought it would help me increase my vocabulary .
It did , but trust me when I tell you it 's very difficult to have a conversation in Latin today other than at the Vatican .
And despite all my efforts , the Pope has yet to call for my advice .
Learn to play a musical instrument .
My only connection to music today is that I was named after Guy Lombardo .
Trust me : it 's better than being named after Guy 's brother , Carmen .
Playing a musical instrument could be with me now and stay with me forever .
Instead , I have to buy CDs at Tower .
I played football .
I loved football .
Football is macho .
I was a middle linebacker - arguably , one of the most macho position in a macho game .
But you should also learn to play a non-contact sport like basketball or tennis .
That is , a sport you can play when you 're over the hill .
It will be as difficult when you 're 40 to get twenty two guys together in a stadium to play football as it is to have a conversation in Latin , but all the people who wore cute , white tennis outfits can still play tennis .
And all the macho football players are sitting around watching television and drinking beer .
# 6 : Continue to learn .
Learning is a process not an event .
I thought learning would be over when I got my degree .
It 's not true .
You should never stop learning .
Indeed , it gets easier to learn once you 're out of school because it 's easier to see the relevance of why you need to learn .
You 're learning in a structured , dedicated environment right now .
On your parent 's nickel .
But do n't confuse school and learning .
You can go to school and not learn a thing .
You can also learn a tremendous amount without school .
# 5 : Learn to like yourself or change yourself until you can like yourself .
I know a forty year old woman who was a drug addict .
She is a mother of three .
She traced the start of her drug addiction to smoking dope in high school .
I 'm not going to lecture you about not taking drugs .
Hey , I smoked dope in high school .
Unlike Bill Clinton , I inhaled .
Also unlike Bill Clinton , I exhaled .
This woman told me that she started taking drugs because she hated herself when she was sober .
She did not like drugs so much as much as she hated herself .
Drugs were not the cause though she thought they were the solution .
She turned her life around only after she realized that she was in a downward spiral .
Fix your problem .
Fix your life .
Then you wo n't need to take drugs .
Drugs are neither the solution nor the problem .
Frankly , smoking , drugs , alcohol - and using an IBM PC - are signs of stupidity .
End of discussion . # 4 : Do n't get married too soon .
I got married when I was 32 .
That 's about the right age .
Until you 're about that age , you may not know who you are .
You also may not know who you 're marrying .
I do n't know one person who got married too late .
I know many people who got married too young .
If you do decide to get married , just keep in mind that you need to accept the person for what he or she is right now . # 3 : Play to win and win to play .
Playing to win is one of the finest things you can do .
It enables you to fulfill your potential .
It enables you to improve the world and , conveniently , develop high expectations for everyone else too .
And what if you lose ?
Just make sure you lose while trying something grand .
Avinash Dixit , an economics professor at Princeton , and Barry Nalebuff , an economics and management professor at the Yale School of Organization and Management , say it this way : " If you are going to fail , you might as well fail at a difficult task .
Failure causes others to downgrade their expectations of you in the future .
The seriousness of this problem depends on what you attempt . "
In its purest form , winning becomes a means , not an end , to improve your self and your competition .
Winning is also a means to play again .
The unexamined life may not be worth living , but the unlived life is not worth examining .
The rewards of winning - money , power , satisfaction , and self - confidence - should not be squandered .
Thus , in addition to playing to win , you have a second , more important obligation :
To compete again to the depth and breadth and height that your soul can reach .
Ultimately , your greatest competition is yourself . # 2 : Obey the absolutes .
Playing to win , however , does not mean playing dirty .
As you grow older and older , you will find that things change from absolute to relative .
When you were very young , it was absolutely wrong to lie , cheat , or steal .
As you get older , and particularly when you enter the workforce , you will be tempted by the " system " to think in relative terms .
" I made more money . " " I have a nicer car . "
" I went on a better vacation . "
Worse , " I did n't cheat as much on my taxes as my partner . "
" I just have a few drinks .
I do n't take cocaine . "
" I do n't pad my expense reports as much as others . "
This is completely wrong .
Preserve and obey the absolutes as much as you can .
If you never lie , cheat , or steal , you will never have to remember who you lied to , how you cheated , and what you stole .
There absolutely are absolute rights and wrongs .
#: Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone .
This is the most important hindsight .
It does n't need much explanation .
I 'll just repeat it : Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone .
Nothing - not money , power , or fame - can replace your family and friends or bring them back once they are gone .
Our greatest joy has been our baby , and I predict that children will bring you the greatest joy in your lives - especially if they graduate from college in four years .
And now , I 'm going to give you one extra hindsight because I 've probably cost your parents thousands of dollars today .
It 's something that I hate to admit to .
By and large , the older you get , the more you 're going to realize that your parents were right .
More and more - until finally , you become your parents .
I know you 're all saying , " Yeah , right . "
Mark my words .
Remember these ten things : if just one of them helps just one of you , this speech will have been a success : # 10 : Live off your parents as long as possible .
# 9 : Pursue joy , not happiness .
# 7 : Learn to speak a foreign language , play a musical instrument , and play non-contact sports .
# 6 : Continue to learn .
# 5 : Learn to like yourself or change yourself until you can like yourself . # 4 : Do n't get married too soon .
# 3 : Play to win and win to play .
# 2 : Obey the absolutes .
# : Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone .
Congratulations on your graduation .
Thank you very much .

Thus , in addition to playing to win , you have a second , more important obligation :
To compete again to the depth and breadth and height that your soul can reach .
Ultimately , your greatest competition is yourself . # 2 : Obey the absolutes .
Playing to win , however , does not mean playing dirty .
As you grow older and older , you will find that things change from absolute to relative .
When you were very young , it was absolutely wrong to lie , cheat , or steal .
As you get older , and particularly when you enter the workforce , you will be tempted by the " system " to think in relative terms .
" I made more money . " " I have a nicer car . "
" I went on a better vacation . "
Worse , " I did n't cheat as much on my taxes as my partner . "
" I just have a few drinks .
I do n't take cocaine . "
" I do n't pad my expense reports as much as others . "
This is completely wrong .
Preserve and obey the absolutes as much as you can .
If you never lie , cheat , or steal , you will never have to remember who you lied to , how you cheated , and what you stole .
There absolutely are absolute rights and wrongs .
#: Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone .
This is the most important hindsight .
It does n't need much explanation .
I 'll just repeat it : Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone .
Nothing - not money , power , or fame - can replace your family and friends or bring them back once they are gone .
Our greatest joy has been our baby , and I predict that children will bring you the greatest joy in your lives - especially if they graduate from college in four years .
And now , I 'm going to give you one extra hindsight because I 've probably cost your parents thousands of dollars today .
It 's something that I hate to admit to .
By and large , the older you get , the more you 're going to realize that your parents were right .
More and more - until finally , you become your parents .
I know you 're all saying , " Yeah , right . "
Mark my words .
Remember these ten things : if just one of them helps just one of you , this speech will have been a success : # 10 : Live off your parents as long as possible .
# 9 : Pursue joy , not happiness .
# 7 : Learn to speak a foreign language , play a musical instrument , and play non-contact sports .
# 6 : Continue to learn .
# 5 : Learn to like yourself or change yourself until you can like yourself . # 4 : Do n't get married too soon .
# 3 : Play to win and win to play .
# 2 : Obey the absolutes .
# : Enjoy your family and friends before they are gone .
Congratulations on your graduation .
Thank you very much .

Female koalas indulge in lesbian " sex sessions " , rejecting male suitors and attempting to mate with each other , sometimes up to five at a time , according to researchers .
The furry , eucalyptus - eating creatures appear to develop this tendency for same - sex liaisons when they are in captivity .
In the wild , they remain heterosexual .
Scientists monitoring the marsupials with digital cameras counted three homosexual interactions for every heterosexual one .
" Some females rejected the advances of males that were in their enclosures , only to become willing participants in homosexual encounters immediately after , " say the researchers .
" On several occasions more than one pair of females shared the same pole , and multiple females mounted each other simultaneously .
At least one multiple encounter involved five female koalas .
“ One day I was eating a bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk and I thought , this has absolutely no flavor , ” he said .
“ I looked at the label and saw it was made by Hershey .
I was outraged . ”
Cadbury Dairy Milk is the iconic British candy bar , the one most likely to be tucked into the suitcase of a Yankee tourist looking for an inexpensive souvenir .
Versions are filled with caramel , whipped fondant , whole nuts or pellets of shortbread cookie .
It ’s a different bar from the Cadbury bar available in the United States .
According to the label , a British Cadbury Dairy Milk bar contains milk , sugar , cocoa mass , cocoa butter , vegetable fat and emulsifiers .
The version made by the Hershey Company , which holds the license from Cadbury - Schweppes to produce the candy in the United States under the British company ’s direction , starts its ingredient list with sugar .
It lists lactose and the emulsifier soy lecithin , which keeps the cocoa butter from separating from the cocoa .
The American product also lists “ natural and artificial flavorings . ”
Tony Bilsborough , a spokesman for Cadbury - Schweppes in Britain , said his company ships its specially formulated chocolate crumb — a mash of dried milk and chocolate to which cocoa butter will be added later — to Hershey , Pa .
What happens next accounts for the differences .
“ I imagine it ’s down to the final processing and the blending , ” he said .
After consulting with chocolate manufacturers in each country , Cadbury tries to replicate the taste people grew up with , he said .
In the United States , that means a bar that is more akin to a Hershey bar , which to many British palates tastes sour .
Kirk Seville , a spokesman for the Hershey Company , declined to explain the manufacturing process , saying the company preferred not to take part in a discussion about the manufacturing differences between a British and an American Cadbury bar .

For people here with a taste for British candy , no explanation is necessary .
Their opinions are already formed .
We are a long way from the glory days of Mission Accomplished , when the Iraq war was over before it was over — indeed before it really began — and the president could dress up like a fighter pilot and land on an aircraft carrier , and the nation , led by a pliable media , would applaud .
Now , late in this sad , terribly diminished presidency , mired in an unwinnable war of their own making , and increasingly on the defensive about events which , to their surprise , they do not control , the president and his men have turned , with some degree of desperation , to history .
In their view Iraq under Saddam was like Europe dominated by Hitler , and the Democrats and critics in the media are likened to the appeasers of the 1930s .
The Iraqi people , shorn of their immensely complicated history , become either the people of Europe eager to be liberated from the Germans , or a little nation that great powerful nations ought to protect .
Most recently in this history rummage sale — and perhaps most surprisingly — Bush has become Harry Truman .
Illustrations by Edward Sorel .
We have lately been getting so many history lessons from the White House that I have come to think of Bush , Cheney , Rice , and the late , unlamented Rumsfeld as the History Boys .
They are people groping for rationales for their failed policy , and as the criticism becomes ever harsher , they cling to the idea that a true judgment will come only in the future , and history will save them .
Ironically , it is the president himself , a man notoriously careless about , indeed almost indifferent to , the intellectual underpinnings of his actions , who has come to trumpet loudest his close scrutiny of the lessons of the past .
Though , before , he tended to boast about making critical decisions based on instinct and religious faith , he now talks more and more about historical mandates .
Usually he does this in the broadest — and vaguest — sense : History teaches us …
We know from history … History shows us .
In one of his speaking appearances in March 2006 , in Cleveland , I counted four references to history , and what it meant for today , as if he had had dinner the night before with Arnold Toynbee , or at the very least Barbara Tuchman , and then gone home for a few hours to read his Gibbon .
I am deeply suspicious of these presidential seminars .
We have , after all , come to know George Bush fairly well by now , and many of us have come to feel — not only because of what he says , but also because of the sheer cockiness in how he says it — that he has a tendency to decide what he wants to do first , and only then leaves it to his staff to look for intellectual justification .
Many of us have always sensed a deep and visceral anti-intellectual streak in the president , that there was a great chip on his shoulder , and that the burden of the fancy schools he attended — Andover and Yale — and even simply being a member of the Bush family were too much for him .
It was as if he needed not only to escape but also to put down those of his peers who had been more successful .
From that mind - set , I think , came his rather unattractive habit of bestowing nicknames , most of them unflattering , on the people around him , to remind them that he was in charge , that despite their greater achievements they still worked for him .
Daily Show : ' America to the Rescue ' in the Middle East David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Jon Stewart offered a Daily Show - style history of American arms policy in the Middle East on Wednesday 's program .
" Obviously , the Iraq War is very complicated , " he began .
" It 's another reason why Barack Obama 's foreign policy inexperience is going to be an important issue in this campaign .
You can't have a newbie overthrowing the delicate balance that we have engineered and maintained in this complex region . "
Stewart then proceeded to give examples of that " delicate balance , " starting by pointing out that " a weakened Iraq has meant a strengthened Iran .
... Our Sunni friends in Saudi Arabia are none too happy about that .
But that 's no problem for our experienced hands . "
" America to the Rescue " read the graphic , as Stewart explained , " A few weeks ago , the White House announced plans to sell $ 20 billion in weapons to the Saudi royal family .
Boom !
Balance of power restored !
Trust me , you do n't have to worry about billions of dollars in weapons being sent to a country like that .
Because , may I remind you , a full 20 % of the 9/11 hijackers were not from there . "
" Of course , this move may intimidate our circumcised friends to the west , " Stewart continued , adding -- with a recurrence of the " America to the Rescue " graphic -- that there was no need to worry , because " the White House announced that it will increase aid to Israel by 25 % , meaning an additional $ 30 billion over the next decade to them . "
" We 've been rescuing the Middle East for some time now , " Stewart went on .
" Think back to 1990 , when an oil - rich , very nice little country named Kuwait was invaded by the very not - nice Iraq .
...
At that time , we had to weaken Saddam Hussein , who had become very powerful after purchasing a shitload of weapons from -- oh boy .
Oops . "
" See , at that time we had to give him the weapons , because he was at war with Iran , " said Stewart , getting back in stride .
" But see , once Saddam got real powerful , we had to worry that he would topple our friends in Saudi Arabia .
Which is why we put troops there , which kind of pissed off , uh , that guy , who had also become very powerful , fighting the Russians in Afghanistan after getting weapons from -- son of a bitch !
What the fuck ! "
" My point is , foreign policy experience is very important , " concluded Stewart .

A legged snake fossil found in 2003 in Patagonia , Argentina , may be the most primitive snake ever found – the sacral region is shown here ( Image : H Zaher )
An articulated portion of the Najash fossil ( Image : H Zaher )
Scientists have found fossils of a legged snake with “ hips ” – a specimen that could be the most primitive snake ever unearthed .
The find suggests early snakes were not creatures of the sea and has reignited the debate over how snakes evolved .
Advertisement
Sebastián Apesteguía at the Argentine Museum of Natural History and his team found the snake fossil in a terrestrial deposit in the Río Negro province of north Patagonia , Argentina , in 2003 .
Unlike a handful of legged fossils found in marine deposits and identified as snakes over the past decade , the new fossil , named Najash rionegrina , has a well - defined sacrum supporting a pelvis and functional hind legs outside of its ribcage .
The creature ’s skeletal structure suggests it was evolutionarily closer to its four - legged ancestor than previous fossils .
And since the scientists found it in a terrestrial deposit , it is near certain that the animal lived on land .
“ This snake is an important addition because it is the first snake with a sacrum .
This represents an intermediate morphology that has never before been seen , ” says Hussam Zaher , curator of herpetology at the University of São Paulo in Brazil , and part of the research team .
The burrowers
The fossil was found in a deposit from the late Cretaceous period and Zaher says the snake is at least 90 million years old .
“ This fills an important morphological gap of information regarding the early evolution of snakes , ” he says .
Zaher and Apesteguía argue that the Najash fossil supports the hypothesis that snakes evolved on land , eventually losing their limbs as they became soil burrowers .
That idea was popular for most of the 20th century , but when legged fossils found in marine sediments in and around Israel were identified as snakes around the turn of the millennium , a group of scientists resurrected an older , alternate theory .
They say snakes lost their limbs in the oceans and seas rather than on land , and that they evolved from now extinct marine lizards called mosasaurs .
Fins and paddles
Zaher told New Scientist : “ We can now reject the hypothesis of marine origin .
This Najash snake fossil suggests that mosasaur lizards were not the most closely related group of lizards to snakes . ”
He says the marine legged snakes are of a more recent lineage and probably represent the first invasion of the sea by snakes .
Blair Hedges , an evolutionary biologist at Pennsylvania State University , US , says : “ In one fell swoop , this new fossil kind of casts doubt on the aquatic hypothesis . ”
His DNA sequencing studies suggest a terrestrial origin for snakes .
And he says that , looking at evolutionary history , it is difficult to find examples of limb loss in an aquatic environment .
“ We see many cases where animals that walked on land eventually evolved lineages that invaded the oceans .
Almost all of them kept their limbs and turned them into fins or paddles , ” he says .
Missing ancestor
Zaher admits that even if the new fossil does prove snakes did not lose their legs in the seas , there are many questions about snake evolution left unsolved .
At the top of that list is the question of what lizard group is most closely related to snakes .
“ We do not have an undisputed hypothesis on that question , ” he admits .
Michael Caldwell , from the University of Alberta , Canada , and one of the researchers who reintroduced the marine hypothesis , told New Scientist : “ These specimens provide important new information on the anatomy of Cretaceous snakes . ”
But he is also critical of the interpretations of the new fossil ’s anatomy .
He argues that without identifying a closest ancestor , there is no robust way of gaining insight into the origin of snakes and says the new study ’s assessment of the Najash snake only takes into account snakes rather than all the snakes and lizards in the squamate order , which includes mosasaurs .
Furthermore , he argues , calling the specimen the most primitive may be incorrect because the fossils identified in marine environments are at least 8 million years older .
Mr. Hill spoke as the director general of the United Nations atomic agency , Mohamed ElBaradei , said today that his 10 - member team of inspectors had visited the nuclear complex in Yongbyon , 100 kilometers , or 62 miles , north of Pyongyang , and had verified that the reactor there was switched off , as North Korea had announced over the weekend .
“ After tomorrow , we will be able to report , hopefully , that all of the five facilities have been shut down , ” Mr. ElBaradei said , speaking in Bangkok .
He was referring to five facilities North Korea has agreed to shut down under a February agreement with the United States , South Korea , China , and Russia in return for an initial shipment of 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil .
The facilities include a radiochemical laboratory that extracts plutonium from spent fuel rods from the five - megawatt reactor in Yongbyon , and two new , bigger reactors under construction nearby .
Speaking to Fox News on Sunday , the United States ’ national security adviser , Stephen J. Hadley , said that Washington ’s aim was “ ultimately dismantling that program , getting a full accounting of what they ’ve been doing with any covert enrichment program and finally getting them to turn over any nuclear materials from which nuclear weapons have or could be made . ”
A statement from the North Korean foreign ministry in Pyongyang on Sunday said that that will depend “ on what practical measures the U.S. and Japan , in particular , will take to roll back their hostile policies toward ” North Korea .
North Korea said the IAEA team was only allowed to “ verify and monitor ” the shutdown and was not allowed to inspect its nuclear sites .
That strips the agency of any ability to independently investigate how much plutonium and atomic bombs North Korea has produced from the Yongbyon facilities and what it has done with the uranium enrichment equipment that American officials say North Korea bought from Pakistan .
GETTING halves of two cars was not what Paulette Day expected when she bought a red 2004 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that year from a dealership near Detroit for $ 22,000 .
The car was used , but it was a “ G.M. certified ” car , meaning it had supposedly passed a rigorous inspection by the dealer .
As General Motors says in its marketing material , buying a certified car means “ the reliability of new and the affordability of used . ”
Not in this case .
Ms. Day said she became suspicious about the car after noticing the paint did not match .
After a mechanic put the car on a lift and saw the welds , Ms. Day learned that it included pieces from the front of one Monte Carlo and the rear of another , both seriously damaged in crashes .
“ I thought being certified , there are supposed to be so many checkpoints to make sure the car is safe , ” she said .
“ I think they skipped over all of it .
They would have had to notice that . ”
Certified used cars have become popular over the last five years , favored by consumers worried about getting a lemon when they buy used .
A guarantee from an automaker that the car checks out is peace of mind for which an increasing number of people are willing to pay extra , sometimes $ 2,000 or more .
But some consumers are finding that certified does not protect them and some , like Ms. Day , are filing lawsuits .
Speaking of obsessive - compulsives , this hand - made Modest Mouse video by Max Tyrie is simply stupefying :
Myself and a couple have friends have entered the above into the Modest Mouse video competition .
Using green screen footage provided by the band we cut a simple music video .
We then degraded the images and printed out each frame sequentially .
( all 4133 of them )
We then nailed each " shot " of 50 - 100 posters to various structures and posts .
Then using a digital SLR camera with a long exposure we frame by frame shot each poster .
Oh , and theres a little video projection ( again , frame by frame on the SLR ) just to mix it up .
There is no compositing , no shortcuts , just lots of blood , sweat and tears , and a huge Kinkos bill !

My current scheming is centered around Conjure , a make ( 1 ) replacement written in Scheme .
If you are familiar with Scons , a good approximation is to think about Conjure as Scons , but using Scheme instead of Python .
The key point in these systems is that the language is not just an implementation detail ( as , say , C is in make ) , but soars up to surface in that build scripts are actually Scheme ( or Python ) programs .
I do n’t think i need to go into the details of why having at your disposal a full - fledged high - level language has advantages .
But of course , more power implies more risks , and end users my be confused with , or not willing to learn , your favourite programming language .
This , in my opinion , is a problem much easily surmountable in Scheme than Python ( and that ’s one of the reasons i keep working on Conjure , Scons notwithstanding ) .
How so ?
Syntactic abstraction , of course .
Besides having a far simpler syntax , Scheme ( and Lisp in general ) is the perfect vehicle to implementing domain - specific languages ( see , for instance this nice article by V.S. Lugosky ) .
Thus , one of the goals of Conjure is to provide a declarative DSL tailored to defining software construction tasks and their interrelationships , usable as such even without any knowledge of Scheme .
But then , DSL or not , a Conjure build file is still a Scheme program , and power users can extend and twist the system as much as they want .
The initial draft of the Conjure User ’s Manual has an introductory section where i indulge in a boring discussion of these issues , if you ’re so perversely inclined .
The rest of the manual , by the way , is hopelessly inaccurate and out of sync with the current implementation , which you can browse in my darcs repository .
As you will see , nowadays Conjure is embedded in a wider plan for world domination which includes Spells , s48 - worlds and s42 .
Those projects have been impulsed by my talented and indefatigable friend and conniver Rotty , who finally assimilated me into the s48 underground .
The Conjure homepage provides more details and links .
Please , do n’t be put off if you ’re not a scheme48 aficionado : eventually , Conjure will run on as many Scheme implementations as possible .
This is why it is based on Spells ( which had its beginnings as a Conjure library , but thanks to Rotty has grown up into a project ( very ) worth in and by itself ) , a portability framework .
Think of the current conjure48 as a proof - of - concept implementation that will settle the basis for the portable Conjure .

The Suffolk wetland which the birds are nesting in was a carrot field until the RSPB turned it into Lakenheath Fen Nature Reserve 11 years ago .
Large - scale drainage of fens for agriculture had led to the birds ' disappearance in the 1600s .
RSPB chief executive Graham Wynne said the arrival of the birds came ahead of plans to make further wetland reserves in the Norfolk and Cambridgeshire fens .
RSPB staff discovered the nest by chance while carrying out a routine survey of the site .
It is believed the eggs are near to hatching .
COMMON CRANE ( Grus Grus ) Wingspan : 180-240 cm Weight : 4.5-6kg Global population : 220,000
The RSPB plans to create 20 sq miles ( 51 sq km ) of wetlands in the fens over the next 20 years .
Mr Wynne said : " The arrival of cranes at Lakenheath Fen is fantastic news for the future of this species in the UK .
" It is also testimony to the truly inspirational work done at the site - we have gone from carrot fields to cranes in 11 years .
" Their decision to nest on the reserve was totally unexpected , very exciting and completely wonderful . "
A new visitor centre at Lakenheath Fen Nature Reserve opened on Thursday .
Long history
The common crane is one of the biggest European birds .
It nests in marshy vegetation , and populations all over Europe have suffered historically from the disappearance of wetlands .
Its wingspan can reach 240 cm ( 7.8 ft ) and has a loud bugling call .
The reserve at Lakenheath was restored from a carrot field
The bird has a long history in England : it appears on medieval illuminated manuscripts and was on the menu for a feast held in York by Henry III in 1251 .
Their presence is also recorded in place names such as Cranfield and Cranbrook .
The fens of East Anglia used to cover an area of roughly 3,336 sq km ( 1,300 sq miles ) .
But the draining of these lands in the 17th Century , coupled with persecution by people , led to the crane 's complete disappearance as a breeding bird .
Lakenheath
Fen was created to act as a wetland habitat for another bird , the bittern .
Between 1996 and 2002 , the RSPB converted over 200 hectares ( 500 acres ) of arable land into reedbeds and damp meadows .
A married teacher was today found not guilty of seducing a pupil .
Jenine Saville - King , 29 , was cleared of seven counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of abuse of trust at St Albans crown court .
Ms Saville - King broke down in tears as today 's verdict was read out .
It had been alleged that Ms Saville - King of Hook , Hampshire , began an affair with the boy , then aged 15 , in 2004 , but they did not have sex until after his 16th birthday .
Ms Saville - King maintained her innocence throughout the trial .
The court had been told the relationship lasted for more than a year , continuing even after she became pregnant by her husband , Paul , 37 , and gave birth to her first son .
Jurors were told that during the relationship , Ms Saville - King allegedly became " dependent " on the teenager and exchanged 200 pages of MSN internet messages with him over the four - month period between July and October 2005 .
In addition the couple sent more than 6,000 text messages to each other the court heard .
The teenager , who is now 18 , but can not be named for legal reasons , told the jury he had engaged in sexual activity with Ms Saville - King in hotels and at her home while her husband was at work .
He told the court he had been in love with Ms Saville - King and claimed they had had sex " two to three times a week " .
But the youngster admitted to the courtroom he had approached Ms Saville - King , first asking for help with his maths GCSE coursework .
He also admitted he had obtained her computer chat username after watching her use the MSN Messenger service .
When asked if he had approached her for help as an excuse to be with her he replied : " Yes . "
The court also heard that the boy had been in a relationship with a 37 - year - old mother - of - three for part of the alleged affair and now lived with the woman .
Ms Saville - King was teaching at a school in Watford , Hertfordshire , when she was alleged to have had the affair with the boy .
She was originally taken on as a teaching assistant , but was soon promoted to assistant year leader and asked to cover classes when colleagues were absent .
During her trial Ms Saville - King admitted " loving " the boy and being " emotionally connected " - but denied having sex with him or engaging in sexual activity .
She told the court : " We were just really , really emotionally connected .
It was quite intense .
We talked all the time about everything .
He told me he loved me , I told him I loved him - but no sex . "
She described herself as the boy 's last lifeline and added : " I was very fond of him - loved him even - but that 's all it was . "
Ms Saville - King said the boy had asked her to be his mentor and she had agreed after initially saying no because she did not think he felt he could ask anyone else for help .
Ms Saville - King told jurors she began seeing the boy every day and also agreed that she wrote text and internet messages to him , saying she " missed him " .
She told the jury she became pregnant in November 2004 and that she told the boy and other friends .
But she dismissed any suggestion that she thought the boy might be the father , saying it was " impossible " .
She said she was angered when police took DNA swabs from her and her first child to check who the father was after she was arrested .
Sarah Forshaw , for the defence , told the trial that the boy had tried to blackmail Ms Saville - King and told of the relationship after being accused of harassing the teacher .
Jurors heard that Ms Saville - King had told police she had been " very greatly disturbed by the allegations " .
She told the court : " The boy has pursued a campaign that became one of harassment , intimidation and threats of different kinds towards me and my family . "
She also told detectives she accepted that , with the benefit of hindsight , she should never have allowed the situation with the youngster to develop in the way it did .
Ms Saville - King also told the trial that she had suffered from depression and the eating disorder bulimia and had stopped working at the school after suffering stress .

Every now and then something comes along which is so bonkers and so unhinged that it unmoors itself from all cultural anchoring points , and floats off into a baffling universe all of its own .
I am a connoisseur of freaky ideas , but nothing prepared me for this gem from the academic journal Medical Hypotheses : an article called “ Down subjects and Oriental population share several specific attitudes and characteristics ” .
You ’d be right to experience a shudder of nervousness at the title alone , since this is an academic journal , from 2007 , and not 1866 when John Langdon Down wrote his classic “ Observations on the Ethnic Classification of Idiots ” .
This paper was the first to describe Down syndrome ( which Down called “ mongolism ” ) and in it , the author explained that different forms of genetic disorder were , in fact , evolutionary regressions to what he viewed as the less advanced , non -white forms of humanity .
He described an Ethiopian form of “ idiot ” , a mongoloid form , and so on .
Looking back , it reads as spectacularly offensive .
Now .
People with Down syndrome – who have three copies of chromosome 21 , learning difficulties , and other congenital health problems – do indeed look a tiny bit like people from east Asia , to westerners .
This is because they have something called an “ epicanthic fold ” , a piece of skin that joins the upper part of the nose to the inner part of the eyebrow .
It makes the eyes almond shaped .
You ’ll find epicanthic folds on faces from east Asia , south - east Asia , and some west Africans and Native Americans .
People with Down syndrome have various other incidental anatomical differences too , if you ’re interested , such as a single crease in their palm .
Flash forward to 2007 – I think that ’s where we are – to two Italian doctors .
They offer their theory that the parallels between Down syndrome and “ oriental ” people go beyond this fleeting facial similarity .
What is the evidence they have amassed ?
I offer it almost in its totality .
One aspect , they say , is alimentary characteristics .
“ Down subjects adore having several dishes displayed on the table , and have a propensity for food which is rich in monosodium glutamate . ”
I , too , adore having several dishes displayed upon the table .
Two doctors , in an academic journal , in 2007 , go on : “ The tendencies of Down subjects to carry out recreative - rehabilitative activities , such as embroidery , wicker - working , ceramics , book - binding , etc. , that is renowned , remind [ us of ] the Chinese hand - crafts , which need a notable ability , such as Chinese vases , or the use of chopsticks employed for eating by Asiatic populations . ”
Perhaps you can think of cultural rather than genetic explanations for these observations .
There ’s more .
“ Down persons during waiting periods , when they get tired of standing up straight , crouch , squatting down , reminding us of the ‘ squatting ’ position …
They remain in this position for several minutes and only to rest themselves . ”
Amazing .
“ This position is the same taken by the Vietnamese , the Thai , the Cambodian , the Chinese , while they are waiting at a bus stop , for instance , or while they are chatting . ”
And that ’s not all .
“ There is another pose taken by Down subjects while they are sitting on a chair : they sit with their legs crossed while they are eating , writing , watching TV , as the Oriental peoples do . ”
To me , and I may be wrong , this article is so fantastical and so thoughtlessly crass that it ’s impossible to experience anything like outrage .
But this is a proper academic journal , published by Elsevier , with a respectable “ impact factor ” – a measure of how frequently a journal is cited – of 1.299 .
I contacted the editor .
He told me this paper was a very short , discursive and preliminary communication , floating a general idea for discussion and debate , and that taking scientific ideas out of their context could be misleading .
I hope I am not misleading anybody .
I contacted Elsevier , the journal publisher : they will consider making the article free to access , so that anyone can read it for themselves , and reach their own conclusion .
I ’ll let you know … [ see below ]

[ Ooh , in case you ’re wondering why I wrote about this , it ’s a setup for something more interesting , and related , next week , assuming nothing topical comes in .
And also because it is a fantastic paper . ]
And here is the paper .

A lethal dose of chloral hydrate killed Anna Nicole Smith , but she would have been dead anyway from a blood infection , claims an exclusive report .
Chloral hydrate is a sleep inducer sometimes used in date rape drugs .
They go on to say ,
In its most stunning disclosure , the report says Smith ’s life might have been saved had she simply gone to a hospital rather than treating her severe fever , nausea and other infection symptoms on her own .
The infection resulted from an improperly sterilized needle injected into her left buttock which caused her temperature to sky rocket to 105 degrees and caused a painful abscess to develop .
It is unknown what substance was .
* Looks down at unsterilized needle in ass *
Ahh , crap .
Meanwhile , G. Ben Thompson is so sure Howard K. Stern is not the father of Dannielynn that he has kicked Howard out of the house he bought for Anna Nicole .
“ We did this only after we found out that the courts directed that Howard K. Stern and the other parties seeking paternity take a DNA test .
We know that Howard K. Stern cannot pass that test in any way that would suggest he is the father of that particular child . ”
You better believe Howard K. Stern has a plan .
A video of Dannielynn wearing clown makeup tripping on shrooms would sell for thousands , nay , millions of dollars .
People always go gaga for cutesy mother - daughter type stuff .
EVANSTON , Ill . --
Imagine a car windshield that displays a map to your destination , military goggles with targets and instructions displayed right before a soldier 's eyes or a billboard that doubles as a window .
Only in science fiction you say ?
Northwestern University researchers report that by combining organic and inorganic materials they have produced transparent , high - performance transistors that can be assembled inexpensively on both glass and plastics .
The results of this breakthrough , which brings such futuristic high - quality displays closer to reality , were published in the November 2006 issue of the journal Nature Materials .
Researchers have long worked on developing new types of displays powered by electronics without visible wires .
But , until now , no one was able to develop materials for transistors that could be " invisible " while still maintaining a high level of performance .
" Our development provides new strategies for creating transparent electronics , " said Tobin J. Marks , the Vladimir N. Ipatieff Research Professor in Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern and professor of materials science and engineering , who led the research .
" You can imagine a variety of applications for new electronics that have n't been possible previously -- imagine displays of text or images that would seem to be floating in space . "
Transistors are used for all the switching and computing necessary in electronics , and , in displays , they are used to power and switch the light sources .
High - performance , transparent transistors could be combined with existing kinds of light display technologies , such as organic light - emitting diodes , liquid crystal displays ( LCDs ) and electroluminescent displays , which are already used in televisions , desktop and laptop computers and cell phones .
To create their thin - film transistors , Marks ' group combined films of the inorganic semiconductor indium oxide with a multilayer of self - assembling organic molecules that provides superior insulating properties .
The indium oxide films can be fabricated at room temperature , allowing the transistors to be produced at a low cost .
And , in addition to being transparent , the transistors outperform the silicon transistors currently used in LCD screens and perform nearly as well as high - end polysilicon transistors .
Prototype displays using the transistors developed at Northwestern could be available in 12 to 18 months , said Marks .
He has formed a start - up company , Polyera , to bring this and related technologies to market .
###
The Two Meanings of Declarative
For about the seventh time , now , I ’ve been “ corrected ” on something in a way that is n’t really correct .
The issue here is what is meant by a declarative language .
Haskell and SQL are both called declarative .
There are , though , very different senses in which these languages might qualify as declarative .
Haskell is a declarative language in that the program can be treated as a statement of facts , rather than as a set of commands that are sequenced in time .
These facts , though , are about all sorts of things .
They express the structure of the problem , but also the algorithms used to solve the problem , the intermediate data structures used between steps , and so on .
I can implement merge sort , quick sort , and bubble sort in Haskell ; and I can tell the difference .
SQL is a declarative language in that it ’s a formal way for me to say what I want .
The database decides how to find it .
It ’s true that there are some limitations : some databases perform far better with joins than with correlated IN clauses , for example .
By and large , though , these are warts .
I ca n’t describe most algorithms in SQL .
It would be meaningless to try to identify whether an ORDER BY clause does a merge sort or bubble sort .
The basic algorithms used by the system can depend on the definition of the table , the existence of indices , and even statistics gathered by the DBMS over time .
You can bet your bottom dollar those algorithms are n’t themselves written in SQL ( or even in PL / SQL or some other procedural extension ) .
These are , in other words , two different definitions of “ declarative . ”
One language allows you to declare things about the computation .
The other restricts you to declaring things about the problem .
Critics and armchair observers would be well - advised to determine which is meant before blurting out “ that does n’t make sense , because Haskell is a declarative language . ”

The fact that such a bill has been introduced is significant in a number of respects .
First , the debate over open formats will now be ongoing in two U.S. states rather than one .
Second , if the bill is successful , the Minnesota CIO will be required to enforce a law requiring the use of open formats , rather than be forced to justify his or her authority to do so .
Third , the size of the market share that can be won ( or lost ) depending upon a vendor 's compliance with open standards will increase .
And finally , if two states successfully adopt and implement open data format policies , other states will be more inclined to follow .
I received an email yesterday pointing me to a bill , introduced on March 27 , that would require all Executive branch agencies in the state of Minnesota to " use open standards in situations where the other requirements of a project do not make it technically impossible to do this . "
The text of the bill is focused specifically on " open data formats , " and would amend the existing statute that establishes the authority of the Office of Enterprise Technology ( OET ) , and the duties of the states Chief Information Officer .
While the amendment does not refer to open source software , the definition of " open standards " that it contains would be conducive to open source implementations of open standards .
The text of the affected sections of Minnesota Statutes Chapter 16E , showing the amendments proposed , can be found here .
The amendment , and the statutory framework in which it exists , provides an interesting contrast to the open standards policy adopted by the Massachusetts Information Technology Division ( ITD ) in many respects .
For example , it appears from the existing text of the statute that the Minnesota OET already has clear authority to mandate the use of open data formats , reading in part as follows :
When state agencies have need for the same or similar public data , the chief information officer , in coordination with the affected agencies , shall manage the most efficient and cost - effective method of producing and storing data for or sharing data between those agencies .
The development of this information architecture must include the establishment of standards and guidelines to be followed by state agencies .
The office shall ensure compliance with the architecture .
Second , the proposed amendment contains an extremely detailed ( and rather eclectic ) definition of " open standards , " including not only the traditional concepts of availability to all on reasonable and nondiscriminatory ( " RAND " ) terms , but a good deal more besides .
For example , it requires that all permitted standards must permit royalty free implementation , and also includes a number of requirements that are far more detailed than would normally be found in the description of an open standard , but which might be agreed upon as necessary by the members of a working group developing a standard .
The following is one example taken from the proposed definition of an " open standard " found in the amendment : " [ An open standard ] is documented , so that anyone can write software that can read and interpret the complete semantics of any data file stored in the data format . "
( I 've included the full text of the proposed definition at the end of this blog entry . )
In addition to the very restrictive definition of open standards and open data formats , the amendment is also intolerant of making exceptions , providing :
For a particular project involving the access , storage , or transfer of data , a restricted data format may be chosen when satisfaction of essential project requirements precludes the use of an open data format .
Neither the current storage format of previously collected data , nor current utilization of specific software products , is a sufficient reason , in absence of other specific overriding functional requirements , to use a restricted format ;
Moreover , the amendment would require periodic review of all " existing data stored in a restricted format , to which the state of Minnesota does not own the rights , every four years to determine if the format has become open and , if not , whether an appropriate open standard exists ; "
The amendment , if enacted , would therefore impose a very tight collar on what types of software could be purchased and used .
On its face , the amendment is vendor neutral .
It does , however , include one provision that may have been directed at Microsoft , which has at times been criticized for adding proprietary extensions to otherwise standards - compliant product features .
That provision is found in the definition of an " open standard , " and requires that if a standard , " allows extensions , ensures that all extensions of the data format are themselves documented and have the other characteristics of an open data format ; "
There are a number of other interesting points that I note in reading the amendment at the Minnesota site , one being that the state legislation portal is set up to provide data on a bill 's sponsors and current status - something that is sadly lacking in Massachusetts .
There also appear to be a number of differences between the responsibilities and authority of the CIO in Minnesota , as compared to Massachusetts , that Peter Quinn might have appreciated .
I may look more deeply into those differences and return to them in a future entry .
Curiously , I have been able to find out almost nothing on the Web about the amendment , indicating that thus far it has received little public notice .
The news item submission ( written by the submitter ) that pointed me to the bill , however , reads in part as follows :
A consortium of Minnesota businesses and citizens has moved to put forward legislation that promises to assist the State in overcoming the negative effects of time , innovation and the market .
Referred to as the Open Data Formats Bill , House File 3971 defines the means by which Minnesota could take control over how it stores information so as to not be bound , technically or legally , to anything other than its own technical objectives .
The Bill is an attempt to counter the fact that searches on the State website display information that is primarily stored in formats owned by vendors ... that could go out of business , get acquired , or turn into the next Enron .
It is also a response to what some refer to as the ' eight track tape effect ' where information is stored in a way that is both popular and looks permanent , but then is quickly replaced by newer technologies .
In some instances the information has been lost forever .
The Bill is not biased towards any one technology and advances a policy where at all times and in all instances the State has the ability and legal right to review , fix or improve the information it uses to conduct business .
The Bill is not expected to increase State spending on technology .
It is , nonetheless , expected to receive stiff opposition despite improving competition for State contracts , enhancing the ability of Minnesotans to access State services and data , and improving communication between State systems .
I will keep an eye on this new bill and report further as additional information becomes available .
For now , however , it is significant to note that the debate over open data formats has now begun in a second state .
It will be interesting to watch how the forces align , and the discussion becomes focused as the process moves forward .
The full text of the two new statute sections appears below .

Language to be added to Minnesota Statutes 2005 Supplement , section 16E.03 , subdivision 1 :
( f) " Open standards " means specifications for the encoding and transfer of computer data that : ( 1 ) is free for all to implement and use in perpetuity , with no royalty or fee ; ( 2 ) has no restrictions on the use of data stored in the format ; ( 3 ) has no restrictions on the creation of software that stores , transmits , receives , or accesses data codified in such way ; ( 4 ) has a specification available for all to read , in a human - readable format , written in commonly accepted technical language ; ( 5 ) is documented , so that anyone can write software that can read and interpret the complete semantics of any data file stored in the data format ; ( 6 ) if it allows extensions , ensures that all extensions of the data format are themselves documented and have the other characteristics of an open data format ; ( 7 ) allows any file written in that format to be identified as adhering or not adhering to the format ; ( 8 ) if it includes any use of encryption , provides that the encryption algorithm is usable on a royalty - free , nondiscriminatory manner in perpetuity , and is documented so that anyone in possession of the appropriate encryption key or keys is able to write 2.20 software to unencrypt the data .

Kevin and I have been having a discussion in the comment thread to my earlier post about the Senate ’s passage of an Iraq War funding bill that contains a timetable for withdrawal .
The basic question is whether the Bush Administration or the Democratic Congress has the most to lose in what looks like it will be a showdown over funding the war .
Apropos of that disucssion , I though these poll results were interesting :
1 . A solid majority of Americans want Congress to fully fund the war in Iraq .
When asked if they favor or oppose Congress fully funding the war in Iraq , 56 % favor fully funding the war in Iraq , while just 38 % oppose .
In fact , more voters STRONGLY favor ( 40 % ) Congress fully funding the war in Iraq than out - right oppose it ( 38 % ) .
Support for funding our troops is consistent across the board : Republicans are unified with 87 % support .
A majority ( 55 % ) of Independents support fully funding the war in Iraq .
Despite the party line vote in Congress , more than one in four Democrats support funding for our military in Iraq .
Across the country , majorities of Americans support funding our troops – including 51 % in the Northeast , 56 % in the Midwest , 58 % in the South , and 59 % in the West .
and …..
3 . Voters point the finger of blame squarely in the Democrats ’ direction for not funding the troops .
We read voters the following statements and asked them to pick which statement they agreed with the most .
President Bush has declared that he will veto the bill because it sets a timetable for withdrawal in Iraq and includes billions of dollars in non-emergency spending .
By vetoing this bill , a spending bill for the troops will not be passed .
In thinking about this , which position do you agree with most ?
( ROTATE STATEMENTS ) 40 % ( SOME / OTHER ) people say that if President Bush vetoes the Democratic spending bill then Bush should be blamed for not funding the troops because his veto will mean that there is no spending package available for the troops .
… OR … 50 % ( OTHER / SOME ) people say that if President Bush vetoes the Democratic spending bill then the Democrats in Congress are to be blamed for not funding the troops because they attached restrictions on the President and military commanders in Iraq along with billions of dollars in pork barrel spending to a bill intended to help the troops .
If this poll is to be believed , then the public at this point is on the side of the Administration , or at least opposed to the idea of defunding the war , and that they would blame the Democrats in Congress if a clean Iraq War spending bill did not pass by the April 15th deadline .
Given , this I think my earlier conclusion that the Democrats are taking big political risk here is well - supported .

Quite some time ago I gave a little presentation on DictMixin at ChiPy .
If you have n’t used DictMixin before , it ’s a class that implements all the derivative methods of dictionaries so you only have to implement the most minimal set : __getitem__ , __setitem__ , __delitem__ , and keys .
It ’s a lot better than subclassing dict directly , as you have to implement a lot more , and dict implies a specific kind of storage .
With DictMixin you can get the information from anywhere .
I thought of a couple examples , and wrote some doctests for them ; I thought satisfying the doctests would itself be the presentation .
I ’m not sure how it worked ; it was a fairly experienced crowd , but the switch from code to test can be disorienting .
One of the examples I used was a filesystem access layer .
Representing a filesystem as a dictionary is nothing new , but the simplicity of the representation worked well .
Here ’s how it works :
An FSDict represents one directory .
represents one directory .
The keys are the filenames in the directory .
The values are the contents of the files ( strings ) .
When there is a subdirectory , it is another FSDict instance .
When you assign a dictionary - like object to a key , it creates a FSDict from that object .
Dictionaries have lots of methods , like items ( ) , update ( ) , etc .
But using DictMixin you just implement the four methods .
First , the setup :
class FSDict ( DictMixin ) : def __init__ ( self , path ) : self .
path = path
Creation of a dictionary is not part of the dictionary interface .
This seems a little strange at first , but the dict class interface is n’t the same as the dictionary instance interface .
So FSDict.__init__ does n’t bear any particular relation to dict .
__init__ .
Now the other methods … in each case , strings and dictionaries ( files and directories ) are treated differently .
def __getitem__( self , item ) : fn = os.path.join(self.path , item ) if not os.path.exists ( fn ) : raise KeyError ( " File %s does not exist " % fn ) if os.path.isdir( fn ) : return self.__class__( fn ) f = open ( fn , 'rb ' ) c = f.read ( ) f.close ( ) return c
Note the use of self .
__class__( fn ) instead of FSDict ( fn ) .
This makes the class subclassable if you retain the FSDict.__init__ signature .
This way subclasses will create new instances using the subclass .
Note also that KeyError is part of the dictionary interface ( an important part ! ) , so we ca n’t raise IOError .
Now , assignment …
def __setitem__ ( self , item , value ) : if item in self : del self [ item ] fn = os.path.join( self.path , item ) if isinstance ( value , str ) : f = open ( fn , ' wb ' ) f.write ( value ) f.close ( ) else : # Assume it is a dictionary os . mkdir ( fn ) f = self [ item ] f.update ( value )
Note that with subdirectories ( represented as nested dictionaries ) we let DictMixin.update do all the hard work , and just create an empty directory to be filled .
Deletion …
def __delitem__( self , item ) : fn = os.path.join(self.path , item ) if not os.path.exists ( fn ) : raise KeyError ( " File %s does not exist " % fn ) if os.path.isdir( fn ) : ## one way ... self [ item ].clear ( ) os.rmdir( fn ) ## another way ... # shutil.rmtree ( fn ) else : os.unlink(fn )
Enumeration …
def keys ( self ) : return os.listdir(self.path )
So , to recursively copy '/ foo / bar ' to ' / dest / path / bar ' you do :
FSDict ( '/ dest / path ' ) [ ' bar ' ] = FSDict ( '/ foo ' ) [ ' bar ' ]
It does n’t really matter if '/ foo / bar ' is a directory or file .
There ’s a number of other clever things that come out of this .
I think it ’s an example of the power of a closed set — dictionaries are expressable from these four operations , and all the other methods can be derived from there .
If you find this interesting , you might want to read the source for DictMixin ; it ’s only about 95 lines .
My article templating via dict wrappers has some other similar dict tricks .

Bush on track to become the vacation president
President Bush tries to set an example for Americans whenever he can , in terms of physical fitness , faith , optimism and a certain overall moral rectitude .
He also sets an excellent example on taking vacation .
On Thursday , Bush left for a weekend in Kennebunkport , Maine , and his family 's summer compound , Walker 's Point .
On Monday , he heads to his Crawford retreat , where he has spent all or part of 418 days of his presidency , according to Mark Knoller , a CBS News White House correspondent and meticulous record - keeper .
Never a fan of Washington 's more cosmopolitan pleasures , Bush will be in Central Texas for about two weeks , with an overnight trip to Ottawa to meet with the leaders of Canada and Mexico .
At a White House press conference Thursday , Bush appeared to be already inhabiting his vacation mode , shedding the businesslike , sometimes grim demeanor he's had of late to slouch against the podium and be avuncular .
He gamely joked and mugged with reporters , at one point raising two fists in a boxing stance to illustrate what not to do in a photo op with the president of Iran .
" You do n't want the picture to be kind of , you know , duking it out , you know ? "
Bush said " ' OK , put up your dukes . '
That 's an old boxing expression . "
Bush 's August sojourn will be his 65th trip to Crawford , according to Knoller .
The 1,600 - acre ranch has proved a durable haven for Bush , who often disappears into its varied landscapes for days or weeks at a time without public appearances .
He has an attractive stone house , shaded swimming pool , miles of rugged bike trails and law enforcement at every entry point keeping people out .
" I fell in love with it the minute I saw it , " Bush said of his ranch in 2001 .
" I like being out here .
I like spending a lot of time outside . "
The presidential vacation - time record holder is the late Ronald Reagan , who tallied 436 days in his two terms .
At 418 days , and with 17 months to go in his presidency , Bush is going to beat that easily .
Even so , this year 's August vacation for Bush is a contrast to previous years such as 2005 , when he dragged out vacation in Texas to five weeks .
That was also the year Bush remained on vacation immediately after Hurricane Katrina hit .
Vice President Dick Cheney generally takes August off , often heading to Wyoming or coastal Maryland .
Congress left last weekend and is gone until Sept.
4 . The Iraqi parliament is taking August off , too .
Still , all this governmental time off is more than most Americans are taking .
A recent survey by Yahoo Hot Jobs found nearly half of American workers did not take all of their vacation days last year .
Bush , on his 10th visit to Kennebunkport as president ( according to Knoller ) , is scheduled for lunch Saturday with French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Indeed , on the issue of vacation , at least , Bush is much like a pleasure - seeking Frenchman .
According to Expedia.com , French workers get about 39 days off a year and generally take all but one .

Square that circle
It sounds simple : draw a circle with one hand , and a square with the other .
But the circle usually has square sides , the square has curved sides , or you break the pencil in frustration .

Bob Dylan can sing and strum .
Brett Favre can ( usually ) run and throw .
So why is it so hard to rub your tummy and pat your head , or draw a circle and a square simultaneously ?
David Rosenbaum , a professor of psychology at Penn State , says this is " a fundamental question :
Why is it difficult to carry out two different movements at the same time ?
The joke says you can't walk and chew gum .
You can do that , but there are certain pairs of activities that we can't do very well , like drawing a square and a circle . "
996Kb QuickTime movie
Rosenbaum , who directs Penn State 's Laboratory for Cognition and Action , says , " It is a fundamental limitation that the nervous system seems to impose on the hands for reasons that are not fully understood . "
It sounds plausible .
Is it true ?
To pinpoint the source of the limitation , Rosenbaum and associates Amanda Dawson , a recent Ph.D. recipient , and John Challis , associate professor of kinesiology , developed an apparatus that produced different movement patterns , and asked volunteers to track those patterns .
It turns that simultaneously outlining a square and a circle is easy -- if you can rely on your sense of touch to follow a moving object .
The blindfolded subjects tracked a disk located on a sheet of opaque glass , which followed a moving magnet behind the glass .
If the volunteers leaned on the disk ( indicating that they were using it to move their hands ) , the disk became detached and the trial was considered a failure .
But failures were rare : Guided by the sense of touch , the difficult square - and - circle movement was suddenly simple , Rosenbaum says .
" We figured out that if we ask someone to gently touch an object that is moving in a circular way with one hand , and with the other , to gently touch one that 's moving in a square fashion , they can do it lickety split .
It was absolutely no problem .
They needed no training . "
Courtesy David Rosenbaum , Penn State University .
The experiment , published in the November / December Journal of Experimental Psychology , proved that the limitation is neither in the muscles nor in the part of nervous system that communicates directly with them , Rosenbaum says .
" Instead , we have come to the idea that the source of the limitation is conceptual , it 's not in the execution . "
When asked to draw a square and circle , " you need to keep those two forms in mind , and that 's hard for us to do . "
Touching better than thinking !
Touch input goes to a part of the brain called the somatosensory cortex , which is directly connected to the motor cortex , Rosenbaum explains .
And apparently these two areas are happy to trace squares and circles without help ( or hindrance ! ) from the brain 's intellectual center , the prefrontal cortex , which makes plans and carries them out .
So how , for example , do musicians do two things at once ?
" It turns out that very , very few people can carry out two differently timed activities totally independently , " says Rosenbaum .
" If you sing while playing guitar , over time , you learn to think of them as a single task . "
Learning to sidestep cognitive limitations on movement could have practical benefits , Rosenbaum says .
" We are very interested in trying to use this with patients who have trouble moving in a coordinated fashion ; clumsy children or people recovering from a stroke . "
By teaching patients to follow their sense of touch , and then gradually removing the touch stimulus , " maybe we could improve their coordination . "
Courtesy David Rosenbaum , Penn State University .
The research is more proof of some basic limitations on multitasking , Rosenbaum adds .
" It is dangerous to talk on the cell phone while driving because of the attention limits .
In our research , those same attention limits are manifest in simple movement tasks .
There are serious limits on how well we can multitask , whether it's for intellectual activities or even for simple motor acts . "

Computer scientists from California universities have hacked into three electronic voting systems used in California and elsewhere in the nation and found several ways in which vote totals could potentially be altered , according to reports released yesterday by the state .
The reports , the latest to raise questions about electronic voting machines , came to light on a day when House leaders announced in Washington that they had reached an agreement on measures to revamp voting systems and increase their security .
The House bill would require every state to use paper records that would let voters verify that their ballots had been correctly cast and that would be available for recounts .
The House majority leader , Representative Steny H. Hoyer , Democrat of Maryland , and the original sponsor of the bill , Representative Rush D. Holt , Democrat of New Jersey , said it would require hundreds of counties with paperless machines to install backup paper trails by the presidential election next year while giving most states until 2012 to upgrade their machines further .
Ex-CIA analyst : Forged ' yellowcake ' memo ' leads right back to '
Cheney David Edwards
Published : Monday April 30 , 2007 Print This Email
This A former CIA analyst claims that falsified documents which were meant to show that Iraq 's Saddam Hussein regime had been trying to procure yellowcake uranium from Niger can be traced back to Vice President Dick Cheney .
Appearing on MSNBC's Tucker Carlson Show , Ray McGovern who served in the CIA for twenty - seven years , said , " the [ forged ] memo leads right back to the doorstep of the Vice President of the United States . "
According to McGovern , former CIA Director George Tenet told his " coterie of malleable managers " at the CIA to create a National Intelligence Estimate " to the terms of reference of Dick Cheney 's speech of August 26 , 2002 , where Dick Cheney said for the first time Saddam Hussein could have a nuclear weapon in a year , he 's got all kinds of chemical , he 's got all kinds of biological weapons . "
McGovern , who at one time chaired National Intelligence Estimates and prepared the President 's Daily Brief , also claimed to have evidence that the memo leads back to Cheney , but he would not say what it was , except that the names of the people involved were " in the public domain . "
In an op - ed posted at Buzzflash , McGovern argues , " If any good can come out of the intelligence / policy debacle regarding Iraq , it would be the clear lesson that intelligence crafted to dovetail with the predilections of policymakers can bring disaster .
The role that Tenet , McLaughlin , and their small coterie of malleable managers played as willing accomplices in the corruption of intelligence has made a mockery of the verse chiseled into the marble at the entrance to CIA headquarters : ' You will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ' "
McGovern also calls Tenet a " pathetic figure " who is trying to " justify himself for unjustifiable activity . "
Tenet , in his new book , claims that the Bush administration distorted his use of the term " slam dunk " in reference to intelligence that ultimately led to the Iraq war ( RAW STORY 's coverage is here ) .
The following video is from MSNBC's Tucker .
These words remain relevant today .
Only two decades ago the world was ideologically and economically divided and it was the huge strategic potential of two superpowers that ensured global security .
This global standoff pushed the sharpest economic and social problems to the margins of the world 's agenda .
And , just like any war , the cold war left behind live ammunition , figuratively speaking .
It left ideological stereotypes , double standards and other remnants of cold war thinking .
What then is a unipolar world ?
However one might embellish this term , at the end of the day it describes a scenario in which there is one centre of authority , one centre of force , one centre of decision - making .
It is a world in which there is one master , one sovereign .
And this is pernicious , not only for all those within this system , but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within .
And this , certainly , has nothing in common with democracy .
Because democracy is the power of the majority in the light of the interests and opinions of the minority .
We , Russia , are constantly being taught about democracy .
But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves .
I believe that unipolarity is not only unacceptable but also impossible in today 's world .
The model itself is flawed : at its root it provides no moral foundations for modern civilisation .
But witnessed in today 's world is a tendency to introduce precisely this concept into international affairs , the concept of a unipolar world .
And with which results ?
Unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems .
Moreover , they have caused new human tragedies and created new centres of tension .
Judge for yourselves : wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished .
And even more are dying than before .
Many more .
Today we are witnessing an almost unrestrained hyper-use of force - military force - in international relations , a force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts .
As a result we do not have sufficient strength to find a comprehensive solution to any one of these conflicts .
Finding a political settlement also becomes impossible .
We are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law .
One country , the United States , has overstepped its national borders in every way .
This is visible in the economic , political , cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations .
This force 's dominance inevitably encourages a number of countries to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
Moreover , threats such as terrorism have now taken on a global character .
I am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security .
And we must proceed by searching for a reasonable balance between the interests of all participants in the international dialogue .
Especially since the international landscape is so varied and is changing so quickly .
The need for principles such as openness , transparency and predictability in politics is uncontested and the use of force should be a truly exceptional measure , comparable to using the death penalty in the judicial systems of certain states .
However , today we are witnessing the opposite tendency , namely a situation in which countries that forbid the death penalty even for murderers and other dangerous criminals are airily participating in military operations that are difficult to consider legitimate .
And yet the fact is that these conflicts are killing people - civilians - in their hundreds and thousands .
At the same time we face the question of whether we should remain unmoved by various internal conflicts inside countries , authoritarian regimes , tyrants , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
Can we be indifferent observers ?
Of course not .
But I am convinced that the only mechanism that can make decisions about using military force as a last resort is the charter of the United Nations .
The use of force can only be considered legitimate if the decision is sanctioned by the UN .
Another important theme that directly affects global security is the struggle against poverty .
On the one hand , financial resources are allocated for programmes to help the world 's poorest countries - sometimes substantial financial resources ( which tend to be linked with the development of that same donor country 's companies ) .
And on the other hand , developed countries simultaneously retain their agricultural subsidies while limiting some countries ' access to hi-tech products .
And let 's say things as they are - one hand distributes charitable help and the other hand not only preserves economic backwardness , but also reaps the profits thereof .
The increasing social tension in depressed regions inevitably results in the growth of radicalism , extremism , feeds terrorism and local conflicts .
And if all this happens in , say , a region such as the Middle East , where there is increasingly the sense that the world at large is unfair , then there is the risk of global destabilisation .
It is obvious that the world 's leading countries should see this threat .
And that they should therefore build a more democratic , fairer system of global economic relations , a system that would give everyone the chance and the possibility to develop .
Russia is a country with a history that spans more than a thousand years and has practically always exercised its prerogative to carry out an independent foreign policy .
We are not going to change this tradition today .
At the same time , we are well aware of how the world has changed and we have a realistic sense of our own opportunities and potential .
And of course we would like to interact with responsible and independent partners with whom we could work together in constructing a fair and democratic world order that would ensure security and prosperity not only for a select few , but for all .

After wiretapping victory , Bush says he wants more authority from Congress Michael Roston
Published : Monday August 6 , 2007
Print This Email This
The day after President George W. Bush marshaled political forces in Congress to grant him greater authority to engage in counterterrorism - related spying , the president stated that he would seek greater changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act when the legislative branch returns to work in September .
" While I appreciate the leadership it took to pass this bill , we must remember that our work is not done , " the President said in his Sunday statement .
" This bill is a temporary , narrowly focused statute to deal with the most immediate shortcomings in the law . "
The President said next month he would focus on further immunizing private companies that cooperate with government wiretapping .
However , he used complicated language to describe these activities .
" When Congress returns in September the Intelligence committees and leaders in both parties will need to complete work on the comprehensive reforms requested by Director McConnell , including the important issue of providing meaningful liability protection to those who are alleged to have assisted our Nation following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , " he said .
One constitutional scholar derided Bush 's reasoning , particularly the tortuous language in his statement .
" Apparently ' allegedly helped us stay safe ' is Bush Administration code for telecom companies and government officials who participated in a conspiracy to perform illegal surveillance , " wrote Yale Law Professor Jack Balkin in a Monday morning blog post .
" Because what they did is illegal , we do not admit that they actually did it , we only say that they are alleged to have done it . "
Balkin also offered another amusing interpretation of Bush 's words .
" Or perhaps the Administration is suggesting that although such parties are alleged to have helped the country stay safe , there 's no evidence that their repeated violations of federal law actually did much to promote our security , " he quipped .
Last week , National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell made a related appeal , appearing to acknowledge that telecommunications companies had not only ' allegedly ' assisted the government in its wiretapping activities .
" [ T ] hose who assist the Government in protecting us from harm must be protected from liability , " he said in a Friday statement .
" This includes those who are alleged to have assisted the Government after September 11 , 2001 and have helped keep the country safe ....
I appreciate the commitment of the congressional leadership to address this particular issue immediately upon the return of Congress in September 2007 . "
And for one top Congressional advocate of Bush 's proposed wiretapping ' reforms , ' the participation of telecommunication companies in government spying was not described as an allegation at all .
" These are companies who were doing the patriotic thing , " said Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , Ranking Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , in an interview with Paul Gigot for Fox News 's Journal Editorial Report on Saturday night .
" They were helping the U.S. government , the American people , get the information that we believe we needed to keep us safe .
They voluntarily participated , and now that the program is exposed , they 've been open to all kinds of lawsuits . "
Meanwhile , pundits were already building the case for expanding liability protections for telecommunications companies that help the government spy .
" The new legislation does not go far enough because , while it addresses liability for telecommunications companies under FISA , it does not look at companies ' liabilities under other laws , " wrote Harold Furchtgott - Roth , a former Federal Communications Commission commisioner , in a Monday article in the New York Sun .
" This is an important point because the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have many legal cases against various communications companies for cooperating with the federal government on many matters outside FISA . "
Hoekstra in a statement released to RAW STORY Saturday night after the House passed his legislation said that , " he would use momentum from Congressional Republicans  efforts to fix FISA to push for comprehensive reform of the law to ... obtain retroactive liability for parties who may have aided the government . "
But Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also stated her own plan to pass legislation in September with the intention of countering the changes enacted by the President 's allies in Congress .
" Tonight , the House passed S. 1927 , a bill approved by the Senate yesterday , which is an interim response to the Administrations request for changes in FISA , and which was sought to fill an intelligence gap which is asserted to exist , " the Speaker said in a Saturday letter to the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees .
" Many provisions of this legislation are unacceptable , and , although the bill has a six month sunset clause , I do not believe the American people will want to wait that long before corrective action is taken . "
She therefore called on the committees , " as soon as possible after Congress reconvenes , " to pass " legislation which responds comprehensively to the Administrations proposal while addressing the many deficiencies in S. 1927 . "
THE mania began in 1981 , when American Airlines launched AAdvantage , the world 's first mileage - based frequent - flyer programme , to encourage customer loyalty .
Today more than 130 airlines issue miles , and according to Randy Petersen , the founder of InsideFlyer magazine , 163 m people around the globe collect miles of some sort .
Indeed , calculations by The Economist in January 2005 suggested that the total stock of unredeemed miles was worth more than all the dollar bills in circulation .
The record for the biggest individual account is 25 m miles ( enough to fly from London to Sydney and back 250 times ) , reputedly belonging to a publishing executive who charged his firm 's postage bill to his own credit card .
The biggest collectors of miles today are not frequent flyers but frequent buyers .
More than half of all miles are earned on the ground , notably on credit cards linked to airlines ' programmes or on telephone calls .
Miles are doled out by hotels , car - rental firms , retailers , real - estate agents and mortgage brokers .
In America , if you pay by credit card you can earn miles for hospital surgery , income - tax payments and funerals .
Some airlines even award miles to pets that fly with their owner .
On most airlines , one mile is earned for every mile flown .
But what is a mile worth ?
Airlines sell them to credit - card firms at a rate of between one and two cents a mile .
Yet if you make the best use of your miles , such as flying business class across the Atlantic , the market value can be up to 10 cents per mile .
In 2004 , over 20 m free tickets were issued , and on a typical flight 7 - 8 % of passengers were travelling on such tickets .
You can also use miles for hotel rooms , car rental , holidays , restaurants , CDs and magazines , but these account for a small fraction of miles spent .
As with any form of “ money ” , frequent - flyer miles have bred crime , corruption and crafty scams .
A Singapore Airlines employee in Australia was recently jailed for fraudulently awarding himself 17.6 m miles .
In 2002 , two German politicians were forced to resign when it was discovered that they had broken the rules by using miles earned on official trips for personal tickets .
In America , by contrast , miles earned by federal employees can now be used for personal trips .
But sadly one of the best scams to earn lots of miles ended in 2003 , when the American Treasury stopped accepting credit cards for online bond purchases .
Frequent - flyer programmes are no longer just a marketing gimmick ; they have become a lucrative earner for airlines , through their sale of miles to partners , such as credit - card companies .
When United Airlines filed for bankruptcy in 2002 , it said that its frequent - flyer programme was the only part of its business that was making money .
The economics is certainly attractive .
Charging partners for each mile earned on a credit card , say , by a member of a frequent - flyer programme , brings in estimated annual revenue of more than $ 10 billion for the industry worldwide .
Better still , the airlines get this revenue upfront , while the miles are not redeemed until well into the future — if ever .
Miles make money
Moreover , although a ticket may be worth several hundred dollars to a passenger , the marginal cost to the airline of giving away empty seats is estimated at around $ 25 for a roundtrip on an American domestic flight , to cover the cost of fuel , ticketing and food .
If the airline had previously sold all 25,000 miles redeemed for that ticket to a credit - card firm , it could have earned up to $ 400 .
Even allowing for some revenue loss from passengers who might otherwise have paid , the industry 's total costs for giving away free seats are probably not much more than $ 1 billion — a fraction of the $ 10 billion revenue .
No wonder sceptics argue that frequent - flyer miles now reward airlines more than passengers .
Airlines have to include a contingent liability in their accounts , to cover the future cost of unredeemed miles , but they try to make this as small as possible .
American airlines ignore all miles in individual accounts until they reach blocks of 25,000 miles ( the minimum required for a domestic ticket ) .
Then , for each 25,000 - mile block of unredeemed miles , they enter a liability of only $ 20 - 25 .
They also assume , on average , that one third of miles will never be redeemed .
Taking all this into account , in 2004 the 14 biggest American airlines posted a total liability of only $ 3.9 billion to allow for future frequent - flyer mileage redemptions , according to IdeaWorks , a consulting firm .
Whatever the correct figure , the future financial liability of unredeemed miles cannot cause an airline to go bust , because the fine print of frequent - flyer rule books allows airlines to increase the number of miles required for a free flight , or to restrict seat availability .
Both are a form of devaluation .
With no independent central bank to protect the “ currency ” , the value of frequent - flyer miles has already diminished : over the past decade most airlines have increased the number of miles needed for a free flight .
Just as passengers are addicted to earning miles , so airlines have become habituated to the profits from selling miles to partner firms .
As a result , the stock of miles has soared .
The snag is that the stock of seats available for awards is limited : the number of miles redeemed has barely changed over the past five years ( see chart ) .
Indeed , in relation to capacity , seat availability has fallen .
In 1999 , free tickets accounted for around 9 % of total revenue passenger miles on both American Airlines and United .
In 2004 the figure was only 7.5 % .
With too many miles chasing too few seats , there are growing complaints from consumers who cannot book the flight they want , or have been forced to redeem twice as many miles to get a seat .
Most American airlines have a two - tier system : a limited number of seats are on offer at the basic rate of 25,000 miles for a domestic ticket ; but if you pay up to double this , you can buy any available seat .
Once again , this is a form of devaluation .
According to a survey on Webflyer.com , the average success rate in getting a free ticket varies from 71 % on US Airways to 54 % at British Airways and only 37 % on Northwest .
Members of US Airways ' frequent - flyer programme succeeded in getting upgrades 76 % of the time , on British Airways only 23 % ( see chart ) .
British Airways ' scheme is generally stingier than those of its American counterparts .
Not only are upgrades much harder to get , but discounted tickets earn only 25 % of the miles flown ( compared with 100 % on most American carriers ) and do not count towards earning elite status .
On the other hand , a British Airways gold card is a much - coveted prize of the frequent traveller , allowing free access into luxurious first - class lounges around the world .
British Airways likes to see its Executive Club as a true loyalty programme rather than just an upmarket trading - stamp scheme .
It is one thing for frequent - flyer miles to be devalued , but what is the risk they might become worthless ?
Never before have so many airlines been in such trouble .
American airlines have lost around $ 40 billion over the past five years , and three of country 's four biggest carriers ( United , Delta and Northwest ) are currently operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
In the past , when a big airline went out of business , parts of it were acquired by rival airlines , which honoured its frequent - flyer miles .
When TWA went bust in 2001 its loyalty programme was absorbed by American .
But smaller airlines have fared less well .
In the cases of Midway , Braniff , Ansett Australia and National , members lost all their miles when the airlines folded .
If one of the big American airlines went under today , none of the other giants is currently strong enough to take it over .
What to do ?
AwardGuard , a company that insured frequent - flyer miles , stopped accepting new customers in 2003 , because of the increased risk of claims .
But American Express has just launched an insurance policy for miles in the United States .
Both history and recent financial troubles suggest that frequent - flyer miles will not improve with age .
If you can't use all your miles on flights now , you could try to sell them .
The fine print of every programme prohibits the sale or barter of miles , but there is a black market of brokers , such as Award Traveller , which will buy your miles at a discount ( by paying you to redeem them for a ticket for one of their customers ) .
However , if the buyer is caught with your award ticket , it will be confiscated and your frequent - flyer account permanently frozen .
Some members who have sold their miles on eBay have also had their miles revoked .
Another option is to transfer miles to a sounder airline .
Points.com brokers miles among various programmes , but its rates of exchange involve losses of up to 90 % of the value of miles .
The Diners Club Rewards programme can also be used to swap some airlines ' miles ( again with a sizeable loss ) .
For instance , 10,000 United miles can be switched into 5,000 BA miles .
If current losses persist , might some airlines try to raise money by selling off their frequent - flyer programmes ?
In 2005 , Air Canada sold 12.5 % of its loyalty scheme , Aeroplan , into a separate income trust .
This raised C$ 250 m , putting a total valuation of C$ 2 billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) on the scheme .
United 's Mileage Plus has eight times as many members as Aeroplan .
On the other hand , United 's estimated revenue from sales of miles to partner companies is perhaps only three to four times larger .
This suggests a valuation of United 's mileage scheme of $ 5 billion - 10 billion .
That would come in handy , but in the long run , airlines that flogged off their loyalty programmes would risk killing the goose that lays the golden ( or perhaps platinum ? ) eggs .
This encounter with the invisible began eight years ago , when two competing teams of astronomers were using exploding stars known as Type 1a supernovas as cosmic distance markers to determine the fate of the universe .
Ever since the Big Bang 14 billion years ago , the galaxies and the rest of the universe have been flying apart like a handful of pebbles tossed in the air .
Astronomers reasoned that gravity would be slowing the expansion , and the teams were trying to find out by how much and , thus , determine whether all would collapse one day into a “ big crunch ” or expand forever .
Instead , to their surprise , the two teams , one led by Saul Perlmutter of the University of California , Berkeley , and the other by Brian Schmidt of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories in Australia , found that the universe was speeding up instead of slowing down .
But the ground - based telescopes that the two teams used could track supernovas to distances of just seven billion light - years , corresponding to half the age of the universe , and the effect could have been mimicked by dust or a slight change in the nature of the supernova explosions .
Since then , Dr. Riess , who was a member of Dr. Schmidt ’s team , and his colleagues have used the Hubble telescope to prospect for supernovas and dark energy farther out in space or back in time .
The new results are based on observations of 23 supernovas that are more than eight billion years in the past , before dark energy came to dominate the cosmos .
The spectra of those distant supernovas , Dr. Riess reported , appear to be identical to those closer and more recent examples .
By combining the supernova results with data from other experiments like the NASA Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe , Dr. Riess and his colleagues could begin to address the evolution of dark energy .
“ That ’s one of the $ 64,000 questions , ” he said .
“ Is dark energy changing ? ”
So far , he said , the results are consistent with the cosmological constant , but other answers are also possible .
The possibility that it is the cosmological constant is a mixed blessing .
Physicists concede that they do not understand it .
Page Six , The New York Post ’s free - swinging showcase for gossip about canoodling celebrities and cheating spouses , ran a tell - all item yesterday about a subject it does not usually cover in eye - popping detail : itself .
And it had some pretty juicy details : the editor of the paper patronized a strip club , and the longtime author of the column , Richard Johnson , once took a $ 1,000 cash gift .
And that was not all .
The item also raised anew long - heard allegations that Rupert Murdoch , The Post ’s owner , had directed the Page Six writers to avoid items that could be seen as critical of China , where he was trying to do business .
The 675 - word item was the latest twist in the long - running dispute involving Jared Paul Stern , a former freelance contributor to Page Six .
He was suspended in April 2006 amid allegations that he had demanded money for favorable coverage — allegations that the authorities later declined to prosecute .
Inspectors searching for the causes of the collapse of a Minnesota bridge this month that killed at least 13 people have identified pigeon droppings as a possible factor .
It is thought the build - up of guano over many years could have speeded up the rusting of the steel beams in the eight - lane bridge , which collapsed into the Mississippi on August 1 .
Structural engineers had been aware of the problem since as early as 1987 , when inspectors noted a coating of guano on the inside of some of the steel girders .
Pigeon droppings contain ammonia and salt which , when combined with rainwater , can lead to tiny electrochemical reactions that rust steel .
" Over a long term , it might in fact cause structural weaknesses , " Neal Langerman , of the American Chemical Society , told Associated Press .
The authorities can point to efforts to contain the problem on the Minnesota bridge from 1996 , when screens were put up to prevent pigeons nesting in some of the openings in the structure .
But the build - up of guano is thought to have continued on other parts of the bridge .
The problem of bird guano is just one of the factors that inspectors are considering as they seek to prevent a repeat of the catastrophe in other ageing infrastructure .
About 77,000 bridges across the US have been identified as having the same level of structural deficiencies as the Minnesota bridge .
Owner of RV Park Banned 2 - year - old Boy with HIV from Pool and Other Common Areas
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
MONTGOMERY , AL – The American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the owner of the Wales West RV park in Silverhill , Alabama today demanding that it stop discriminating against people with HIV by barring people with the disease from using the swimming pool , showers and other common areas of the park without a letter from a doctor .
' This kind of ignorance and prejudice is unacceptable at this point in the HIV epidemic , ' said Olivia Turner , Executive Director of the ACLU of Alabama .
' After more than two decades of studying the disease , we know that you ca n’t catch HIV by swimming next to someone with the disease or using a public shower . '
According to media reports , Dick and Silvia Glover ’s two - year - old foster son Caleb was banned from the pool and other common areas of the RV park by its owner Ken Zadnichek after Silvia mentioned to a desk clerk that the boy had HIV .
Although Caleb had been looking forward to taking a ride on the park ’s two train rides , the couple had no choice but to leave the park .
' Mr. Zadnichek should be ashamed of himself for picking on a defenseless two - year old , ' said Christine Sun , a staff attorney with the ACLU ’s AIDS Project .
' Mr. Zadnichek claims that he was merely trying to protect other campers , but he had nothing to protect other campers against .
Ignorance about the disease is no excuse for prejudice . '
The letter sent by the ACLU explains that discrimination against people with HIV is illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) and demands that the park owner send written assurances to the ACLU that the park will no longer discriminate against people with HIV .
The letter also notes that the ADA prohibits businesses from imposing eligibility requirements , such as requiring a doctor ’s note , that screen out people with disabilities .
The letter quotes information from the Alabama Department of Public Health making it clear that , ' [y ] ou do not get HIV from an HIV - infected person by working together , playing sports , shaking hands , hugging , closed - mouth kissing , sharing drinking glasses , eating utensils or towels , using the same wash water or toilet , swimming in the same pool , or coming in contact with their sneezes , coughs , tears or sweat .

NASA has released a striking new image of explosive neighbouring star Eta Carinae .
The star is huge : somewhere between 100 and 150 times the size of our own sun .
It is also consuming its fuel at a truly astonishing rate .
The star is currently teetering along a knife edge , almost at equilibrium : its gravity just about balanced by the huge outward pressure generated by the nuclear furnace at its core .
But the star is incredibly unstable , and the tiniest perturbation could cause a massive eruption of material .
Star goes boom .

Back in 1840 , this is exactly what happened .
The star shed something close to 10 times the mass of our sun in a single explosive belch of matter .
Eta Carinae briefly became the second brightest star in the sky .
The remnants of the explosion - which should have destroyed the star - can still be seen today in the image that NASA has released .
The image is a composite , with data taken from both Hubble and the Chandra - X observatory .
The blue areas , courtesy of Hubble , show cool optical emissions from the a bi-polar shell of dust and gas the star shrugged off in 1840 .
This area is surrounded by a cloud of fainter material , more ragged in appearance .
Data from the X - ray observatory , Chandra , shows the regions much further from the star where the material it expelled has collided with gas and dust nearby .
The collision has heated the matter above a scorching million degrees .
The X - ray data show that this superheated region is filled with complex atoms , such as nitrogen , which would have been produced inside Eta Carinae itself , and become part of the stellar surface before being ejected .
They also reveal a slight glow of X - ray reflection on the optical nebula .
NASA researchers explain that the X - rays causing this come from very close to the star itself .
They are generated by the interaction of Eta-Carinae 's million mile - per - hour stellar wind , and the much faster wind from its companion star ( not pictured ) .
NASA says the companion star is something of a mystery : it is not known what role it has played in the evolution of Eta-Carinae , nor what it might do in the future . ®
In the early morning of 21st July , neo - nazi skinheads launched a vicious and unprovoked attack on an anti-nuclear protest camp in Angarsk , Siberia , Russia ( see map ) .
The nazis violently attacked activists in their sleeping bags and tents with iron rods , knives and air pressure guns .
21 year old Ilya Borodaenko from Nachodka suffered a head - fracture during the attack and later died in hospital from his injuries .
At least nine others have been reported to be seriously injured , one of which has had both their legs broken .
Tents were set on fire and several belongings were stolen .
The camp had started the week before and was aimed at protesting against a planned centre of uranium enrichment in Angarsk .
Ever since the arrival of the activists , the police tried to intimidate them and have entered the camp in an attempt to gather information about planned actions .
The organisation who planned the camp , the ' Ecological Wave of Baikal ' , had planned various rallies in the surronding area to inform locals about the plans and drum up support for the campaign .
Although the protesters knew about the planned attack and had organized night guards , they were much too few to stop the attack .
Police said at least 15 assailants raided the camp at the Yelovskoye Reservoir near the city of Angarsk occupied by a group of 21 protesters against reprocessing of nuclear waste at a local plant .
The attack on the camp happened at 5.10 am Moscow time ( 1.10 am GMT ) on Saturday .
Recent police statements have mentioned that two attackers have been arrested , and at least 13 others have been identified .
An investigation was started and according to mainstream sources the police believe the reason for the attack was that they wanted to ' rob the activists ' , no political motive to be seen ( because they found some things that belong to the activists when they arrested the attackers ) .
One of the first contact with the police when people arrived to set up the camp was for them to illegally arrest ten people on 14 July .
All of them were released after a few hours but faced intimidation and had their fingerprints taken .
Various complaints have been made about the conduct of police earlier on in the week , who entered the camp in an attempt to gather information about planned actions .
Nuclear Storage
Ros-Atom ( the state agency for Russia ’s nuclear industry ) has plans to establish an International Uranium Enrichment Centre ( IUEC ) at the Angarsk uranium enrichment plant ( AUEP ) to supply fuel to Russian and other nuclear power stations .
The site is within the boundaries of the town of Angarsk , 30 km. from Irkutsk and 100 km. from Lake Baikal , which is the world ’s deepest lake and classed by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee as one of the World Natural Heritage Sites .
With neither a buffer safety area nor radiation - control zone , campaigners say the new proposals pave the way for another nuclear disaster .
One of the main points of debate is that of the storage of nuclear waste .
As Russia will produce uranium fuel for a load of nations , it will be obligated to reclaim the spent nuclear fuel once it is burned in foreign reactors .
Especially as many countries have no or little nuclear storage space of their own .
According to the ' Ecological Wave of Baikal ' , at present , waste in the form of depleted uranium hexafluoride ( DUH ) , produced as a result of uranium enrichment , is kept at the Angarsk plant in storage casks in the open .
Ros-Atom fails to answer critical questions :
How much depleted uranium has already been amassed at the plant ?
( they describe this information as being a “ commercial secret ” ) .
How long is it planned to store DUH ?
What would be the possible consequences if all the containers were to become depressurized ( as in the case of an accident or terrorist attack ) ?
How much waste will be accumulated at the plant with the establishment of the International Centre ?
The ' Ecological Wave of Baikal ' is one of a few groups who continue to ask questions and in doing so have gathered an ever increasing number of supporters within the local community .
“ We declare a decisive no to Rosatom ’s plans to build the International Uranium Enrichment Centre in Angarsk , no to illegal imports from abroad of radioactive waste in the form of uranium tailings to the Angarsk Electrolysis Chemical Combine , ” reads a resolution issued by the No to Chernobyl at Baikal assembly which took place in Irkutsk last December , drawing some 150 people .
Eight thousand signatures have already been collected in support of the movement .

The G8 Deal
The international centre at Angarsk will give access to atomic technology to a large number of countries which they have previously not possessed .
How did the plans for this International Uranium Enrichment Centre ( IUEC ) become about ?
Suprise , surprise , it has come to light that the first agreement about the creation of a network of international centres for the enrichment of uranium ( ICEUs ) was reached at last summer ’s meeting of the G8 in St Petersburgh .
See G8 2006 page .
On Putin ’s initiative , it was decided that the first such centre would be built in Russia on the site of the Angarsk uranium enrichment plant ( AECC ) , which produces enriched uranium hexafluoride - which is put to further use for producing nuclear fuel .
In fact , the creation of the centre gives the AECC a whole new status .
What kind of uranium is going to be enriched at the centre is unknown .
Presently , Ros-Atom only has a single partner in Kazakhstan .
In 1996 Russian and Kazakhstan created the joint uranium mining venture “ Zarechnoe , ” and it is assumed that uranium from there will be enriched in Angarsk .
Other potential partners in the International Centre are Japan , India , Iran , and African nations said Vladimir Servetnik , deputy general director of Tenex , Russia ’s nuclear fuel monopoly .
He also said that “ productive negotiations ” were underway with South Korea .
As the deal has been made at the G8 summit last year , it is no surprise that the United States gave their mark of approval to the Russian - Kazakh initiative ealier this year .

Granted , this is n't the first run-in we 've seen involving trains and an SMS - minded individual , but the former story certainly did n't involve a train coming into contact with a human .
This time , however , an 18 - year old Ohio resident managed to get carted away from a devastating collision after being struck by an oncoming locomotive .
The kid apparently waited for one train to pass , but rather than double - checking for anything coming in the opposite direction , he simply forged ahead .
Consequently , he was thrown 50 - feet and knocked unconscious mid-sentence , but is thankfully recovering in a Cincinnati hospital .

Brion Gysin's Dreamachine - still legal , but not for long ...
In 1959 Brion Gysin , of whom William Burroughs said , " he was the only man I have ever respected , " invented the Dreamachine .
Timothy Leary called it " the most sophisticated neurophenomenological device ever designed . "
Burroughs experimented with the machine for nearly four decades .
Gysin attempted to commercialize the Dreamachine during the 60s and 70s without success .
David Woodard , who now makes Dreamachines to order at his LA studio , learned about the device from a friend of Gysin 's a few years after his death in 1986 .
Woodard borrowed the original Dreamachine templates , and built his first one in 1989 .
Within a few years word of mouth and modest advertising led to a full - fledged business .
He made two for Burroughs ( below is a photo of the author [ on the right ] and Woodard in 1997 )
and many more for other celebrities including Iggy Pop , Beck and Kurt Cobain .
The price ?
$ 500 for the basic , entry - level model with a cylinder of acid - free matting board .
Custom models with cylinders of steel , copper or cocobolo wood , or even covered in ermine fur , like the one pictured below ,
which Woodard made in 1999 for Burroughs ' memorial service , can run as much as $ 3,000 .
Mark Allen tried out a Dreamachine and reported on his experience in a superb New York Times article which appeared on January 20 .
It 's fascinating - not least because the machine actually appears to work .
The reason I 'd advise buying yours now is that anything that creates pleasure is - by definition - a threat to the established order , and will ultimately become outlawed or regulated .
Just like with Prohibition , Wilhelm Reich 's orgone box , and now the drug war , there 's a never - ending need to stamp out sources of possible deviation and self - indulgence before they become entrenched .
Here 's the Times story .
Décor by Timothy Leary
At first glance it looked like something in the window of a TriBeCa furniture store , an oversize lamp from the early 60's maybe .
But when Kate Chapman [ pictured at the top of this post with her Dreamachine ] flicked a switch and the three - foot high latticework cylinder in front of me began to spin , it was clear that we were dealing with more than just another piece of midcentury flotsam .
The machine started to cast strobelike patterns of bright light on our faces , and when I closed my eyes as instructed , there they were , the dazzling multicolored forms that I 'd been told about : mandalas and crosses and even Mandelbrot fractals , dancing across my eyelids .
I was sitting on the floor of Ms. Chapman 's Brooklyn loft , and she was demonstrating her prized household appliance , a 1996 Dreamachine originally made for William S. Burroughs .
Besides the trippy visual effects the device is said to induce an " alpha state " - a state conducive to lucid dreaming or intense daydreaming - in people who face the cylinder with their eyes closed as it spins around a bright light .
Dreamachine enthusiasts - whose ranks have swelled recently thanks to chat forums and a book published last year - claim that it promotes a trancelike serenity , intensifies creativity and insight and even uncovers suppressed memories .
Ms. Chapman 's Dreamachine is one of more than a thousand that have been manufactured since the early 90's by a California composer and conductor named David Woodard .
One is on display this month at the Clair Obscur Gallery in Los Angeles along with an exhibit of photographs of Burroughs taken by John Aes - Nihil , an underground filmmaker , and the premiere at the gallery of his film , " William Burroughs in the Dreamachine . "
Burroughs , along with other figures from the Beat Generation like Allen Ginsberg and Timothy Leary , was fascinated , even at times obsessed by the Dreamachine , which was invented in 1959 by their fellow Beats Brion Gysin , an artist , and Ian Sommerville , a math student at Cambridge .
Mr. Leary called it " the most sophisticated neurophenomenological device ever designed " ; Mr. Burroughs experimented with it for nearly four decades .
( The film shows him using his Dreamachines at his home in Lawrence , Kan. , shortly before his death in 1997 ) .
I had come to Ms. Chapman 's loft to see if the machine lived up to the hype , but I did n't get very far in my first session .
The colorful undulating patterns that I began to see almost at once were intriguing : far more vivid than the fuzzy images you see when you rub your eyes , although just as hard to focus on .
But as far as I could tell my state of consciousness barely changed during the 20 minutes that I sat cross -legged in front of the spinning cylinder .
When I opened my eyes , Ms. Chapman seemed to sense my disappointment .
I had been somewhat skeptical , but was still hoping for more , given what I had learned about the machine and its history .
Mr. Gysin and Mr. Sommerville built the first Dreamachine after learning of research by John Smythies and W. Grey Walter , scientists who had noted in experiments that light flickering at 8 to 12 flashes a second against a subject 's closed eyelids seemed to slow the electrical pulse rate of the subject 's brain to a state of semiconsciousness known as the alpha state and produce rich dreamlike imagery .
Although his fellow Beats were excited about using the device , Mr. Gysin had broader ambitions for it and tried to distance himself from their enthusiasm , says John Geiger , the author of " Chapel of Extreme Experience : a Short History of Stroboscopic Light and the Dream Machine " ( Soft Skull Press , 2004 ) .
" He was focused on its commercial potential , " Mr. Geiger said .
" He imagined a Dreamachine in every suburban home , in the spot formerly occupied by the television set , but broadcasting inner programming .
He really saw this idea as his ticket out of bohemia town . "
Mr. Gysin 's attempts to commercialize the Dreamachine during the 60's and 70's never got very far .
He met with corporations like Philips , Columbia Records and Random House , but they did not share his vision of the Dreamachine as the successor to TV .
They were also worried about lawsuits resulting from seizures caused by the machine .
" For the high majority of people this is a completely safe device , " Mr. Geiger said .
But Dr. Robert Fisher , the director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at Stanford , said that 1 in 10,000 people is likely to have a seizure in reaction to the its stroboscopic light , and that children are about twice as susceptible .
David Woodard , who now makes Dreamachines to order at his studio in Los Angeles , learned about the device from a friend of Mr. Gysin 's a few years after his death in 1986 .
Mr. Woodard was able to borrow the original Dreamachine templates from the friend , and built his first one in 1989 ; within a few years word of mouth and modest advertising led to a full - fledged business .
He made two for William Burroughs and has made others for celebrities including Iggy Pop , Beck and Kurt Cobain .
( Rumors circulated that Cobain had been using the device heavily in the days leading up to his suicide , although later reports contradicted this . )
Mr. Woodard charges $ 500 for a basic model with a cylinder of acid - free matting board .
( The cylinder surrounds a 150 - watt bulb , which is mounted in the center of a wood base holding a motor that spins the cylinder at 80 r.p.m. )
Custom models , with cylinders made from steel , copper or cocobolo wood - or even covered in ermine fur - can cost as much as $ 3,000 .
After the mixed success of my first experiment with the Dreamachine , my hostess urged me to try again .
Ms. Chapman , 30 , is a former neuroscience researcher for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , a nonprofit organization that sponsors " scientific research designed to develop psychedelics and marijuana into F.D.A. - approved prescription medicines , " according to its Web site .
" I 'm just an artist now , " she said .
Ms. Chapman thought it might be helpful if my body were more relaxed , so I lay down on a sofa , and she put on soothing music .
She flicked the machine back on as I shut my eyes .
A moment later there they were , the same flashing patterns as before .
After a while I became bored and my mind began to drift .
That 's when it happened .
I did n't " see " as much as I strongly imagined a campfire in a clearing in a dense forest at night .
My boyfriend Jim was sitting to my left , laughing .
Later I seemed to find myself in a large empty auditorium , walking toward some chairs arranged in the middle of the room .
In one creepy moment I was in a basement hallway , following closely behind someone walking ahead of me , whose face I could n't see .
I was imagining these scenes so vividly that it was almost as if I were seeing them .
The thoughts had a kind of slow - motion jump - cut feel , just like dreams , but because I was fully conscious , I was able to contemplate all of this as it was happening .
With my eyes still shut and my mind now very relaxed and slightly adrift , I started to notice that the wall of flashing patterns was receding backward and developing a dark border around its edges .
It was at that moment that I sensed someone to my left , sitting beside me , watching what I was watching .
This figure was not in the room with me , but in my head , which had now turned into a little theater .
I felt that if I turned my head , I would be able to look over at this person .
I opened my eyes , and reality rushed back in , to my relief .
That last vision had n't really been frightening , but it was n't exactly heartwarming either .
But I was impressed .
As I talked to Ms. Chapman about my experience , I became aware of an unusual serenity and mental clarity , as if I had just waked from a refreshing nap .
Days after my experience with Ms. Chapman
I found myself craving the Dreamachine and the vivid imagery and sense of calm it had produced .
I 'm not sure I would part with $ 500 to bring one into my life .
But having lived through the experience , it was hard not to think about Mr. Gysin 's vision of an alternate - universe America in which every home would tune into internal landscapes instead of commercial programming .

" His invention , the orgone accumulator , was a boxlike structure in which patients would sit .

" Extensive EEG studies have shown that a flicker stimuli between 10 and 30 flashes per second induces the generalized epileptiform discharges and the clinical features characteristic of an epileptic seizure particularly well . "

Actually , the things that cause pleasure that are either outlawed or regulated are things like cigarettes , alcohol , heroin , cocaine , PCP , and numerous other body - and mind - damaging substances .
Unless this device itself proves to be physically or psychologically addictive AND harmful in some way , there 's no reason why it would be outlawed .
I can say this with all certainty because , as a Republican , I 've come to understand what the government actually intends for itself and for the wellbeing of the people .

Not one to plagiarize , " anything that creates pleasure is - by definition - a threat to the established order , and will ultimately become outlawed or regulated . "
Desperate waving from the peripheral might bring too much attention and subsequent regulation , laws and the inevitable outlaw ( no , not in - laws ! ) .

If you want to try the Dream machine for free before buying one , try this :
On a nice clear day at noon time lie on your back , face facing the sun , eyes closed .
Take each hand with fingers closed and place fingers 3 - 4 inches over each eye so the sun is blocked to each eye .
Now spread fingers wide and rotate hands at wrists quickly back and forth , keeping arms motionless .
This produces a strobe effect similar to Dream Machine .
Experiment with speeding up or slowing down rate of finger wave .
Quickly you will see incredible color patterns and will achieve the spacious quality described in the article .
Very neat

Five Easy Pieces : Simple Python Non-Patterns
Alex Martelli , AB Strakt
Abstract
The concept of Design Patterns ( and full fledged Pattern Languages ) has rapidly become deservedly popular .
Sometimes , however , one is addressing issues that are too simple to really need the power of these semi-formal approaches .
When this is the case , focusing on such powerful approaches may be overkill , somewhat similar to the " Big Design Up Front " fallacy so prevalent in software development .
Python has a knack for making many issues simpler .
This , in turn , enables use of simpler conceptual tools , such as an idiom in lieu of a Design Pattern .
Sometimes , indeed , it 's enough to just follow " good common practice " .
Simplicity is an excellent quality to strive for .
This paper argues for this perspective , and exemplifies it with five simple Python " solution elements " that are not Design Patterns but may , to some extent , be satisfactorily substituted for DP 's in various contexts .
Patterns and non-Patterns
" Design Patterns " ( henceforth DP ) , which had been brewing for quite a while , became suddenly and deservedly popular in the software development community when E. Gamma , R. Helm , R. Johnson , J. Vlissides ( henceforth the " Gang of Four " , or Gof4 ) published their book " Design Patterns " in 1995 .
The wide Patterns community has produced a lot of other fascinating publications connected with software development , particularly on Pattern Languages ( integrated , coordinated systems of Patterns ) in every conceivable area , from organizational structure , to analysis , to development processes , as well as in the design field .
Although a complete collection of all fundamental books and articles on these themes would overflow the average developer 's available shelf space , any developer should at least be familiar with the original Gof4's DP book , M. Fowler 's " Analysys Patterns " and " Refactoring " , Vlissides ' " Hatching Patterns " ( all very practical , highly usable books , directly oriented to software development ) , and some wider - view philosophical reflection work ( my personal " dark horse " suggestion for the latter category , focusing on Alexander 's original work on Pattern Languages for building architecture , is N. Salingaros ' The Structure of Pattern Languages ) .
But I come neither to praise Design Patterns , nor , most particularly , to bury them : just to offer a small alternate perspective of their use , and non-use , when one is developing Pyhon programs .
I focus on contrast ( or , actually , just nuance ! ) from the Gof4's DP book , for definiteness and because ( by its superb quality , and for being in the right place at the right time ) it 's the best known DP book in the software development community .
The Gof4 do make the point , right in the first chapter , that " the choice of programming language is important because it influences one 's point of view " , and that in fact what is or is n't " worthy " of being framed as a DP ( or even feasible to so frame ) is language dependent .
Many of their patterns are of course C++ specific , at least to the extent of making most sense in a C++ context ( compile - time type checking , etc ) .
More to the point , however , a DP ( and , even more , a complete Pattern Language ) is a conceptually " heavy weight " construct .
Setting down a DP requires a semi- formal approach : identifying relevant object and classes , at the right levels of abstraction ; then singling out and articulating intent , motivation , applicability , structure , participants , collaboration , consequences , implementation ; most particularly , researching , finding , and documenting Known Uses .
Known
Uses are not an optional element of a DP : at the very least ( i.e. , by the Gof4's relatively benign criterion ) , it 's not a pattern unless you can identify at least two usage examples from different domains .
Developing the DP itself implies a substantial investment of effort , so the " known uses " are needed to provide some assurance that the whole conceptual edifice is indeed worthy of that effort , having proven itself in the field .
This is just fine and dandy when this considerable overall investment of time and energy pays back by helping us control and conquer complexity , which is often the case .
But what if some of the complexity goes away , or at least is considerably diminished , by the programming language we 're using ?
Python 's forte is simplicity .
Again and again , problems that are difficult in other languages scale down to " pretty easy " in the light of Python 's bright Sun .
The amount and caliber of intellectual weaponry that it makes sense to bring to bear on a problem depends on the problem 's difficulty level .
For a simpler problem , an informal approach may make more sense , while a harder problem might profit from more structured and formalized procedures .
One plus of making problems simpler is that , the simpler a problem , the more simplicity you can deploy in solving it .
Of course , one always aims ( or should ) at making each solution as simple as it can possibly be ( but , admittedly , no simpler than that :-) .
Maybe you can get away with an idiom ( language specific usage ) , or even just " good common practice " , where another language would require you to unearth and apply a full - fledged design pattern .
At times , it 's a reasonably big win , in terms of simplicity , even just to avoid forcing an aspect of the solution into the object oriented mold ( so pervasive , and indeed so often appropriate , in software development Design Patterns ) .
One aspect of Python 's simplicity is , indeed , that you only do OO when you want to !
Borg versus Singleton
A popular , widely implemented Gof4 design pattern is Singleton .
One can't help but wonder why : besides the catchy name , what does Singleton offer , that makes it so appealing ?
The DP 's stated Intent is to " ensure a class only has one instance " ( and provide a global point of access to it ) .
But why would we want to ensure that ?
Are n't we entering in the middle of the action , where a specific approach has already been chosen to solve some other actual underlying problem , just as in Bentley 's classic " How do I use the system sort from within my program " question ( in the very first essay of his outstanding " Programming Pearls " ) ?
I think we are .
Coming to the Motivation , in fact , we find that " It 's important for some classes to have exactly one instance .
Although there can be many printers in a system , there should be only one printer spooler " .
And so ( maybe ) there should be , depending on the system that we 're modeling .
But this still does n't tell us why that " one printer spooler " ( in the system we 're modeling ) should necessarily ( or optimally ) be the " exactly one instance " of some specific class ( in the software we write to model that system ) !
There appears to be a lot of unspoken subtext in this intent and motivation .
It is taken for granted , I surmise , that instance identity must ( or , at least , had better be ) in one to one corresponence with an " entity in the real world " ( or , more precisely , a conceptual entity in the worldview that our software system is modeling ) .
Some schools of OO design take this as a given , but the Gof4 argue directly against this earlier on in the book ( in 1.6 : " object oriented designs often end up with classes that have no counterpart in the real world ... abstractions that emerge during design are key to making a design flexible " ) .
Right on !
I happen to agree very closely with this opinion .
Yet , in identifying Singleton 's intent and motivation , the need for " counterparts " seems to be an unspoken assumption .
Object identity is a frail reed on which to rely .
A. Korzybski , engineer extraordinaire , had choice words on the subject of " the is of identity " ( an expression he credits to mathematician W. S. Jevons ) , but G. Santayana had already remarked that " Whenever I use the word ' is ' , except in sheer tautology , I deeply misuse it " , and L. von Wittgenstein , another contemporary engineer of notice , had similarly ( but , characteristically , more analytically and verbosely ) observed " to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense , and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is to say nothing at all " .
Back to Korzybski , his best known quote might as well be directly on the issue of the need for " counterparts in the real world " of objects in an OO design : " the map is not the territory " !
What 's in an instance
Lest I be accused of escaping into philosophy ( but I am quoting mostly engineers ! ) , let 's look closer at that " instance " thingy ( of which Singleton wants to ensure a certain class has only one ) .
In Python , an instance has an identity : we know because we can print id ( instance ) and see that identity displayed as an integer number right in front of our eyes .
An instance has state : assuming the instance belongs to a " classic class " ( an assumption that we 'll have to critically revisit later , of course ) , the instance 's state ( sticking for the moment to its " direct " , per instance part ) is entirely held in instance .
__dict__ .
An instance has behavior , coded in its methods ( which , in most cases , come [ some have argued , should always come ] as the methods of instance .
__class__ -- some of them , of course , could in turn be inherited , but that 's neither here nor there ) .
That 's it .
Of course , an instance 's " state " in a wider sense may partly come from elsewhere -- instance.__class__.__dict__ is a popular place in which to keep some state ( that part which is shared by all instances of the class ) , and then there are global variables in sys.modules[instance.__class__.__module__ ]
.__dict__ , and , potentially , even more indirect state containers .
But , as we 're discussing Singleton , we need not dwell on all of these sources , which are obviously and implicitly held in common by all instances of a class ( and possibly by other entities yet ) .
If there is any motivation for ensuring that a class is only ever instantiated once , it cannot lie in aspects in which other instances of the same class , if they existed , would be identical and indistinguishable ; the hypothetical motivation we 're looking for has to rest , if anywhere , then in those aspects which might distinguish , i.e. , differentiate , a multiplicity of instances , were they allowed .
By the same token , the hypothetical advantage of Singleton cannot be about behavior ( code ) .
Normally , all instances of the same class share behavior .
We can arrange for deviations from this rule , by binding freshly created bound methods as part of per instance state , but it 's quite a moot point whether we ever should .
Again , therefore , behavior - wise it cannot matter much whether we constrain a class to just one instance : even if the class had several instances , they 'd share behavior , as long as we conventionally agree to eschew the dubious practice of creating and binding new per instance bound methods , at least regarding instances of that particular class .
( Let 's not forget that Python gains much of its ease and simplicity by substituting clear , sensible conventions in place of the hard , strictly - enforced rules which many other languages try to impose on programmers ... ) .
So , it boils down to identity , and ( per instance ) state .
Why would we need to ensure singleness of identity ?
If it 's for the purpose of testing equality with is , why not define __equal__ instead -- that gives us at least as much control .
If it 's for the purpose of using the instance as a dictionary key , without forcing the instance to be immutable , we can get there just as well by defining __hash__ -- the " immutability " only needs to refer to equality comparison status being unchangeable , and hash ( instance ) similarly fixed .
We do n't need to get metaphysical about this , but , should we want to , it 's easy to argue that " immutability " is defined by the context : if we ensure that the dictionary code , the only relevant " observer " , can never notice a mutation , then who 's to say any mutation has in fact occurred ...?
So , naah , we do n't really care about identity , not deeply at all .
So , is it all about per instance state ...?
I think it is .
When we say there 's only one printer spooler , all we really care about is that there be only one " printer spooler state " -- just one set of queues , jobs in the queues , currently set options , and so forth .
Now this is concrete and juicy enough to sink our teeth into .
Do n't we need to ensure there is only one instance of the class , so that there will only be one " occurrence " of the relevant state ?
Borg : just share state !
And the answer is , no , of course we do n't .
Not in any language , or object model , actually .
As long as we arrange all instances , whatever number thereof might be in existence , to share their state ( typically by delegation in some form ) , we satisfy the real application need that may indeed arise -- uniqueness of state .
Ensuring that the " number of instances " is identically equal to 1 is one approach , but it 's far from the only one !
So we need to weigh the actual advantages and disadvantages of the Singleton approach versus delegation based alternatives .
In the alternatives , we allow client code to instantiate the target class freely , but we must arrange for all instances thus created to delegate their state to a single agent .
You could look at these alternatives as Structural ( or even , by a bit of a stretch , Behavioral ! ) patterns , while Singleton is a Creational pattern .
For example , it 's easy to envision the connection ( almost antisymmetric ) between the shared - state multiple instances , and DP Flyweight -- some of the Applicability issues ( state is made extrinsic , the application must not depend on object identity ) are very close .
Before we proceed further , we really need a catchy name .
Singleton thrives , " out there " in the real world of software development , in good part because its name is so catchy .
Now what name would well represent these sort - of - Flyweight objects , numerous as to identity , but deeper down all the same , indistinguishable , because they all share state ?
Well , what about Borg ?
After all , the several instances ( with distinct identity ) are really all One because they have no distinct state .
Identity is irrelevant , resistance is futile , prepare to be assimilated ...!
Yep , it works ( and I am indebted to D. Ascher for suggesting this name in discussion on the Python Cookbook site ) .
So , how hard is it to implement Borg ?
Not very , in any language or object model I know of -- at worst , one has to explicitly code delegation , but it 's generally not even as bad as that .
For example , in Consequences n.5 of Singleton , the Gof4 claim Singleton is " More flexible than class operations " ( use of static member functions in C++ ) , for example because those can't be overridable ( virtual , in C++ terms ) .
True , but so what ?
Who 'd ever want to use class ( static ) methods ?
All we need is for the instance methods ( which can perfectly well be virtual ones in C++ ) to only use " static " ( per class , not per instance ) member data -- prepend a " static " to all data members , leave the methods per instance ( virtual if you need or want them that way ) , bingo , instant C++ Borg .
Borg in Python
But , of course , it is even easier in Python ( is n't it always ? ) :
class Borg : _shared_state = {} def __init__ ( self ) : self.__dict__ = self._shared_state
Borg.__init__( self )
__init__
_shared_state
self
Borg
Let 's take a small step back to look at this tiny snippet of code with " beginners ' eyes " .
Our design intent is for all instances to share state .
Our Python knowledge tells us that each instance 's state lives in the instance 's __dict__ ( ignoring without loss of generality other state that is already shared " by nature " , and delaying for the moment the issue of Python 2.2's non-classic classes ) .
Therefore , we explicitly express this design intent by just ensuring that the __dict__ is the same dictionary object for each and every instance , as elementarily done by our assignment .
This is totally consequential , direct , even trivially obvious .
I shamefully confess it took me a while ( of fiddling with __getattr__ , __setattr , and of course __delattr__ , for example ) before the obvious solution jumped right out at me .
We can be so conditioned to complexity and cleverness , that it becomes hard to find the simplicity and obviousness " hiding " right in front of our nose !
Fortunately , Python helps a lot in this quest for simplicity and clarity .
So , back to examining what Borg is giving us ...
Client code can just instantiate your Borg derived class , just as it might instantiate any other class .
Borg is not a creational pattern ( it verges more on the structural , although you could make a case about it having a behavioral aspect ) .
Therefore , Borg carries no creational constraints , or , to put it another way , does not require creational Collaborations from client clode ( like any other Python class meant to be inherited , it does of course require from subclasses the Collaboration of calling the superclass 's __init__ ) .
If you want to have " controlled access to instances " , for example ( listed as benefit number 1 in the Gof4's Singleton pattern ) , deal with it in some other way , just as you would for any other class for which you deem controlled access desirable ( a clearly orthogonal consideration from " limiting number of instances " , or " state sharing " :
Borg is a simple idea , it does n't conflate different and unrelated concerns ) .
Ability to subclass Singleton is very important in the Singleton DP : it 's the second condition in Applicability , and the key issue in Consequences n.3 and n.5 .
However , the issue of choosing which of the Singleton 's subclasses is actually instantiated looms large , taking up two thirds of the Implementation section and leading to a rich , complex solution ( a registry of singletons ) .
And this still does n't meet many typical application needs .
What if two separate subsystems each need to refine Singleton by subclassing ?
Instances of the two separate subclasses can't both exist , or else two separate " instances of Singleton " would exist , each as a subobject ( base object ) of one of them .
Borg has no problem with this : as many instances as needed exist , all sharing state , and therefore in particular the Borg subclass may be independently further subclassed as needed .
Often , the independent subclasses are each providing different behavior tweaks or additions with different mixins .
State will still be shared , but of course each independent subclass may easily avoid accidentally interfering with another in the usual way , i.e. by naming attributes and methods that are only needed for its internal operation with two leading underscores .
PolySingleton and PolyBorg
One claimed advantage of Singleton that Borg may not appear to match is Consequence n.4 , " Permits a variable number of instances " .
When you 're refactoring your code , you can of course easily de-Borgize a given application level class , but there 's no easy third way : it 's all or nothing -- either per instance state is shared , or it 's kept by each instance on its own .
On the other hand , a separate PolyBorg class is n't any harder to envisage , than the PolySingleton class the Gof4 may have had in mind when writing about this Consequence .
Say , for example , that in the PolySingleton 's case exactly 4 instances may exist , and each call to PolySingleton : : Instance chooses which of the 4 instances to yield in round robin fashion , something like :
PolySingleton * PolySingleton::_instances [ 4 ] ; int PolySingleton :: _next=-1 ; PolySingleton * PolySingleton :: Instance ( ) { ++ _next ; if ( _next > =4 ) _next=0 ; if ( _instances [ _next ]==0 ) { _instances [ _next ] = new PolySingleton ; } return _instances [ _next ] ; }
class PolyBorg : _shared_states = [ {} for i in range ( 4 ) ] _next = - 1 def __init__( self ) : self.__class__._next+=1 if self.__class__._next>=4 : self.__class__._next=0 self.__dict__ = self._shared_states[self.__class__._next ]
self.__class__.next
Borg , and its variation PolyBorg , are the first two of our five easy non-Patterns .
They are as easy as pie , mind you -- do n't let the amount of discussion fool you into believing there 's anything deep or difficult about them -- I was mostly addressing the complexity and hidden depths of Singleton ( and PolySingleton ) .
Look at the Python code again , it so much terser , clearer , and simpler than all of the discussion around it !
Four lines of code for Borg , seven for PolyBorg , all clear and open and understandable at an elementary level .
Python makes it so easy to unveil the simplicity that , without it , masquerades as complexity !-)
But are n't these Patterns ...?
So , what makes Borg and PolyBorg non-patterns ?
Why , they miss the prime requisite -- Known Uses !
That 's right , folks , these are scary , dangerous , field - unproven , experimental ideas !
Does this scare you off from the effort of studying and understanding them so you can apply them to everyday problems ...?
What effort ? what study ?
they are clear at first sight to any Pythonista worth his or her salt .
Indeed , they 're so simple they may well have been independently reinvented over and over -- as is often the case in Python .
It 's so simple to just do it , that the effort of combing the literature and published sources looking for Patterns to extract is pretty hard to cost - justify -- sure , Python 's readability and clarity reduces that cost , but it can't reduce it to the point of making it lower than the effort of writing four lines of code , or thereabouts ! - ) .
So , Borg and PolyBorg are not Patterns ( with the uppercase - P :-) because they 're too simple and elementary to justify a Pattern 's necessary " infrastructure " investment , and particularly the research effort needed to find Known Uses -- and real Patterns do really need that infrastructure , and most particularly that research into Known Uses .
Let 's say Borg and PolyBorg are idioms , then , or , at best , lowercase - p patterns .
Borg has first been proposed as a Recipe , and that may be as good a name as any for this class of Pythonic ideas !- ) .
RegisBorg and RegisFact
Going back to the requisite of " multiple instances , but in limited number " , we might typically want each instance - request to have as an argument a desired - instance identifier , say a string .
If an instance corresponding to the given identifier alreadt exists , that instance must be returned ; otherwise , a new instance must be created and returned .
This is getting pretty far away from the " just one instance " idea , and yet it is a reasonably frequent application need ( think , for example , of opening files , or other URL's -- we may well want to ensure state is shared no matter how many times an URL is opened ) .
Also , requirements akin to these are what the " registry of singletons " in the Gof4's Singleton DP Implementation section strongly suggest ( at least , to me ) .
Could Borg be stretched to accomodate this need -- an extensible registry of hive - minds , tagged by identifiers , with the right one available on demand ...?
Well , yes , it 's not all that different from PolyBorg after all , and of course Python 's dictionaries make " the Registry " a snap :
class RegisBorg : _shared_states = {} def __init__ ( self , id ) : try : self.__dict__=self._shared_states[id ] except KeyError : self.__dict__=self._shared_states[id ]={}
It is a snap , but one must nevertheless question if it's the appropriate snap , or if we could n't have snapped even more simply and fruitfully .
After all , the amended specs sound more and more like a Creational request , and yet we 're still using a solution that 's rather Structural .
Such a " category mismatch " should rightfully makes us a little bit uneasy .
Are n't we over - stretching Borg , and abandoning the straight and narrow , but fruitful , path of simplicity , for a seductive but ultimately fraught one of cleverness and deviousness ...?
After all , the " intuitive " solution to the stated requirements , the one that comes to mind at once , would be an application of a Pattern ( or pattern , or idiom , or Recipe ... )
" Factory with a Registry " , or RegisFact for short :
class Whatever : pass _instances = {} def RegisFact ( id ) : try : return _instances [ id ] except KeyError : _instances [ id ] = Whatever ( ) return _instances [id ]
But not really all that extra simplicity over RegisBorg , either , and substantially limited functionality .
Abstract , semi- philosophical guidelines such as " no category mismatch " are often useful as broad rules of thumb , lighthouses helping us find our way in the fog .
But it 's even better when there is no fog around and we can just find our way by carefully examining our surroundings -- and Python 's already - mentioned Sun is one good way to help fog disperse .
Translation from too - fancy metaphors back down to Earth again : writing down some actual Python code , rather than reasoning in the abstract , we can more easily examine concrete perspectives of different possible solutions :-) .
RegisBorg still has the same usefulness as the other Borg variations : we can subclass at will , to tweak behavior or add per-subclass state , while keeping the essential defining characteristic -- all instances ( here , all instances with the same id ) share state .
Because of this , RegisBorg , exactly as above coded , already has usefulness , although class RegisBorg itself does just about nothing -- said class can handle the registry and state - sharing behavior , while subclasses provide application - specific , hopefully useful parts of behavior and state .
On the other hand , RegisFact , as coded , is not all that useful .
Factory functions do not let client - code easily use inheritance , so , since class Whatever is hard - coded with certain behavior ( as we wrote it , no behavior at all ) , that 's the behavior ( or lack thereof ) that actually obtains from the point of view of RegisFact 's clients .
Better than nothing ( we can still use the Whatever instances that factory function RegisFact yields as passive containers of arbitrary attributes ... and maybe we 've found one case where adding per-instance behavior is justifiable !-) , but far from fully satisfactory .
Indeed , for most potential uses , RegisFact as written is too simple .
Yes , there can be such a thing as an artefact that is too simple , not rich and complex enough , for the goals it should accomplish .
RegisFact really wants to be quite a bit richer and more complex than it is , to deploy its full potential ...
Factories ' speciality is their potential ability to return objects of different classes , according to specifics that the Factory can encapsulate .
RegisFact could be extended to hold a registry of classes , and a set of rules ( a Strategy Design Pattern might be very appropriate here ! ) to select the right class to instantiate for any given requested id -- parsing the id string , for example , and selecting accordingly .
But it does n't do any of that , as it stands ... it just sort of sits there !
So , RegisFact as written is " easy " , yes , but ... too easy -- neither fish nor fowl , neither as intrinsically simple as RegisBorg , nor as rich and sophisticated as the full - fledged Design Pattern it might one day become , RegisFact basically serves the purpose of convincing us that a thorough study of Design Patterns ( and Pattern Languages ) is anything but a waste of effort .
Simplicity can ( for a short while , until we examine it more closely , and check if it shines in the bright light , or starts getting soggy and melting ) be somewhat illusory in its intuitive appeal !
Borg 2.2 ?
For completeness , and to reach the number of five non-patterns that justifies the neat title : -) , let 's examine how Borg plays with the " non-classic " classes introduced in Python 2.2 .
The " instant user appeal " of new classes is , first and foremost , that they can subclass built in types .
However , they come with a whole panoplia of new possibilities and constraints .
From the perspective of sharing state , in particular , the key issue that distinguishes a new - order class from a classic class is that the former does n't keep all per instance data in a single dictionary .
Rather , the class may define or inherit " slots " , and part of all of per-instance state lives in the slots rather than in the dictionary .
Moreover , even for classes whose instances do keep state in __dict__ , the __dict__ attribute itself may not be assigned ( rebound ) .
All in all , then , for a new - order class we cannot just " mix - in inherit " something like Borg and just have state be automatically shared , as for a classic class .
So , we 're back to the status quo as in most other languages , that is , Delegation .
Again , that 's definitely not a Design Pattern , but for a different reason : it 's simply too fundamental , too basilar to good object - oriented design .
It 's not a DP for much the same reason integer addition , while loops , and subroutines are n't -- they are , rather , some of the fundamental building blocks out of which all designs ( and the inherent patterns , or Patterns ) are built and implemented .
Gof4 single Delegation out among the fundamental principles they point out , right after polymorphism , mixin classes , " program to an interface , not an implementation " ( Python translation thereof : do n't typetest !- ) , and " favor object composition over class inheritance " , and just before generics and the principles of " designing for change " .
All in Chapter 1 , of course , before they start their Design Patterns catalog .
In Python , we 're blessed with a particularly flexible and easy to code form of automatic Delegation , thanks to the fact that ( for a classic class ) every attribute ( and methods are just attributes ! ) is looked up via method __getattr__ ( and bound , re-bound , unbound via similar special methods , too , of course ) .
In pre -2.2 Python , we mostly used automatic Delegation to " inherit from built - in types " -- we could n't inherit , but we almost did n't notice ( except where some uncouth piece of framework or client - code typetested , and thus broke the wonderful , smooth polymorphism ...! ) -- reprising Gof4 again , " Delegation ... shows ... you can always replace inheritance with object composition " ( unless somebody 's busy coding deuced typetests , of course ) .
In Python 2.2 , we mostly do n't need automatic Delegation for that , but it 's anything but obsolete -- it still plays a precious role when we need to " dress up " anything that 's not a classic class as if it were a classic class , to exploit the regularity and simplicity of " all per instance state is in __dict__ " and similar wonderful simple rules ( that do n't generalize to builtin types and non-classic classes ) .
So , for example , " Borg 2.2 " is actually :
class DeleBorg : delegate = None _shared_state = {} def __init__ ( self ) : self.__dict__=self._shared_state def __getattr__( self , name ) : return getattr( self.delegate , name ) def __delattr__( self , name ) : return delattr ( self.delegate , name ) def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ) : return setattr( self.delegate , name , value )
DeleBorg.delegate
So , it would seem , old non-Patterns ( here , automatic Delegation ) do n't really ever die , they just fade away into somewhat more obscure corners of language usage ...

In the auto industry , there ’s one thing you can always count on : if a new environmental or safety rule is proposed , executives will prophesy disaster .
In the nineteen - twenties , Alfred Sloan , the president of General Motors , insisted that the company could not make windshields with safety glass because doing so would harm the bottom line .
In the fifties , auto executives told Congress that making seat belts compulsory would slash industry profits .
When air bags came along , Lee Iacocca told Richard Nixon that “ safety has really killed all our business . ”
A few years later , when Congress was thinking about requiring fuel - economy standards , auto executives warned that instituting such standards would create “ massive financial and unemployment problems . ”
And now , with Congress debating a bill to raise fuel - economy standards , for the first time in almost twenty years , the Chicken Littles are squawking again , forecasting doom for Detroit and asserting that making higher - mileage vehicles is technologically unfeasible and economically suicidal .
CHRISTOPH NIEMANN
Of course , much of this is simply stonewalling by executives determined to keep meddlesome politicians out of their business .
But sometimes the industry ’s fears have been founded on real market research .
In the case of safety glass , G.M. believed that consumers were n’t prepared to pay more for cars with safety glass , so Sloan worried that it would be hard to recoup the cost of installing it .
Similarly , when , in the mid-nineteen - seventies , G.M. offered front - seat air bags as an option on Cadillacs , Buicks , and Oldsmobiles , they did n’t sell .
Fuel - economy standards present the same difficulty : although there are plenty of affordable models that get good gas mileage , over the past two decades some of the most powerful and least fuel - efficient vehicles on the market — S.U.V.s and pickup trucks — have also been among the best - selling .
Thirty years ago , so - called “ light trucks ” accounted for about a fifth of all auto sales .
Today , even with a recent slowdown , they account for more than half .
Americans may want to buy the biggest and most environmentally damaging vehicles available , but polls show that , given an option , some three - quarters of them vote for dramatic increases in fuel - economy standards — increases that may well force automakers to sell fewer ( or at least smaller ) S.U.V.s .
We buy gas guzzlers but vote for gas sipping .
This is n’t because people are ignorant about how higher fuel - economy standards would affect them personally ; polls that explicitly lay out the potential trade - offs involved still find support for tougher standards .
And it is n’t as if voters and car buyers belong to two different groups ; one recent survey of pickup owners found that seventy per cent strongly favored tougher requirements .
The curious fact is that many people buying three - ton Suburbans for that arduous two - mile trip to the supermarket also want Congress to pass laws making it harder to buy Suburbans at all .
What ’s happening here ?
Back in the nineteen - seventies , an economist named Thomas Schelling , who later won the Nobel Prize , noticed something peculiar about the N.H.L .
At the time , players were allowed , but not required , to wear helmets , and most players chose to go helmet - less , despite the risk of severe head trauma .
But when they were asked in secret ballots most players also said that the league should require them to wear helmets .
The reason for this conflict , Schelling explained , was that not wearing a helmet conferred a slight advantage on the ice ; crucially , it gave the player better peripheral vision , and it also made him look fearless .
The players wanted to have their heads protected , but as individuals they could n’t afford to jeopardize their effectiveness on the ice .
Making helmets compulsory eliminated the dilemma : the players could protect their heads without suffering a competitive disadvantage .
Without the rule , the players ’ individually rational decisions added up to a collectively irrational result .
With the rule , the outcome was closer to what players really wanted .
The same phenomenon is , to some extent , at work in the fuel - economy debate .
People believe that bigger and heavier cars are safer in a crash ( forgetting that , often , bigger cars are also more likely to crash ) .
And people like the fact that driving a higher - horsepower car makes you look better at the stoplight .
So our desires as individuals to protect ourselves and to outclass our neighbors encourage us to buy bigger and bigger vehicles with more and more horsepower .
And the market does n’t create counter - incentives that would push us in a responsible direction , since someone who drives a Hummer does n’t suffer the effects of pollution and global warming any more than someone driving a Prius does , and is n’t charged more for the extra environmental damage .
The results of this size - and - power arms race are easy to see : between 1984 and 2002 , the average vehicle got twenty per cent heavier and its zero - to - sixty acceleration improved by twenty - five per cent , while fuel efficiency stagnated .
( By contrast , between 1975 , when fuel - economy standards were first introduced , and 1984 , average fuel economy improved by sixty - two per cent , without any decline in performance . )
This is not because of technological difficulties or a conspiracy on the part of the auto industry .
It ’s because automakers have listened to car buyers , and put their energy into making vehicles bigger and faster , rather than more efficient .
In calling for a law requiring better gas mileage in our cars , then , voters are really saying that they ’re unhappy with the collective result of the choices they make as buyers .
Sometimes , they know , we need to save ourselves from ourselves . ♦
And while there are tentative signs that the worst of the overall housing slump may be easing as builders cut back and interest rates remain relatively modest , condo markets continue to suffer .
Take the owner trying to sell a spacious two - bedroom condo for $ 879,000 in the former Columbia Hospital for Women , which closed in 2002 , in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington .
In 2004 , the investor was so confident that he would make a handsome resale profit that he told his agent , Thomas P. Murphy , he wanted to buy five condos .
Mr. Murphy said he flatly told his client he would only assist him in purchasing one unit in any one building .
“ He needs $ 890,000 to break even , but the offers are at $ 800,000 to $ 840,000 , ” Mr. Murphy said .
“ He does remember that I told him he was not getting five of them . ”
Could he rent the condo ?
Yes , but that option is not appealing , either .
Mr. Murphy estimates that the unit could rent for $ 4,000 a month , far short of the $ 6,800 a month the condo costs in mortgage interest , maintenance fees , insurance and taxes .
“ They have a choice of how they want to lose it , ” Mr. Murphy said of investors and condo developers .
“ Drip by drip or in one slap . ”
Mr. Murphy said he believed condo sales had picked up somewhat lately and he even ran a four - way bidding contest on one well - priced condo in Foggy Bottom , near the State Department .
But the supply of newly built condos is so large and so many of them are similar to each other that many sellers are having to sharply cut their asking price .
Others have simply given up .
At the end of 2006 , 24,200 units were on the market in the Washington area , up from 13,000 at the start of 2005 .
Sales have slowed to 663 in the fourth quarter of 2006 from 3,520 in the first quarter of 2005 , according to Delta Associates .
Recorded prices have been flat , which probably masks an effective decline since only the most attractive properties are selling and many owners throw in extra inducements that do not show up in official figures .

PERHAPS it is carelessness or perhaps it is just a spell of bad luck .
Either way , the spate of Afghan civilian deaths caused by Western forces is as dangerous as the most callous of Taliban suicide - bombs .
Fighting an insurgency while building a working state from the ruins of Afghanistan was never going to be easy , particularly with a coalition of 37 countries including both battle - hardened Americans and battle - shy Germans .
But the allies have hobbled themselves by creating two separate forces — both dominated and led by American generals — that at times work at cross-purposes .
One is the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , the NATO - led operation that does peacekeeping , stabilisation and , for some contingents in the south , counter - insurgency against the Taliban .
A more obscure group , now called Combined Joint Task Force 82 , consists of special forces and elite infantry who hunt Taliban and al - Qaeda leaders under America 's Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) .
The differences can be blurry .
The two forces are supposed to co-ordinate their activity , and have some “ dual - hatted ” officers serving in both .
Both groups have killed civilians , but many of the most controversial incidents — such as the death of seven children in an air strike on an alleged al - Qaeda safe house in Paktika province on June 17th — are the responsibility of OEF ( see article ) .
How to undermine your friends
A joint effort last month led to the death of the Taliban military commander , Mullah Dadullah .
But local ISAF commanders complain that , unbeknownst to them , OEF troops often operate in their areas and undermine their work .
Whatever the truth of this , everybody suffers the consequences of mistakes , none more so than the government of President Hamid Karzai .
Anti-Western riots have started to break out .
The Afghan leader , who is protected by Western forces , complained in May that civilian deaths and arbitrary searches of people 's homes had reached an unacceptable level .
Despite abject apologies from the allies , the “ mistakes ” go on .
When confronted with a foe that hides among civilians , whether by consent or by intimidation , no amount of care will eliminate the death of innocents .
But Western countries must do better , or risk losing support and moving the spotlight away from Taliban atrocities and war crimes .
Under America 's new counter - insurgency doctrine , “ unity of effort ” is the essential prerequisite for success .
Having two separate forces makes little military sense , but it was politically expedient .
Many NATO countries , seeing their role as helping to rebuild Afghanistan rather than fighting the Taliban , do not want to be too closely associated with America 's more aggressive tactics in the “ global war on terror ” .
America , for its part , is reluctant to place its warriors too firmly under the control of wishy - washy Europeans .
Neither side is wholly wrong .
The Americans are right that the NATO mission would not survive without their muscle .
Last year , when ISAF spread throughout Afghanistan and found itself in a war with the Taliban it had not expected , OEF came to its rescue .
But the Europeans are right that the Taliban and al - Qaeda cannot be defeated only , or even mainly , by firepower .
The two forces should be merged , but if that proves impossible , it should be made clear that ISAF has primacy , and should have oversight over OEF actions .
More important , the aim of military operations should be to protect the civilian population and win its trust , not to kill as many insurgents as possible .
Strikes against even “ high - value targets ” should be aborted if there is a serious risk of ordinary Afghans dying .
Targets will re-appear ; lost goodwill is harder to win back .
Unity of effort requires much more than rejigging command structures ; it is about managing the complexity of nation - building .
The problem is not just the strength of the Taliban , but also the weakness of the Afghan government , and disillusionment with corruption and slow reconstruction .
On top of this , Western and Afghan forces are too thinly stretched .
Afghanistan is larger in size and population than Iraq , but has a fraction of the soldiers and police .
Without enough forces on the ground , Western commanders have relied more heavily on bombing from the air , endangering more civilians .
Reducing Afghan deaths will require , for some years to come , putting more Western soldiers in harm 's way .

British teenagers are the worst behaved in Europe , a report has revealed .
They are more likely to binge - drink , take drugs , have sex at a young age and start fights .
The report , from a think - tank closely linked to Labour , says the collapse of family life is at least partly to blame .
It means youngsters follow the example set by their friends rather than guidance from their parents .
The damning verdict from the Institute for Public Policy Research was revealed as ministers prepared to publish a blueprint aimed at keeping teenagers out of trouble .
It is expected to include more cash for youth groups and other activities .
But the institute says radical measures are needed .
It says many disruptive youngsters will simply ignore out - of - school activities unless forced to attend .
Its study found that 44 per cent of British youngsters had been involved in a physical fight in the previous year - against just 28 per cent in Germany , 36 per cent in France and 38 per cent in Italy .
Some 38 per cent confessed to under - age sex , almost double the French figure .
The same percentage had tried cannabis , more than five times the rate in Sweden .
Our teenagers are also bigger drinkers , with 27 per cent admitting to getting drunk regularly .
In Italy , the figure is five per cent and in France it is just three per cent .
The researchers found that UK children rarely talk in any depth to their parents or sit down to family meals .
Just 64 per cent ate a main meal with their parents several times a week , against 93 per cent in Italy .
They also spend more time ' hanging out ' with other teenagers , meaning they learn how to behave from each other and are not taught ' how to get on in life ' .
The IPPR also says British adults are becoming afraid of trying to curb out - of - control youngsters .
We are less likely than our European counterparts to confront teenagers about antisocial behaviour and vandalism .
Ministers set the scene for the youth blueprint yesterday by announcing an outlay of almost £ 1.4 billion on out - of - hours homework , art and drama clubs at primary and secondary schools .
The ' extended schools ' initiative , where schools open ten hours a day , is aimed at helping latchkey children as well as encouraging more mothers back to work full - time .
But the IPPR wants ' a legal extension ' to the school day to make pupils take part in afterschool activities such as martial arts and cadets groups , which have been credited with curbing anti-social behaviour .
Senior research fellow Julia Margo said : " Britain has a real problem with its teenagers .
But it is n't their fault . "
She said the Government 's youth strategy , to be outlined to Parliament today , was an admission that teenagers had been left to their own devices for too long .
But she warned : " The worry is that if the Government is too touchy - feely and just offers teenagers the activities they say they want , we will fail another generation .
" Every child should be expected to do at least an hour a week of constructive after - school activities .
They might not like it but the evidence shows that the ones who do n't want to do it are the ones who would benefit the most . "
The IPPR wants more pupils encouraged to follow pursuits such as Girl Guides and Scouts , Army , Air and Sea Cadets , martial arts , drama clubs and sporting teams .
The warning came as Schools Secretary Ed Balls said youngsters would be able to stay on at school in the evening as part of plans to keep all schools open between 8 am and 6 pm by 2010 .
But despite the £ 1.38 billion spending on the initiative , middle - class parents will still face charges for some extra provision .
The IPPR report adds to recent disturbing evidence that Britain is among the worst places to grow up in the developed world .
Unicef claimed earlier this year that British children were among the unhappiest and unhealthiest in Europe .
Ministers have disputed that report but acknowledge that more needs to be done to provide purposeful and constructive activities .
They plan a sharper focus on preventing anti-social behaviour before it becomes entrenched , with the cost to society that entails .
Premier Gordon Brown is keen to promote activities which encourage responsible citizenship , community service and volunteering and has already championed the spread of combined cadet forces to state schools .
Mr Balls is understood to want a ' good youth centre ' in every neighbourhood .
NEWS OF ALIEN PRESENCE STARTLES INDIA
India was startled by four reports last week which appeared to confirm the rumors of a large underground base staffed by extraterrestrials in the Ladakh region of the Himalayas .
In New Delhi , India 's capital , a senior officer of the Indian Army told freelance journalist Subha Jain that aliens were indeed in the Himalayas .
In Bangalore , a recently - retired officer of the Indian Air Force described the underground base to his youngest son's elementary school class and said aliens had met with high - ranking officials of India 's government .
In Leh , a city in the Ladakh region , a local official confirmed that the Indian Army had moved armored brigades into the area and was limiting access to civilian residents and tourists .
In Joshimath , another Ladakh town , workers at an auto repair shop claim they witnessed a strange broadcast on their Chinese - made miniature black - and - white television set .
" According to Subha Jain , a freelance reporter in New Delhi , she bumped into a very senior military official in a nightclub in New Delhi .
According to him , the extraterrestrials have been visiting India and the rest of the world for thousands of years . "
" In recent years , most of the super - powers have been visited .
India is no exception . "
" ' They always make contact through the ground radar stations run by the military , ' she says . "
" The Himalayas and Ladakh is where they have made their most recent contact .
They want to let Indians know the rules and regulations of the multidimensional universe . "
" India is planning an unmanned moon and later an advanced unmanned Mars expedition .
India 's Space Research Organisation ( SRO ) has been given the galactic do's and do n't's . "
" Last week , a flight commodore of the Indian Air Force ( IAF ) , who recently retired , was asked to provide a little talk to his youngest son's class at a school in Bangalore . "
" Guess what he picked as a topic ?
Yes , you got it right .
It was the advanced landing base for UFOs in Ladakh . "
Some Xbox Live gamers have complained about fraud
The company admitted it had been forced to make " an unacceptable number of repairs " to the consoles after key hardware failed .
Customers who suffer the problems will now be given a free three - year warranty , the company said .
The failures are indicated by three red flashing lights on the console .
Microsoft has not revealed how many of its machines have suffered the problem , but said the number was " bigger than we are comfortable with . "
It added that the move - which will also see some people reimbursed for postage and repairs on consoles which were out of warranty - was aimed at keeping the loyalty of its customers .
" The majority of Xbox 360 owners are having a great experience with their console and have from day one , " said Robbie Bach , president of Microsoft 's Entertainment & Devices Division .
" But this problem has caused frustration for some of our customers and for that , we sincerely apologise . "
It added its Xbox division was still expected to make a profit during the financial year beginning 1 July 2007 .
Migration manoeuvre
Separately the company has announced an October launch of its advanced version of the Xbox - the Xbox 360 Elite - in Japan , where it lags behind Nintendo and Sony in the console market .
And the company has also unveiled plans to open a software development centre in Canada which it said was a way of hiring talented people from abroad who would struggle to obtain a US working visa .
The Vancouver location would " allow the company to continue to recruit and retain highly skilled people affected by the immigration issues in the US " , Microsoft said .
Scientists at Forsyth may have moved one step closer to regenerating human spinal cord tissue by artificially inducing a frog tadpole to re-grow its tail at a stage in its development when it is normally impossible .
Using a variety of methods including a kind of gene therapy , the scientists altered the electrical properties of cells thus inducing regeneration .
This discovery may provide clues about how bioelectricity can be used to help humans regenerate .
This study , for the first time , gave scientists a direct glimpse of the source of natural electric fields that are crucial for regeneration , as well as revealing how these are produced .
In addition , the findings provide the first detailed mechanistic synthesis of bioelectrical , molecular - genetic , and cell - biological events underlying the regeneration of a complex vertebrate structure that includes skin , muscle , vasculature and critically spinal cord .
Although the Xenopus ( frog ) tadpole sometimes has the ability to re-grow its tail , there are specific times during its development that regeneration does not take place ( much as human children lose the ability to regenerate finger - tips after 7 years of age ) .
During the Forsyth study , the activity of a yeast proton pump ( which produces H+ ion flow and thus sets up regions of higher and lower pH ) triggered the regeneration of the frog ’s tail during the normally quiescent time .
This research will be published in the April issue of Development and will appear online on February 28 , 2007 .
According to the publication ’s first author , Dany Adams , Ph.D. , Assistant Research Investigator at the Forsyth Institute , applied electric fields have long been known to enhance regeneration in amphibia , and in fact have led to clinical trials in human patients .
“ However , the molecular sources of relevant currents and the mechanisms underlying their control have remained poorly understood , ” said Adams .
“ To truly make strides in regenerative medicine , we need to understand the innate components that underlie bioelectrical events during normal development and regeneration .
Our ability to stop regeneration by blocking a particular H+ pump and to induce regeneration when it is normally absent , means we have found at least one critical component . ”
The research team , led by Michael Levin , Ph.D. , Director of the Forsyth Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology has been using the Xenopus tadpole to study regeneration because it provides an opportunity to see how much can be done with non-embryonic ( somatic ) cells during regeneration , and it is a perfect model system in which to understand how movement of electric charges leads to the ability to re-grow a fully functioning tail .
Furthermore , said Dr. Levin , tail regeneration in Xenopus is more likely to be similar to tissue renewal in human beings than some other regenerative model systems .
The Forsyth scientists previously studied the role that apoptosis , a process of programmed cell death in multi-cellular organisms , plays in regeneration .
Michael Levin , PhD. is an Associate Member of the Staff in The Forsyth Institute Department of Cytokine Biology and the Director of the Forsyth Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology .
Through experimental approaches and mathematical modeling , Dr. Levin and his team examine the processes governing large - scale pattern formation and biological information storage during animal embryogenesis .
The lab investigates mechanisms of signaling between cells and tissues that allows a living system to reliably generate and maintain a complex morphology .
The Levin team studies these processes in the context of embryonic development and regeneration , with a particular focus on the biophysics of cell behavior .

Not only do workers fail to save enough in defined contribution plans , such as tax code Section 401 ( k ) plans , many workers do not make the wisest investment choices and fail to get the most out of their assets , Watson Wyatt Worldwide said in an analysis of survey results on March 7th , 2007 .
Many workers do n’t start saving soon enough , do n’t save enough , and do n’t follow sound investment principles in managing their retirement assets .
Additionally , many defined contribution plan participants do not properly diversify their investments , it said .
Even those whose investment allocations reflect a rational assessment of their risk tolerances and investment goals often fail to periodically rebalance their portfolios when asset returns reshuffle their allocations , it said .
The first responsibility for wise investment choices by participants lies with the plan sponsor .
Sufficient and clear information should be provided so that average participants are not overwhelmed by myriad possibilities , but can make reasonable choices reflecting broadly their own tolerance for risk and personal economic situation .
The report also found that while participation rates are consistent with previous findings that not every employee participates in the plan , especially younger employees .
It also found that even at the highest earnings levels , some workers do not participate .
It suggested that the automatic enrollment provisions of the Pension Protection Act will result in greater plan participation .
The report also found a total of 39.6 percent of plan participants aged 50 through 64 had accumulated less than their annual pay .
Many workers spend their lump - sum payouts from their defined contribution plans , and to some extent , from their defined benefit plan as well .
Defined Benefit Plans More Effective
According to Watson Wyatt , studies have shown that assets are more effectively managed in defined benefit plans .
Defined benefit plan sponsors generally work with consultants and professional asset managers to set investment policy and goals and their asset managers actively implement investment plans to attain those goals , the report said .
If plan managers decide to invest 50 percent of assets in equities , they allocate their contributions accordingly and periodically rebalance the portfolio to stay on course , it added .
Swings in equity holdings in defined contribution plans are much wider than those for defined benefit plans , the report said .
The wider swings in defined contribution plans are driven by market momentum rather than active management , it said .
By failing to rebalance their portfolios during the latter part of the 1990s when rising share prices ballooned the equity share in 401 ( k ) portfolios , plan participants set themselves up to be “ clobbered ” by plunging stock prices from 2000 to 2002 , the report said .
It provided an example of assets worth $ 1,000 at the end of 1999 being worth about $ 880 at the end of 2002 in a defined benefit plan , compared to $ 780 for a defined contribution plan at the end of 2002 .
To encourage appropriate investing , some employers have been introducing lifecycle funds as investment options in their savings plans , the report said .
These balanced funds divide assets between fixed income investments and equities , it said .
Plan Participation and Automatic Enrollment
While younger employees are less likely to participate in 401 ( k ) plans than older employees , some workers at the highest earning levels do not participate in such plans , the report said .
Voluntary participation clearly does not work well for everyone .
Some employers have started automatically enrolling workers in their 401 ( k ) plans unless the employee opts out , according to the report .
In these automatic enrollment plans , participation tends to be 10 percent to 15 percent higher than in plans where the employee must make the first move to enroll , it said .
Some employers also automatically increase the savings rate whenever an employee receives a raise , the report said .
However , many employers have hesitated to take this automatic approach because of concerns about their fiduciary responsibility for investment results , the report said .
But it noted that the automatic enrollment provision of the PPA , enacted in 2006 , should ease this concern and encourage more employers to adopt such arrangements in the future .
Asset Balances of Older Employees
Lower earners tend to be disproportionately represented among the groups with relatively low accumulations , while higher earners tend toward the high end of accumulations , referred to as the “ balance - to - pay scale , ” the report said .
Still , many lower earning employees have accumulated large balances and some very high earner employees have little to show for the opportunity to save for retirement on a pretax basis , the report said .
The total balances suggest that workers following a reasonable path toward a comfortable retirement are a minority .
Sixty - six percent of lower pay employees aged 50 to 64 have less than one year ’s pay in their accounts .
In the $ 45,000 to $ 60,000 range , 34.6 percent have less than a year ’s pay in retirement savings .
Even in the $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 pay class , nearly 27 percent come up short of one year ’s pay .
It noted that these employees have been with their current employer for 20 years or longer , plenty of time to have accumulated substantial balances .
This is shocking .
Lump - Sum Benefit Payouts
Another problem with defined contribution plans and , to a growing extent , with defined benefit plans that provide lump - sum payouts , is that many workers spend the money rather than save it .
When workers switch jobs , most of them withdraw their money from their defined contribution plan .
While roughly 75 percent of these assets are rolled over into another tax qualified retirement savings account , 55 percent of workers , especially younger and lower wage workers , withdraw their entire account for immediate use .
My Thoughts
As you have just read through the general results above you can probably see some information we have known for a while .
That people are not saving enough and many of those who do are not investing the money properly .
This is n’t news , but some of the actual statistics are shocking .
For instance the number of higher income earners having less than one year ’s worth of salary saved up and they have been employed for over 20 years .
There is one part of the study that I have to partially disagree with , and that is in regards to the claim that defined benefit plans are better than defined contribution plans .
Now , I do agree that given the investment knowledge of most people and the lack of willingness to participate in a defined contribution plan , yes , a defined benefit will suit these people better .
But all things considered , an employee who is saving into a DC plan and investing appropriately along with regular rebalancing will be far better than the DB plan .
Of course until employees become educated enough to utilize their DC plan effectively it may still seem as if a DB plan will provide the most benefit .
Unfortunately these plans are disappearing rapidly and people will need to rely on a DC plan for the bulk of their retirement .
I think this study does a great job at illustrating the severe situation many people are in and hopefully it sheds some light on changes that need to be made in order to properly educate people about their responsibility to save and invest for their own retirement .

Harry Kat questioned why anyone would pay hedge - fund fees .
RICHARD THOMPSON
In 2000 , Harry Kat got a call from a corporate headhunter who asked whether he would be interested in joining a financial firm that invested in hedge funds — a so - called fund of funds .
Kat , a forty - three - year - old Dutch economist , had recently left a high - paying job at the London office of Bank of America to pursue a career in academe .
He did n’t know much about hedge funds , but he agreed to be interviewed by an executive at the firm .
Hedge funds are privately owned financial companies that raise cash from very wealthy individuals and institutional investors , such as pension funds and charitable endowments .
Unlike banks and brokerage firms , hedge funds are largely unregulated , which gives them considerable latitude in investing their clients ’ money .
During the past fifteen years , the number of hedge funds has increased from about five hundred to perhaps ten thousand , and some hedge - fund managers have made vast fortunes .
Last year , three reportedly earned more than a billion dollars each : James Simons , of Renaissance Technologies ; Kenneth Griffin , of Citadel Investment Group ; and Edward Lampert , of ESL Investments .
Hedge funds go to great lengths to maintain their mystique : Simons and other managers rarely grant interviews , and the mostly young analysts and traders who make up the funds ’ staffs sign confidentiality agreements barring them from discussing their work .
The public , denied information about the industry ’s methods , has focussed instead on the conspicuous spending it has enabled_ , _ seeing in the life styles of the funds ’ managers proof of their ingenuity .
Steven Cohen , the founder of SAC Capital Advisors , lives in a thirty - two - thousand - square - foot house in Greenwich , Connecticut , and last year reportedly paid $ 143.5 million for a painting by Willem de Kooning .
In the jargon of Wall Street , hedge funds seek “ alpha ” : returns greater than those provided by standard market indices , such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S. & P. 500 .
Investing in hedge funds can be lucrative , but it is also risky : the funds , many of which are highly leveraged , have a tendency to implode when their investments turn against them .
( Last week , two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns , the investment bank , were brought to the brink of closure after losing hundreds of millions of dollars , largely in bonds tied to the sub - prime mortgage market . )
Funds of funds hold stakes in a variety of hedge funds , so they are somewhat safer .
However , as the executive made clear to Kat , investing in them is costly .
Typically , hedge - fund managers charge their clients a management fee equal to two per cent of the amount they invest , plus twenty per cent of any profits that the fund generates .
( This fee structure is known as “ two and twenty . ” )
On top of these charges , funds of funds often add a management fee of one per cent , plus a commission of ten per cent on investment gains .
Thus , people who invest in funds of funds are effectively paying a three - per-cent management fee plus a “ success fee ” of thirty per cent — “ three and thirty . ”
This arithmetic helps explain the astronomical wealth of leading hedge - fund managers , and suggests why even less successful competitors make plenty of money .
If a fund manager does well , he gets to keep a large portion of the profits he makes using his clients ’ money ; if he does poorly , he still receives the generous management fees , at least until his clients withdraw their money , which is n’t always easy to do .
( Some funds impose “ lockup ” periods of several years . )
Kat had worked in the financial markets for almost fifteen years , but what he learned about hedge - fund fees shocked him .
An investor who puts a million dollars in a fund of funds whose value goes up ten per cent in twelve months would face deductions of about sixty thousand dollars on the gains he makes .
“ Who wants to pay that kind of money ? ” Kat asked the executive who was interviewing him .
“ You ca n’t seriously expect there to be anything interesting left after somebody takes out three and thirty . ”
The executive was nonplussed .
“ I do n’t know , ” he said .
“ But they pay it . ”
The executive ’s firm offered Kat a job as the head of research , but he turned it down .
The following year , he began teaching finance at the University of Reading , and in 2003 he became a professor of risk management at Sir John Cass Business School , which is part of City University in London .
He continued to think about hedge funds .
“ When I became an academic , I said , ‘ That ’s the thing I want to investigate , ’ ” he recalled recently .
“ Is it really possible to generate investment returns to the extent that you can take out three and thirty and still be left with something you can call superior ? ”
Kat had moved to London in 1996 , several years after completing a Ph.D. in economics and statistics at the University of Amsterdam .
He worked in the derivatives department of an investment bank , where he traded futures and options — financial contracts in which a buyer has an obligation or option to pay a fixed price for a commodity or a security at a future date .
Futures and options are relatively simple derivatives ; for decades , farmers and businessmen have relied on them to stabilize their incomes .
In the past twenty years , however , new kinds of custom - built derivatives have emerged , which allow investors to make bets on , say , the future creditworthiness of corporations , or the future volatility of the stock market .
Kat became an expert in these complex securities , and by the late nineties he was head of the equity - derivatives desk at Bank of America .
He never adjusted to corporate life , though .
“ If you really want to get up at 5 A.M. , get the train , and spend all day in the office for twenty - five years , well , good luck , ” he said .
“ I did n’t want to do that . ”
Studying hedge funds proved to be a more satisfying , if less remunerative , challenge .
( As a professor , Kat earns less than a hundred thousand pounds a year — about a tenth of what he was earning as a financier . )
Aside from their fee structure , hedge funds generally have little in common .
A few make long - term investments ; most buy and sell incessantly .
Some trade individual stocks ; others place bets on entire industries and markets .
Some rely on human intuition to identify plum investments ; many use computer software programs to ferret out profitable trades .
Kat , realizing that it would be nearly impossible to determine the trading strategies of individual hedge funds — the companies would never agree to divulge them — decided to study their results instead .
Hedge funds are n’t required to file quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission , so it is n’t easy to get accurate information about their earnings .
However , several financial - publishing companies now collate data on monthly returns which hedge funds supply to them voluntarily , presumably in order to impress potential investors .
The databases that these publishers have assembled are neither complete nor entirely reliable , but they include information on thousands of funds , some of it dating back to the nineteen - eighties .
When Kat examined the databases , he noticed that in most years hedge funds outperformed the Dow and the S. & P. 500 ; they appeared to have produced alpha .
But the figures in the databases do n’t take into account the unusual risks that hedge funds take .
Many funds use borrowed money to leverage their investments ; they short stocks ; and they speculate on the price of volatile commodities , such as gold and coffee .

A new study by Google 's Anti-Malware Team seems to confirm what many people have believed for years :
Web sites running Microsoft 's IIS are twice as likely to host malware than those running Apache .
Last month , Google studied about 70,000 malware - distributing domains .
IIS servers accounted for 49 percent of the malware market — the same percentage as Apache .
( " Other " servers accounted for the remaining 2 percent . )
But Google 's survey of 80 million domain names found that IIS runs on 23 percent of web sites compared to 66 percent for Apache .
" Compared to our sample of servers across the Internet , Microsoft IIS features twice as often ( 49 percent vs. 23 percent ) as a malware distributing server , " writes Nagendra Modadugu of the Google Anti-Malware team .
A much smaller market share and a similar number of exploits means IIS has some explaining to do , and Google offered some .
Modadugu notes that in countries where software piracy is rampant — think China and other Asian countries — automatic updates may not be enabled , and patches may not be available , making those servers easier to compromise .
Of course Modadugu also says that " while many servers serve malware as a result of a server compromise ... some servers are configured to serve up exploits by their administrators . "
Do bad guys prefer GUIs ?
You have to go to a previous Google study ( PDF ) to find what may be the single biggest reason for the discrepancy .
In " The Ghost In The Browser : Analysis of Web - Based Malware , " Google noted that " web - based malware infection has been enabled to a large degree by the fact that it has become easier to setup and deploy Web sites . "
Anyone can do it !
And when one of your main selling points is ease of use , we should not be surprised if the less security - conscious among us gravitate toward IIS .

Get your energy buzz in the morning
We wrote about the full scale high - voltage and Tesla experiments going on in Russia , producing 100 meter lightnings and other spectacular effects in the surrounding forest .
These effects proved to be too fascinating to pass by , as many inspiring scientists in various countries are building small scale replicas of Tesla and other high - voltage equipment in their backyards and garages .
We 've been sent a number of images , electrifying enough to scare some fire departments - proving that this backyard activity is popular not just with curious engineers who want to get a quick " buzz " but also with photographers .
These " furry " sparks can extend to 8 feet and carry around half a million volts :

Russian " Master " sends his chair " back to the future "
With kind permission of Master we show here his experiment with DIY Tesla set .
His impressive results include a 5 meter long high - voltage discharge , which converted a normal chair into an " electric " one , and a demonstration of fluorescent tubes glowing purely from the rig 's surrounding electro - magnetic field .
Other friends of Master also tried a lesser - scale set - up , made from the dozens of used tin coffee cans .

Tesla Down Under
You can observe bigger Tesla installations in action on Peter Terren 's site Tesla Down Under .
With his permission , here are some of the most spectacular images from his hair - raising experiments .
Note , that Peter basically works with the equipment on his own , with a little help from his interested kids - so it 's really quite impressive that he came up with such an extensive catalog of electrical phenomena found on his site .
His ( very effective ) Car Theft Prevention program :
The encircling power arcs are achieved by connecting motorized 6 foot aluminum tube to the top of the Tesla coil .
A variation of this setup , called " The Eye of Sauron " produces a breathtaking effect , when rotated ( long - exposure photo ) :
" Sauron 's Aura " is even more striking - the Tesla coil is mounted 11 foot ( 3.3 m ) in the air and the rotating rod is attached to a long beam .
Peter also conducts some very odd looking experiments with " swimming pool sparks " ( do not try to imitate this , as you definitely have to know what you are doing ) .
Peter says , " The salt water pool is very conductive like a big ground so there is absolutely no sensation .
People associate water and electricity with danger .
Like dropping the hairdryer in the bathtub .
But the danger only occurs if the water forms a path to you then ground ie if you touch the taps , bath drain or wet grounded floor .
The chain mail glove has a copper braid attached otherwise it would be a problem if I had my hand right out of the water . "
Faraday cage ( or Dalek cage , as a homage to Dr. Who ) will get you so close to 6 foot sparks , that it just might " electrify " you for the rest of the day :
Peter calls this " Honey ... there is some electrical interference " , and adds that the mobile phone works just fine :
His site also provides a wealth of information on how to build and enjoy your own Tesla coil .
What else does he do in his garage and around it ?
How about moving small objects by the ionic wind , crushing cans , shrinking coins , exploding stuff for fun and BBQ - ing hot dogs with high - voltage :
Just the sort of activity we'd like to do after a stressful day in the office .
When not in the shack , Peter invades his wife 's kitchen to abuse the microwave oven .
Here is a very special microwave CD Burner :
or playing with ferro - fluids ...
We could spend all day on his site .

Michael Moore says he 's been served with subpoena
John Byrne

Filmmaker Michael Moore revealed on Thursday 's " The Tonight Show " with Jay Leno that the Bush Administration had served him with a subpoena regarding his recent trip to Cuba made as part of his new film , Sicko .
Moore told the audience that he was notified of the subpoena backstage .
" I have n't even told my own family yet , " Moore remarked .
" I was just informed when I was back there with Jay that the Bush administration has now issued a subpoena for me . "
Moore declared that the subpoena was unwarranted , saying , " this was a work of journalism . "
" I was there to help them and now I m going to face this further harassment from the Bush people , " Moore said , according to a transcript .
 Arent they busy with something else ? "
The Oscar - winning filmmaker filmed his trip to the US base at Guantanamo Bay , where he pleaded with military officials to let three 9/11 rescue workers enjoy the benefits of healthcare extended to detainees .
" I heard the al - Qaeda terrorists we have in the camps there , detained , are receiving free dental , medical , eye care , the whole deal , and our own [ 9/11 ] rescue workers can't get that in New York City , " Moore said .
The workers later received care and heavily discounted prescriptions at Cuban hospitals .
United Press International reported Thursday that the film 's distributor , the Weinstein Company , will donate 11 percent of Sicko's box office sales August 11 to " help these workers and the other workers who need help . "

In 1993 , J. Richard Gott III computed with scientific certainty that humanity would survive at least 5,100 more years .
At the time , I took that as reason to relax , but Dr. Gott has now convinced me I was wrong .
He has issued a wake - up call :
To ensure our long - term survival , we need to get a colony up and running on Mars within 46 years .
If you ’re not awakened yet , I understand .
It ’s only prudent to be skeptical of people who make scientific forecasts about the end of humanity .
Dr. Gott , a professor of astrophysics at Princeton , got plenty of grief after he made his original prediction in 1993 .
But in the ensuing 14 years , his prophetic credentials have strengthened , and not merely because humanity is still around .
Dr. Gott has used his technique to successfully forecast the longevity of Broadway plays , newspapers , dogs and , most recently , the tenure in office of hundreds of political leaders around the world .
He bases predictions on just one bit of data , how long something has lasted already ; and on one assumption , that there is nothing special about the particular moment that you ’re observing this phenomenon .
This assumption is called the Copernican Principle , after the astronomer who assumed he was n’t seeing the universe from a special spot in the center .
Suppose you want to forecast the political longevity of the leader of a foreign country , and you know nothing about her country except that she has just finished her 39th week in power .
What are the odds that she ’ll leave office in her 40th week ?
According to the Copernican Principle , there ’s nothing special about this week , so there ’s only a 1 - in - 40 chance , or 2.5 percent , that she ’s now in the final week of her tenure .
The mayor ’s chief spokesman , Stu Loeser , was asked in an interview yesterday whether being driven to an express station distanced Mr. Bloomberg from the experience of the average Manhattan subway rider .
Mr. Loeser replied , “ Who is the average Manhattan subway - goer ?
I do n’t think it ’s an answerable question .
The mayor rides the subway like anyone else .
Zips his card through , stands on the platform , and waits for a train to come . ”
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority chuckled when asked how common it is for Manhattan residents to be driven to the subway .
“ Where would you drive from in Manhattan to a subway station ?
That would be pretty crazy , ” the spokesman , Jeremy Soffin , said .
Told of the mayor ’s morning routine , he added , “ Most people do n’t have chauffeurs . ”
And most people do n’t have reporters from The New York Times watching their travels , as Mr. Bloomberg did for five weeks .
Almost every morning , two Suburbans waited outside his East 79th Street town house , sometimes with engines idling and windows up , until their charge was ready to leave .
Uniformed police officers and the mayor ’s security detail flanked the doorway as Mr. Bloomberg emerged and ducked into one of the waiting vehicles .
As they head to the express subway , they pass two No. 6 local stops , at 77th Street and 68th Street .
They pull up to the 59th Street station , across the street from Bloomingdale’s .
Mr. Bloomberg , who entered politics as a self - made media mogul , struck a populist note early in his mayoral campaign by pledging to use mass transit .
Since starting at City Hall he has invited reporters , photographers and television news anchors to ride along with him .

TRAVERSE CITY , Mich. , Aug. 9 — As gasoline prices surge past $ 3 a gallon in most of the country and closer to $ 4 in some cities , sales figures show Americans are snapping up small cars that go easier on fuel and on their wallets .
But none of the smallest cars are designed or developed by Detroit companies , which in the face of high gas prices are now highlighting another kind of automobile not usually thought of as energy efficient : the muscle car .
Ford Motor said Wednesday that it planned to build a 325 - horsepower version of the Ford Shelby GT .
It also plans a big luxury car , the Lincoln MKS , which will become the struggling brand ’s flagship sedan .
The announcement came at an industry conference here sponsored by the Center for Automotive Research .
On Thursday , General Motors is expected to confirm that it will resurrect one of its most famous muscle cars , the Chevrolet Camaro , which was a hit at the Detroit auto show in January .

Do n't wait for the muse »
The Zone of Expendability ?
In Don Norman 's words , " If someone does n't hate your product , it 's probably mediocre . "
If playing it safe today is considered a risk in business , what about in a job ?
If all managers like you , are you safer than if some think you 're amazing while others think you 're the poster child for Bad Hiring Decisions ?
My little trip back to Sun was a perfect reminder of this ... during the time I was there as an employee , one manager would give me an award while another would dig up dirt for my next performance review .
Marketing gave me a bonus ( for having a tech article published in a major trade magazine ) while another department gave me a reprimand for not getting all the proper approvals .
One boss went out of her way to use the downturn as an excuse to give me the one job she knew I hated , while another used his remaining time to give me a ridiculously large salary increase .
The thing is , through all of this ... I was always the same person .
In a single year , I went from best thing since canned beer to best reason for having a Prompt Exit Plan ( otherwise known as the , " We 're almost certainly going to fire you unless you do this [ insert thing they know you wo n't do ] , but we 'll give you the chance to leave quietly if you go now ... ] .
I 'm rightly and frequently criticized for celebrating the trouble - maker ... for making the rule - breaker into some kind of hero .
But I agree that just because one challenges the status quo does NOT mean they 're helping .
And just because one has bold , risky ideas does n't mean those ideas are good .
Sometimes a rule - breaker , non -team - playing upstart is simply ... a pain in the ass .
But too many managers appear too threatened to figure out whether their trouble - maker is the one person who can really push things forward , or the one who simply thrives on being disruptive .
There are no guarantees , of course .
Especially now .
But while in the past the safest move was to keep your head down and stay off any radars ... being a good little trooper ... that 's no longer any more likely to help you keep your job .
If you 're on nobody 's radar , you 've probably got nobody defending you like a tiger to their boss .
In either case , the freedom to push for what you believe in , and to challenge the status quo is a lot more stimulating than deciding to just not care .
If everyone is a lot more expendable today , and we ALL are " short - timers " whether we know it or not , we might as well act like short - timers by taking the risks we were too afraid to make before .
It probably wo n't make us any less at risk , and today ... it might even make us safer .
[ Footnote : this seems to be true for students as well ... like mother like daughter I suppose , but Skyler 's report cards always made me smile when it came to the little extra notes each teacher attached to the grade .
It was amazing how a single person -- Skyler - - could simultaneously be " a joy to have in class ! " an " inspiration " and " disrupts the class " and " disrespectful " , all in a single semester .
Again , this is not the strategy I 'd ever recommend , especially for a child who wants into a great college , but this kid has other plans for the world , and I can't say I 'm not secretly delighted .
Life ... is just too darn short not to speak up . ]

Wow , this is fantastic , thanks so much for this post , it really puts my experience at the only big corporation I 've worked at in perspective .
Posted by : Scott M. | Nov 20 , 2006 4:50:04 PM
You described my last job in your second paragraph perfect .
It seems that with " corporate america " the only way to grow is to have managers that are morons , or ones that just have no clue on what they are doing .
Great post !

Your second to last sentence was structured quite appropriately .
I simultaneously wanted to hug and reprimand you for your mind - boggling use of negatives . :)
Posted by : Adam Keys | Nov 20 , 2006 5:09:56 PM
Adam : I 'm not entirely unaware of how not to use negatives , but I 'm also not entirely unable to continue using them . : )
Jeremy :
Yes , it does seem that way sometimes ...
I will say that while some of the worst managers I ever had were at Sun ( who shall remain nameless ) , it was also the place where I worked for two of the absolutely best managers I ever had ( Jari Pakku and Andrea Redmond ) .
The lack of consistency is a separate and interesting discussion ...
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Nov 20 , 2006 5:55:31 PM
Of course , there 's also the " leave me alone do n't make me change my job " kind of trouble ... which does n't seem to fit on your graph very well . :-)
Managers , learn to listen to disagreement from your employees without coming to dislike them .
Employees , learn to disagree without acting like a jerk .
Here Endeth The Lesson .

I think this ties in well with your earlier post on the 19th .
Without recognition of peoples efforts , you 're not going to encourage people .
My feedback at my last job was mostly tending towards the " You 're awesome " end of the chart , but to be honest , I do n't think I was doing enything special .
All I did was see jobs through and make sure that people got the resolution they were after .
The thing was , the feedback was almost entirely from my peers and my clients .
My manager at review time would go as far as a " You 're doing well , everyone says good things about you " , and mostly that was all the recognition I got from further up .
One day , a business analyst who I did an emergency bit of reverse engineering for , bought me a pack of M&Ms to say thanks .
I still remember the warm feeling I got for that .
It was nothing really , but it showed he noticed and appreciated the effort .
If you want people to display behaviour in areas of that chart above , you have to recognise it and reward it , and straight away , not at review time 6 months down the line .
After 3 years , I got fed up with getting the same results and pay rises come review time as the slackers around me who did 1 /3rd of the amount of work , and headed for pastures new .
I 'm now very happy .

Hi folks !
This post reminds me of the oft - quoted declaration " The opposite of love is not hate , but indifference " .
I think it appropriately highlights that an emotional response is often a positive signal , even if it starts with a negative .
Of course , there are many caveats ...

I 'd say this is more applicable when working for Sun or IBM , and not most other software companies ( Microsoft , Google , Oracle , etc . )
To be frank , Sun has endless comittees to get anything done .
Nobody is empowered to make their own decisions .
In such a situation , you MUST ruffle feathers to get ANYTHING done .
In companies that actually reward innovation and initiaitive , being considered ' trouble ' is usually a bad thing ...
Posted by : bex | Nov 21 , 2006 4:48:21 PM
interesting post ; in my own experience , the worse - case scenario ( which is a flattering one , actually ) is where under - performing executives see you as a threat .
you would n't believe what they 'll do to conspire against you .
these scared runts will begin to co-operate as pack animals with peers they see to be similarly scared - ie , the weak execs will subconsciously team - together to remove or at least damage such perceived threats .
as i recall an executive saying many years ago : " never employ someone that you think is better than you . "
incredible , but rather more frequent than we 'd care too imagine ...

In a city scarred for ever by terror , they could have been forgiven for fearing the worst .
With visions of 9/11 flashing through their minds , hundreds of workers poured out of skyscrapers when a blast ripped through central Manhattan .
Shoppers ran for cover , dodging flying rubble , and a truck was swallowed when the tarmac opened up into a giant crater .
Scroll down for more ...
As the dust settled , a 120 ft - high geyser of boiling , brown - coloured water was left shooting into the air , its steam shrouding landmarks including the Chrysler Building .
A woman died of a heart attack and at least 30 were injured , some seriously .
When it became known that this was not a terror attack , but an explosion in an underground steam pipe , the relief was tangible .
Scroll down for more ...
" We ran down 43 floors thinking we were going to die , ' said Megan Fletcher , 35 , who works for an Australian company in the Chrysler Building .
" It looked like when the buildings collapsed on 9/11 . "
Karyn Easton , a customer at a salon a few blocks from the blast , said : " We were scared to death .
It sounded like a bomb went off , just like 9/11 .
People were hysterical , crying , running down the street . "
Scroll down for more ...
The explosion happened near East 41st Street and Lexington Avenue on Wednesday .
Yesterday , with around 20 blocks around the area still closed to traffic , the fear was that dust from the asbestos which insulates some of the underground piping network may have been released into the atmosphere .
Air samples tested negative , but some samples from debris and dust were positive , emergency officials said .
Residents were warned to keep their windows closed and air conditioners set to recirculate internally .
Those exposed to debris and dust were instructed to wash thoroughly and discard soiled clothing .
Scroll down for more ...
Engineers warned that an area up to 6ft around the crater might be in danger of collapse .
Many of the injured were struck by falling chunks of asphalt or rock that had been blasted out of the ground .
Casualties included several firemen and policeman Robert Mirfield , who helped evacuate 75 people trapped in an office building by cutting open a gate .
The cause of the rupture was under investigation .
Officials said the pipe , installed in 1924 , might have exploded under extreme pressure caused by an infiltration of cold rainwater , or might have been damaged by a water main break .
The site of the explosion had been inspected hours before the blast as part of a routine response to heavy rains that flooded parts of the city .
Millions of pounds of steam are pumped beneath the streets of Manhattan every hour , heating and cooling thousands of buildings , including the Empire State Building .
The systems are normally inspected every six weeks .

1945 : US drops atomic bomb on Hiroshima
The first atomic bomb has been dropped by a United States aircraft on the Japanese city of Hiroshima .
The first atomic bomb has been dropped by a United States aircraft on the Japanese city of Hiroshima .
President Harry S Truman , announcing the news from the cruiser , USS Augusta , in the mid-Atlantic , said the device was more than 2,000 times more powerful than the largest bomb used to date .
An accurate assessment of the damage caused has so far been impossible due to a huge cloud of impenetrable dust covering the target .
Hiroshima is one of the chief supply depots for the Japanese army .
The bomb was dropped from an American B - 29 Superfortress , known as Enola Gay , at 0815 local time .
The plane 's crew say they saw a column of smoke rising and intense fires springing up .
We found the Japanese in our locality were not eager to befriend us - after all , they had not long ago had the most fearful weapon of all time dropped on their doorstep
People 's
War memories »
The President said the atomic bomb heralded the " harnessing of the basic power of the universe " .
It also marked a victory over the Germans in the race to be first to develop a weapon using atomic energy .
President Truman went on to warn the Japanese the Allies would completely destroy their capacity to make war .
The Potsdam declaration issued 10 days ago , which called for the unconditional surrender of Japan , was a last chance for the country to avoid utter destruction , the President said .
" If they do not now accept our terms they may expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on Earth .
Behind this air attack will follow by sea and land forces in such number and power as they have not yet seen , but with fighting skill of which they are already aware . "
The British Prime Minister Clement Attlee , who has replaced Winston Churchill at Number 10 , read out a statement prepared by his predecessor to MPs in the Commons .
It said the atomic project had such great potential the government felt it was right to pursue the research and to pool information with atomic scientists in the US .
As Britain was considered within easy reach of Germany and its bombers , the decision was made to set up the bomb - making plants in the US .
The statement continued : " By God 's mercy , Britain and American science outpaced all German efforts .
These were on a considerable scale , but far behind .
The possession of these powers by the Germans at any time might have altered the result of the war . "
Mr Churchill 's statement said considerable efforts had been made to disrupt German progress - including attacks on plants making constituent parts of the bomb .
He ended : " We must indeed pray that these awful agencies will be made to conduce peace among the nations and that instead of wreaking measureless havoc upon the entire globe they become a perennial fountain of world prosperity . "

In Context The Hiroshima bomb , known as " Little Boy " - a reference to former President Roosevelt , contained the equivalent of between 12 and 15,000 tons of TNT and devastated an area of five square miles ( 13 square kilometres ) .
More than 60 % of the buildings in the city were destroyed .
Official Japanese figures at the time put the death toll at 118,661 civilians .
But later estimates suggest the final toll was about 140,000 , of Hiroshima 's 350,000 population , including military personnel and those who died later from radiation .
Many have also suffered long - term sickness and disability .
Three days later , the United States launched a second , bigger atomic bomb against the city of Nagasaki .
The device known as " Fat man " , after Winston Churchill , weighed nearly 4,050 kg ( nearly 9,000lb ) .
Nagasaki is surrounded by mountains and because of this the level of destruction was confined to about 2.6 square miles or 6.7 square kilometres .
Nearly 74,000 were killed and a similar number injured .
The two atomic bombs , with the Soviet declaration of war against Japan on 8 August 1945 , finally left the Japanese no choice .
Japan surrendered to the Allies on 14 August 1945 .

Coral geneticists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science have found that many corals store several types of algae , which can improve their capacity to cope with warmer water .
“ This work shatters the popular view that only a small percentage of corals have the potential to respond to warmer conditions by shuffling live - in algal partners , ” said institute marine scientist Madeleine van Oppen .
“ Simply , when conditions warm the more heat - tolerant algae provide back - up , become more abundant .
Some algal types impart greater resistance to environmental extremes , ” van Oppen said in a statement received on Friday .
Since the 1980s , reefs around the world have been devastated by coral bleaching , where temperature increases of just 1 degree Celsius can cause coral animals to expel the photosynthetic algae that keep them supplied with nutrients .
Numerous scientific studies have warned that global warming of the ocean was threatening the very existence of reefs , such as the Great Barrier Reef .
The Australian scientists said their study had found that coral has the ability to “ shuffle ” the algae , maximizing nutrients depending on water temperature .
They discovered heat - resistant algae by examining the DNA of different types of coral .
But many marine scientists have argued that “ back - up ” algae were infrequent because of the small number of corals that were shown to host several types of algae .
“ The potential for this hidden back - up type ( algae ) to step in and provide nutrition to coral during heat stress is far greater than currently thought , ” said Jos Mieog , a PhD student involved in the coral study .
The Australian scientists said this “ shuffle ” ability might explain why coral reefs have been able to survive for thousands of years during various climate changes .
“ This flexibility discovered in our research is important in understanding the past evolutionary success of these coral species and their future survival capacity in the face of a changing climate , ” said van Oppen .
Reporters trawling un - indexed FTP servers have recently been able to download large amounts of secret US military data , it has been revealed .
Documents found included plans of a new military prison camp in Iraq and a fuel dump in Afghanistan - both likely to be targets for insurgents .
Associated Press hacks who carried out the investigation suggested that less tech - savvy people in the US military - industrial complex thought it safe to put the files on open FTP ( File Transfer Protocol ) machines because they were not crawled by search - engine bots and thus could not be Googled .
However , the AP scribes could get to the files in many cases by simply substituting " ftp " for " http " in their browser address bars .
Many of the embarrassing sites appear to have been run by contractors rather than the US military itself , however the Army Corps of Engineers did put some Iraqi airbase plans up for free download , as did the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency .
The Los Alamos and Sandia nuke labs apparently made similar blunders .
In one case a sensitive document was password protected , but the password was revealed in another unsecured document on the same site .
Whoops .
AP quoted security guru Bruce Schneier as saying : " For some , there 's sort of this myth that ' if I put something on the net and do n't tell anybody ' , that it 's hidden .
It 's a sloppy user mistake .
This is yet another human error that creates a major problem . "
Well , kind of major .
It is mildly worrying that Iraqi or Afghan insurgents can download full maps of US base layouts without leaving their bedrooms , just like they could before Google Earth got all patriotic .
But they 'll still need to put their trousers on and go outdoors to actually do anything with the info : and at least in some cases they could get much of the info in question just by doing that .
It 's recently been revealed , for instance , that most Iraqis seized by the US military simply get released again - which argues that in fact the layout of US prisoner - holding facilities is quite well known .
Also , most US bases are constantly visited by local contractors - and sometimes are even built using local labour .
This could just be sour grapes from the Reg , but you could almost say that if this is the only classified stuff America has accidentally left on open FTP servers , the US military - industrial complex is actually relatively secure and tech - savvy .

Monster.com Site Hacked ; 1.6 Million Users Compromised Posted by Pile ( 8839 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Web site Monster.com has suffered an online attack with the personal data of hundreds of thousands of users stolen , says a security firm .
A computer program was used to access the employers ' section of the website using stolen log - in credentials .
The most amusing part of this is that Monster.com did n't even know about this until a security company noticed phishing spam with stolen customer information within and contacted Monster.com .
As usual , it 's the European press which break stories like this .
Why do I have to read in English papers what happens to U.S. companies ?
Never mind , do n't answer that .
We all know why .
Symantec said the log-ins were used to harvest user names , e-mail addresses , home addresses and phone numbers , which were uploaded to a remote web server .
The stolen data could be used to send phishing and spam e-mails .
" This remote server held over 1.6 million entries with personal information belonging to several hundred thousands of candidates , mainly based in the US , who had posted their resumes to the Monster.com website , " reported Symantec .
Security breach
The firm has contacted Monster.com to inform them of the security breach .
Symantec said it had seen reports of phishing e-mails sent out to Monster.com users which were " very realistic " and contained " personal information of the victims " .
The e-mail encouraged users to download a Monster Job Seeker Tool , which was in fact a program that encrypted files in their computer and left a ransom note demanding money for their decryption .
" To the best of our knowledge , this is not a hack of Monster 's security , rather , legitimate customer credentials are being used to log in to the database , " said Patrick Manzo , vice president of compliance and fraud prevention at Monster .
He added : " There have been reports of this as an issue of identify theft .
" We are not aware of any cases of identity theft .
In fact , the information that is gathered from Monster is no different than that displayed in a phone book . "
The program used to access Monster.com user data was a Trojan , which are commonly used to gain access to bank details , usernames and passwords .

Being lost in the woods is frightening , but you can improve your odds of staying safe by keeping calm and finding water , food , and shelter .
Staying hydrated is key to survival , so locate a source of drinking water , such as a stream or river , rainwater that you can collect in a container or tarp , or snow that you can melt and drink .
If you do n’t have a tent , protect yourself from the elements by building a lean - to out of branches and leaves .
You ’ll also need food , so look for safe things to eat , such as edible wild berries , dandelion leaves , or even insect larvae .
Just take care to avoid eating plants or mushrooms you do n’t recognize , since some species are toxic .
For more advice , including how to start a fire when you ’re lost in the woods , keep reading !
Geopolitics Iran to Stop Accepting Dollars for Oil By Ryan McGreal
Published April 14 , 2007
In a move seven years in the making , Iran has stopped all sales of oil in US dollars , electing to sell other countries instead .
Iran has been selling oil for other currencies for a few years , but it is taking the next step and phasing out dollar sales completely .
If you want to buy oil from Iran , you will need euros or yen .
To understand just how significant this is , look at this table of current account balances by country .
The US , with four percent of the world 's population , has a current accounts deficit of $ 829 billion .
A nation 's current accounts is the difference between the value of goods and services it exports and the value of goods and services it imports .
A deficit means a country imports more than it exports .
The US current accounts deficit is ten times higher than the country with the next highest deficit ( Spain ) and double the total current accounts deficits of the other 89 countries with deficits .
That 's right : the US is singlehandedly responsible for two thirds of the entire planet 's current accounts deficits .
Of the 60 countries with current accounts surpluses , the top two are Japan and China , with surpluses of $ 165.5 billion and $ 160.8 billion , respectively .
These two countries are major holders of dollar - denominated securities , and both have been slowly , quietly reducing their dollar holdings .
Petrodollar Hegemony
So how is Iran refusing to sell oil for dollars is connected to the US current accounts deficit ?
Normally , when a country runs a current accounts deficit , it must pay the difference in cash .
However , since the early 1970s , the US has had a special deal .
When OPEC formed , the US government negotiated a deal that all OPEC countries would only sell oil for dollars and dollar denominated securities .
In other words , if you want to buy oil from an OPEC country , you need to buy dollars first .
This was a great deal for the US because it could essentially print dollars and sell them abroad to cover its trade shortfalls .
Other countries had to buy those dollars so they could buy oil .
The OPEC countries , in turn , tended to invest their wealth back into the US ( this is called petrodollar recycling ) so the US economy could essentially enjoy its benefits without actually having to produce anything to earn it .
The run-up in oil prices since 2000 has been a bonanza for the US economy despite higher prices at the pump since the international demand for US dollars has grown in lockstep .
This has allowed the US current accounts deficit to reach its present state of unimaginable bloat .
If OPEC changed its policy and allowed people to buy oil with other currencies , it would be a disaster for the US economy , because international demand for all those little green pieces of paper would evaporate .
Despite the high oil prices , the value of the dollar has been flagging against the euro since 1999 when the common European courrency was first introduced .
This reflects the poor fundamentals of the US economy - other than the petrodollar system , US currency is n't backed by any real economic foundation .
For a much more in - depth examination of what 's at stake , I highly recommend William Clark 's book Petrodollar Warfare ( reviewed in RTH ) .
Iran 's Real Threat
Back in 2005 , I wrote that the American sabre - rattling against Iran had less to do with its plan to develop nuclear power , which it is legally entitled to do under the Non Proliferation Treaty , than with its plan to launch a euro - based oil bourse , or stock exchange for trading energy .
( The article generated some interest and even landed me an interview on the Sky documentary Conspiracies : Iraq .
A low - res version in Real Media format is available for download . )
The plan to launch the bourse seems to be on indefinite hold , but otherwise , Iran is still proceeding with its strategy of undermining petrodollar hegemony by making long - term energy deals with China and refusing to trade oil for dollars .
While pundits hollar at each other over whether Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons , the country has quietly lit the fuse to a financial time bomb that could leave the US economy looking like a war zone once its staggering trade obligations are called in .
Amazingly , almost no one seems to have noticed .
The International Herald - Tribune carried a story about it , but the New York Times , which owns the Tribune , did not .
The next time you read or hear someone claiming Iran is a threat , remember that the real threat is that Iran 's actions might trigger the collapse of the American economic house of cards .

Reliable Sources had on Brian Ross from ABC to talk about the Randall Tobias resignation and the thousands of names on the DC Madam 's phone records .
I think there are a few people a bit worried , do n't you ?
Download Download
BRIAN ROSS , ABC NEWS :
There are several thousands names , tens of thousands of phone numbers and they range from administration officials to lobbyists to advisers who are well known , people who appear on television , lawyers , and then just a lot of sort of ordinary businessmen and CEOs .
Duncan talks about the privacy issue .
I found it f'd up that the Feds are only interested in the women .
But that 's par for the course ...
Here 's a bit of interesting Laura / GW news ... Does privacy extend to them ?
( full transcript via CNN below the fold )
On Thursday , Ross spoke with Deputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias , whose phone number was in the escort service 's records .
Tobias resigned late Friday and Ross , who 's working on a story for next week 's " 20/20 , " posted some of the details on his blog that night .
ABC 's chief investigative reporter joins us now by phone from Connecticut .
Brian Ross , thanks very much for calling in .
Roughly , how many names are on this list and what kind of people are they ?
BRIAN ROSS , ABC NEWS :
There are several thousands names , tens of thousands of phone numbers and they range from administration officials to lobbyists to advisers who are well known , people who appear on television , lawyers , and then just a lot of sort of ordinary businessmen and CEOs .
KURTZ : And some women as well ?
ROSS : The women who are the -- the women who worked for Jean Palfrey range from university professors , legal secretaries , military officers themselves .
KURTZ : Brian , as I just mentioned , you spoke on Thursday with Randall Tobias .
He was running the Agency for International Development at the State Department .
What did he tell you about his involvement with the escort service ?
Was he agitated during this conversation ?
ROSS : No , he was I would say more , Howie , he was subdued .
Initially , I placed a call on the number he used to contact the escort service .
His press secretary called back and I explained that I wanted to speak to Mr. Tobias directly - only if he authorized the press secretary to talk to me would I continue .
And then about an hour later , Tobias himself called back .
And I told him what we had seen in the records and it was his number listed to his home address in Indiana , and after about a five - second silence , he confirmed .
He said he had gals come over to the condo to give him massages , that he had found the number in the " Washingtonian " magazine and recently he been using some what he called central American gals to give him massages .
KURTZ : So Tobias is saying only massages , no sex .
ROSS : No sex .
KURTZ : Now on Friday night 's " World News , " you did not report this .
You put it on your blog , the blotter , about 9:00 that night .
Is that because you did n't know or decided not to go with it for television ?
ROSS : I was off on Friday , actually attending my son's high school debate tournament and the State Department release came out around 5:00 Friday afternoon .
I just did n't know about it until about 8:00 at night and about an hour later we put it on abcnews.com .
KURTZ : Here I thought there was some elaborate conspiratorial reason and it was your son 's debate tournament .
All right .
This list of thousands of names , got all these phone records , just as a practical matter , is it difficult to find out who these phone records belong to ?
ROSS : It takes some work .
We 've been working on it , our investigative team for the last month , month and a half , going through them all and I think we have a pretty good idea now of who is on the list .
KURTZ : Jeane Palfrey originally talked about selling her list of clients to a tabloid outfit and then obviously , ABC News does not pay for information .
Why did she decide to cooperate with you ?
ROSS : We told her that we would take it seriously , that it was a potentially important story .
Her point is that she runs an operation that she claims offered no sex .
And that she sees it as hypocritical that the government is going after her and the women who worked for her and not the men .
The phone lists were in her home when the Federal agents raided it .
But they were not interested in apparently the names of the men , only the women who worked for her .
So she thinks that it is hypocritical .
Secondly , she wants to call some of these men to testify on her behalf .
She 's turned down a deal , a plea bargain deal from the government and wants to go to trial .
KURTZ : I should have mentioned at the top she 's under indictment and as you say , she apparently plans to go to trial .
If a government official pays for this kind of service personally and has nothing to do with his job , is there at least an argument that it 's not news worthy and should n't be reported ?
ROSS : Well , I think there -- I think it is news worthy that there is this indictment .
It 's part of a Bush administration effort under the Department of Justice to crack down on prostitution and this is part of it .
Tobias in particular , given his role as spearheading the Bush administration effort overseas to crack down on prostitution , seemed to us to be news worthy .
KURTZ : You are faced with a list of names .
You say some of them are fairly prominent people , from not just the government but different walks of life .
Is this a dilemma for you as to how far you should push your reporting ?
ROSS : The reporting is -- we want to know all we can know and then the decision has to be made as to what information we 'll actually use on the air next week on " 20/20 " or on " World News " .
We actually had n't made the decision about Tobias and he did n't ask me whether we 're going to name him .
I guess he just assumed that .
KURTZ : As of now , you are planning on reporting the story on Friday on " 20/20 . "
ROSS : " 20/20 " and on other ABC outlets , " Good Morning America " and " World News " and on the ABC News blotter .
KURTZ : I suspect the story may get a little bit attention when you report it .
Brian Ross , thanks very much for calling this morning .
Good to talk with you .
Two years from now , Hillary Clinton might be pleased to hear the kind of boos and antiwar chants that greeted her days ago when she spoke at the annual Take Back America conference of Democratic activists and argued against a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq .
But so much of politics is about timing .
And right now , Clinton is facing a serious problem of premature triangulation .
As long as she needs support from Democratic primary voters , Hillary Clinton will want to defer the media rewards of an all - out “ Sister Souljah moment . ”
Let ’s recall that in 1992 , when Bill Clinton went out of his way to denounce the then - little - known rap singer Sister Souljah at a Rainbow Coalition conference , he ’d already clinched the Democratic presidential nomination and was looking toward the general election .
Bill Clinton ’s triangulation gambit , using Sister Souljah as a prop for his calculated move to ingratiate himself with establishment pundits , had been foreshadowed by a Washington Post article that reported the day before : “ Some top advisers to Clinton argue that he must become involved in highly publicized confrontations with one or more Democratic constituencies . ”
The constituency that Clinton chose to polarize with was African - American activists .
These days , and from here to the horizon , there ’s no larger or more adamant Democratic constituency than the antiwar voters who want the U.S. military out of Iraq pronto .
At this point , Hillary Clinton ’s pro-war position is far afield from the views of most grassroots Democrats .
Clinton ’s foreseeable game plan is to eventually confront antiwar activists head - on as she portrays herself as a strong - on - defense Newer - Than - New Democrat .
Two years from now , if she has the nomination cinched , she ’ll be eager to ratchet up her strategy of playing to the gallery of corporate - media journalists by presenting herself as a centrist alternative to both the Republican Party ’s right wing and the Democratic Party ’s “ special interests ” ( a.k.a. , the party ’s base ) .
But first Hillary Clinton would need to win enough delegates to become the party ’s presidential nominee .
To that end , she ’ll try to finesse and blur the war issue in hopes that her hawkish position wo n’t rub too many Democratic primary voters the wrong way .
It ’s not going to be easy .
What happened at the Take Back America conference the other day was mild compared to what Hillary Clinton has coming in primary and caucus battleground states once the presidential campaign begins in earnest .
And she may encounter unexpected difficulties as her pro-war reputation grows .
If Hillary Clinton thinks she can postpone an all - out confrontation with the antiwar movement until a time and place of her tactical choosing , she ’s going to be very disappointed .
And at the end of her 2008 quest , Clinton may discover that she has triangulated herself right out of the nomination .
“ ‘ Siag , it sucks less ! ’
This is the slogan for Siag Office .
This and the self - effacing name for the Siag Office Word Processor , Pathetic Writer , might leave you thinking that this office suite is a mere plaything , a university student ’s cobbled - together programming assignment .
But do n’t be fooled by first impressions .
Siag Office is a lightweight suite of applications which might be just the right set of office tools for you , especially if you have older hardware . ”
Pagination and Page - View Juicing are Evil
You ’ve seen it a thousand times .
You ’re reading a great article on the web , you get to the bottom of the page , and there it is :
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Next >
The pagination tattoo .
The mark of the beast .
Over the last several years , many publishers have convinced themselves that breaking up stories into sometimes as many as ten pages is an acceptable way to present content on the web .
The realistic ones at least admit that it ’s a cheap way to boost stats .
The disingenuous ( or naive ) ones actually posit that they are improving readability and usability for their audiences by reducing scrolling .
Because scrolling is so hard .
I ’ve seen both rationales presented by colleagues , and frankly , I ’m not on board with either one .
There are really only two instances where I find pagination acceptable , and they both seem rare on today ’s web :
If an article is extremely long .
Like 20 screens worth .
And even then , it should be broken up by “ Acts ” and not necessarily word count .
Break it up as if it were a play and try to never have more than a few Acts .
Slightly related to item 1 , even a short piece can be functionally broken up .
Imagine a much shorter version of that great Washington Post article about the violinist in the train station .
The article has several video clips strewn throughout .
Those would be logical places to either start or end each Act .
Instead , what I ’m seeing more and more of is ridiculous pagination for the sake of juicing page views .
Take for example this article which was seeded sarcastically to Newsvine the other day .
It ’s from a site called Associated Content .
The article is a lousy 1504 words and it ’s broken up into four pages !
I ’ve read cover letters that are longer than that .
How is a reader to endure a user experience like this and feel respected by the publisher ?
Maybe if I ’m reading Malcolm Gladwell , I ’ll give the guy a break because I ’m so lucky to be reading his masterpieces in the first place , but the fact of the matter is that 99 % of content on the web ( and in the world ) is not stuff we ’d bow down to , so we should at least hope to be respected as we ’re trading our attention and associated ad revenue for some reasonably entertaining or educational text .
As the founder of a news startup , I ’m fully aware of the constant pressure to increase page views month over month , but at some point you have to ask yourself if the page view is your most important metric over time .
If you could choose only one of the following — long term — which would you choose : a user who consistently generates 10 page views a day on your site but spends only 5 minutes with you , or a user who literally stares slackjawed at the screen for two hours a day with your site running on it , generating only one page view ?
Your accountants will always pick the former , but you should always pick the latter .
In the long run , it ’s not total HTTP requests that will determine how successful you are .
It ’s what percentage of any given population ’s attention you earn .
Do n’t blow it by manipulating your readers .
An international working group under the direction of Wolfgang und Roswitha Wiltschko of Frankfurt University has now succeeded in demonstrating the presence of a magnetic sense of direction in domestic chickens .
40 years ago , Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Wiltschko was the first to prove that migrating robins use the Earth ’s magnetic field to direct themselves during migration .
Their magnetic sensor showed them the course of the field lines of the Earth ’s magnetic field .
This produces an inclination compass that reacts to the inclination of the Earth ’s magnetic field to the surface of the Earth , thus distinguishing between “ pole - wards ” ( the side on which the field lines incline downwards ) and “ equator - wards ” ( the side on which they incline upwards ) .
The inbuilt compass is additionally finely tuned to the field strength of the Earth ’s local magnetic field , but can also be flexibly adapted to other field strengths that the birds encounter in the course of migration .
Since that time a compass of this kind has been found in more than 20 species of birds , the majority of them being those songbirds that undertake annual migration .
For this experiment , newly hatched chicks were imprinted on a red ball which they from then on regarded as their ‘ mother ’ .
The researchers then hid the ball behind one of four screens , and taught the chickens by intensive training that the mother was always behind the screen that was in the northerly direction .
To demonstrate that the chicken senses this compass point by means of its magnetic sense of direction , the researchers set up an artificial magnetic field in an easterly direction – and the chickens did actually seek their mother behind the screen that lay to the east .
Further experiments showed that the chickens ’ magnetic sensor functions very similarly to that of the robin .
It also reacts to the inclination and the local field strength of the Earth ’s magnetic field .
The magnetic sensor is probably situated in the eye , since the birds need short - wave light ( such as blue light ) to orientate themselves .
In long - wave light above the yellow level this ability is lost in all the birds that have so far been tested .
From these similarities the research group has deduced that a magnetic sense of direction could be an ability common to all birds .
Since one has to go back very far in evolutionary history to find a common ancestor for chickens and robins , this ability must have developed before the birds began to migrate .
Accordingly it seems that the magnetic sense of direction was already used by primitive bird - forms to move efficiently in their environment between their nests , sleeping places , and sources of food and water .

In 2002 , the Times reported :
White House officials said today that the administration was following a meticulously planned strategy to persuade the public , the Congress and the allies of the need to confront the threat from Saddam Hussein .
The rollout of the strategy this week , they said , was planned long before President Bush 's vacation in Texas last month .
It was not hastily concocted , they insisted , after some prominent Republicans began to raise doubts about moving against Mr. Hussein and administration officials made contradictory statements about the need for weapons inspectors in Iraq .
The White House decided , they said , that even with the appearance of disarray it was still more advantageous to wait until after Labor Day to kick off their plan .
'' From a marketing point of view , '' said Andrew H. Card Jr. , the White House chief of staff who is coordinating the effort , '' you do n't introduce new products in August . ''
A centerpiece of the strategy , White House officials said , is to use Mr. Bush 's speech on Sept. 11 to help move Americans toward support of action against Iraq , which could come early next year .
This September 11 , we will have the reports from General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker , filtered through a White House drafted report .
I watched Vice - President Cheney 's speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars on August 26 , 2002 , in the residence where I was staying in Kabul , Afghanistan .
I heard Cheney deliver his famous falsehood :
The Iraqi regime has in fact been very busy enhancing its capabilities in the field of chemical and biological agents .
And they continue to pursue the nuclear program they began so many years ago .
These are not weapons for the purpose of defending Iraq ; these are offensive weapons for the purpose of inflicting death on a massive scale , developed so that Saddam can hold the threat over the head of anyone he chooses , in his own region or beyond .
We know the results .
This year , on August 28 , President Bush spoke to another veterans ' group , the American Legion .
He called Iran " the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , " whose " active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust . "
He concluded :
Iran 's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere .
And that is why the United States is rallying friends and allies around the world to isolate the regime , to impose economic sanctions .
We will confront this danger before it is too late .
But this may just be test marketing , like Cheney 's 2002 speech .
After all " from a marketing point of view , you do n't introduce new products in August . "
I cannot verify this report .
But I also heard last week from a former U.S. government contractor .
According to this contractor , someone in the Department of Defense called , asking for cost estimates for a model for reconstruction in Asia .
The former contractor finally concluded that the model was intended for Iran .
This anecdote is also inconclusive , but it would be consistent with the depth of planning that went into the reconstruction effort in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I hesitated before posting this .
I do n't want to spread alarmist rumors .
The U.S. cannot mount a ground invasion or occupation of Iran , but it might be capable of an air attack and sea embargo .
The administration has prepared a legal justification by floating its plan to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization .
Since the IRGC is under the command of the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , the administration , with its usual legal acuity , could claim legal authority for an attack on Iran under Senate Joint Resolution 23 of September 18 , 2001 , which authorized the use of military force against " those who plan , authorize , commit , or aid terrorist attacks against the United States and its interests -- including those who harbor terrorists . "
There are too many signs of another irresponsible military adventure from the Cheney - Bush administration to just dismiss these reports .
Perhaps it is just a clever attempt to ratchet up pressure on Tehran , but the history of this administration does not allow me to believe that .
I am putting these inconclusive reports into the public sphere in the hope of helping to mobilize opposition to a policy that would further doom the efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and burden our country and the people of the Middle East with yet another unstoppable fountain of bloodshed .
Not to show off or anything , but I have a day job .
Every morning from Monday through Friday I put on a pair of pants and toddle off to an environment I like to call " the workplace " to perform the duties associated with " work " .
Weekends are pants - optional .
I am compensated for the performance of these labors with " money " , or in other words abstract units of value that can be exchanged for goods and services , until inflation kicks in .
This money of which I speak enters and exits my life in precisely the same quantity , much like beer through an Australian , but on a much smaller scale .
All well and good , except it 's no longer enough merely to secure an income and spend it until the inevitable illness or bear attack claims one 's life , the way it was in Grandpa 's time .
Our lives may not last all that much longer than they used to , but modern medicine has figured out how to prolong the dying process by as much as thirty years .
Nothing to worry about , in simpler times .
You did n't have to invent the reciprocating engine , build a woolen mill , or wipe out an indigenous people in order to live comfortably all your days ( some folks went ahead and did these things anyway , though relatively few did all three ) .
You could operate a newsstand or sell shoes and get by .
Put a little money in the Savings & Loan for old age , smoke three packs of Chesterfields a day , and die at fifty , leaving a modest inheritance , and people would think you did all right .
But these days , if one does not wish to suffer one 's waning years in poverty and sorrow , gnawing the marrow out of femurs robbed from the graveyard just to stay alive , one -- and I think we all know who " one " is -- must have established a source of funding well beyond such trifles as social security checks and pensions , none of which will probably exist anyway by the time I reach retirement age , if I even get that far .
Nowadays ( and I do n't use the reprehensible word " nowadays " lightly , in company as it is with words like " winsome " and " anyhoo " ) if we expect to survive until death , we must not only save and invest - we must also be successful .
Success can be defined as one 's work having exceeded one 's days .
If , every day , one makes more progress towards a goal , eventually reaching it , one can be said to have accomplished something .
Probably not much , but something .
Success is a bigger thing than accomplishment .
It is a matter of posterity .
A successful person has earned a place in the future beyond his or her own lifetime , whether this is a matter of money alone , or notoriety , or making a difference in the world .
Look at Gregor Mendel and his peas , or Jayne Mansfield and her tomatoes : the fruits of their labors live on .
John Brown 's
Body lies a mould 'ring in the grave /
But his soul goes tiddly - pom ( I forget the exact words ) .
If we can agree on this simple premise , or even where to go for lunch , then we can also agree that I am completely , utterly , almost exhilaratingly unsuccessful .
Which is quite an accomplishment , but it wo n't pay for my old age .
When I say , " I am not prepared for retirement " ( and I say this at the age of forty - one , the same age that Julius Caesar became Consul of Rome , Tony Blair became leader of the Labour Party , and William ' Wild Bill ' Shakespeare was writing King Lear and Macbeth back - to - back ) , I do not mean retirement to an attractive five - bedroom en suite home in a palmy New Mexico golf community for wealthy assholes ; rather I mean that I am not prepared to retire under any circumstances , ever .
In fact if I stop working for more than about a week and a half , I 'm ruined .
Experts recommend you should have three to six month 's living expenses socked away against emergencies , in addition to whatever you 're hiding behind the loose brick in the chimneypiece for old age .
I have twenty minutes ' living expenses socked away .
Even a new belt for the vacuum cleaner would break me at this stage in my life , so the idea of saving money for the semi- distant future is absurd .
It 's not that I 've squandered money - I just have n't had any .
To me , this is normal .
I think it 's normal for most guys my age , like hating Phil Collins or having to fart with care to avoid soiling ourselves .
Being clever with investments strikes me as weird .
Then again , it 's weird in the same way that a guy who can blow himself is weird : I 'm sickened , but strangely envious .
I 've got no knack for the lucrative shell game of investors : short - selling and gamma hedges and partial lookback options and so forth .
There was a 401 K plan in my past somewhere , but it got cashed out for an emergency .
Sold a house at the top of the market , but also purchased a divorce , so broke more or less even .
I might accumulate some value from my collection of pre-war nickels , but that 's about it .
Anything else is going to my son's college , assuming he does n't get into drugs , knock up his underage girlfriend , and become a drummer , in which case his college money is mine .
I 'd like to think that Social Security will someday provide me with a little ready money to pay for fuel oil now and then when I 'm older and grayer .
Maybe even a tin of discount Chinese cat food on Fridays .
But the Republicans are intent on strangling social security , and about all the loyal opposition can manage is to insist it get a decent burial .
So although I 'm more than happy ( miserable ) to get robbed every year by the federal government for the symbolic purpose of paying for our collective retirements , it 's not much of a comfort .
In real - world terms , I 'm still on my own .
So how to succeed ?
I 've sold screenplays every once in a while , design great big theme parks and resorts and things ( that is my day job ) , but there is n't much money in either of those things .
There 's a reason well - paid writers and artists get on the news .
It 's the same reason a lungfish that can whistle Bizet 's Song of the Toreador gets on the news .
Still , if I 'm to make any progress beyond a few modest accomplishments , which as I 've established above will not pay for my dotage , I must find a way to be successful within the scope of what I can realistically expect to do , particularly at my age , when it 's no longer seemly to attempt anything impressive .
For example : even as we speak ( I speak , anyway ) I 'm working on a television pilot .
It 's a great story and it comes with a four - season arc that would take the show into syndication .
However , back here on earth , the likelihood of this earning me a single pre-war nickel is extremely small .
Then there 's the scheme to become a consultant to the Irish Film Board ( Bord ScannÃ¡n na hÃ‰ireann ) .
Or the peyote chewing gum idea ( " Whiten Your Teeth While You Witness The Sky Jaguar People ! " ) .
Heckfire , I could start a theme park of my very own .
These things might be a fabulous success , although let 's not kid around about it .
I suspect that most folks are in much the same leaky boat as I am : a head full of dreams and a bellyful of maybe - next - time .
Which sounds a lot like Social Security .
When I wrote the outline for this essay , I arranged it just like every good schoolboy does : topic , thesis , argument , filler material , conclusion .
Unfortunately , when I got round to the conclusion , I did n't have one .
I 'm still wallowing my way up flumen fimus without a paddle , unable to think up a cunning method by which I can not merely accomplish things , which was good enough in the old days , but succeed , which is barely enough to get by in the modern age ( I seem to have stated my topic at the end of the essay instead of the beginning ) .
In my notes , under the word " conclusion " it just says " punt " .
Which , now that I think of it , is my retirement plan in a nutshell .

The Interior Department celebrated European Heritage Month in August , an unusual move that has caused some employees to feel uneasy .
Interior published an online monthly magazine as part of that celebration , which highlighted the history and accomplishments of various European cultures in the United States .
While the same publication put out previous issues that focused on other groups such as LGBTQ and Asian Americans , the publication caused a stir among some employees who saw the celebration as insensitive and improperly promoting ideals related to white pride .
Employees at Interior said they could not recall Interior ever recognizing European Heritage Month previously , with one saying the department “ made up their own commemorative month . ”
The publication was put together by the head of “ special emphasis programs ” at the Interior Business Center , though the magazine is labeled as a publication of Interior ’s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administrative Services .
A division
The graffiti was discovered by staff on Tuesday
Staff at Skara Brae arrived on Tuesday to find graffiti scribbled on the walls of the 5,000 year - old village .
Police are keen to trace a group of visitors who are believed to have been travelling in a silver Hyundai .
The site attracts thousands of visitors every year and is one of Orkney 's most iconic tourist attractions .
Mary Dunnett , monument manager of the site which is looked after by Historic Scotland , said that the graffiti was one of the first things that visitors to the village would see .
I 'd imagine it will cost a lot of money to remove this without damaging the stone too much
Mary Dunnett
Historic Scotland
" Someone has come in and gone into house one , which is one of the best houses here in Skara Brae , " she said .
" They 've put marker pen on a dresser and they 've also written their name , put a smiley face and the date on one of the bedposts so it 's quite prominent .
" I 'd imagine it will cost a lot of money to remove this without damaging the stone too much . "
Sergeant Gregor
Hay , who is leading the investigation , said that they had identified the suspect as a tourist due to travel back to the mainland by ferry on Friday .
" We believe the suspect has been stupid enough to use his own name , " he added .
" We are keen to speak to a family who are still on the island . "
Gradual excavations
Skara Brae was first discovered following a major storm in 1850 , which battered the island to such an extent that an outline of a series of stone buildings were revealed .
A series of excavations were carried out over the next century , finally revealing eight stone dwellings that were originally believed to be an Iron Age settlement .
However in the 1970s radiocarbon dating showed that the village was originally built between 3200 and 2200 BC .
Today the ancient village is under serious erosion threat from the sea and Orkney 's fierce weather conditions .
Twins Reunited After 14 Years
Mother claims doctor stole second child , never told her she had twins .
July 15 , 2007  --
For the first 14 years of her life , Andrea Penaherrera never knew she had a sister .
But on one day four months ago in the in the southern Ecuadorean town of Milagros , she and her mother were shocked to walk into a restaurant and see across the room another face that looked just like Andrea's .
The girls had the same hair , eyes and were identical in every way .
It did n't take long for Andrea and the other girl , Marielisa , to realize that they were twins , separated at birth .
Across the globe , the discovery generated headlines , in part for how the two girls met .
But , there was another twist -- the alleged story of how the two were separated in the first place .
The girls ' biological mother , Petita Penaherrera , said doctors never told her she had twins .
She claimed when the babies were delivered , she was told she had given birth to just one , and said she believed the doctor took the second child and raised it on his own .
Roberto Romo , one of the doctors who delivered the girls , disagrees with Penaherrera 's version of events .
He claimed she knew of the twins , but decided to give one away because she was a teen mother , unable to take care of two babies .
The sisters said they are thrilled to be reunited , though Marielisa said she wants to remain with her adopted family .
However , Marielisa 's biological mother and her husband Augusto Freire want Marielisa back , and a court will soon decide her fate .
Castro has been out of public life for nearly a year
Speaking in a US TV interview Ricardo Alarcon gave no indication of when the Cuban leader might return to power .
But he said Mr Castro was over the worst after a series of operations , including what he described as very delicate surgery .
Mr Alarcon also said Mr Castro was reading and writing a lot .
The Cuban leader has not been seen in public since undergoing intestinal surgery in July 2006 and has temporarily ceded power to his brother Raul .
" I think , in a way , he practically has fully recovered , " Mr Alarcon told the CNN network .
" The problem was a very delicate surgery , " he went on .
" He had to have several surgeries .
But it was a very risky situation .
Now it is not anymore . "
Bush ' threat '
Raul Castro has taken over during his brother 's illness
A week ago , Mr Castro made a statement about his health for the first time since he felt ill , saying his health was improving .
" No danger is larger than that related to ageing , " said the Cuban leader , who added that the first operations he had undergone had been unsuccessful , leading to a lengthy recovery period .
In another article published earlier this week , Mr Castro wrote that US President George W Bush had said : " I 'm a hard - line president and I 'm only waiting for Castro to die . "
" I 'm not the first , nor will I be the last , that Bush has ordered to be deprived of life , " wrote the Cuban president , although he did not provide any details about when Mr Bush allegedly made the remark .
Asked about US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 's recent comment that " there must be democratic transition in Cuba , Mr Alarcon told CNN he was hoping " there will be regime change in your country " .

Lately , I 've been developing a little application using the Facebook Platform ( my Easter Egg and Four Secrets , One Lie application ) and I started wondering about the statistics surrounding Facebook applications .
So , a little WWW :: Mechanize application later here 's some facts that are true today : 1 . There are 1,225 Facebook applications available in the Facebook directory .
2 . There are 73,109,074 installed applications in Facebook users ' profiles .
3 .
Hence the average application has about 59700 users .
The problem with the average is that it hides a savage reality of Facebook applications : some have many users , most have almost none .
To analyze that I broke the data logarithmically counting the number of applications with greater than 1,000,000 , 100,000 , 10,000 , 1,000 , 100 , 10 and 0 users .
So , 86 % of applications on Facebook have less than 10,000 users , with 62 % having less than 1,000 users .
The ' big applications ' ( with over 100,000 users ) account for 5 % of all the applications , and only 2 % make it over 1,000,000 users .
So for most people developing a Facebook applications means very , very few users .
Graphing that you get a classic Long Tail picture :
The top 21 applications ( over 1,000,000 users are ) : Another way to examine the Facebook data is to ask who the most prolific authors are .
The top most profilic authors are :
Only Kevin Koder ( with 230,164 users spread of 8 applications ) is anywhere near being a ' top application ' on Facebook .
Kevin's top application is Family Guy Quotes .
The top 10 authors by number of users are : Unsurprisingly Facebook is one of the most popular authors given their advantage of actually owning the site .
Ignoring the companies on the list there are a few individuals who've hit the big time on Facebook .
Whether that turns in to any money for them is another thing ... but Facebook benefits from this Long Tail because the cost to them of the vast underbelly of barely used applications is close to 0 : they do n't even host those applications , you do .

Koch urges withdrawal from Iraq
I ’m bailing out .
I will no longer defend the policy of keeping U.S. troops in Iraq to assist the Iraqi central government in the ongoing civil war .
While our men and women in the military suffer casualties daily , the Iraqi government refuses to take the major political steps required to end the civil war .
The U.S. government told the Iraqi government that it needed to achieve 18 goals .
Our administration ’s recent report to the U.S. Congress on how close the Iraqis have come to achieving those goals states that eight have been achieved , no progress has been made on eight others and two have had mixed results .
Advertisement
With regard to the most important goals , which include bringing the Sunni population into the Shia - dominated government by removing the bans against those ( primarily Sunnis ) who had served in the prior Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein , the grade was zero .
The Iraqi government similarly received a zero for failing to enact legislation that would equitably divide the country ’s oil income among the Kurdish , Sunni and Shiite ethnic regions .
Currently the Kurds and Shia share the oil revenues because the oil fields are located in the areas they control .
The Sunnis control very few oil fields .
The American people no longer support our presence in Iraq .
They made that clear in the 2006 congressional election when the majority in both houses of Congress shifted to the Democrats .
My own position has been that we were better off fighting Islamic terrorism in Iraq than abandoning it and having that battle shift to American soil , which I am certain will happen when we leave Iraq .
But my support for remaining in Iraq was conditioned on our allies joining us in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Sadly , very few have done so .
Instead , many of those same allies criticize us for staying in Iraq .
Only one major ally , Great Britain , has joined us with any serious contribution of troops .
Even that in numbers -- 7,100 -- is paltry compared to our 140,000 troops , now increased to 160,000 .
Tony Blair was cast out as prime minister in part because he supported the U.S. in Iraq .
Under the new prime minister , Laborite Gordon Brown , the British commitment is shrinking and the inevitability of a British withdrawal is clear .
The cost to date for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan is computed at about $ 400 billion , with $ 12 billion per month being spent in Iraq alone .
The Bush administration has declined to leave Iraq , opting instead for what they call the “ surge , ” increasing our military forces to 160,000 by bringing in an additional 30,000 American troops .
In September , our new commanding general on the ground , Army Gen. David Petraeus , will report on whether the surge is working .
But already the administration suggests that a September assessment may not cover enough time to determine success or failure .
In any event , Petraeus has stated that political changes by the Iraqi government are necessary and that military progress by itself is not enough .
The media recently reported that American soldiers on the ground fear they are being betrayed by and fired upon by members of the Iraqi army and police force .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki stated over the weekend , “ We say with confidence that we are capable , God willing , of taking full responsibility for the security file if the international forces withdraw in any time they wish . ”
In the meantime , the civil war escalates .
This week alone on a single day more than 100 Iraqi civilians were killed and near 200 injured in two car bombings .
Our soldiers cannot end the civil war for the Iraqis .
Their soldiers have to do that .
My voice is a modest one , so I would like to buttress my pro-withdrawal position with arguments put forth by the highly regarded New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman .
In his July 11 column , he stated :
“ But getting out has at least four advantages .
First , no more Americans will be dying while refereeing a civil war .
Second , the fear of an all - out civil war , as we do prepare to leave , may be the last best hope for getting the Iraqis to reach an eleventh - hour political agreement .
Third , as the civil war in Iraq plays out , it could , painfully , force the realignment of communities on the ground that may create a more stable foundation upon which to build a federal settlement .
Fourth , we will restore our deterrence with Iran .
Tehran will no longer be able to bleed us through its proxies in Iraq , and we will be much freer to hit Iran -- should we ever need to -- once we ’re out .
Moreover , Iran will by default inherit management of the mess in southern Iraq , which , in time , will be an enormous problem for Tehran . ”
I agree with Friedman and repeat that I would support our troops remaining in Iraq if our allies were to join us .
But they have made it clear they will not .
I propose that we do what the British did when they withdrew their troops from the historic Palestine Mandate they had assumed in 1922 .
They simply notified the United Nations that they would be gone by May 15 , 1948 , and they left it to the U.N. to decide what it would do with the territory .
The U.N. voted to partition Palestine and create two states : one Jewish and one Arab .
Palestinians and Arab nations rejected the U.N. solution and waged war against the new Jewish state of Israel .
With the exception of Egypt and Jordan , they maintain a state of war with Israel 59 years later .
I believe we can be out of Iraq in a few months if we want to leave , departing by way of Turkey in the north and via Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and Jordan in the south and west .
We should leave to the Iraqi army the supplies and materials they need to protect themselves and we should arm the Kurds .
Common decency requires that we take with us those Iraqi civilians who helped us and would be in danger when we left .
We then should prepare for a battle on American soil with the Islamic forces of terror .
That battle could last at least 30 years .
The terrorists must be defeated for if , God forbid , they defeat us they will put us to the sword .
They refer to Christians , Jews , Hindus , Buddhists and other Muslims they disagree with religiously as infidels .
Remember the words of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed after he killed Danny Pearl on Feb. 1 , 2002 : “ I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew , Daniel Pearl , in the City of Karachi , Pakistan . ”
He is the same Khalid Sheikh Mohammed whom CNN referred to as “ the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks . ”
He is now in American custody .
Remember , they have threatened to kill Pope Benedict XVI .
Remember also how we refused to take seriously the threats Adolf Hitler made in his book “ Mein Kampf . ”
There were only 80 million Germans at the start of World War II .
There are now 1.4 billion Muslims .
While only a minority of Muslims subscribe to the Wahabist fundamentalist belief popular in Saudi Arabia that infidels must be killed , that minority of jihadists and their supporters still number in the tens of millions and is growing .
Wake up , America .
Ed Koch , former mayor of the city of New York , is currently a partner at Bryan Cave LLP .
" If you are the big tree , We are the small axe .
Sharpened to cut you down , Ready to cut you down "
The supreme court ruled today that the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from automobiles .
Justice John Paul Stevens , reading the majority opinion said that Co2 is a pollutant under the Clean Air Act , and that the EPA has shirked its duty by not regulating it .
In fact the court went so far as saying that the so called “ laundry list ” of reasons the EPA has given for why it has not regulated emissions so far are invalid and that it must come up with some better ones if it wants to continue to do nothing .
This ruling gives Massachusetts , California , Connecticut , Illinois , Maine , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington , the District of Columbia , Baltimore , New York City and a dozen environmental groups a legal basis for suing the EPA .
This is significant because in order to attain this standing the plaintiffs had to convince the court that there is an injury that can be traced to the defendantâ€™s behavior , and that the injury will be relieved by the action the lawsuit seeks .
In essence this presents a strong legal case for global warming as a harming agent .
“ EPAâ€™s steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to Massachusetts that is bothâ€ œactualâ€  and â€œimminent , â€ ( via , pdf of ruling ) wrote Justice Stevens .
Because the EPA did nothing to curtail this danger ( as it is required to under the Clean Air Act ) “ â€ œIts action was therefore arbitrary , capricious , or otherwise not in accordance with law , ” said Stevens .
To be clear the ruling does not say that green house gasses are a danger because they cause global warming , but it did say that the EPA can only choose not to regulate them if it can prove that they do not contribute to global warming .
If the EPA does try and show that greenhouse gas emissions from cars do not contribute to global warming it will be in the uncomfortable position of going against the majority of the worlds scientists .
Several friend of the court briefings were issued that suggested the EPA was guilty of trying to present more doubt about global warming than there really is .
This does n’t surprise me considering the White House has systematically lied about climate change , going so far as to change or edit scientific papers to make them fit the view espoused by the administration .
Senator John Kerry said ; â€ œItâ€™s an historic moment when the Supreme Court has to step in to protect the environment from the Bush administration .â€ ( via )
Which is deliciously ironic considering he is trying to block the nations first offshore wind farm in his own state .
Hypocrisy aside he is not alone in his views .
All of the front runners ( Democratic and Republican ) for the 2008 presidential election accept man made global warming and all have plans to do something to fix it .
They are all far from the Bush administration ’s view that the science is still not complete on global warming .
A majority of Americans also feels that global warming is a serious problem .
So where does this leave us ?
The ruling means that California will have an easier time of implementing its plan to limit Co2 from cars , and the EPA will have a much harder time dodging its duties to protect the environment .
With all major candidates for president ready to at least talk about fighting global warming , and some ready to tackle the problem head on , and the majority of Americans ready to do something about it , I feel that meaningful change has started to happen .
It ’s about damn time .
They say if you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water , it will , of course , frantically try to clamber out .
But if you place it gently in a pot of tepid water and turn the heat on low , it will float there quite placidly .
As you turn up the heat , the frog will sink into a tranquil stupor and before long , with a smile on its face , it will unresistingly allow itself to be boiled to death .
The security industry is much like that frog ; completely and uncontrollably in disarray – yet we tolerate it since we are used to it .
It is time to admit what many security professionals already know :
We , as security professionals , are drastically failing ourselves , our community , and the people we are meant to protect .
Too many of our security layers of defense are broken .
Security professionals are enjoying a surge in business and growing salaries and that is why we tolerate the dismal situation we are facing .
Yet it is our mandate , first and foremost , to protect .
The ramifications of our failure are immense .
The success of the Internet and the global economy relies on trust and security .
Billions of dollars of ecommerce opportunities are being lost due to inadequate security .
A recent survey of U.S. adults revealed that three times the number of respondents believed they were more likely to be victimized in an online attack than a physical crime .
A recent Gartner survey indicated that 14 % of those who had banked online had stopped because of security concerns , and 30 % had altered their usage .
People are simply losing trust in the internet .
The security community is not just failing in one specific way – it is failing across multiple categories .
It is being out innovated .
It is losing the digital battle over cyberspace .

Same thing occurs for automakers , why not software companies ?

May 10th , 2006 at 8:35 amVery entertaining and enjoyable paper … ( failure.php ) .
I think , however , from a universal user ( e.g. the home user ) perspective , security and security tools need a witch doctor more than a security professional .
The ritual and dogma surounding security tools , the advertisements filled with bovine fecal matter , and the layer upon layer of redundant firewalls , scanners , filters , detectors , alert mechanisms ….. ad nauseum leave users realing from security tools shock .
We as security professionals need to stop trying to come up with tools and techniques that protect the end user without their involvement and spend a little time trying to understand exactly what this user is capable of understanding .
Then provide tools that match that capability .
I believe most users ignore or improperly configure security mechanisms out of contempt or dismay , not lack of ability .
Our failure ( as professionals ) is in failing to understand the users capability and matching our user interface to that level of understanding .
I look forward to your next installment
Lester Bello Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 8:39 amAn interesting article indeed .
I agree with most of the said here .
It really is an impressive thing how a Systems Administrator can install a Windows server , enable IIS , plug it to the corporate network and think “ good job , buddy ” without even thinking on that little thing called security .
Far worse is the case of thos admins who plug the server to the Internet instead !
Another amazing thing : the green lights in the security websites .
I understand that most of people will not have the time or mental resolution to use a point - and - click exploit to damage someone else , but the mere fact that there is a chance to exploit a vulnerability is serious enough to make us run for a solution .
And I disagree with Jonathan Yarden .
It ’s not Microsoft ’s fault ( alone , I mean ) .
Yes , they ’re guilty of not testing their products enough , but they ’re not the only software maker in the world .
Most of the great incidents cited on the article would never happened with a SERIOUS security professional in the defensive lines .
Someone who understands anad accepts that security is a constant worry , and not just a patching - firewall .
AV thing .
It means constant care , constant monitoring , constant learning .
Security is just an illusion .
But diligence + learning = real security .

May 10th , 2006 at 8:40 amMicrosoft is only one of many contributors to the problem .
The fact is that the foundations of both our operating systems and the internet were built from naive assumptions that must be revisited .
In doing so , the means of establishing authenticity must be imported from centuries old processes of establihsing authoritative certification .
These processes have very little to do with technology .
The irony of the term “ certification authority ” says it all .
It refers to a piece of technology , with zero genuine authority , yet we trust it to put the lock icon on our browsers .
No wonder we ’re hosed .
We went on the assumption that authenticity could come from technology .

Dan Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 8:49 amIt is not the fault of Microsoft , Cisco , or whatver vendor of the day you want to blame .
The simple truth is most people fail to adequatey secure thier enviroment because they have no plan to manage it long term , no technical security architccture , and no real concept of what constitutes a security program .
This leads to lots of technology with no increase in security .
I do agree Information Security on a whole is failing .
But the solution does not start with technology !!!
It starts with Vision , Strategy , Proccess , Systems , -> solutions .
The Technology factor of securing an enviroment against the 80 % is less than 30 % of a Infosec Teams Job .
the remaining 20 % is targetes Business Based risk Assesments , Proccess mapping , working with PEOPLE .
However ,
It is rare that you will find an infosec team doing anything other than getting paid alot of money to stare at meaningless IDS alerts as they probably do n’t have a Incident Response plan or capability .

You are right on the money my friend .
This is exactly the problem with infosec today .
Even the author of this article does n’t REALLY get it – the real issue is the lack of a good foundation – sound policies , guidelines , practices and sufficient human resources , training and experience .

May 10th , 2006 at 9:50 amGreat article !
I do however have a hard time accepting total failure as a fellow security proffessional .
I think that security
proffessionals know EXACTLY how to secure a system – turn the computer off .
Unfortunately , this does n’t allow for much business to take place .
My point is that unfortunately in most cases , our main purpose is not actually to secure all information .
Our goal is to ENABLE THE BUSINESS … oh … and to do so as securely as possible within the constraints of money and time .
Microsoft makes money because it sells a product that is easily useable by default .
They are not in the market to sell the most secure operating system .
They are selling businesses the tools to just get the job done as quickly and easily as possible …period .
Do n’t get me wrong , I have a real problem with the kind of irresponsibility inherent in this way of thinking .
I am just saying that the people who sign the checks in most cases just do n’t care about fixing root security problems until it is WORTH it to them to change .
Welcome to capitalism .
The architects have built a boat full of holes from the very first plank .
We can plug those holes until we run out of fingers , but the reality is that it will never float until we rebuild it the right way .
I digress ….

White Badger Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 10:51 amWe have MANY fundamental issues to deal with here .
The OSs are deeply flawed .
The apps do n’t respect what security the OS provides , and open it up with its own vulnerabilities .
The software that is supposed to protect the other software closes most holes , but opens others .
I eagerly await the second part of this article .
I think the ultimate solution is to start from the ground up .
We need programming languages that are designed not to allow the majority of mistakes that lead to insecurities .
We need compilers that check for potential issues .
We need OSs that are designed for BOTH security and usability , which prevent apps from doing stupid things .
These OSs also need to be less monolithic , and more compartmentalized , to keep breaches that do happen from being able to affect the remainder of the system .
We need apps that correctly use the OS and respect its security structure .
Finally , we need to educate users , because NO security system in the world can protect a moron from him / herself .
Also … here ’s my question to this incredible mess we ’re in :
Why is the solution to broken software always MORE software and usually from someone else ?
Tim Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 10:58 amPeople are the reason we have a problem .
The people building the technology have neither the ability nor the desire to build it securely .
Fixing the technology only makes the Internet like power tools , leaving the onus on the people using the tools to be forever vigilant — something that does n’t happen for power tools and certainly wo n’t happen for “ friendly ” Internet applications .
And of course there are the people that attack , cashing in on a massive risk - reward imbalance .
Scale is the reason the problem is so bad .
Scale is an inherent feature of the Internet : millions of ( flawed ) applications , millions of potential victims , millions of potential attackers — all of which can interact with full capability from distant locations .
The effect is that a security flaw in an application is not at all like a safety flaw in a power tool ; it ’s likely that only one hand is lost at a time in that faulty table saw , but a typical security flaw allows the attacker to exploit millions of people at nearly the same cost as exploiting just one .
blank Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 11:17 amGreat article !
I ’m looking forward to part 2 .
I hope that one issue you address in the next part is the fact that security is so often undermined by market economics .
On the one hand , you ’ve got security always taking a back - seat to performance and other issues , where the people with the technical knowledge are restricted from implementing what they know are ‘ best practices ’ , because the client will only pay for what they can see .
So , for instance , the client will pay for a web application to be built in a fast language that does no type checking or security restriction ( e.g. php , perl ) rather than a strict language that would take longer to code in ( e.g. java ) .
On the other hand , there is the ‘ tragedy of the commons ’ effect , where the problems are significantly large , but the cost is distributed so widely that it is not in the interests of any single actor to take action to address the problem .
Vet Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 11:19 am “ I have to say that major changes scare me too .
But those changes definitely have to be made .
One issue that you do n’t mention is the possibility that many of the organizations that provide security related products DON ’T WANT it to change , and they are using their influence in some way to slow down major change .
If there are major changes to the Internet , and we have much higher security , then what happens to their revenue stream ?
Many of those people are smart enough to change with it , but I would say that they see an ever - growing market right now .
Maybe the conspiracy theorist is coming out in me , but I think it deserves to be looked at . ” Maybe I am just feeling paranoid right now .
P_Scotty Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 11:49 amThere is a simple cause behind the failure , and the cause is that same enabler allowing threats and compromise of systems to proliferate :
It ’s the money .
Security as a business innovates when there is a perception that profit can be attained .
The opposite number , organized crime ( call it what it is !!! ) , innovates TO MAKE MONEY .
The business of security , therefore , by its very nature , is REACTIVE .
It will always , therefore , exist in a state of failure .
How do we adjust ?
In other lines of business or acts of human endeavour , the needs of people or business or nations were the needs that spurred innovation ahead of the curve – the curve being defined as the goal of a society and the lack of enabling solutions to reach that goal .
If a society or nation or business finds that their endeavours are failing due to a lack of IT security , innovation will outstrip the ‘ dangerous neighborhood ’ of the internet .
P_Scotty Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 11:49 amWhen we needed to get goods to the West Coast of the US , the railroads expanded .
When we needed to expand our markets to the mideast using the expansion of democracy to do so , we built the Great White Fleet .
When Europe ran out of places to sell their trinkets , they went to China and sailed the Atlantic ocean .
The innovations of tanks , nuclear weapons , jet aircraft and other tools of ’ security ’ were driven by the mass disruptions of economic freedoms .
Economy drives innovation .
Nothing else .
Ben Strother Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 12:01 pmNoam , Sadly nothing you described was new to me .
We have had problems with information security as long as we have had information .
Even CISOs of fortune - 500 companies are struggling to get the money , people , processes and technology they need to protect their company ’s information assets .
It is true that the skill required to perform attacks has decreased , and the number of attacks have increased , but there is research being done to respond to this challenge .
It will not come from the vendors that are selling products today , but the researchers that are building the protocols and services of tomorrow .
When attacks can be filtered off the network , services can degrade gracefully then fail - over , and we have moved from simple defense to prevention we will see real improvements in information security .
Even then , you need to total approach , not just a technology magic bullet , the people , processes and funding all need to be there for security to be possible .

May 10th , 2006 at 1:14 pmI think that the fundamental problem is the thought that computers / software are simple and for everybody .
The reality is that is all very complex , especially when you connect it all .
Most people know nothing about it , they just want to use it , click on a button and it should run .
Even most ( / all ) specialists know only part of the complex picture .
Meanwhile businesses develop hardware / software that must be �?´ affordable �?´, etc. so developing and especially testing is subject to business demands , project cuts , decisions by unable managers , etc .
Testing and security are mostly costs for businesses and allways underestimated .
So , with an underestimated foundation ( simple and for everybody ) and building blocks with holes , I think most security experts do a very good job juggling their parts .
The complexity will only get worse , with more and more other equipment connecting .
Users will always want easy to use systems , but fortunately are also starting to get educated slowly and little by little .
With all the attention testing and security get more and more attention , but never enough .
Where will this all lead to ?????
I don� ?´t know , that �?´s another reason why it is fun to be into IT .

margalit Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 1:52 pmI think it ’s interesting reading all these comments that talk about blaming someone or something for the mess we ’ve gotten outselves into .
I see it differently .
As the internet grew and evolved , changes were made to the population of users , and to the vision of the ‘ net from a place where professionals and scientists shared information , to a place where people can now share unwholesome material .
It ’s obvious that the net is n’t working anymore .
A concept of being InDoors , where there are people whose identities have been authenticated by a professional ( not corporate or governmental ) organization , where biometrics are used on mobile devices to authenticate users , where the environment is secure within an organization , and where information is only shared with other authenticated organizations is the way to go .
Let all the reprobates remain outdoors in the wild west of the internet , but provide privacy , authentication and security to those that choose to go InDoors .
Dano Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 2:03 pmGood read , thank you .
A couple of points that I feel need to be mentioned .
Learning Curve –
There is a ‘ell of a lot of software out there , majority with different configurations , poor default settings , and inadequate documentation .
In order to properly administer a typical departmental server you need to have a solid understanding of all of the services / programs that it uses .
Just because you can pass a multiple choice test does n’t mean you ’re qualified .
Time –
There is never enough of it .
Workload increases and you ’re expected to produce quantifiable results .
As a result , it gets done just not done right .
Inertia – “ We ’ve always done it this way , there has n’t been a problem , so we do n’t need to change . ”
Until something explodes , then run around like a chicken with it ’s head cut off , blame someone else for it , and implement poorly thought out policies that actually make things worse .
Money –
We want a secure server farm by next Tuesday , here ’s $ 100 .
( Although this is getting better ) Authority – Should n’t have to spend a week convincing 10 managers and department heads that a critical patch / fix really needs to be done .
Security is n’t a destination , its a continually evolving process .
Thanks again , and I ’m looking forward to part II .
Carcarius Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 2:12 pmInfosec is best realized when you carry a low profile .
The individuals who get their systems hacked into ( residential users ) are those who are openeing up unknown attachments , going to places on the web they probably should n’t be going to , and generally being lackadaisical about what they are doing over the web .
Users can be their own worst enemy .
Businesses get attacked on an hourly basis because there is obviously money in it .
A market for criminal activity .
As many people have said already the Internet was never conceived to be inherently secure .
Neither has software up until now .
We security professionals are the stop - gap measure .
Unless we can completely strip out the Internet and rebuild it from scratch we will always have these problems .
I do n’t know if we will EVER move to IP v6 in regards to the internet .
Let ’s just be happy that security professionals have an industry to call their own .
Let ’s face it a lot of the problems that curse humanity were created simply to provide business opportunities … or should I say evolved ?
Jeremy Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 2:44 pmI wrote this comment on reddit.com , but I felt it was appropriate to repost here :
Almost all of the failures he mentions have nothing to do with security profesionals .
They have to do with users being uneducated .
For example , in the “ failures are everywhere ” section : SPYWARE —
Even if the user had to specifically allow every piece of softare to be installed ( like on OSX ) , they will still get spyware , because they will allow ANY software to install on their system without reading what it is .
PHISHING —
There is no solution to this problem other than user education .
Users will enter their password into a phishing site no matter what measures the legitamite site takes to prevent it , even if they have one of the many toolbars that pops up and warns them that it is a phishing site .
I ’ve seen usability studies — they window pops up , they hit “ ok ” without reading it , and then enter their password anyway .
TROJANS & VIRUSES & WORMS — Admitedly this problem stems from poor OS security , but still , the typical delivery mechnisim of one of these things requires user interacation , and again , no matter what steps are taken , an uneducated user will double - click the executable , or click the “ awsome link ” they got in IM , or whatever .
SPAM —
The only reason spam works is because users actually respond to this stuff and buy things .
There are ways to compbat spam , but even the best baysian filters can’t filter messages out if you train your filter that you want to know more about penis enlargement .
BOTNETS — This is the same as Trojans .
The user will install anything asked no matter how obvious .
DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS — See BOTNETS .
The rest of the things mentioned do have to do with security personel failures , such as Patch Management , Web App Vulns , etc , but in a lot of cases , this has more to do with company politics than anything else .
In pretty much every large organization , even the financial ones , security people ’s recomendations are ignored on a daliy basis in the name of “ business needs ” — ie .
the business is willing to take the risk because it is not profitable to fix the problem .
One day , perhaps the CxO ’s will learn …
CurtW Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 3:06 pmThere are a lot of practical day - to - day solutions to meeting this challenge , but I ’d like to go a step deeper and talk about what I see as the roots of the problem .
If a criminal wants to knock you down and steal your money , they will find a way .
The criminal element of our world is just recently finding it ’s larger - scale footing in the world of computer - land .
One response to crime in the physical world is laws and law enforcement , including a prison system that does n’t even pretend to offer rehabilitation .
Computer - land invokes new potentials for the same human sickness to manifest and it ’s no suprise .
We wo n’t easily solve the problems of the world and resolve the damages of short - sighted socio- economic systems that define life for many .
But we still have to try to see the bigger picture and get some context from it , in my opinion .
The security companies indeed make plenty of money off of the problem , however the IT security industry is merely a response to a stimulus .
Some have speculated that this same industry is not going to destroy itself by truly solving the problem , but can you imagine what it would be like if the tools and options provided by the industry were unavailable ?
I ’d rather have some kung - fu skills while walking down the dark street than not .
I believe that we as a society can make progress , but we wo n’t fully solve this problem .
It ’s a reflection of human nature .
Significant progress can only happen through a concerted effort that crosses multiple areas – policy , process , people , legal , educational , law enforcement , financial , technical , etc.
People need to recognize the value and risk potential in their data and computing resources and act accordingly to reduce those risks while still trying to stay afloat within the general constraints that have been mentioned in the other commentary on this page .
Not the easiest job in the world .
We ’ve got our work cut out for us .
I am primarily a technologist by training and job history , and just one piece in the puzzle to helping provide better information security at my campus .
Since security is primarily a “ people problem ” we ’ve got to consider the roots of the problems , instead of just applying another layer of band - aids .
Band - aids serve a valid purpose but if each patch represented a band - aid , every computer in the world would be a large stack of band - aids layered over one another in a messy ball .
Perhaps there is a better way , but I ’m not holding my breath just yet .
Rob Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 3:12 pmThough I agree with many points in your article , I have to point out that one statistic you use is a bit misleading .
Yes , losses due to cyber - crime are the highest ever , but at the same time internet usage is also at the highest ever .
If you wanted this statisic to be meaningful you would need to show that losses due to cybercrime are growing faster than worldwide internet adoption .
Ben Ricker Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 4:18 pmThere seems to be a bit of a non-sequitor going on here : you go through a laundry list of new technologies to protect data and implement security , then say “ But look at all the brak-ins ! ”
You seem to be arguing that all these new technologies are not protecting us .
Logically , however , the question is : are the companies USING these technologies and out of those , how many of them are still getting popped ?
You are mixing up the classes of everyone and everyone WHO FOLLOWS GOOD SECURITY PRACTICES .
In the laundry lists of incidents , I know that a couple of them were within areas that had poor security practices .
They were NOT using all these new technologies in the right manner .
The honeypot point fails to convince for the same reason : out - of - the - box configs on servers are BAD security practices : the used the default security settings .
I am not saying that your main point , that info security has failed us , is incorrect .
It is just that you have not SHOWN that this is the case .
I also think Connie Sadler ’s point is right on : security professionals are not gods dictating from on high .
Mostly , we are fighting tooth and nail for GOOD security practices across the enterprise ( and we tend to lose the battles tragically often ) .
And note that ONE failure can be the difference between GOOD security and the next screaming headline .
L33tman Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 4:40 pmSecurity is a business problem and not a technical problem .
If businesses would approach security like any other risk to the business , we would not be where we are today .
Most businesses deal with security as a technical problem and technology drives the business as opposed to the other way around .
Unless we fix these basic things , security risks will never be managed to an acceptable level in smart way that supports the overall business need .

Jason Muskat Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 6:11 pmMost of the time , security , any security , is about bringing that feel good feeling to the customer ; having somebody to blame when something goes bad is a plus as well .
Real security is very rare as it costs a lot .
Most people think they are secure because of a policy , or something just as silly like a sign on the wall .
I think it is imperative that government set and regulate minimal real information security standards especially in sectors that provide essential services such as power , telecomm , and banking , and such .
The regulations will allow the security people to enforce security despite a line of business not wanting to ‘ implement ” a secure solution .
People are still building new applications and workflows that use telnet and refuse to use SSH or any secure other secure methods such as telnet over SSL .
iorta Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 6:37 pmGreat article !
It conveys what many have known in the information security community for a long time , in a way that may be easier for the general population ( and policy makers ) to understand .
The frog analogy is great .
I suggest that any solution , as most these days , will deal with cost , lawyers , and insurance companies , and perhaps legislation .
The bodies of individuals and information security programs litter the path behind us .
There have been many that have clamored , screamed and championed information security since the 1960s .
A valued acquaintance and inspiration , Peter G. Neumann , often told me at dinner or lunch about told me of the security issues with Multics , so this is nothing new .
Demanding security for securityâ� ?��?�s sake has not been successful as we are often a reactive society , not one that prepares for the future .
Weâ� ?��? �re also a society that values convenience and features over security .
Itâ� ?��? �s that security is not often viewed as a valuable feature , and industry is in business for providing value because thatâ� ?��?�s how they make money .
Iâ� ?��? �d argue that we have come a long way .
Security awareness has improved due to those bodies in the path behind us .
The problem is that the rate of adoption of technology features and conveniences is far outpacing our value of security and our ability to provide that security .
Another problem is that weâ� ?��? �re not able to maintain security once it is installed .
Things change too fast and the organizational and operational realities are not considered that will allow security to endure more than months to moments .
Because weâ� ?��? �re reactive , something large will have to happen that is widely and significantly inconvenient or alarming .
Weâ� ?��? �ve not yet seen that â� ?��? cyber Pearl Harbor.â� ?�I hope that your follow - on article addresses not only what we SHOULD do ( because there are a lot of ideas already out there on that topic ) , but practical approaches that we must take to make this happen in a practical world .
You might address money , lawyers insurance companies , and legislation .
Yaa 101 Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 8:43 pmYou are failing because it is not a technical problem but a social or better said , an a -social engineering problem .
It means that life has catched up upon internet and that crooks and swindlers have found their place inside the environment .
To be honest , most of them would be able to swindle your money if they would be standing next to you at some party .
Do n’t kid yourself into thinking that you are able to see through those things , only very schrewd thinking people are capable to a thing like that taking place before it ’s too late .
The problem is that most swindlers do not look like your typical archetype of crook , if one exsists at all .
Most swindlers are very charming sociable easy going people ( except for your average 319′er ) and mostly are decloaked too late .
What makes you think that rules of the game of life are different online than offline ?
To have scams succeed you need various ingredients which are available in abundance .
You need greed , groupthink , social moronity and fraudulent minds at the victim side and charm , persuation , knowledge and fraudulent minds at the offender side .
Sorry to say but the whole technical aspect here is irrelevant , the level of corruption in most socities right now in the 21st century is too high to be able to stop all this crime from happening .
There are too many holes in society itself and these are not solvable with tech .
The problem of our societies are the politicians in the 20th century that made a spagetty mess of of our books of law to accomodate their petty political purposes .
You can see by the amount of lawyers in your country how your previous governments and chambers thought of you as citizens .
More lawyers mean more complex laws were fabricated and that alone is a contempt of public .
This makes most laws unenforcable in most circomstances but lethal when used with precision in abnormal circomstances .
Laws are mostly made complex for few reasons like for the executive branch to be able to hide behind obscure articles of law and also to criminate all comon people mostly without them knowing .
To get back to a technical solution of our problem of insecure networks , part of the problem is that some think they can promise a secure network .
Probably the same types that believe in a makable society like socialists , fascists and stalinists , which makes up most big business management and corrupt politicians in power for the last century and at this moment .
They come up with perverse things like DMCA DRM Trusted computing or what ever flavour of du jour .
The solution is as old as the problem crime just takes a part of economy , period .
No ifs and no buts , this has been reality and always will be , even under the most oppressing rule you can find .
So accept that networks are unsafe , networking between people on parties or other arrangements are as unsafe .
Make sure that whatever is stolen is small like in micro payments , make sure most people do n’t need all of their money online .
Oh yes , a last word of note : KILL all the administrators of critical networks that coupled their networks to the internet , this is shortsighted bean counting that can cost all of our society their lives .
Thanks for listning ,

Rick Wash Says :
May 10th , 2006 at 8:47 pmYou assume that zero security problems is the end goal .
This assumption is behind the fact that you are using a list of current security problems as evidence that we are failing .
Zero security problems IS possible .
Though I am pretty sure that nuclear holocost is too high of a price to pay for it .
What we need is to find the right balance between how difficult the security problems are to solve ( the cost ) and the benefits of actually solving those problems .
Look at the credit card industry .
Zero fraud is n’t their goal — they accept a certain amount of fraud as a cost of doing business .
But they have managed to keep the fraud at acceptably low levels that its not causing a serious problem to anyone .
That said , I think current information security practices are failing .
I think that we should be working harder on security to reduce the problems , since the costs we pay in securiy are still far less than the problems we are encountering .
The real problems I see in security are two : 1 .
People are myopic and nearsighted .
When asked whether they should take the hard ( security ) road now , or take the easy road and risk huge problems in the future , they tend to take the easy road and the risk , and keep getting burnt by it .
We need to learn to think more long - term .
2 .
People still see security as something that can be separated from the rest of systems .
That is the essence of ’ security professionals ’ and ’ security software ’ .
First we set up everything like we want it to work .
Then we put some tools and people in place that try to keep it running that way .
That ’s not the way security works .
Just like a firewall wo n’t really prevent people from exploiting the latest Microsoft vulnerability , security professionals can’t make insecure setups suddenly secure .

May 10th , 2006 at 9:02 pmIf you ’re going to be a heretic and point out the truth about the Emperor ’s new clothes :-) , you might as well go whole - hog and pin the blame for all these problems where 90 % of it belongs : Microsoft .
A lot of people will claim that ’s not fair , that it ’s too facile , that it ’s not Microsoft ’s fault ( it ’s the * bad guys ’* fault ! ) , that security is a * really hard * problem that Microsoft could n’t be expected to get right , that Microsoft ’s only problem is its popularity , that if the other , allegedly more secure platforms ( Linux , Mac OS X ) were as popular as Windows is , the bad guys would be targeting them and showing up just as many problems with them , too .
But as anyone who truly understands security will tell you , all those claims are bogus .
It * is* possible to do a better job , a much better job , on computer security .
We ’ve known how to for 20 or 30 years .
We ’ve known , for example , how to compartmentalize code , so that only critical OS code runs with full permissions , and that the majority of less - critical code runs in a restricted environment where it ca n’t do as much damage .
But Microsoft never really cared about any of that , and they very successfully implicitly trained a whole and much larger generation of computer users that security and other problems are mostly inevitable and have to be lived with , like bad weather or something .
As a wise man once said , “ Other computer companies have spent years working on fault - tolerant computers .
Microsoft has spent its time more fruitfully , working on fault - tolerant * users * ” Now that people are finally starting to demand some real security , it is in many ways too late : too many of the fundamental design decisions which underlie the insecurity are now utterly entrenched , and ( apparently ) ca n’t realistically be changed .
The most obvious example of the utter culpability of Microsoft software when it comes to security problems is : e-mail viruses .
Where is it written that an executable attachment should be executed when you “ open ” it ?
Why is it the * user ’s* responsibility to decide which attachments are safe ( plain data ) and which are dangerous ( executable code ) ?
The computer knows this , it ca n’t get confused by tricks to hide the filename , so why does n’t it just refuse to execute the executable attachments ?
But somehow this straightforward solution is never adopted , evidently because there are one or two people who need to be able to click and run programs that they receive as email attachments but which are n’t viruses .
Instead we run around deploying reactive “ antivirus ” tools that , as you ’ve correctly pointed out , can never be perfectly reliable .

I see it , the problem is simple –the Internet , or Arpanet in the old days , was designed in a time & place when everyone trusted each other .
The US government , US military , US research labs , US universities & US military contractors were all that used Arpanet and the early Internet .
Hence the .gov .mil .org .edu & .com top level domains .
Security was not an issue , as no one else was on the system !
Since security needs were never designed into the system , they ’ve all been patches applied later .
As someone recently pointed - out ; “ The US government paid millions to develop the Internet , then decided out of the goodness of their hearts to allow the whole world to use it for free ” … R i g h t , sure they did … just after they realized it was the easiest way to spy on the whole world .
Some of the big data thefts ( or misplacements ) have been off - line , huge paper piles lost in the mail or by couriers like UPS , DHL or FedEx .
Most people handling this type of data now realize that secured transmission makes more sense than physical shipping .
But still do n’t store it encrypted by default .
Because people tend to be lazy they think encryption is hard , and to be fair , it used to be–just ask those of us who tried PGP 1 or 2 .
The quickest solutions would seem to be :1 ) Move to an all - encrypted Internet .
No more http , only https .
Do n’t just encrypt the check - out page at amazon or ebay , but SSL encrypt EVERY page .
All email must be digitally signed & encrypted–if it ’s not , bounce it back to the sender ( virtually no spam or hishing –instantly ! ) .
2 ) Windows handles Admin / User very poorly !
Users ca n’t install software or do much of anything , so almost everyone on the system is an “ Administrator ” ; which allows all the evil software a way to install .
Linux / BSD type systems handle this much better : Everyone logs in as a user , if Administrator ( Root ) privileges are need , the computer simply asks the user for the Root ( Administrator ’s ) password .
Evil software simply can’t sneak - in undetected unless you ’re running as Administrator . –

May 10th , 2006 at 10:57 pmThis is probably the single most compelling article I have read on the topic / issue .
Well done .
I personally like to think of the Internet as a parallel universe , a cyber - world as opposed to the real - world .
In cyber - world people do thing much the same as in the real - world , such as chat , work or go shopping .
And as in the real - world , there are dangers .
In the real - world we spend years as children learning about this world and all its dangers before we can safely go out on our own .
This is not the case in cyber - world .
People wonder into cyber - world as cyber - toddlers or even cyber - infants .
How can these people are expected to look after themselves in this strange new world ?
I know Iâ� ?��? �m reiterating some other peopleâ� ?��? �s comments , but I believe education must be the first step to computer security .
Cyber - world is too complex and dangerous to jump into without understanding the dangers .
Cyber - world is not as safe as the real - world .
Itâ� ?��?�s much the wild west with outlaws running rampant .
But the wild west was tamed .
Maybe if we look out how it was tamed , weâ� ?��? �ll get an idea of how to tame our cyber - wild west .
I submit the idea that greater law enforce is needed .
Software can only do so much .
No matter how secure real or cyber property is , there is always a way to break in .
We have police in the real - world , why shouldnâ� ?��? �t we have police in the cyber - world ?
Criminals need to be apprehended and punished and we need real - people ( not just software ) to do this .
I realise I havenâ� ?��? �t addressed the problem who will fund this education and police force , but I hope it provides a new way of looking at the problem .
Erik Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 12:22 amLike they say , if the engineering / building / public safety industies were like the software industries , it would be a common orrurance for buildings to collapse , bridges to fall , and backup plans to fail .
This is just a perfect example of how the desire to crank out new software and features leads to a failure to look at the fundamnetal security ‘ infrastructure ’ upon which the feature is built .
Subsequently , we get patches upon patches , and even patches to cover up previously inaediquate patches for nearly the same issue .
Security is messed up these days .
Yutivo.org Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 1:02 amMost of the facts in the article are absolutely true .
There is really a failure somewhere .
Let us all face it .
Information Security is as strong as the weakest link .
Every information security professional presents to management a listing of risks affecting the organization .
These risks are then assigned costs : Cost of Risk and Cost to Mitigate Risk .
Each manager is then faced with the decision to either mitigate or ignore the risk .
The problem with information security is that there are certain threats that are just too expensive to mitigate .
Threats that involve Acts of God , lazy people , other peopleâ� ?��? �s software , network and infrastructure are particularly hard to solve .
In then end , people just ignore these risks .
Then a weakest link is made available for exploit .
Then security fails .
Another problem with securityâ� ?��? �s weakest link is about people , entities or organizations not willing to invest in information security .
These people , entities and organization then become vulnerable and later become vectors for attack .
These may not even belong to ones organization or is beyond administrative reach .
If a vendor refuses to patch a security exploit in their softwareâ� ?�¦
If thousands of home computers are transformed into mindless spambotsâ� ?�¦
How is one organizationâ� ?��? �s information security people supposed to solve all the worldâ� ?��? �s information security problems ?
I disagree with the article in saying that this failure is due to lack of innovation .
There are always new and novel ways of dealing with information security problems .
Most of these are even solvable with current technology .
Instead , I believe the failure is because of our inability to cost - effectively apply information security consistently across the entire infrastructure and dependent networks .
But , is this reasonable to expect in this age of well interconnected networks ( such as the Internet ) ?
Can we secure every part of it ?
The only secure system is one that is powered down , disassembled , boxed , vaulted , sealed and blasted into another universe .
Even then , what if aliens exist and send the system back â� ?�¦
Pipboy Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 1:03 amIt would be good if schools could integrate security courses and topics into the curriculum of computer science , information systems and management - related courses to raise the awareness regarding information security .
too many students are coming out of college knowing a lot on what and how to setup businesses and information systems , but little on why and how to protect them .
Yes , they might know that they have to protect their intellectual property , but framing â� ?��? virtual assetsâ� ?� with a â� ?��? brick - and - mortarâ� ?� business perspective usually limits the security measures down to patents and security guards .
crude and effective , but insufficient .
information security as a part of TCO rarely comes to mind .
in addition to that , most startups skip information security to cut down on costs .
as they grow bigger , these companies then play an expensive game of information security catch up .
Wyuwp Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 1:08 amMost companies do not see the information security risks until they are faced by it .
Most people will think that TCO is the problem of the big corporation .
here are some classic TCO - bites - my - back problems for SMEs : No anti-virus , anti-malware , or firewall software .
This normally translates into loss productivity when workstations are taken out by these malware .
Spam is also another items that can be added here as people spend more and more time filtering spam than reading valid email .
No investment for PC upgrades .
This also translates into loss productivity .
As workstations fail , companies spend more and more time fixing them .
This is why desktop support is rarely a problem when companies start - out .
But , it becomes a major problem when companies grow .
No Perimeter Protection .
It is typically difficult to invest in workstations protection for all the workstations .
One of the most basic things a company can do is enable firewalling in their DSL routers .
No Use Education on Information Security .
This is the single most important aspect of information security .
As a greater number of exploits are targeted to people and not machines .
There are many more cases of SME - technology - hits - me - in - the - head problems .
It would definitely help if students were aware of these even before they hit the streets and the halls of Makati .
NoticeBored Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 3:46 amThe first part of your article is already part of the solution – it ’s an excellent summary of current information security risks .
The sheer breadth of issues we face is an eye - opener , and that to me is the first step towards finding a workable solution .
People who do n’t appreciate the risks are unlikely to even address them , let alone solve them .
There are three obvious ways to open their eyes :
(1) Scare them witless with articles like yours .
Surveys such as the DTI ’s latest UK survey provide statistics to back up the conjecture and assessment .
The news headlines are full of this stuff .
( 2 ) Educate them , raise their awareness and motivate them .
By “ them ” , I really mean “ us ” ( I learn new stuff every day ! ) .
I do n’t just mean awareness programs that address the clueless general public : it ’s just as important to educate IT professionals about information security , and “ management ” as a third category with their own specific information needs and hot buttons ( did anyone mention SOX yet ?
Or HIPAA ? Or data protection ? ) .
( 3 ) Let them suffer .
Once bitten twice shy .
Speaking personally , I truly learned the value of backups when I lost some irreplaceable photographic images .
Now I ’m a backup freak with multiple on - and off - site backups , but I sleep better .
Metrics and instrumentation of security are the key to helping people appreciate the extent and cost of security incidents that happen all the time .

AllOSVulnerable Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 7:31 amThe problem is you focused your examples too much on Windows .
Linux and MAC are also vulnerable .
Most of the backend systems that are manually hacked are misconfigured or unpatched Linux systems .
Once Linux becomes the desktop for the non-techie …
It will be like a MAC or Windows system in that it will have lots of holes punched in it .
Software is inherently insecure .
We just have to accept that fact .
Tim Bilbro Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 8:07 amEntertaining article .
Although I think you are just a little over the top declaring an entire profession a failure .
Keep in mind all of the problems you are outlining can be prevented , and are being prevented on highly secure networks .
Unfortunately , in order to secure a network , you must remove capabilities and access .
The problem is that industry has seemingly made a decision to ignore security concerns in the name of progress and easy access .
Sometimes , unfortunately , in order to secure something , you have to make it less accessable .
But , there is so much push back from non-security types on that .
It is not the security pro who is driving that decision .
Until it really hurts an industry financially to move forward with lax security , InfoSec breaches are a cost of doing business .
Also keep in mind that cybercrime still represents a small portion of crime as a whole .
I think your measuring stick is too high .
Just because there are security breaches does not mean that the industry is failing .
You would not say that the law enforcement profession is failing because there are crimes being committed .
To carry the analogy a bit further , if your neighborhood were full of crime , you would do everything you could to move out .
Do n’t let your data live in a bad neighborhood .

Kenneth Searl Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 8:21 amNOAMâ� ?��?�s article is right on .
I believe a significant part of the issue with regard to security is the lack of acceptance of innovative products by the security professionals .
Best practices have not worked as Noam is suggesting .
In 2002 I was new to the security space and looked at security as an outsider .
As Noam states on insider threats , traditional perimeter solutions just donâ� ?��? �t work .
There are better ways of looking at security and Iâ� ?��?�m sure there are many creative innovations in other areas , but until the security professional can take the chance on a solution beyond â� ?��?

UberMonkey Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 8:57 amThe underlying issue is human psychology ; people are basically trusting .
It does n’t really matter how much we overhaul the technology .
Much of information security does n’t involve a computer .
Humans write the code , answer the phone , open the front door and sign on the dotted line .
Paranoia , even when justified , takes too much effort to sustain .
It is stressful to be paranoid .
As long as people think the world is a safe place they will be vulnerable – and they will convey that vulnerability to every aspect of their lives .
Humans do n’t usually wise up until after they have been victimized .
To fix the problem , we have to teach people to override their basic human tendancy to blindly trust others .
But , the social ramifications could get interesting …

Security Professional Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 1:56 pmGreat article .
However , I think you need to be careful on whom you place the blame .
The article at first glance faults on the thousands of security professionals whose job it is to stem the tide of vulnerabilities and threats .
However , these professionals are not the ones writing the swiss cheese software .
The fact of the matter is that if applications and operating systems were designed securely form the start , then the majority of these issues would n’t exist .
Brian Smithson Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 2:09 pmHi Noam , There is much in your paper that I can agree with .
The state of infosec is pretty awful .
But at the same time , it ’s working pretty well .
Honestly , if you look at the complexity of computers and the Internet and the naivete of the average user , and also consider that the Internet is performing functions that it was never intended to do , I ’m amazed that it all works even half as well as it does .
But I ’m also left wondering how those average users manage even to keep their computers running , much less be expected to keep them secure .
So I agree that there is much to do , and I can even agree that there is much to do in every category of infosec .
However :- I would n’t characterize it as a total failure .
Billions of transactions are successfully executed every day on the Internet , just as they are over the phone , by mail , and in person .
Millions of people use the Internet every day and protect themselves from attacks , just as they do when driving their cars or walking around in the physical world .
On the Internet , as everywhere else , there is a certain amount of risk associated with doing anything .
The question one should ask is , is the risk associated with doing things on the Internet significantly greater than doing things elsewhere ?-
I would n’t place the blame on complacency of infosec professionals , or at least not the ones I know .
The people I work with try to fix every security issue they can , too often fighting against the wishes of management , data owners , and end users .
I might fault some infosec professionals for lacking sensitivity about how dealing with security ( or lack thereof ) effects people who are n’t either computer professionals or security professionals .
I might fault some infosec professionals with treating all security issues equally , without risk analysis .
But complacency ?
I ’m sure there are examples , but I would n’t say that complacency is the primary cause of our security problems . -
I would n’t characterize infosec problems as being unique to the Internet .
People have stolen PINs by putting false front panels on ATM machines , phishing can take place over the telephone , extortion via DOS attack in the physical world is called a “ protection racket ” , identity theft can be accomplished by rummaging through the victim ’s trashcan , every day my postal mailbox contains about 90 % spam and includes letters that appear to be important notices from the government or about my mortgage , non-computer passwords such as ATM card PINs or “ mother ’s maiden name ” authentication has always been easy to guess , physical locks are easy to pick , telephones are easy to tap , alarm systems are easy to defeat , and people are generally good - natured but gullible targets of all sorts of scams outside of the Internet .
Granted , the Internet has made some crimes much easier to accomplish — phishing , for example — but it can also make such crimes easier to solve .
If someone talks me out of my PIN and then empties my bank account at the ATM , law enforcement will have much less to go on than if my PIN was obtained through phishing and my bank account was emptied electronically .
I think we can learn a lot from our counterparts in non-infosec security , and vice versa .
My main problem with your paper is that absent of part 2 , it reeks of the kind of scare - mongering whitepaper that does little more than drum up more infosec consulting business and fails to resolve any of the broader issues that it raises .
After 25 + years in the industry , I did n’t need a wake - up call ; I ’ve been wide awake since roughly 1981 .
If your intention was to communicate a call - to - arms and establish a forum for discussing and finding solutions as a group which you would then publish , then I applaud your effort .
But I think that you should have stated that intention .
As written , your paper makes a well - worn case for how bad things are , and promises solutions in Part 2 .
I have to question whether you , or any individual , can deliver on such a promise .
Kenton Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 2:51 pmFrom http://www.securecomputing.ca/?p=41:Well, hereâ� ?��? �s an interesting article for you to read .
After my initial feeling of being insulted , I setled in and read the article .
This is only part one and my criticism would be , and security professional knows all of the things heâ� ?��? �s talking about , that he doesnâ� ?��? �t give us any solutions to fix the problems .
Apparently this will come in “ Part 2 ″ and I question whether he has the answers yet or is waiting to get feedback on his article and build some answers from that .
Iâ� ?��?�m not going to go into a long diatribe here ; suffice it to say there are many ways to solve the problems , some of which will never be attainable and others which may help .
The fact still remains ; the IT Security field is constantly in a reactionary state .
This puts security professionals at a disadvantage from the start and leaves them open to widespread criticism .
There is no easy way to change this .
IT security needs to be implemented with a holistic approach .
You canâ� ?��? �t solve the problem with technology alone , you need policies and procedures , and above all else , education .
Any company that installs a bunch of security technology without going through the rest of the excercise will inevitably end up with some kind of security incident .
Bruce Schneier said â� ?��?
Security is a process , not a productâ� ?� and too many people are still missing his point .
Yes we need the technology and very often that has to be implemented first , however thatâ� ?��?�s not the end of securing your company , it is just one small piece .
I look forward to installment number two in this series and hope that there are some genuinely helpful and effective suggestions .
David Emerson Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 3:53 pmNoam ,
I think you ’ve done a great job of “ making a list ” here , complete with bibliography .
You ’ve named and described many major security issues that are plaguing computers today — including many of the political and professional problems surrounding these issues .
What was really missing was specificity about which computers are effected and why — throughout the article , I was unsure whether you were referring to computers in general , or only to computers running Microsoft Windows .
Which computers are so insecure ??
Squarely on the Windows side is Active - X. Leaning in the same direction are Vulnerabilities in Security Software , and most spyware , viruses , and other parasites ( though an ignorant GNU / Linux or Mac user could easily install spyware on his / her own computer — it ’s just not quite as easy to do so right now in 2006 . )
On the other side of the spectrum ( well , some of these are kind of in the middle ) you mention Internal Attacks , Passwords , Encryption , Wireless Access Points , Phishing , Spam , and zero - day exploits , all of which are pretty OS - neutral ( right ? )
Of course if MS takes too long to make a patch for a known exploit , they deserve criticism , but they ’re by no means alone .
As far as I know , Botnets and DDoS exist mostly because masses of compromised windows zombie systems .
GNU / Linux and Mac systems are not completely immune to rootkits that could similarly enslave them , but do these Botnets * ever * use compromised non-Windows systems , and would it be easy to enslave them if Windows magically became more secure overnight ?
My inclination is “ no ” , but - I- do n’t know !
Of course , there ’s lots of interoperability between all these different platforms and applications due to the internet .
Spam goes to everyone regardless of what kind of computer they ’re using .
Warding off phishing attacks is no different from defending yourself against fraud — except that the internet allows much more anonymity for everyone including criminals ; insecure SMTP servers can easily make the initial contact that ’s so key to traditional fraud ; and international criminals can often circumvent the laws of the victim ’s country .
Botnets can attack any server running any OS .
What with this new ( lack of ) U.S. legislation , I ’m surprised not to have heard of any of the telecommunications companies talking about restricting outgoing ping floods .
I ’ll look forward to the follow - up !
~David .
John Howard Oxley Says :
May 11th , 2006 at 7:54 pmWhile I certainly do n’t disagree with this analysis , and certainly accept that there are lots of ’ causes ’ to be addressed , I think there is one thing missing : this form of crime is not only easy , but also apprehension rates are low , and punishments are far too light .
Technical solutions , and “ blaming the user ” only goes so far — we must have an effecient , effective , and proportionate system of punishing the wrongdoers [ I suggest kneecapping for a first offense ] if we are to make any progress on this at all .
Otherwise , security professionals are just walking around with a big “ Kick Me ! ” sign on their backs .
Nor do I underestimate the difficulty of doing this sort of thing , but if it ca n’t be done , then a case can be made for giving up the InterNet for commercial purposes .
Lohan Spies Says :
May 12th , 2006 at 5:11 amFirst of all i donâ� ?��? �t want to criticize any vendor for the security weaknesses in there products .
Each and every vendor has some vulnerabilities in their code waiting to be found by some security professional and exploited by some malicious programmer .
My view to address the security problems we face today would be to start by proactively increasing the awareness of how computers function in general to the internet community .
After a successful completion of the first step we could start with Security Awareness programs .
Successful Security Awareness programs address much of the vulnerabilities that exist in the security controls we use today .
Like antispam , antivirus , content filters etc.
Now and even more in the future , security awareness must be made the first step of general user training so that we can stop the simple problems we are facing today without implementing costly devices that try to mimic your users thinking !
Security Awareness is an ongoing program that needs to be updated with the latest and greatest out there and retraining the users as needed .
A computer cannot and will not be able to think like humans .
They might mimic the human brain , but it will never be 100 % reproduceable !
A human stays human and all humans make mistakes , unless they are trained before hand to know what to look out for .
Another concern is the size of patches .
Some users in Africa donâ� ?��? �t even have a 56 K internet connection , what about downloading 260 Mb for patching your system .
We must investigate , and find a simpler more sufficient way of developing and applying patches in the desired time frame !
M. W. Meyer Says :
May 12th , 2006 at 12:26 pmNice battlefield summary , sir .
There are two fundamental weaknesses to the corporate desktop that support the crimeware exploits – and crimeware is really the major problem my clients face today .
One we think about consciously – connection to the Internet .
In other words , if my customers disconnected from the Internet , most attacks disappear .
It IS very worthwhile to lead your client through an exercise to ask “ Why does your company need the Internet ? ”
Although literally impossible for most businesses , I look for solutions for my government clients that approach this goal as a limit , such as virtualization and appliances .
For example , separate machines for Intranet and Internet access , with either a physical or virtual airgap , vastly reduces exposure .
Then if a naive user selects a link that installs a trojan , that attack gains no ground because the victim machine has no connection into the corporate network because of a virtual sandbox ( e.g. , VMPLAYER appliance ) or a physical separation ( Internet Thin Client for surfing ) .
The other related vulnerability is even more problematic but less obvious – the multi- purpose operating system , whether it is Windows , Linux , or ReactOS .
Most crimeware attacks do n’t want to control your browser or email for it ’s their sake – the goal is to use these processes to deposit code to gain access to more interesting functions or data on the system .
By narrowing the function of the machine face exposed to the Internet to a single - purpose ( e.g. , browser appliance ) , the attack is chopped off at the knees .
On the human side , I would comment that our lack of tactical sense and cleverness as security professionals is our huge weakness .
With our standard network perimeters , we are like the football team that runs the same off - tackle play every down .
We use the frontal defense , never considering other tactical options – cover , deception , movement .
For example , most orgs would never consider a honeypot .
Like the HP does n’t really stop the traditional attackers of the 80’s and 90’s , whose goal was disruption , Crimeware attackers do n’t want to be discovered .
I can tell you from experience that deception is a counter tactic that makes corporate espionage attackers hesitate – because they are n’t quite sure how good you are .

Augusto Says :
May 12th , 2006 at 11:09 pmNoam Eppel wrote an article called “ Security Absurdity : The Complete , Unquestionable , And Total Failure of Information Security . ” that generated a lot of noise in the security community .
I decided to comment it in my blog too .
Yes , it ’s really too - FUD .
But it also has great points about things that are real .
Some of them are not always seen in other places , and I ’m glad to see that a lot of them are things that I ’m always reminding people about .
Among them are :- Antivirus signature based approach failure
– Trojans and backdoors targeted to specific companies and organizations
– Trojans that instead of stealing credentials just perform funds transfers after the user is authenticated ( I made a PoC presentation about it last year in CNASI ) .
I was impressed to know that there are real cases now
– 0 - days usage more common every day
– Internal attacks issues , one of the biggest motivators of my Master Thesis .
He used these facts to drain conclusions , some right , some wrong .
I agree that there is a raising complexity that makes security harder to do , that the cost of security controls is too high and that our “ best practices ” do n’t solve the problem .
This last one is one if my favorites , I have been saying that for some time .
I have a friend that is a penetration test specialist .
His approach gives him almost 100 % success rate , even in companies that have advanced security programs .
What is happening is that the main sources of information for the CSO , with their indications about most common threats , do n’t drive to solutions that could stop my friend ’s approach .
The “ by the book ” CSO will be a easy prey for him .
I believe that we need a deeper technical discussion about what we understand as “ best practices ” , making them more effective and clear .
When I say technical discussion I mean “ bring the good guys ! ” , specially those that are not related to off - the - shelf products vendors .
Have you ever noticed that the “ next biggest threat ” always fit in the features description of those just released blackboxes ?
Wow , so every new threat can be avoided just by buying them ?
Back to the article , I think that its qualities end here .
The author does not remember that our goal is not reaching 100 % security , but the security level needed to allow the business to keep going .
The “ it just need one single vulnerability to fail entirely ” approach is counting that defense in depth and compartmentalization are not being applied .
It ’s over reacting .
I also think that there too much confusion about “ home user ” security and corporate security .
Really , we need to improve a lot the security for the common home user , it ’s very hard to a non technical person to keep a computer secure .
But we ca n’t forget that we are not dealing with a common home appliance , like a refrigerator or a TV .
There is two - way communication , there are new features being deployed on the fly , from different sources .
The user has part of the responsibility to decide which features and which sources are safe , we ca n’t deny that .
If you want to drive your car in the streets you need to know that your safety depends not only on roads conditions or on your car safety features , but also on decisions and skills from you and other drivers .
It ’s the same thing with the Internet and computers in general .
There are still more deaths in car accidents than in wars !!
I do n’t think we are terribly failing in infosec as we are with traffic safety .
There is another thing .
Those numbers , increasing losses , frauds , etc .
I ca n’t say for sure as I have n’t made a extensive research , but I bet that when paper money or checks were introduced , the frauds grown wild .
As technology is gradually dominated the ways of making it secure evolve .
However , if the technology is evolving too fast there is not time to security to evolve .
It ’s natural .
Security systems created 10 years ago are not very effective today , but if we apply their current versions in the same problem for which they were created to , they would be almost perfect .
Let ’s try to imagine if the weapons evolution had happen in a much more accelerated form .
We should have spears , swords 6 months later , muskets in two years and grenades after 3 .
If we compare this with the infosec we would be trying to make hand shields stronger and complaining that they were not protecting us from the grenades .
First , it ’s necessary to make people in charge of security to know about it .
They know about products , not about security .
They think that they just need to build the lego with firewall + ids +ips+av blocks and everything is ok .
We need education , make them skilled professionals .
It can be dome with better training ( SANS ! ) , certifications , standards , code of practices , etc .
Second , user awareness .
Sorry Ranum , but I think it ’s more than necessary if our intention is to keep the flexibility and power in their hands .
We can replace all our cars by a public transportation system and drastically reduce the accidents .
Do anybody think this is possible ? 🙂
Third , product intelligence .
Keep running behind attacks , virus and Trojan signatures ??
This is too archaic .
The advantage of more frauds is that there will be more investments in security technology , bringing more money and brains to the research field too .
With this investment we can reduce the gap between state of art technology and the security tools available .
Fourth , demystify insecurity .
This not black or white , all or nothing , but the gray tone that each person or company can live with .
When you go out to the streets there is a risk of being robbed , murdered , victim of an accident .
These risks are , usually , getting higher every day .
Have you give up going out of your house because of that ?
Maybe you have changed some habits ( mitigating risk ) , but you accept that there is risk to keep doing what you need to do .
You go to the bank , there is the risk of someone who saw you withdrawing following you later to rob you .
You use the Internet banking , there is the risk of someone taking advantage of this .
Nothing changes .
People only need to be conscious that the problem exists in any situation , be it “ real ” or “ virtual ” .

May 13th , 2006 at 5:53 pmThis article is completely correct , and it ’s something I ’ve been telling people for years .
In computer security , quite simply , the bad guys are winning .
Do n’t kid yourself if you think you ’re actually safe online .
Even if you do everything right on your local computer , use good passwords , and play it safe , eventually , information about you , outside of your control , in some database somewhere that you ca n’t get away from , will fall into the wrong hands …

Ranum did for his “ 6 dumbest mistakes in computer security ” piece as well .
Entrenched vested interest groups always get defensive with change because they like to protect their learning investment and revenue stream .�?�
How do you think the whole industry would handle it if a new model of IT security arrived on the scene that made status quo technologies obsolete ?
Are they going to be happy ?
Not likely .
There are many who agree with you , as your comment board shows .
Others take a practical tact and say that although things are a mess , we have to find just good enough security .
Finally , some others are still in denial .
Yet I see the whole industry lining up behind Cisco and NAC and it will probably take about 10 years to get close to good enough .
Mike Fratto over at Dark Reading just said there is no real
business case for NAC , and it does not deliver real data assurance .
We are heading for even more crapola !

Koos van der Merwe Says :
May 15th , 2006 at 3:35 amI liked the article , but I think one point is missed : there is usually a trade - off between user - friendliness and security .
A 100 % secure system is impossible as long as people need to use it .
Every company / computer user will have to decide what level of risk is acceptable .
E.g. as mentioned by M.W. Meyer above … do n’t connect computers with critical private data to the internet !
I think it might actually be a good idea to let go of the internet for commercial purposes ( as John Howard Oxley suggested ) and rather create a “ new ” internet , with security designed into it from the start ( e.g. only allow “ secure ” / ” trusted ” nteworks to join it , running software that are certified as secure ( maybe only allow OpenBSD ;-) ) and that are not connected to the present Internet at all .
But will the users go for it ?
On the other hand AFAIK , bank transfers ( between banks ) has been done on ( older ) private networks not involving the internet … has that been 100 % secure ?
Pete Hillier Says :
May 15th , 2006 at 12:37 pmWhile I enjoyed the context of the peice , I found that all the author did was point the fear , uncertainty and doubt ( FUD ) issues at the security practitioners rather than the organizations who are responsible and accountable to a great extent for the level of security they can afford and want .
We all know that the assumption of risk is a balancing act at best that comes at the whim of the CXO ’s who either “ get it ” or not .
Frankly I do n’t believe it ’s all doom and gloom , nor would I point fingers in the direction of specific vendors , for example Microsoft .
To think Bill Gates has taken a couple of Billion dollars in security investment internally , directly from the bottom line , to placate us all is just silly .
If he can be blamed for anything , it ’s perhaps tardiness .
Barring all that , I look forward to reading the countermeasures .
Dietrich Says :
May 16th , 2006 at 6:37 amIt is unfortunate that IT companies do not associate economic power with responsibility .
Until such point that they are held accountable , why would they implement the necessary changes if it means it will make them less competitive .
It should be the Dells that ensure that all newly sold machines are patched upto the latest level .
It should be the Microsofts that DETECT and fix vulnerabilities in their own software .
It should be the Ciscos and the AT&Ts that block unwanted traffic .
At all levels , large and very profitable IT companies are making money from technologies , software and appliances they sell , security vulnerabilities included .
Surely we can start insisting on security from them .
If we do n’t , the loop will continue to feed itself : the bigger the problem gets , the more products they ’re going to sell , and with that the problem get ’s even bigger …
On the other hand … we cannot complain , that when they DO take charge , it means I ca n’t instantly speak to my colleague who ’s sitting at a client on the otherside of the globe with his Linux installed laptop , using my TV remote , at the same time updating him on how seriously cool my new cellphone looks by showing him a live video …
Jason Goodburn - Moffitt Says :
May 16th , 2006 at 4:37 pmIt was n’t much more than 30 years ago that identity security at banks was bullet - proof .
It was done through relationship building .
Not impersonal pseudo - relationships that an entire CRM industry has been created to manage , but the real thing .
If the teller saw that the Martha Smith withdrawing money from an account was n’t the Martha Smith she sees every Thursday at 4:30 PM with her cane and sandwich , then she would raise the red flag , and the imposter Martha would have to explain herself to the Bank Manager , and more likely the Police .
Unfortunately , we truly have traded security for convenience , and are now paying a much higher cost .

Toby Says :
May 17th , 2006 at 12:03 pmAfter reading the majority of posts , it is clear that there are several reasons why we are in this particular secuirty quagmire .
As an ex-tech support employee , I would like to add my own viewpoint into the mix : Somewhere along the way , it was decided that computers and the internet were ready for the mass market .
They were not .
For the same reason that Ford probably never considered the inevitable air pollution if millions of his cars were run on a daily basis , nobody reallly understood what was being unleashed .
That ’s how we got where we are now .
That ’s why the software and the operating systems ( at least initially ) are as insecure as they are .
COntinuing with thye car analaogy , when many people started using cars , it was quickly realised that some standard of use was required : hence the driver ’s license .
Not every 10 - year - old with an understanding of how the controls work is able to drive a car nowadays ; because , THEY CAN’T OPERATE A CAR RESPONSIBLY OR SAFELY .
Everyone in the developed world must get a license to legally drive a car .
It does n’t prevent all accidents from happening , or drunk driving , but could you imagine who would be on the road if we had no licensing system ?
End-users are unlicensed kids , who were taught how the controls work , but not taught how to use those controls responsably .
Maybe it ’s unfair , maybe the onus should be on the software developers who made things so difficult for the average user , but nevertheless , this is the situation we are in now .
Whatever operating system , or security software , or whatever , is cooked up , users ( who by the way leave their house and drive their computers at work just as irresponsably as at home ) need to be educated in proper computer use .
And tested .
And licensed .
Duane Gran Says :
May 17th , 2006 at 2:15 pmWhile some applaud the semi-anonymous nature of online communications and stateless protocols , I believe part of the problem is that the whole network is built on a brittle trust .
As a previous commenter noted , the Internet was designed to facilitate collaboration among people with a common interest .
Much in the way that crimes are few and easily solved in close - knit communities , the good old Internet was practically an Amish town compared to our present global network .
As I delve into a practical ( or impractical , you tell me ) suggestion , think about some of the problems we may have faced as our automotive network of roads developed and cars were largely unlicensed personal property .
How did anyone identify a hit and run driver or a bank robber ’s get away car , especially when it matched the ever present black Model - T?
My proposal is most likely untenable , but I would be interested to know if it has any traction at all .
I propose that identity , as we know it in meat space , should be part of the protocol stack for the Internet .
It is n’t perfect , but our global network is full of anonymous black Model - Ts and it seems about high time that we put some license plates on the payload .
Alan Willcox Says :
May 19th , 2006 at 8:59 amThis takes things a bit too far .
Information Security is practiced differently by every organization , within every country , and by each security professional .
Just as there are valuable lawyers and rotten lawyers , there are valuable infosec practitioners and incompetent ones .
For example : Codes of ethics must MEAN something .
How many CISSPs have signed certification applications for applicants who do n’t have the requisite experience ?
Have applications been audited ?
Have any certifications of these folks been revoked ?
Chris Byrd Says :
May 20th , 2006 at 7:06 pmThis is an excellent article which does a great job of pulling together much of the current information on the state of infosec .
I ’ve posted a link and my impressions of the article in my blog at :
http://riosec.com/state-of-insecurityBasically,
I feel that while this article accuratly reflects the state of ( in ) security today , there is a lot that companies and individuals can do to protect themselves .
For example , I ’ve never had a virus outbreak on any network I ’ve been responsible for .
By following defense - in - depth and default - deny principles , a little resources can go a long way .
Marshall Goodman Says :
May 23rd , 2006 at 5:46 pmGentlemen : Several thoughts have occurred to me on this issue and I too await Noam ’s sequel .
What we really face is how to deal with the ‘ risk ’ to the client .
I have noticed all the standard comments , from ‘ there really is n’t a problem ’ to ‘ we have to re-build / re-engineer ’ the O/S. Hogwash !
We need to concentrate on the client ’s needs .
The top three are ( IMHO ) as follows :
1. guarantee network / webserver service from interruption by DDoS / Trojan / Virus etc .
2.guarantee security of data from phishing and de-cryption
3.guaarantee website integrity from hacking and defacing .
The fundamental element of these three is that there be a minimal impact on the user ’s experience .
I want to come back to the risk part now .
As an internet business , all three items are high on my risk chart , because any one of them would have an adverse affect on business .
As a home user , data security and DDoS abuse of my computer are my high risk items .
If I was a corporate user , with a media profile , again all three are important to me .
How does business usually handle risk ?
By getting insurance .
With insurance as an option , looking at our security issues , we can tell our clients that we can get ‘ internet / Data / Webserver / Network security insurance ’ that will pay something if there is a security breach covered in the policy .
The catch will be that approval of the policy would be contigent on having the approved set of software and hardware installed and maintained by certified technicians that implement the ‘ best of breed ’ components to battle the foe , so to speak .
The Insurance companies would become interested partners in the security software / hardware business and would refine their policies ( and premiums ) as the level of ‘ risk ’ measured for a client on an ongoing basis .
Ok .
That ’s my three cents worth .
Regards ,
Marsh .

give me a break – many , if not most , of the examples you talk to are really losses , not thefts .
corporations and governments just are n’t treating customers and citizens with any respect .
Until businesses starts to care about their customers a lot of security is a waste of time and money .
NEGLIGENCE is your customers ’ real enemy .
Walt Rountree Says :
May 29th , 2006 at 1:20 amLoved your piece .
Education is a key .
But it is not necessary for people to learn software fixes .
Many of the security vulnerabilities are not really technical at all .
For the same reason you do n’t leave your money laying around for anyone to take , do not put information on the Internet that you would not want evil people to have .
I never believed it was safe to bank online despite what some security â� ?��? expertsâ� ?� say .
Do not do it .
It is always better to order by mail or telephone : or better yet at a store .
Also , do not put information on any computer connected to the Internet that you do not want people to see .
If you must use Quicken or some other program for your finances , be sure either to put it on an isolated box or otherwise back it up and remove it before being tempted to go online .
The ease of opening an account by providing limited identification has led to vulnerability for many companies and this is not in any way technical .
Giving out your social security number used to be perfectly safe before accounts could be opened using it without other verification ( For example , my drivers license number and US Army service number used to be my Social Security number .
Nobody was worried in the 70’s . )
Just as you cannot believe of all you read online , businesses and people cannot afford to be too trusting when using cyberspace .
This practice of allowing an purchase to be made so easily by an unverified individual is what has led to the stories of â� ?
�identity theftâ� ?� and must end before the losses become unacceptable .
Non-technical users need to use a Macintosh which is not vulnerable to many of the things which infect and ruin Windows computers .
You can not expect my grandma , bless her heart , to always keep her defenses up to date .
She wants to share photos and email .
Eric Says :
May 29th , 2006 at 5:28 pmThis is why security is a process – not an end product .
While interesting and informative , you ’re article simply isolates various security products , tools , and ‘ ways of doing things ’ along with each of their respective failures .
Some of which are very old news ( by tech standards ) .
As infosec professionals know ( as well as anyone who specializes in risk ) there is NO way to secure anything 100 % .
That ’s why we focus on risk mitigation , not risk avoidance .
Ultimately , the problem is humans are still responsible for everything .
Building the ’ secure ’ systems , developing and testing applications , patching , following - process and as long as that is the case , other humans will find a way to break the work .
Is this really a big failure ?
Of course , your piece was sooo long with so many reference links , I may have missed something somewhere .
Good reference piece though .
Jim Says :
May 31st , 2006 at 12:53 amA sobering paper which rings 100 % true .
Yes , user education is a sine qua non , but it ca n’t be sufficient .
I am a computer professional , reasonably aware of security issues , yet I ca n’t say I have the know - how to sit down at a computer and completely secure it ; in fact , if you accept this article , no one can !
Mostly we take the shotgun , i.e. , ‘ layered defense ’ approach of closing every vulnerability we can possibly think of , and no doubt that ’s a lot better than nothing , but this makes it all seem futile .
I too am looking forward to the next installment .
Sierra Bravo Says :
May 31st , 2006 at 4:32 amNice article , though sensationalist in parts .
My comments : 1 . Security is a journey , not a destination .
It is a process , not a device .
Therefore , it will never be “ done ” at any point .
2 . As a user of both Windows (> 15 years ) and Linux (> 6 years ) , I would place the 95 % of the blame on MS .
Not just for turning out crappy code , but mostly for “ dumbing down ” OSes and destroying the necessary discipline that ought to have been there for every user .
This has created problems for every other OS as well ( ” … why is n’t this as simple as Windows ? ” ) .
3 . A turning point in security during 2005 - 2006 is that the security business has been formally criminalized .
Therefore addressing security requires legal steps as well .
4. Free / Open Source Software must be promoted for other reasons as well , with peer review being most important .
Sony could n’t have smuggled in a root kit into the audio CD had there been some effort at peer review .
5 .
Personally , I do not feel that there is going to be an immediate meltdown of the Internet , but loss / compromise of personal , corporate or government data would be very much feasible where sysadmins are careless6 .
The ‘ dumb user ’ remains the greatest threat for all developers .
A balance has to be found between ease - of - use and security .
7 . Social engineering will also become an important problem as large numbers of neo-literate computer users take to the Internet .

Gord T. Says :
June 1st , 2006 at 11:10 amHey Noam , after our chat last night , I hopped on - line to have a look at your article .
I ’ll start by saying I love the frog analogy – very striking and apt .
I agree IN PRINCIPLE with what you ’re saying insofar as we ’re deluding others about our ability to have a secure cyberspace .
I ’m not , however , a great fan of FUD ( fear , uncertainty and doubt ) .
That ’s what vendors have been using to sell us “ the next great security product ” for a long while .
By propagating this “ the sky is falling ” tactic ourselves , we ’re essentially validating the method – is n’t that also a failure ?
Ironic , that such a mistake should occur in an article where you ’re trying to wake people up to failure .
I ’m not sure if this strengthens or weakens your position .
The sensationalist way with which you ’ve presented the info , though , is a great way to get people talking : 82 posts before me as I type this up – and that ’s just the people who ’ve bothered to comment .
Good work .
A few thoughts that occurred to me at various points while I was reading the article : -
The information you present reminds me of statistics ( damn , lying statistics ) .
Anyone who has ever built more than one statistical report has probably experienced the phenomenon where you can pretty much make the data ( facts ) say anything you want based on the manner in which you present them .
Do you think you ’re presenting your facts in the most truthful manner , or have you presented them in a fashion to support your thesis ? -
I was reminded of news articles I ’ve read describing how various government agencies , typically targetting police forces , are failing us by not providing sufficient protection : guns are rampant , organized crime is at an all - time high , kids are swarming people at malls , etc .
Should n’t people take some responsibility for their own actions ?
Do n’t we all ( as a cohesive society – not just the police ) have a responsibility to stand together and help each other out , rather than just pointing at the bad - guys and whining that someone else has n’t done enough to protect us from them ?-
You point out that all the various tools are failing us , but many of the quotes you use are from the very sources you ’re saying are broken : “ IBM is putting out warnings ” – yet IBM is one of the world ’s biggest providers of security consultants who are “ drastically failing ” .
So , why should we believe what IBM is saying if they suck as bad as the rest of us ?
Because they make a lot of money and are big ?
They ’re about business , and every press release they put out is solely for the purpose of increasing or maintaining business .
There are similar quotes where you say anti-spyware is failing us , but then quote an anti-spyware consortium , etc . . - I remember when the AvanteGarde test results came out .
It was a flawed test from the start – they used XPSP1 with known ( patchable LSASS ) vulnerabilities because that ’s how “ some vendors are still providing it ” .
That ’s definitely a vendor failing , but really only proves that an unpatched system WILL get compromised – every OS vendor has been telling us that forever .
Purely sensationalism for publicity .
There are large parallels with what we do and what law enforcement does : cops focus on protecting people from crime , as do we .
They do it in the physical space , while we do it in the virtual space .
I think this analogy is even reflected in the names give to ourselves Blackhat vs. Whitehat , Attacker vs. Defender , Bad Guy vs. Good Guy .
As a result , I believe we should expect to have similar problems as law enforcement – the criminals are evolving , so we must evolve .
Can we anticipate what the next attack mechanism will be ?
Sometimes .
Can we entirely prevent it until the bad guy makes the first move ?
Probably not .
As with law - enforcement , we ’ll always be reactionary – it ’s the nature of the beast .
[ Noam writes = “ People can come up with statistics to prove anything , Gord. 14 % of people know that .
😉
Certainly , while certain statistics can be debated , judging by most of the comments and discussions around this article most people agree that things are pretty bad and that the security industry is facing a number of challenges .
Regarding the AvanteGarde test , they did deploy a number of systems including some which were not patched against LSASS vulnerabilities .
However , I do believe that as long as “ some vendors were still providing it ” in that configuration it is a valid experiment because it does simulate the real - world experience of people ( e.g. , average home users ) purchasing computers from those vendors .
And I agree completely that simply spreading FUD is unproductive .
As I mentioned elsewhere , the article was written to encourage and promote discussion to help solve some of the current security challenges we are facing .
I mentioned in the article that , “ Part Two of this article will contain a list of what we must do to address our current failure . ”
And that , “ It will incorporate your comments and feedback . ”
Thanks for the comments Gord ! ]

June 4th , 2006 at 1:01 amGreat article .
Somehow the FUD is alerting , however unproductive to come up with the right solutions .
You agree on that in your reaction to Gord .
What scares me every time I face enterprise customer is the risk they are prepared to take due to the ice it takes to implement all necessary controls ( regardless of the complexity ) .
Paying for protection up to 5 times more than the functionality you use on your desktop / laptop is insane .

Jasmine was taken to hospital ( picture Northern Echo )
Jasmine Willis , 17 , developed a fever and began hyperventilating after drinking seven double espressos while working at her family 's sandwich shop .
The student , of Stanley , County Durham , was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham , where doctors confirmed she had overdosed on caffeine .
She has since made a full recovery and is now warning others about the dangers of excessive coffee drinking .
Ms Willis , who had thought the coffees were single measures , said the effects were so severe that she began laughing and crying for no reason while serving customers at the shop .

I was burning up and hyperventilating .
" I was having palpitations , my heart was beating so fast and I thought I was going into shock .
" I did not realise this could happen to you and I only hope other people learn from my mistake . "

" I have always stressed to my children the importance of moderation but Jasmine got caught out on this occasion . "
Japan 's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ( AIST ) has developed a device that uses lasers to project real three - dimensional images in mid-air .
The institute unveiled the device on February 7 in a demonstration that showed off the device 's ability to project three - dimensional shapes of white light .
AIST developed the projector with the cooperation of Keio University and Burton Inc. ( Kawasaki , Japan ) .
Until now , projected three - dimensional imagery has been " artificial " -- optical illusions that appear 3D due to the parallax difference between the eyes of the observer .
Prolonged viewing of this conventional sort of 3D imagery can cause physical discomfort .
The newly developed device , however , creates " real " 3D images by using laser light , which is focused through a lens at points in space above the device , to create plasma emissions from the nitrogen and oxygen in the air at the point of focus .
Because plasma emission continues for a short period of time , the device is able to create 3D images by moving the point of focus .
At the demonstration , bursts of laser light were emitted 100 times per second to form shapes in the air up to 50 cm above the device .
Heat from the laser caused the air to expand , producing a crackling sound that resembled a series of tiny explosions .
At the moment , the distance at which the device can project images is limited to between 2 and 3 meters .
Improved laser technology will enable images to be projected at greater distances and with more color , so we may soon see 3D images floating above our city skylines .
The chief scientist at AIST�s Photonics Research Institute says , " We believe this technology may eventually be used in applications ranging from pyrotechnics to outdoor advertising . "

Aug 15 ( Reuters ) - Citrix Systems Inc. CTXS.O said it agreed to buy privately held XenSource Inc. in a deal valued at about $ 500 million , including the assumption of stock options , to enter into the adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets .
The infrastructure software maker said the cash and stock deal , which is expected to close in the fourth quarter , will result in a non-cash charge of about $ 8 million to $ 10 million in the quarter it closes .
Citrix said the acquisition includes the assumption of about $ 107 million in unvested stock options .
XenSource provides system virtualization technology , which helps present the resources of a single computer as if it were a collection of separate computers .
The deal is expected to add about $ 1 million in revenue and $ 3 million in cost of revenue and operating expenses to fiscal year 2007 , Citrix said .
For fiscal 2008 , the acquisition is expected to add about $ 50 million in revenue and $ 60 million to $ 70 million in total cost of revenue and operating expenses .
Upon the completion of the deal , XenSource Chief Executive Peter Levine will head the new virtualization and management division of Citrix .

Clients of Blue Cross to get billed for bills

As if the U.S. health care system was n't bad enough , now comes word that Blue Cross , California 's largest health insurer , will charge hundreds of thousands of people a $ 2 " service fee " just to receive their bills in the mail .
That 's right -- a bill for them to bill you .
" Business costs do n't stay stagnant , " explained Nick Garcia , a spokesman for Blue Cross of California .
" There have been increases in postage and paper costs . "
Blue Cross ' paper - billing fee affects the 820,000 California members who receive coverage directly from the insurer in the form of individual policies .
At this point , it wo n't apply to the roughly 7.5 million others who are insured by Blue Cross through an employer or some other organization .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Garcia said the fee , to be introduced in September , is already prompting many members to turn instead to electronic billing and payments .
This , he said , is a plus for Blue Cross customers .
" When you 're in the individual market and paying month to month , there might be fears of a lapse in coverage if you do n't pay your bill on time , " Garcia said .
" This will alleviate those fears . "
Blue Cross is n't the only insurer charging customers a fee to receive their bills in the mail .
Health
Net bills its 100,000 California members with individual policies $ 5 a month for paper bills .
" This is to promote the efficiency of electronic payment methods , " said Brad Kieffer , a Health Net spokesman .
Similarly , phone company MCI , now owned by Verizon , charges a 99 - cent monthly fee for paper bills .
Internet service provider EarthLink charges $ 1 .
Yet it seems different when a health insurer does this .
If a telecom company hits people up for paper billing , at least it 's coming from a presumption that the customer has or can receive Internet access and thus is open to electronic billing .
An insurer can make no such presumption -- its customers can be anyone .
Moreover , an insurer 's billing statements are often the sole evidence of a person 's interaction with the health care system and thus comprise a crucial aspect of individual record keeping .
Garcia responded that the health care industry is moving toward digital medical records , and it's thus unsurprising that an insurance company would want to communicate with customers electronically .
" We think this is the direction that the industry is heading in , " he said .
Some consumers might see the switch away from paper billing as being more convenient for insurers than for those they cover .
It 's not as though most major insurance providers are hurting for cash .
Garcia said Blue Cross of California does n't disclose profit on a statewide basis .
But its parent company , WellPoint Health Networks , the nation 's largest health insurer , reported profit of $ 783.1 million during just the first three months of the year , up 16 percent from a year before .
Health Net 's Kieffer said about a third of individual policyholders pay the $ 5 monthly fee for paper bills .
If a third of the 820,000 Californians with individual Blue Cross policies chooses to continue receiving paper bills , the company is looking at an additional $ 547,000 in monthly revenue , or about $ 6.5 million a year .
Garcia said Blue Cross is expecting the percentage of members opting for electronic payments to reach as high as 85 percent in coming months .
However , this would still leave about 123,000 Californians stuck with the new fee , resulting in almost $ 250,000 in monthly revenue for the company , or about $ 3 million a year .
Rather than padding Blue Cross ' pockets , though , Garcia said the insurer sees the $ 2 paper - billing fee as a way to save people cash .
" We can save members a lot of money this way so that higher costs are n't passed on to them as premium increases , " he said .
There .
Does n't that make you feel better ?
Wrong path ? :
Speaking of health care , it was striking that President Bush had harsh words last week for a plan by Democrats to provide health coverage to more kids by expanding a popular children 's insurance program , known in California as Healthy Families .
The nationwide program covers more than 6 million kids , primarily in low - income families .
Congress will soon vote on reauthorizing the 10 - year - old system , with Democrats seeking to expand its scope so that a greater number of youths are covered .
Bush called this an attempt " to take incremental steps down the path to government - run health care for every American . "
He said this would be " the wrong path for our nation . "
At the same time , Bush warned that " America 's health care is too costly , is too confusing , it leaves too many people uninsured . "
He said the system " is in need of serious reform . "
Up to a point , that is .

The May Day marchers in LA called for greater rights for immigrants
Last week protesters and journalists were injured when police fired some 140 rubber bullets to break up the crowd .
The rally had been peaceful until the clashes , which the police department said were prompted by agitators throwing rocks and bottles at officers .
But TV footage showed a police officer pushing people who were walking away .
Widespread outrage over the pictures of the incident prompted the city 's mayor to cut short an overseas visit and return to the city .
Internal inquiry
News footage showed a police officer pushing a TV camerawoman to the ground and shoving people who were walking away from the officers .
Officials have denied the police deliberately targeted immigrants or civil rights activists .
Bratton has said an order to disperse may not have been clear
Nonetheless , the highest - ranking officer at the scene of the rally has been demoted and placed on house leave pending the outcome of an internal inquiry .
His second - in - charge , a veteran of almost 40 years on the force , has been demoted and about 60 highly - trained riot control officers who were involved in the clashes have been reassigned .
The Los Angeles Police Department is no stranger to scandal .
Sixteen years ago , officers were videotaped beating an unarmed black man , Rodney King .
Their subsequent acquittal prompted three days of riots , in which more than 50 people died .

(7) Ghost Towns of the American West are what come to mind for many when they think of abandoned settlements .
However , there are fascinating abandonments all over the world .
Some of these have a clear historical reason for being deserted , while the abandonment of others remains a mystery .
Here are six more amazing examples of urban deserts from around the globe .
(6) San Zhi , Taiwan is an abandoned settlement on the outskirts of Taipei , Taiwan .
A mysterious series of accidents led this would - be tourist town to go unused upon its completion .
Further , regional beliefs also kept the abandoned settlement from demolished – for fear of angering spirits dwelling in the complex .
(5) Near Genoa , Italy is a small abandoned village .
What would cause people to leave such a beautiful place ?
To be fair , though , the ruins left behind are aesthetically compelling in their own right .
The structures are remarkably intact and provocative .
(4) Promyshlennyi , Russia was abandoned with the fall of the Soviet Union , cut off from communication with and support from the government .
When utilities and electricity stopped working , people simply left to find a home an work elsewhere , leaving buildings behind and many belongings in the wreckage .
(3) New York , USA has a surprising number of abandoned airfields – directly in and around the city .
Given the relative density of the city and its surroundings it seems unusual that these have been left unused for so long .
Each of these anomolous airfields has its own story .
(2) Tere - Hole , Siberia is a lake with a recently dicovered treasure in the middle : a ruin dating back 1500 years .
Located in a vast wilderness of lakes , this long - abandoned stronghold is 600 by 450 feet .
Excavations this year may reveal ancient artifacts .
(1) Pripyat , Ukraine was once a thriving city of 50,000 , but was abandoned following the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl .
For a long time the amazingly preserved city – rapidly abandoned by the populace – was a virtual museum , a snapshot of the times .
Pripyat has since been looted and only images and architecture remain .
The site will be unfit for human habitation for hundreds of years due to nuclear fallout .
However , you can tour the ruins by video .

The World Champion largest number , listed in the latest Guinness Book of Records , is an upper bound , derived by R. L. Graham , from a problem in a part of combinatorics called Ramsey theory .
Graham ’s number cannot be expressed using the conventional notation of powers , and powers of powers .
If all the material in the universe were turned into pen and ink it would not be enough to write the number down .
Consequently , this special notation , devised by Donald Knuth , is necessary .
3^3 means ‘ 3 cubed ’ , as it often does in computer printouts .
3 ^^3 means 3 ^( 3^3 ) , or 3^27 , which is already quite large : 3^27 = 7,625,597,484,987 , but is still easily written , especially as a tower of 3 numbers : 333 .
3 ^^^3 = 3 ^ ^( 3^ ^3 ) , however , is 3^ ^7,625,597,484,987 = 3 ^( 7,625,597,484,987^7,625,597,484,987 ) , which makes a tower of exponents 7,625,597,484,987 layers high .
3 ^ ^^^3 = 3 ^ ^^( 3 ^ ^ ^3 ) , of course .
Even the tower of exponents is now unimaginably large in our usual notation , but Graham ’s number only starts here .
Consider the number 3 ^^^ ... ^^^3 in which there are 3 ^ ^^ ^3 arrows .
A largish number !
Next construct the number 3 ^^^ ... ^^^3 where the number of arrows is the previous 3 ^^^ ... ^^^3 number .
An incredible , ungraspable number !
Yet we are only two steps away from the original ginormous 3 ^ ^ ^ ^3 .
Now continue this process , making the number of arrows in 3 ^ ^^ ... ^^^3 equal to the number at the previous step , until you are 63 steps , yes , sixty - three , steps from 3 ^ ^ ^ ^3 .
That is Graham ’s number .
There is a twist in the tail of this true fairy story .
Remember that Graham ’s number is an upper bound , just like Skewes ’ number .
What is likely to be the actual answer to Graham ’s problem ?
Gardner quotes the opinions of the experts in Ramsey theory , who suspect that the answer is : 6 .

WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes fell more than expected in April while prices slid for a record ninth consecutive month , indicating further troubles ahead for the housing market .
The National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of existing homes dropped 2.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.99 million units , the slowest sales pace in nearly four years .
The median price of a home fell to $ 220,900 , a 0.8 percent decline from the median price a year ago .
The median is the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less .
The slide in existing home sales came after a report Thursday that showed a big 16.2 percent surge in sales of new homes in April that occurred as the median price of a new home fell by a record 11.1 percent from the previous month .
Analysts said the disparity in sales of new and existing homes for April reflected in part the decision by builders to aggressively cut prices to unload inventory while homeowners are still reluctant to lower their asking prices .
" It is only a matter of time before homeowners realize that the dream is over and that price cuts are now necessary to sell their homes , " said Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , a Darien , Conn. , investment firm .
The supply of existing homes for sale shot up to a record total of 4.2 million in April , an increase of 394,000 from the March supply .
Analysts predicted that this big inventory surge would act to further depress prices .
" We 're swimming in supply , " said Mike Larson , a real estate analyst with Weiss Research , who cited a number of factors for the unsold homes .

It ’s obvious why the Bush administration would edit those documents , but why the voting report ?
Because charges of voter fraud are a key component of the Republican electoral strategy .
If the public believes there are rampant efforts to vote fraudulently , or to register voters improperly , it increases support for measures like special voter ID ’s , which work against the poor , the elderly , minorities and other disenfranchised groups that tend to support Democrats .
Claims of rampant voter fraud also give the administration an excuse to cut back prosecutions of the real problem : officials who block voters ’ access to the polls .
There is one big catch , as Eric Lipton and Ian Urbina reported in The Times last week .
After a five - year crackdown , the Justice Department has not turned up any evidence that voter fraud actually is a problem .
Only 86 people were convicted of voter fraud crimes as of last year — most of them Democrats and many on trivial , trumped - up charges .
The Bush administration was so determined to pursue this phantom scourge that it deported a legal Florida resident back to his native Pakistan for mistakenly filling out a voter registration card when he renewed his driver ’s license .
And it may well have decided to fire most of the eight federal prosecutors because they would not play along .
It is vital that Congress get to the truth about these firings .
Last week , the Republican National Committee threw up another roadblock , claiming it had lost four years ’ worth of e-mail messages by Karl Rove that were sent on a Republican Party account .
Those messages , officials admitted , could include some about the United States attorneys .
It is virtually impossible to erase e-mail messages fully , and the claims that they are gone are not credible .
The only solution is to get these issues out into the open .
It is good that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will finally testify in the Senate this week .
But Mr. Rove , who seems to be at the heart of this affair , should also be required to testify under oath — and in public .
Even the Wizard of Oz eventually came out from behind the curtain .

“ We can provide a reasonable snapshot of the situation at that time and how things have gone in the surge , both in the security and then in the political and economic arenas , ” Gen. David Petraeus said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
President George W. Bush has said Petraeus ’ September report would be important in deciding the future of U.S. involvement in Iraq , but some in his administration have started to play down its significance to relieve some of the anticipation among members of Congress .
Petraeus made clear he thought it was important to give the president and Congress “ some sense of the implications of the various courses of action that might be under discussion at that point in time . ”
“ We all need to have very clear eyes about what can happen , what the implications of various options are and , again , just to assess those correctly , ” he said .
Democrats in Congress have used the September report as a benchmark for re-evaluating Bush ’s Iraq policy .
Some Republicans also have indicated they might push for a change based on what Petraeus says .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said most senators in his party think September is the critical point .
“ The proper time to really make a serious evaluation of the direction we ought to head is in September , ” McConnell said on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . ”
Last week , Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada created a bit of a storm by suggesting Petraeus might water down his report to relieve some of the pressure on Bush .
After complaints by Republicans , Reid said he had high regard for Petraeus but hoped that he would be “ a little more candid with us ” when releasing his report .
Petraeus said his report would be candid and will allow the policy makers to determine the course ahead .
“ We ’ll provide a snapshot of where we are at that time and it will be a forthright assessment of what we have achieved and what we have n’t achieved , ” he said .
The U.S. ambassador to Baghdad , Ryan Crocker , said while Petraeus was giving the security and military report , he would provide the political and economic outlook .
“ What we ’ll do is we will come back and jointly we will give an honest , forthright assessment , ” Crocker told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
In the bustle of announcements surrounding OSCON , Blackhat , and the Ajax Experience one single , incredibly important , announcement was made :
The introduction of two new Mozilla projects : IronMonkey and ScreamingMonkey .
The critical , core , component of this is the Tamarin virtual machine ( which is an Open Sourced version of the ActionScript Virtual Machine that powered the Adobe Flash Player ) .
Tamarin already supports ECMAScript 3 ( and , thusly , JavaScript , ActionScript , and JScript ) and parts of the upcoming ECMAScript 4 specification .
Briefly , since they ’re both still under planning , here ’s what IronMonkey and Screaming Monkey are setting out to achieve .
IronMonkey is setting out with the goal of mapping Microsoft ’s Common Intermediate Language ( CIL ) to ActionScript Byte Code ( ABC ) , allowing additional language implementations , such as IronPython and IronRuby , to run in the Tamarin Virtual Machine .
IronPython and IronRuby are implementations of Python and Ruby , respectively , that runs on .NET Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) ( and , incidentally , also on Mono ) , written in C# .
IronRuby is built on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime ( DLR ) … DLR will ship as part of the Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) in the future …
To break all of this down :
There are implementations of Python and Ruby that are capable of being compiled down to a Common Intermediate Language , which will then be able to be run on Tamarin via IronMonkey .
This is a huge , huge , deal .
This means that JavaScript will no longer be the only viable scripting language in browsers that use that Tamarin engine .
At the very least , there ’ll be two more languages to work with .
However , if IronMonkey works out well , I would n’t be surprised if we see an implementation of PHP that runs in the browser .
Tamarin being able to run JavaScript 2 , Python , and Ruby really does n’t mean a whole lot ( to the general web - developer public ) if the languages do n’t work in all modern browsers ( even though it ’ll give development on the Mozilla platform a considerable boost ) .
This is where Screaming Monkey comes into play .
ScreamingMonkey is the effort , being led by Mark Hammond , to allow the Tamarin engine to run within non-Mozilla browsers , starting with Internet Explorer .
Unfortunately , the Internet Explorer team is caught up fixing bugs in their existing ECMAScript implementation ( JScript ) , thus their likelihood of implementing ECMAScript 4 , in a reasonable time frame , is slim to none .
The result of this effort will be for a developer to be able to reference ECMAScript 4 or JavaScript 2 from a script tag and have it load a required plugin in order to execute it , for example :
< script type=" application/ecmascript;version=4 " >...</ script >
or :
< script type=" application/javascript;version=2 " >...</ script >
There ’s a detailed plan of attack laid out and it will require a lot of work .
The end result still needs to be actualized , but it will most likely be in the form of a standalone Tamarin runtime ( possibly embedded in another distribution ) that will be able to hook into its relevant browsers .
As with IronMonkey , this is a huge announcement .
This immediately helps to give credence to using the upcoming JavaScript 2 language as its cross - browser support is practically assured .
While we ’re still a long ways off from being able to use this particular project , the result of it will surely be incredible .
Regardless of the outcome of either one of these projects , it ’s obvious that browser scripting is beginning to shift in some appreciable ways .
Although , should these projects succeed the resulting effect upon the web development industry will be incalculable .

The GNU Project
Dharamsala , India , 1 April 2003
The Dalai Lama today announced the official release of Yellow Hat GNU / Linux .
Produced by the Gelugpa or " Yellow Hat " sect of Tibetan Buddhism , this GNU / Linux distribution is designed to encourage benevolence and cooperation .
The Dalai Lama said , " The experience of sharing free software will teach all human beings the principle of benevolence toward other beings .
Software is formalized knowledge , and sharing knowledge in the GNU spirit is a human duty .
The GNU / Linux system offers beings a way to follow the path of benevolence while using computers . "
Yellow Hat GNU / Linux not only supports the Tibetan language , it also comes with a full library of Buddhist texts in Tibetan , Chinese and English .
The Tibetan and Chinese versions are in the public domain ; the English translations are newly made and released under a free license .
" Users will advance in programming skill and advance towards enlightenment at the same time , " said the Dalai Lama .
To encourage users to move toward nirvana , a chain of users groups known as GELUGPA ( GNU - Enlightened - Linux User Groups for Passion Abatement ) is being established .
Programmers who have achieved enlightenment become capable of what is called " egoless programming " , and can then use the Dbu debugging environment .
As an integrated development environment , designed specifically for egoless programming , it also serves as a reminder of the essential unity of all things .
Dbu is named after the Tibetan province of Dbu , whose name is pronounced " oo " as in " food " .
If you see a programmer look at a screen and say " oo ! " , he is probably using Dbu , or wishing he were .
Source code for Yellow Hat GNU / Linux is available on CD - ROM ; selected beautiful passages of code can also be ordered as hand - painted tankhas for display on your office wall .
The Chinese authorities immediately banned the distribution , claiming that it includes a photo of the Dalai Lama ; however , the Yellow Hat development group says it is really a photo of Phil Silvers , included so that DeCSS can display it before playing a film .
Chinese spokesmen firmly insisted that " Yellow Hat GNU / Linux will never catch on in China . "
When confronted with reports that a prerelease version is already widely used in parts of Siquan , Qinghai and Gansu provinces , they said that " This means nothing -- those areas are really part of Tibet . "
When asked what response they expect from Red Hat , the Dalai Lama 's spokesmen said that " The Nyingma or Red Hat sect disagrees with us on various points , but all Tibetan sects regard the Dalai Lama as the leader of the Tibetan people .
So we do n't expect them to criticize the Gelugpa sect for venturing into the software field . "
The Dalai Lama 's spokesmen refused to comment on rumors that the Yellow Hat sect plans to merge with the Church of Emacs .
The association between the Dalai Lama and GNU / Linux is an April fool , but the background information about Tibet is accurate -- even the fact that Dbu is pronounced " oo " .
Thanks to Mary Fischer for providing this information .

Jeanine Van Voorhees wanted to do her part for the environment when she bought a $ 1,000 energy - saving washing machine .
But her clothes came out covered in cat hair and her whites were dingy .
She resorted to washing some loads twice .

WASHINGTON , Aug. 16 — John Ashcroft was “ barely articulate , ” “ feeble ” and “ clearly stressed ” as he sat in a hospital room chair in March 2004 when top
White House aides unsuccessfully tried to persuade him , as the Attorney General , to sign an extension for warrantless domestic eavesdropping on Americans , according to notes made by Robert S. Mueller III , the director of the F.B.I .
Mr. Mueller ’s notes of his visit to Mr. Ashcroft ’s hospital room provide another eyewitness account of the dramatic confrontation over the secret surveillance program .
They confirm an account of the encounter given by James B. Comey , the former deputy attorney general , who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about it in May .
Mr. Mueller ’s typed notes , which are undated , also reveal a series of meetings earlier and later that month between the F.B.I. director and other administration officials , including Mr. Comey , Alberto R. Gonzales , then White House Counsel and General Michael V. Hayden , then the director of the National Security Agency , which conducted the electronic monitoring program .
At one point in a meeting with Mr. Mueller , the notes show , Mr. Gonzales said that even he was “ barred ” from getting as much information as he wanted about the highly classified eavesdropping program , because of strict White House secrecy rules .

Ed Hardy , writes , in Congress , keep your mitts off the App Store .
Itâ€™s fine .
[ Opinion ] :
When Apple CEO Tim Cook takes questions from Congress on Wednesday , heâ€™ll surely get an earful of software developersâ€™ complaints about how the App Store operates .
Chief among the criticisms will likely be the fact that Apple charges a percentage of revenue earned from in - app sales .
Itâ€™s not just a percentage of revenue from in - app purchases .
Itâ€™s percentage of every paid upfront app , too .
And the percentage is 30 % for most cases .
Hardy continues :
Thereâ€™s not a bit of justification for any of these highly publicized complaints .
They come from companies that want to have their cake and eat it , too .
Thereâ€™s plenty of justification .
If you offer a Mac app outside of the Mac App Store , you can expect to pay about 5 % to your payment processor .
This option is not permitted for people writing iPhone and iPad apps .
Itâ€™s incredibly dismissive to accuse companies of wanting to â€œhave their cake and eat it , too.â€ �
What companies want is to be able to pay their people and keep making the things they think are cool or good .
The next section of Hardyâ€™s piece is called â€ œThe App Store does business like a grocery store.â€� Butâ€¦
The App Store does not do business like a grocery store
Hardy writes :
â€ ¦take a trip to your local grocery store .
Suppose itâ€™s a Kroger .
Youâ€™ll find store brands â€ ” products made by Kroger â€ ” on the shelves next to products made by outside companies , like Procter & Gamble .
I hope youâ€™re not surprised that if you buy a Procter & Gamble product , Kroger takes a share of the revenue .
Thatâ€™s exactly what Apple does with the App Store .
If I make and distribute toothpaste , I can offer the exact same product via Kroger , Safeway , and Albertsonâ€™s â€ ” Â and I could sell it from my own website and via Amazon .
Thatâ€™s a lot of choices I have for selling my product .
But if I write an iOS app , I can sell it via the App Store and through no other method .
This is not at all how grocery stores work .
Hardy continues :
To be fair , itâ€™s not just Spotify whoâ€™s complaining .
The CEO of Epic Games ( maker of Fortnite ) whined about the App Store just last week .
And the developers of premium email app
Hey engaged in a very public spat with Apple in June , accusing Cupertino of acting like â€œgangsters .â€ �
But none of these companiesâ€™ criticisms hold up .
For whatever reason , developers are often accused of being whiny .
Oh , those whiny developers who like to have their cake and eat it too .
How dare they complain about Apple policies .
Betcha Iâ€™m being a whiny developer right now .
No .
Again : developers want to make great apps and be able to continue making great apps .
Hardy :
To demonstrate why , letâ€™s continue with the grocery store analogy .
Kroger built its store into a successful business .
But suppose the companies who make the products sold in that store wanted to keep using it , without sharing any of the revenue with Kroger .
That would be completely unfair .
Kroger is paying upkeep on the store , but these other companies donâ€™t want to contribute .
Weâ€™ve demonstrated that itâ€™s not like a grocery store .
But letâ€™s talk about fair share .
Apple â€ ” certainly among the wealthiest of companies in human history â€ ” Â is taking 30 % of developersâ€™ paychecks in order to show services growth .
This is not about upkeep on the store : this is about profit for Apple .
And not just profit but a specific category of profit .
And the rules arenâ€™t remotely fair .
Facebook â€ ” Â another fabulously wealthy company â€ ” certainly profits from its iPhone app .
Does it share any of this with Apple ?
No. Instead , apps from smaller developers ( because they are almost all smaller than Facebook ) are subsidizing Facebook .
If thereâ€™s a fair share to be paid , the largest apps get away without paying it .
Instead , companies like Omni subsidize Facebook .
Fair ?
* * *
The next section is called â€ œSelfish developers want to use the iPhone ecosystem without paying their share.â€ �
This is total bullshit and insulting .
( Developers are always whiny and selfish , of course . )
This isnâ€™t about paying a share into some commons run for all of our benefit .
Apple isnâ€™t just asking for us to help cover costs .
No .
This is the only game in town for iPhone and iPad developers , and we have no choice but to subsidize apps like Facebook .
We have no choice but to contribute to Appleâ€™s services growth .
Hardy :
Of course , the analogy isnâ€™t perfect , because it underplays Appleâ€™s role .
It didnâ€™t just build a grocery store â€ ” it built the entire town .
There would be nowhere for Spotify and the rest to sell their products if the iPhone never existed .
This is kind of the thing with platforms .
There would be nowhere for Spotify to sell their iPhone app if there were no such things as iPhones .
True .
The major reason these software developers have a business is because Apple makes iPhones that people carry with them everywhere .
Without them , thereâ€™d be no Spotify .
Fortnite would be a PC - only game .
I think the argument here is that , without Apple , the smart phone revolution wouldnâ€™t have happened so quickly .
That may be true !
But itâ€™s not argument in favor of Appleâ€™s 30 % cut .
Hardy :
These companies love to play on the idea that a 30 % share of revenue is an egregious price to pay to be on the App Store .
However , a recent study found that Appleâ€™s percentage falls in line with other software stores ( .pdf ) .
And Procter & Gamble wouldnâ€™t blink to hear that Kroger charges 30 % extra for one of its products .
All of the various app stores are charging too much .
They all point to Apple as precedent .
* * *
The next section is called â€ œConsumers benefit hugely from the App Store.â€ �
In some ways , sure .
Itâ€™s also worth remembering that the more money Apple takes from developers , the fewer resources developers have .
When developers have to cut costs , they stop updating apps , skimp on customer support , put off hiring a graphic designer , etc .
They decide not to make apps at all that they might have made were it easier to be profitable .
Suppose the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee â€ ” where Apple CEO Cook will answer questions Wednesday ( as will the leaders of Facebook , Amazon and Google ) â€ ” mistakenly thinks there is some justification for these developersâ€™ complaints .
Regulations that forced Apple to change the way the App Store worked would benefit a few big - name software companies , but they would hurt hundreds of millions of Apple users .
We have no way to know that â€ ” Â we donâ€™t know what that regulation would look like or who it would benefit .
I do not want to see Congress regulate app stores .
I want Apple to make better choices here â€ ” Â better for Apple , Apple customers , and developers .
But if Congress lowers the cut to 10 % , or says that App Stores must allow for side - loading , itâ€™s hard to see how customers would be hurt .
( That said â€ ” Â again , Iâ€™d really prefer not to see federal legislation .
It shouldnâ€™t be needed . )
Hardy :
True , Apple rules the App Store with an iron fist .
While it sometimes acts in opaque and arbitrary ways , firmness is absolutely necessary in a world full of unethical developers whoâ€™d happily flood the App Store with crapware designed to steal user information .
No one wants that .
Developers : whiny , selfish , and unethical .
Any time I hear about iron fists and the necessity of firmness , in any context , I get pretty nervous .
But letâ€™s set that aside .
App
Store review is not filtering out apps that steal user information .
No .
This is done by sandboxing and other technical restrictions .
Apps canâ€™t steal user information .
Apple â€ ” to its immense credit ( itâ€™s one of the things I love about Apple ) â€ ” continues to lock this down .
The App Store has nothing at all to do with it , though .
Hardy :
Letting companies avoid this process would release a wave of malware on iPhone users everywhere .
In a world where everyoneâ€™s phones are networked together , introducing another way for criminals to spread nefarious software is a horrible idea .
This is horribly , terribly untrue .
Again : the App Store doesnâ€™t prevent malware .
Other technical limitations , built in to the platform , prevent malware .
Apple does a great job with this and deserves all kinds of credit .
The second sentence in Hardyâ€™s paragraph is just pure scare - mongering with no grain of truth .
* * *
The next section is called â€ œCupertino deserves its fair share.â€ �
Hardy :
Cupertino deserves a cut of the action for the hard work it does policing the App Store .
( And donâ€™t forget about the enormous cost of operating and maintaining the servers that power this $ 519 - billion - a - year economic engine , to say nothing of building the software tools developers use to create apps for iOS and macOS . )
Again : Apple isnâ€™t asking us to cover costs plus a little something extra â€ ” Â no .
Apple considers revenue growth in services to be of paramount importance , and this is one if its favorite ways of making that services money .
This isnâ€™t about fairness at all .
If it were , youâ€™d think Facebook might pay some share .
Apple doesnâ€™t â€œpoliceâ€� the App Store for the benefit of customers .
Submissions are checked to be sure they adhere to Apple guidelines â€ ” Â in other words , reviewers make sure that apps are making money in approved ways and giving Apple its cut .
Itâ€™s also understandable that software developers want customers to pay them directly , rather than sending payments through Apple .
And admittedly the company does make exceptions for certain services , like Amazon Prime Video , that bring customers to Appleâ€™s ecosystem .
However , Cupertinoâ€™s general policy on payments means customers can feel safe shelling out for software and services within the Apple ecosystem .
We know some shady firm wonâ€™t steal our credit card info .
Even the best - intentioned companies get hacked , and I trust Appleâ€™s network security far more than I do some random developerâ€™s .
Again : this article mentions fairness a few times , and I hope itâ€™s clear by now that the App Store isnâ€™t exactly fair .
That thing about security and credit cards is more scare - mongering .
If side - loading were allowed , most developers would use reputable systems like Square and Stripe and so on , where the developers never actually see credit card info at all .
( Developers are , by the way , whiny , selfish , unethical , and random . )
Maybe Appleâ€™s 30 % cut seems steep for digital products .
But , as Ben Bajarin , head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies , points out , the App Store seemed like a bargain to developers when it launched in 2008 .
At that time , developers typically surrendered 50 % of the retail prices on software sold through physical stores .
And small devs couldnâ€™t even gain a toehold .
This is enormously untrue .
I know because I was one of many small developers who were there .
We used Kagi as our payment processor at the time , and I think we paid around 5 % for our storefront and payment processing and everything .
Completely reasonable , and we were perfectly happy with it .
We were also a two - person shopÂ â€ ” my wife and I â€ ” Â and you canâ€™t get much smaller than that .
Did we gain a toehold ?
Hell yes !
We did great !
There were a lot of small companies operating that way .
Hardly any of us were selling boxes through retail stores in the 2000s â€ ” we were already selling over the web by the mid â€™90s .
Nobody saw this as a bargain .
The developers I knew â€ ” Â small developers with nice toeholds !
â€ ” were shocked and astonished , because we were used to paying 5 - 10 % .
Perhaps
Apple should shave a few percentage points off its take from App Store revenues to keep everyone ( including Congress ) happy .
But third - party developers absolutely should pay a share of their revenue to support the iPhone ecosystem .
Everyone benefits from it , including the companies that are whining .
They just donâ€™t want to admit it .
The traditional way of supporting a platform is to write good apps for that platform .
Thatâ€™s it .
A platform with more and better apps will attract more people to that platform .
( Itâ€™s not the only thing , but itâ€™s a real thing . )
But Hardy â€ ” and Apple , apparently â€ ” Â has forgotten that simple truth .
And they havenâ€™t realized that current App Store policies actually hurt the situation : we donâ€™t have the quantity and quality of apps we should have .
Which hurts that very ecosystem .
More eye - candy coming soon to your Squeak desktop 15 July , 2007
Gary Chambers recently announced the imminent release of an add - on package for Morphic that brings more eye - candy to your Squeak desktop .
This package offers TrueType font support ( via the FreeType Plus package ) , desktop theming and a whole collection of standard widgets .
While waiting with impatience for the release of the package , you can look at the screenshots here and here .
How did it get like this ?
How does it continue ?
Yes , corporations are running the show and that guarantees fascism ; that ’s how fascism happens .
Yes , the leaders are all in hock to the money men .
You ca n’t get elected if you do n’t have the money .
Yes , the people are n’t as bright as they once were and that is n’t saying much .
Yes , the glitter of bright shiny plastic and the star power veneer of bimbo and bozo celebrity as well as the gangsta soundtrack make what should embarrass a borderline intellect look hot , but , what ’s the real problem ?
The real problem is the hydra headed Bitch Media .
The real problem is who is controlling the appearance and flow of information ; the perception of reality .
Goebbels would indeed be proud .
Somewhere around 700,000 Iraqi ’s are dead .
The numbers we hear are between 30,000 and 100,000 + .
Why is that ?
Why is n’t the disparity in the numbers even discussed ?
Why is n’t there a headline that asks , “ What ’s the real number of Iraqi Dead ? ”
According to eyewitnesses , which include police , journalists and residents , the kidnapped Israeli soldiers were taken on the Lebanese side of the border .
Here is what happens when you go looking for previous stories reporting that ;
http://www.forbes.com/technology/feeds/ap/2006/07/12/ap2873051.html
Check out the top links on this page
http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/israeli_solders.html
which go directly to that story and click on the links .
That news has been expunged for the most part .
Why ?
Israeli forces were mustered all along the border , well previous to the kidnapping .
No one talks about this manifest proof of prior intent .
Israeli forces dropped 1.2 million cluster bombs on Lebanon
http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/761781.html
and most of them were dropped ‘ after ’ peace had been agreed on .
Half a million of them are unexploded and laying around as party favors ; fireworks for children .
What is presently happening in Gaza is obscene .
But where ’s the story ?
Goebbels would be proud .
Try an experiment and listen , attentively , to mainstream radio and TV news for a couple of days with the intention of getting a feel for what it is determined that you should hear .
What do you hear ?
For days there was a constant barrage of tales about Nimrods looking to blow up things in London and Scotland .
There was n’t any story in the story , just a lot of booga booga .
Why is that ?
Ratchet up the fear ; fear and paranoia to keep the public on the edge of their seats in order to increase surveillance and make them comfy under the all seeing lidless eye .
Ahmanedijad is alleged to have called for the destruction of Israel .
But this is a lie
http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/jonathan_steele/2006/06/post_155.html
why are we being told a lie ?
What about the killing of al - hariri ?
Here is just one polemic that casts a different view on the matter
http://www.williambowles.info/syria_lebanon/hariri_nimmo.html
and you can find much more by simply looking under the sheets .
But you wo n’t find it being discussed in the local or international press .
Why is Olbermann the only mainstream commentator to speak with any outrage against the Bushjunta ?
More curiously , we should ask how he is allowed to .
Those who control the press and the information released , control the public ’s perception of what is happening in the world .
It ’s like a large dark blanket that vibrates with a message that you can’t quite hear and it has been pulled over the heads of the world .
It feels safe and scary under the blanket .
It ’s a lot scarier outside the blanket , under the bed , in the closet , just beyond the periphery of the trees in the yard .
I can watch the news and see , without any doubt that I am being lied to .
Recent history shows us that the majority of everything we hear through official news organs , concerning the war in Iraq and elsewhere and most of what is connected to the war on terror is a lie .
We have the daily ongoing proof of many , many lies .
But the lies continue as if they had n’t been told only the day before .
Ironically , the mass media is forced to reveal various lies as physical proof presents itself … .
Yet somehow it ’s okay .
The lies are n’t really lies .
It ’s something else , something we can’t quite see or catch .
The official numbers of American dead and wounded are not the actual number .
Unless you die right on the battlefield they do n’t count you .
Creative numbers crunching is the rule .
If you go looking for the truth you will at least find out more than you have been told .
How many of us go looking ?
How many of us actually care ?
There is a big difference between something you hear about and something that happens to ‘ you ’ .
Sooner or later something will happen to you .
Quite often it happens because you lived according to things you were told that were not true , or acted on things you were told that were not true .
Bad information can be fatal .
What about all of the inconsistencies in the 9/11 story ?
What was Mohammed Atta doing on Jack Abramoff ’s gambling boat the week before 9/11 ?
Why is n’t the press curious about this ?
I could fill a large book with only some of these lies , known and still repeated lies ; but that ’s not my job .
That ’s their job .
Lies ; there is a huge towering tidal wave , a tsunami of unqualified bullshit ; day in and day out .
Gleam - smiling androids with wax museum hair tell you lies and then break for commercials for more lies .
There is the curious phenomenon of the sloganeering neo-cons and their army of retarded Schmoos .
You saw them at the Palm Beach election center .
You hear their spokebots on radio and TV .
You see the all caps responses in forums .
They have been told what they know and now they know it .
Lies have become reality .
Maybe they always were but they were never so pervasive .
Those who chase the money have their lies .
The sex - obsessed have their lies ; the alcoholics and religious fanatics , the old and the young , those who are afraid they know but do n’t want to know , those who just want to get by .
Living a lie , dying for a lie , on and on into the darkness they march .
The truth that you find at the end of a lying darkness is not a soft truth .
It ’s not an easy truth .
It ’s not the lantern in the window at the journeys end to a warm hearth and the welcome of your loved ones .
Somehow you think it ’s going to be okay .
You ’ll get by .
The sad reality is that lies take more than your body and your freedom ; they rob you of the most important things that make living a wonderland of possibility .
They co-opt your mind and heart .
Lies take your fire and kill your hope .
Lies kill what you might have been .
My advice to you is to stop nodding your head .
I suggest you look deeper .
It all comes down to whether you care or not .
It comes down to how much truth is inside you .
Drinking a little alcohol every day , especially wine , may be associated with an increase in life expectancy .
That ’s the conclusion of Dutch researchers who reported the findings of their study today at the American Heart Association ’s 47th Annual Conference on Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology and Prevention .
The researchers found that a light intake of alcohol ( on average less than one glass per day ) was associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular death and death from all causes .
When compared to spirits and beer , consumption of small amounts of wine , about a half a glass a day , was associated with the lowest levels of all - cause and cardiovascular deaths .
Alcohol treatment may be necessary to reduce the rate of cardiovascular death due to consumption .
“ Our study showed that long - term , light alcohol intake among middle - aged men was associated not only with lower cardiovascular and all - cause death risk , but also with longer life expectancy at age 50 , ” said Martinette T. Streppel , lead author of the study and a Ph.D. student in the Division of Human Nutrition at Wageningen University and National Institute for Public Health and the Environment ( RIVM ) in Bilthoven , The Netherlands .
“ Furthermore , long - term light wine consumption is associated with a further protective effect when compared to that of light - to - moderate alcohol intake of other types . ”
Previous studies have shown that light to moderate alcohol intake is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death .
However , it remained unclear whether a specific beverage was associated with more benefit and whether the use of long - term alcohol consumption was associated with increased life expectancy .
Studies such as this cannot definitively show whether the agent being studied has a causal effect on health .
The Netherlands study — called the Zutphen Study — involved a cohort of 1,373 men born between 1900 and 1920 who were surveyed in detail about alcohol consumption seven times over 40 years .
The participants , all from Zutphen , an industrial town in the eastern part of the Netherlands , were followed until death or until the final survey taken among survivors in mid-2000 .
The surveys included drinking habits , dietary habits , body mass index , smoking habits and the prevalence of heart attack , stroke , diabetes and cancer .
The statistics on alcohol consumption were adjusted to account for other risk factors .
The researchers found that long - term , light alcohol intake of less than or equal to 20 grams per day ( 1 glass of alcoholic beverage contains 10 grams of alcohol , 1 ounce = ~ 30 mL of alcoholic beverage ) compared to no alcohol intake was associated with a 36 percent lower relative risk of all - cause death and a 34 lower relative risk of cardiovascular death .
The average long - term daily intake of the men throughout the 40 - year study was six grams based on any alcohol intake of more than zero and up to 20 grams .
The long - term average intake of six grams of alcohol is equal to one four - ounce beer , one two - ounce glass of wine or one one - ounce glass of spirits , daily .
When the researchers looked independently at wine consumption , the associated risk reduction was greater .
Participants who drank on average half a glass , or 1.5 ounces , of wine per day , over a long period , had a 40 percent lower rate of all - cause death and a 48 percent lower incidence of cardiovascular death , compared to the non-wine drinkers .
Researchers said life expectancy was 3.8 years higher in those men who drank wine compared to those who did not drink alcoholic beverages .
Life expectancy of wine users was more than two years longer than users of other alcoholic beverages .
Men with a long - term alcohol intake less than or equal to 20 grams per day had a 1.6 - year - higher life expectancy , compared to those who consumed no alcohol .
Most of the previous studies assessed alcohol intake at baseline ; however , in this study researchers collected detailed information seven times over 40 years .
“ Consumption patterns usually change during life , ” Streppel said .
“ This enabled us to study the effects of long - term alcohol intake on mortality . ”
Researchers found that the number of alcohol users nearly doubled from 45 percent in 1960 to 85 percent in the 2000 survey .
Average alcohol consumption rose and then fell at various points during the study .
Users ’ consumption was eight grams a day in 1960 , then survivors ’ consumption was 18 grams a day in 1985 , dropping to 13 grams per day in 2000 .
The percentage of wine users increased during follow - up from 2 percent in 1960 to more than 40 percent among the survivors in 2000 .
“ One can speculate that a protective effect of light alcohol intake could be due to an increase in high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , or to a reduction in blood clotting , due to an inhibition of platelet aggregation , ” Streppel said .
Furthermore , red wine consumption may have an additional health benefit because the polyphenolic compounds contained in wine have been seen in animal to interfere with the formation , progression and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques — the build - up of fatty tissue in the arteries that can result in stroke or heart attack .
“ Those people who already consume alcoholic beverages should do so lightly ( 1 to 2 glasses per day ) and preferably drink wine , ” Streppel said .
“ The cardio - protective effects of alcohol and wine only held up for light alcohol consumption in middle - aged men .
Heavy alcohol consumption may cause accidents and diseases such as cancer and cirrhosis of the liver , even though this was not observed in our study .
Since alcohol consumption can be addictive , starting to drink alcohol because of its positive health benefits is not advised . ”
How alcohol or wine might affect cardiovascular risk merits further research , but right now the American Heart Association does not recommend beginning to drink wine or any other form of alcohol to gain these potential benefits .
The association does recommend that to reduce your risk you should talk to your doctor about lowering your cholesterol and blood pressure , controlling your weight , getting enough physical activity and following a healthy diet and quit smoking , if you smoke .
There is no scientific proof that drinking wine or any other alcoholic beverage can replace these conventional measures .

My regular readers know that I am doing a lot of parallel programming for work .
I am writing my PhD - thesis on it .
I am maintaining this blog on the very topic and have even stated in the past that I love parallel programming and why .
Yet , there are still a few days when I wish things would just go a little smother .
And on even fewer of these days , I hate parallel programming .
This post lists and explains the top five reasons why this is the case sometimes .
It is also my submission for Darren Rowses ( problogger ) new group writing project .
Here they are :
It ’s the platform that matters , and parallel programming platforms are not on par with their sequential counterparts .
This hits me every time I search for a good parallel profiler or debugger .
Or when I am looking for a particular library only to realize that it is not thread - safe and may therefore not be usable for me .
I feel the pain when I am looking at an IDE and it does not understand the parallel constructs I am working with every day .
Thats when I know that parallel programming still has a long way to go before mainstream adaption .
It ’s way too easy to make mistakes ( I have a Top 10 List pending for that topic alone ) , therefore I will not elaborate it here .
The programming languages that many parallel programming systems are based on are either not powerful enough ( C , C++ , Fortran ) , or their performance is suboptimal ( all the scripting languages – yes , you can do parallel programming in some of them – I have even tried it in the past ) .
If you have programmed in a scripting language before , you will know what I mean ( feature - and performance - wise ) .
I do n’t want to care about how many elements fit into my arrays , I have come to expect that the language takes care of that for me , just to name an example .
I guess I am spoiled by programming for the web .
* sigh * Parallel Programming is still mostly a manual process – one needs to think about data - and task - distribution without much help from any tools – which makes the process error - prone and one needs a lot of experience to do a good job at it .
And even with a lot of experience , some of it just boils down to trial - and - error .
And I thought this was supposed to be an engineering process : sad : .
Compilers are buggier when writing parallel code than with sequential code – simply because fewer people write parallel code and therefore the compilers are less well tested in this regard .
I have blogged about this before and unfortunately it is still true for many systems .
I hope this changes soon as more people explore the realm of parallel programming .
There , now you have it – my personal hate - list about the very topic I usually love .
I do realize that it is subjective .
There are e.g. languages suitable for parallel programming that provide a very powerful platform – Java comes to my mind , which I am looking into right now and a lot has changed since the last time I have worked with it ( especially with the concurrency features introduced in Java 1.5 ) – will post about this later .
Whether or not its performance has improved since I last played with it , remains to be seen and is the topic of another post ;-) .
Anyways , feel free to add your very own reasons , what is it that bothers you most about parallel programming ?
I am very anxious to hear your comments !
If you 've used a computer for any length of time , you 've probably clicked through hundreds of End User License Agreement ( EULA ) dialogs .
And if you 're like me , you have n't read a single word of any of them .
Who can blame you ?
They 're mind - numbing legalese .
As a software developer , I understand that choosing a software license for my code is helpful to my fellow developers .
But who , exactly , benefits from an end - user license agreement ?
I 'm an end user , and I do n't recall anything good ever coming from clicking that " I accept " option .
It 's just another meaningless hoop I have to jump through before I can actually use the software .
For all I know , the EULA could specify that the software is going to install a keylogger , steal all my passwords and financial information , send incriminating emails threatening the president , format my hard drive , and then sleep with my wife .
How would I know ?
I blindly clicked that big , fat accept button , same as I always have .
Short of writing software to read the EULA and automatically flag such problems – a conceptually brilliant solution to an intractable problem – what 's a poor " end user " to do ?
The EFF points out a few common problems with EULA agreements you might want to watch out for :
" Do not criticize this product publicly . "
Hidden within the terms of many EULAs are often serious demands asking consumers to sign away fundamental rights .
Many agreements on database and middleware programs forbid the consumer from comparing his or her product with another and publicly criticizing the product .
This obviously curtails free speech , and makes it more difficult for consumers to get accurate information about what they 're buying by inhibiting professional watchdog groups like Consumer Reports from conducting independent reviews .
" Using this product means you will be monitored . "
Many products come with EULAs with terms that force users to agree to automatic updates – usually by having the computer or networked device contact a third party without notifying the consumer , thus potentially compromising privacy and security .
" Do not reverse - engineer this product . "
Some EULA terms harm people who want to customize their technology , as well as inventors who want to create new products that work with the technology they 've bought .
" Reverse - engineering , " which is often forbidden in EULAs , is a term for taking a machine or piece of software apart in order to see how it works .
This kind of tinkering is explicitly permitted by federal law – it is considered a " fair use " of a copyrighted item .
Courts have held that the fair use provisions of the US Copyright Act allow for reverse - engineering of software when the purpose is to create a non-infringing interoperable program .
" Do not use this product with other vendor 's products . "
Vendors use EULAs to make consumers agree that they wo n't use products that evaluate the performance of the software they 've bought , or that can be used to uninstall all or part of the program .
Essentially , clicking " I Agree " to such a EULA means that you 're not supposed to reconfigure your computer to touch or remove the software you 've just installed .
These kinds of EULA terms have become popular lately because many vendors support free versions of their products by packaging them with third - party programs that serve ads or gather information about consumer habits for marketing companies .
If users uninstalled such ride - along programs at will , the vendors might lose revenue .
For example , Claria ( formerly Gator ) is a company that delivers pop-up ads and pays to have its GAIN software bundled in free versions of popular file - sharing program Kazaa .
" By signing this contract , you also agree to every change in future versions of it .
Oh yes , and EULAs are subject to change without notice . "
Put simply , this means that when you install iTunes , you are not only agreeing to all the onerous terms in the box , but you are also agreeing to future terms that may appear in the iTunes Terms of Service months or years from now .
These terms are subject to change without notice , and you do n't even get a chance to click through this future " contract " and agree .
Mere " continued use of the iTunes Music Store " constitutes your agreement to contractual terms that you may not be aware exist .
These kinds of terms are ubiquitous in EULAs and in Terms of Service for countless products .
" We are not responsible if this product messes up your computer . "
The disclaimer of liability for faulty software is perhaps the most important function of a EULA from the manufacturer 's perspective .
And it 's bad news for the consumer .
This term purports to supplant traditional consumer protection and products liability law .
Clicking yes on EULAs containing this common clause means that the consumer cannot file class - action lawsuits against the vendor for faulty products , or for products that do not do all the things that the company advertised they would .
I 've presented only the summary highlights ; I highly recommend reading the rest of the EFF article for much more detail .
Unfortunately , following any of the EFF 's advice requires reading the EULA in minute detail , a time commitment that few are willing to make .
What I 've pictured above are known as click - wrap licenses .
Clicking through indicates assent to the license .
But did you know that the physical act of opening some software can subject you to shrink - wrap license terms ?
Cory Doctorow calls shrinkwrap licenses an epidemic of lawsuits waiting to happen .
I 'm not sure about the lawsuit epidemic , but the jury is definitely still out on whether or not clickwrap and shrinkwrap EULAs are enforceable – or even meaningful .
Clickwrap and shrinkwrap agreements all start with the phrase READ CAREFULLY , in caps .
The phrase means , " IGNORE THIS . "
That 's because the small print is unchangeable and outrageous .
Why read the " agreement " if you know that :
No sane person would agree to its text , and
Even if you disagree , no one will negotiate a better agreement with you ?
Given the insanity of our current predicament , not reading the EULA could very well be the most rational course of action .
Tsukuba University engineering professor Yoshiyuki Sankai could probably give his two weeks notice if he should so desire , as his brainchild -- better known as HAL -- is getting ready for " mass production . "
Cyberdyne has embraced the overwhelming potential available in a fully robotic suit , which could prove handy in such applications such as " walking assistance and rehabilitation , nursing , factory work and disaster relief . "
Having already assisted a paralyzed individual ( almost ) summit a mountain , the robotic suit will reportedly find itself in hospital wards in Tsukuba city ( alongside the HOSPI , presumably ) soon , and the company plans to produce " 20 units " by 2007 , while ramping up to " 400 - 500 " in 2008 .

Appointment in Samarra
Appointment in Samarra Parable ( A conversation between Joseph " Sheppey " Miller and Death ) MILLER : I wish now I ’d gone down to the Isle of Sheppey when the doctor advised it .
You would n’t ‘ ave thought of looking for me there .
DEATH : There was a merchant in Baghdad who sent his servant to market to buy provisions and in a little while the servant came back , white and trembling , and said ,
Master , just now when I was in the marketplace I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I saw it was Death that jostled me .
She looked at me and made a threatening gesture ; now , lend me your horse , and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate .
I will go to Samarra and there Death will not find me .
The merchant lent him his horse , and the servant mounted it , and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop he went .
Then the merchant went down to the market - place and he saw me standing in the crowd and he came to me and said ,
Why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning ?
That was not a threatening gesture , I said , it was only a start of surprise .
I was astonished to see him in Baghdad , for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra .
Origin
The version above is quoted from the 1932 play , Sheppey , by William Somerset Maugham .
The protagonist is nicknamed for the Isle of Sheppey , upon which he was born .
John O'Hara 's 1934 book , Appointment in Samarra , was named for the scene in Maugham 's play .
A version of the story appears in the Babylonian Talmud ( תלמוד בבלי ) , Sukkah 53a . ( סוכה ) : “ R. Johanan stated , A man 's feet are responsible for him ; they lead him to the place where he is wanted .
“ There were once two Cushites who attended on Solomon , and these were Elihoreph and Ahyah , the sons of Shisha , scribes , of Solomon .
One day Solomon observed that the Angel of Death was sad .
‘ Why ’ , he said to him , ‘ art thou sad ? ’ — ‘ Because ’ , he answered him , ‘ they have demanded from me the two Cushites who sit here ’ .
[ Solomon thereupon ] gave them [ the Cushites ] in charge of the spirits [ over whom he had dominion ] and sent them to the district of Luz .
When , however , they reached the district of Luz they died .
On the following day he observed that the Angel of Death was in cheerful spirits .
‘ Why ’ , he said to him , ‘ art thou cheerful ? ’ —
‘ To the place ’ , the other replied , ‘ where they expected them from me , thither didst thou send them ! ’
Solomon thereupon uttered the saying , ‘ A man 's feet are responsible for him ; they lead him to the place where he is wanted ’. ”

US Considering Terrorist Label for Iran 's Revolutionary Guards
The Bush administration is considering a move to designate Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization .
Such a step would subject business interests of the elite Iranian military branch to U.S. financial penalties .
VOA 's David Gollust reports from the State Department .
The action , which officials here confirm is under consideration , would be the first time the United States has placed the armed forces of any foreign government on a list of terrorist organizations .
U.S. officials link the Revolutionary Guards , an elite branch of the Iranian military , with Iran 's presumed nuclear weapons program and the smuggling into Iraq of armor- piercing weapons being used with deadly effect against American troops .
Both the New York Times and the Washington Post reported Wednesday that action against the Revolutionary Guard is pending .
The Post said the designation would be made under an executive order issued by President Bush after the September 2001 terrorist attacks aimed at obstructing the funding of terror groups .
Briefing reporters , State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack said he would not discuss administration actions that might be under consideration , saying among other things that an early tip - off might allow the prospective targets of U.S. sanctions to move threatened assets .
At the same time however , McCormack stressed U.S. concern about the Revolutionary Guard Corps , which he said has been depicted as a " state - within - a - state " with " tentacles " extending into commercial businesses as well as a range of terrorist - related activity .
" We all know about their support for those groups that are going after our troops in Iraq , " he said .
" We also have talked about their supplying arms to the Taleban in Afghanistan , and there have also been numerous news reports about their linkages with Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations around the world .
So quite clearly , this is an entity within the Iranian government that is engaged in a number of different activities . "
A designation against the Revolutionary Guard Corps under the 2001 White House directive would block any assets it may have in U.S. banks and make it illegal for U.S. citizens and residents to have any dealings with it .
It is unclear what practical effect such a move would have , but U.S. officials say it would greatly increase international scrutiny of the Guard Corps ' business activities .
In addition to helping to push two sanctions resolutions through the U.N. Security Council over Iran 's nuclear program , the Bush administration has also been pressing international banks and financial institutions to cease , or limit , business dealings with Iran .
McCormack said the aim of the effort is to persuade pragmatic elements within the Iranian government that seeking nuclear weapons and promoting terrorism are not in the country 's long - term interest :
" The hope is that you find enough reasonable people within the Iranian government who say it 's just not worth it to engage in these behaviors anymore , especially when there is something attractive on the other side on the nuclear front , " he said .
" There is still an attractive offer on the table for the Iranian government .
They can have peaceful nuclear energy in such a way that the international community has objective guarantees that they 're not going to use that technology , and those materials , to build a nuclear weapon . "
The spokesman acknowledged that efforts to get a third , more stringent , sanctions resolution through the Security Council have lagged , though it is a matter of " consistent conversation " for top administration officials including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
The sanctions push is likely to intensify next month when Rice will be in New York for the convening of the new U.N. General Assembly .
Risk taking is an integral part of business and life , but so few people know how to manage it properly .
The word risk has a slightly negative connotation to it — it implies danger , tension , and possible loss .
But risk also has a positive side , the chance of hitting a big win , of getting more on the back side than you invest on the front side .
All risks are not equal , however .
Some risks are just plain dumb , and you should never take them .
But even in those cases , there ’s usually some emotional benefit .
My city of Las Vegas thrives on such benefits .
I do n’t even have to pay state taxes because the 30 + million tourists who come here each year pay them for me ( Nevada has no state tax ) .
In fact , I got a $ 75 refund last year for taxes I never paid because the state had a $ 300 million surplus .
I actually got paid by the state just for living here .
Gamblers provide about half the state ’s revenue .
All those risk takers help pay our bills .
I rather like that .
But what about intelligent risks ?
Those are obviously the ones where the upside outweighs the downside , at least probability - wise .
You wo n’t find too many of those risks in casinos .
Now we all know it ’s generally a bad idea to take dumb risks , where your expected outcome is negative and the potential upside is very limited .
But guess what …
It ’s equally stupid to pass up an intelligent risk , where your expected outcome is positive and the potential downside is very limited .
This is a concept I learned from Jay Abraham .
I had to hear it many times before it really sunk in , but when it finally did sink in , it completely transformed my thinking about risk taking .
The most intelligent risks are those where the potential downside is limited , but the potential upside is virtually unlimited .
Those are the risks you should jump to take .
For example , consider the optimization work I do on this web site .
Suppose I take an hour to review my stats and make some tweaks to the ad layout .
There ’s a risk that my income could go down because I ’ve made a mistake .
But if it ’s a big mistake , I ’ll catch it within a matter of days ( perhaps hours ) and correct it .
I can always restore the layout to its previous “ good ” state , so any decline is temporary .
If it ’s a small mistake , I may not catch it until I review the stats again a month later .
But I ’ll still detect and correct the problem , and if the problem is too small to detect , its effect on the results is negligible anyway .
My worst - case downside risk for optimization work is that I ’ll waste about an hour of my time , I ’ll lose a little bit of money , and I ’ll learn something new .
But what ’s the best case outcome ?
The best case is huge .
I might stumble upon a new layout that permanently boosts income .
And in that case my only investment was an hour of my time .
And the actual result of doing optimization work over the past year is that this year , it ’s going to amount to tens of thousands of extra dollars vs. if I ’d never done any testing and tweaking at all .
In the long run , what I ’ve done already will produce enough gain to pay for my house .
And in total it was maybe 20 hours of work over the course of a year .
But what if I ’d never risked those 20 hours and the possibility that I might temporarily mess up my income ?
Methinks 20 hours for a house is a pretty good deal .
The house is probably worth about $ 350 K today .
This is the kind of risk I ’d be a fool not to take .
The downside is limited and fixed , but the potential upside is wide open .
What kind of total and complete idiot would I have to be not to be willing to trade 20 hours of my time for a house ?
This planet has enough total and complete idiots .
Please do n’t be one of them .
You will lose a lot more by missing big opportunities like this than you ever will from making mistakes .
Here are some other examples of intelligent risk taking :
Ask someone out on a date ( worst case downside = one - time embarrassing rejection , best case upside = lifelong relationship with your soulmate )
Ask for a raise or promotion ( worst case downside = boss says no , best case upside = permanent raise or promotion )
Start a blog ( worst case downside = waste some of your time , best case upside = change your life and the world for the better )
Join a new club ( worst case downside = waste some of your time and quit , best case upside = lifelong friendships plus a lot of other benefits )
Take a cooking class ( worst case downside = waste a little time and money , best case upside = become a permanently better chef )
Are you one of those people that mentally catastrophized my worst case downsides ?
Like instead of a “ one - time embarrassing rejection ” for a date request , you thought about a stalker or a painful divorce ?
If so , maybe it ’s time to turn off the TV and hang out with more positive people .
Most of us are pretty good at avoiding dumb risks , unless you happen to be reading this from a jail cell .
But we ’re exceptionally lousy at taking intelligent risks .
The stupidest mistakes we make are errors of omission .
One of the reasons I ’m so gung ho about personal development is that I see such pursuits as a very intelligent risk - taking .
I might waste a lot of time reading bad books , listening to lousy audio programs , and going to lame seminars , but every once in a while , I hit a huge breakthrough that leaves me permanently changed .
Most of the books , audio programs , and seminars I devour are indeed a waste of time .
Maybe I get a temporary rah rah boost from them , but usually they ’re forgotten soon afterwards .
However , those few gems that help me create permanent change make the entire pursuit worthwhile .
These gems , however , are different for everyone .
One person ’s lump of coal is another person ’s diamond .
So even personal recommendations do n’t help that much .
It ’s like a game of chance , but in the long run , the odds of success are in your favor .
This machine has a long - term payout greater than 100 % .
The key to intelligent risk - taking is to look far enough ahead .
When thinking about personal growth , I do n’t just think a year ahead or five years ahead .
I think across the span of my whole lifetime ( sometimes even thinking beyond the grave … seriously ) .
I ask myself , “ What difference might this make over the span of the next several decades ? ”
Over that timespan even small changes you might make today can create huge long - term payoffs .
And the decision to do nothing today means you ’re automatically denying yourself any long - term benefits .
Doing nothing is n’t neutral .
Doing nothing is way , way negative .
This is one of the reasons it ’s so important to install good habits .
In the short - term , it ’s a struggle , often a painful one .
We have to deal with disappointment again and again .
We fall flat on our faces , dust ourselves off , and throw ourselves into the ring anew , only to be pummeled once again .
And we use that same tired mantra , “ This time it will be different ! ” — a mantra that fails 19 times out of 20 .
What keeps me from getting discouraged when my failures outnumber my successes is to keep thinking long - term .
I often must endure a lot of failures to hit the next big breakthrough .
So I just plow through those failures as fast as possible .
It ’s like a conveyor belt — there ’s a new success on that belt somewhere ahead , and the faster the belt moves , the sooner it will arrive .
It ’s amazing how much long - term difference just a small change you make today can make .
Just a little more self - discipline , a little more courage , a little more persistence , a little more enthusiasm — these can produce huge gains in the long run .
Take a look at the second graph from yesterday ’s blog post on my 2005 traffic and Adsense revenue growth .
That was my income from this web site .
Notice how flat it is during the first four months .
This is the point where most people give up .
Personal growth is often flat in the beginning .
The gains are there , but they ’re just too small to see .
Do NOT give up during the flat period !
The flat period is the hardest because you ’re working hard and getting very little to show for it .
Maybe you keep working on your social skills but ca n’t seem to get a date to save your life .
Maybe you keep working on your internet skills but still can’t figure out how to make your own web site .
Maybe you start a new business and just ca n’t seem to get anything going .
That ’s life .
Give yourself permission to work hard and have little to show for it , as long as you intelligently hold a positive long - term outlook .
I ’ve been working hard on this business for 15 – 1 / 2 months now , but it still generates less income for me than what I could get if I went out and got a job working as a computer programmer .
There ’ve been a lot of people in my life who did n’t understand my long - term thinking .
I ’m sure many of my decisions look really dumb if you only project a month or a year ahead .
I ’ve seen more than one person write about me , “ Steve is either really smart or really dumb . ”
The reality is simply that I have a very long time perspective .
Later this year I ’ll be doing some things that I guarantee will look incredibly stupid from a traditional business perspective , but when I consider what those seeds will likely produce over the next several decades , the outlook is simply amazing .
I have to deal with the same negative criticism and lack of support that everyone else does .
It amuses me that one of my extended family members still wanted me to go out and get a job last year , since she felt it would make me more money in the short term .
I basically write her off as clueless — it ’s not hard to do this when I look at her lifelong results from pursuing the strategy of short - term thinking and fear of risk taking .
Short - term thinking and risk aversion dominate this planet .
A person like me who embraces intelligent risk and thinks decades ahead does n’t fit in very well here .
That was a bit of a problem for me when I was younger , but now I just embrace it .
It ’s simply who I am .
I get all the support I need from my connection to my purpose and from feeling a sense that I ’m working to serve the highest good of all .
The whole world could turn against me , and it would n’t make me want to give up .
It would probably just inflame me more .
I never get discouraged because I believe my approach to life will produce some amazing results in the long run .
It ’s only a matter of time .
Love is more powerful than fear .
I overcome fear of risk by tapping ever more deeply into what I love most .
The thought of taking a risk produces excitement instead of anxiety .
Find an intelligent risk you can take today .
Most likely it wo n’t pan out .
But what if it does ?
Celebrate either way because no matter what the outcome , you ’ll gain courage just by making the attempt .
