Mitchell Lawrence is serving a two year prison sentence for the heinous crime of not only selling pot ( Gasp ! ) , but doing it within 1,000 feet of a school ( Double Gasp ! ! ) .
The government will spend close to $ 100,000 to incarcerate this horrible criminal for a non-violent , victimless act .
Meanwhile , your friendly police continue to get away with committing violent crimes against innocent civilians .
Apparently the only individuals they “ Serve and Protect ” are those profiting from the illegality of certain drugs .
The Drug Policy Alliance released a movie about the situation :
The National Academies of Science produces regular reports on the state of scientific research in the US .
Their latest effort along these lines has just been released , and the academy has put the spotlight on physics in a report entitled Condensed - Matter and Materials Physics : The Science of the World Around Us. Despite the dry title , this is an area of physics that Ars readership cares deeply about , even if it does n't realize it : advances in this field have produced the electronics revolution that we 're relying on to read this page .
The report identifies six key questions that will represent the grand challenges that materials science will face over the coming decade : the ones most likely to produce the next revolution .
But it also raises fears that those challenges will be met by researchers outside of the US .
It highlights the fact that government funding has not kept up with the rising costs of research at the same time that the corporate - funded research lab system has collapsed .
As a result , US scientific productivity has stagnated at a time when funding and output are booming overseas .
The report makes a series of recommendations that it hopes will get US physics research booming again .
The grand challenges of materials science
Materials science , as the report notes , is not only a broad field of inquiry itself , but advances in materials science enable advances in many other fields , and its progress has a direct impact on consumers .
Our understanding of the physical and chemical properties of materials has become essential to creating various processors , sensors , light sources , etc .
As such , the grand challenges proposed in the report drift into areas such as biology and computer science :
How do complex phenomena emerge from simple ingredients ?
How will the energy demands of future generations be met ?
What is the physics of life ?
What happens far from equilibrium and why ?
What new discoveries await us in the nanoworld ?
How will the information technology revolution be extended ?
The report suggests that meeting these challenges will be essential not only for our scientific understanding , but for future economic growth as well .
The countries that do the most to meet them will benefit the most economically .
Although the US has dominated the field during the 20th century , a number of reasons are listed to suggest that it is poorly positioned to continue at this pace .
As someone who has followed the funding situation in biology carefully , the problems facing physics appear to be essentially identical .
Stagnating research
The total grant money dedicated to the field has barely outpaced normal inflation over the last decade , but lab costs ( especially salaries of students and fellows ) have shot up at a much faster rate : grant buying power has declined by 15 percent as a result .
Because of this , researchers are applying for more grants , sending the competition up and success rates down : overall funding rates have dropped from 38 percent to 22 percent .
New investigators , who are generally thought to take more aggressive and innovative approaches , are faring even worse as their success rates have dropped by more than half and now stand at only 12 percent .
The net result is that the academic community is now devoting far more of its time to writing grants , a shift that has come at the expense of directing and publishing research .
In the past , academics have had an escape route from the pressures to retain funding : the " blue sky " research labs run by major companies , such as AT&T's Bell Labs .
But the report refers to these institutions as " once great , " since recent years have seen them closed , sold off piecemeal , or refocused on product development .
Combined , these changes have caused US research output to shrink in comparison to the rest of the world .
Based on publications in Physical Reviews B and E , the US contribution to papers has remained flat over the last decade , while papers originating from other countries have nearly doubled .
The report predicts that this reduced output will ultimately exact a price on the American economy .
Money for new directions
Many of their recommendations for correcting the situation are similar to the proposed solutions for other fields of research .
Grant success rates should be brought up to the neighborhood of 30 percent , and the funding amounts need to be adjusted to compensate for the fact that academic researchers are now paid semi-reasonable wages .
Grants should be pushed towards small research groups , as these are the major source of innovations .
More minorities and women should be brought into the field , and career flexibility needs to be provided so that researchers do not have to choose between career and family needs as often .
There are three recommendations that stand out as being distinct from those proposed for other fields .
Two suggest restructuring the way grant money is currently allocated .
The National Science Foundation currently lumps interdisciplinary studies and educational programs in with other grants , where they are evaluated by people who may not have an appropriate background to judge them .
The report recommends that the NSF recruit expertise across fields ( such as the physics / biology overlap ) specifically to provide a decent evaluation of grant proposals .
It also suggests an emphasis on education and outreach programs , which are essential to increasing public understanding of science and attracting a new generation of researchers .
These programs need to be targeted to both college and K - 12 education , and the funding for them needs to be separated from general research funds .
Evaluations of education grants need to be separated as well , as research scientists are often incapable of properly evaluating them .
But the most radical proposal is that the equivalent of the great industrial labs needs to be reestablished .
It suggests that all interested parties , ranging from industry through the Department of Defense and Energy to the academic world , should meet and determine what 's needed to recreate the research environment they once fostered .
Unfortunately , beyond calling for these discussions , the report is remarkably vague about how to resuscitate these now moribund labs .
Prospects for change
Most of the recommendations of this report are very similar to those proposed for other fields of research .
As such , they face a common set of financial and institutional problems .
With the federal government expected to be in deficit for the indefinite future , it 's not clear whether funding for science will outstrip inflation any time soon .
Given that , any efforts to increase the value of grant money will have to come at the expense of the number of grants , a shift that would surely meet resistance from the scientific community .
Similar resistance would be expected to greet changes that favored small research groups , as these will come at the expense of established investigators that wield the most political clout .
The educational proposals are in line with the general scientific community 's recognition that it 's facing a public that 's poorly equipped to evaluate the scientific developments that affect them directly and are thus unable to make reasoned decisions regarding funding and research allocations and restrictions .
It 's hard to say whether they will be enacted , but the proposed changes would make for one of the better structured efforts at public outreach I 've encountered .
In contrast , the proposal to return to the days of large labs that sit on the border between basic research and product development are frustratingly vague .
I find it hard to imagine that anyone would view it as a bad idea , but in the absence of money , a plan , and a clear view of who would be involved , it seems to be an invitation to talk rather than action .
This is a shame , because it's hard to question the contention that they made huge contributions to science in general and materials science in particular .
The report is right that materials science is likely to be key to both scientific and economic advances over the coming decade , and the lack of an achievable plan leaves the US likely to be left out on some of them .
Did Bill Gates say the 640 k line ?
February 20 , 2007
Posted by Imran Ghory in etymology
“ 640 K ought to be enough for anybody . ” - Bill Gates ( 1981 )
One of the most quoted lines of the computer era .
Certainly the most quoted line attributed to the Microsoft founder .
However it is only “ attributed ” as in 1996 Bill decided to publically deny it in an interview :
INTERVIEWER
I read in a newspaper that in 1981 you said , “ 640 K of memory should be enough for anybody . ”
What did you mean when you said this ?
BILL GATES : I ’ve said some stupid things and some wrong things , but not that .
No one involved in computers would ever say that a certain amount of memory is enough for all time .
(…)
We at Microsoft disagreed .
We knew that even 16 - bit computers , which had 640 K of available address space , would be adequate for only four or five years .
[ source ]
But I ’m not convinced by this denial .
Normally when someone denies saying something they do so fairly soon after the event .
This as far as I can find is his first denial of this quote , and is at least four years after the quote was originally popular ( usenet posts from 1992 refer to it ) and fifteen years after it was allegedely made .
Somehow I find it hard to believe that someone can remember everything that they said 15 years ago .
Of course Mr Gates goes on to back up how he never said it by talking about how Microsoft knew back in 1981 ( the year the IBM PC launched ) that 640 k would be too small in 4 - 5 years .
It ’s a pity Mr Gates seems to have forgotten an interview with the Smithsonian just three years prior , in which he talked about how they were surprised when they ran up against the 640 k limit in 1986 / 1987 .
BILL GATES : It [ 640 K ] was ten times what we had before .
But to my surprise , we ran out of that address base for applications within — oh five or six years people were complaining .
[ source ]
So either Mr Gates has trouble remembering these things or he ’s trying to rewrite history to make Microsoft seems more prescient .
Which of course he ’s never done before .
For a long while this quote was taken as “ true ” , after the denial it became false .
But given the unreliability of Mr Gates claims I think that until someone comes up with some more evidence we should label this quote as having what snopes terms “ undetermined or ambiguous veracity . ”
Update : from the 1989 interview linked to by Dan Oblak :
BILL GATES :
I have to say in 1981 making those decisions I felt like I was providing enough freedom for ten years , that is the move from 64 k to 640 k felt like something that would last a great deal of time [ source ] – quote is at 22:28
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog has reached an “ understanding ” with North Korea on verification of the shutdown and sealing of the North ’s Yongbyon reactor , Kyodo news agency said on Friday .
Olli Heinonen ( C ) , nuclear safeguards director for International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , talks to reporters in Pyongyang June 29 , 2007 , after an inspection of the Yongbyon nuclear facility that North Korea has promised to mothball as part of an aid - for - disarmament deal , Kyodo news agency reported .
REUTERS / Kyodo
The head of the U.N. delegation said he was satisfied with a tour of the reactor complex north of Pyongyang that the secretive state has promised to scrap under an aid - for - disarmament deal , Kyodo said .
“ We have now a mutual understanding how to do the verification and monitoring of the Yongbyon facilities when they will be shut down and sealed , ” Kyodo quoted International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) Nuclear Safeguards Director Olli Heinonen as saying .
“ I think it was a very good visit , and we saw a lot of facilities , ” Heinonen told reporters after concluding his talks with North Korea .
The visit to the Yongbyon reactor , about 100 km ( 60 miles ) from the capital , is the first by IAEA officials since Pyongyang kicked out the Vienna - based agency ’s inspectors in December 2002 .
The communist state subsequently opted out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , announced that it had atomic bombs and , last year , carried out its first nuclear test .
The reactor at Yongbyon was still operating , Heinonen was quoted as saying on his return to Pyongyang .
“ We are satisfied , ” Heinonen said , adding that the IAEA team had been able to see all of the sites it wanted to , including a plutonium reprocessing plant where weapons - grade material can be extracted from spent fuel rods .
UP TO SIX COUNTRIES
After talks later on Friday , Heinonen said the question of when the shutdown would begin was up to the six countries involved in talks on Pyongyang ’s nuclear arms program .
“ Now it ’s up to our board of governors to make a decision .
We will go back home and report the results of this discussion , ” Kyodo quoted the IAEA official as saying , adding that the board would meet “ maybe in one week ’s time ” .
The sprawling Yongbyon complex of more than 100 buildings is at the heart of North Korea ’s nuclear program , which dates back to at least the 1980s .
In South Korea , the Yonhap news agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry official as saying : “ The IAEA could announce the date ( for Yongbyon ’s shutdown ) as early as this week . ”
A diplomat close to the IAEA had said earlier that if the team finalized terms for an inspection mission , the agency ’s 35 - nation board of governors would meet -- probably on July 9 -- to ratify the deal .
Kyodo said “ five places ” would be subject to inspections .
The disarmament deal , under which Pyongyang would receive energy aid , security guarantees and better diplomatic standing in return for scrapping its nuclear arms programs , was stalled for weeks by a dispute over some $ 25 million in North Korean funds frozen in a Macau bank at Washington ’s behest .
Following the release of the funds , North Korea agreed this week to implement the deal it struck in February with South Korea , China , the United States , Russia and Japan .
South Korean Foreign Minister Song Min-soon , in Washington for talks with U.S. officials , has hinted at a possible early resumption of the six - way nuclear disarmament talks involving North Korea and those five countries .
“ It would be effective to hold the talks at an appropriately linked time with the shutdown , ” Song told South Korean reporters , Yonhap said .

The speed at which ice - sheets are melting is one of the projects
International Polar Year ( IPY ) will see thousands of scientists , from more than 60 nations , working together on 220 projects at high latitudes .
Scientists hope to improve their understanding of how changes to the polar regions affect the planet .
IPY will be officially launched in Paris on 1 March , but the UK's programme , involving 65 institutions , was unveiled on Monday in London .
IPY actually runs for two years in order to allow equal coverage of both the Arctic and the Antarctic .
It is organised by the International Council for Science ( ICSU ) and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .
Global scale
There have been three previous IPYs - held in 1882 - 83 , 1932-33 and 1957 - 58 - each of which led to scientists gaining a much better knowledge of the remote regions .
The UK research programme was unveiled at a ceremony , attended by the Princess Royal , at the Royal Society in central London .
Cynan Ellis-Evans , head of the UK 's national committee , said much of the research that will carried out during the next two years would be part of existing projects .
" But the difference with IPY is that ... these large numbers of nations are going to be working together , " Dr Ellis - Evans explained .
One example , he said , was a project called the Census of Antarctic Marine Life ( CAML ) .
The project will investigate the distribution and abundance of marine biodiversity in the region .
A " virgin geography " bursts into spectacular life
In pictures
It involves scientists from 18 countries , and aims to provide a benchmark against which future changes , including climatic shifts , can be measured .
" This activity would never have been possible outside the IPY , " he added .
Martin Siegert , who is leading a UK team that will explore Lake Ellsworth , a subglacial lake 2 km beneath the Antarctic ice , explained why the IPY was so important to scientists .
" Fifty years ago , the third International Polar Year happened .
The reason for that period of activity was because we realised that we did not know anything about Antarctica , " the professor of geoscience at the University of Edinburgh told reporters .
" The situation has actually not changed too much - we still know very little about Antarctica and the Arctic .
But the big difference is that we now know the regions are very important .
" So exploration is very much on the agenda for this IPY , " Professor Siegert revealed .
There are six major research themes within the programme :
determine the current environmental status of the polar regions
quantify past and present environmental and social changes , and improve future projections
understand links between the poles and the rest of the planet
investigate the frontiers of science in the regions
use the polar areas to develop and enhance observation of the Earth 's interior and of space
explore the cultural , historical and social aspects of circumpolar human communities
Ice loss
One of the institutes that will be playing a leading role in IPY is the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) .
Chris Rapley , BAS director , said that growing awareness of the threats posed by changes to the climate made the 24 - month programme timely .
In terms of scientific breakthroughs ...
I think the year is going to be a very significant one
Malcolm Wicks
UK Science and Innovation Minister
" In many respects the Antarctic , although it is geographically distant , is in everyone 's backyard , " he said .
" A warmer world always results in less ice and higher sea levels . "
One area of research involved trying to understand how much and how fast ice - sheets would melt as temperatures rose , Professor Rapley explained .
" The palaeo - evidence has been very thin and patchy , because when the major blocks of ice have collapsed in the past , they have not left much evidence of how quickly it happened .
" International Polar Year will allow us to marshal the resources of all nations that are capable of addressing those issues in an intensive way , and speed up delivery of the answers . "
' Significant year '
The UK's Science and Innovation Minister , Malcolm Wicks , last week visited the BAS research station at Rothera to see first - hand the work being carried out by scientists .
" The significance of the International Polar Year is that it brings together some of the globe 's best scientists to work together on a number of different projects , " he said .
" In terms of scientific breakthroughs and the accumulation of knowledge of this vital area , I think the year is going to be a very significant one . "
Ahead of the IPY 's launch , a team of researchers on the CAML project completed a 10 - week census of marine life in a near - pristine stretch of Antarctic seabed .
The lack of Arctic summer sea ice threatens polar bears ' survival
The team , led by researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute , Germany , found a number of likely new species , and gained an insight into the dynamics of the polar ecology .
" What we learned from the ... expedition is the tip of an iceberg , so to speak , " said team leader Michael Stoddart .
" Insights from this and CAML 's upcoming International Polar Year voyages will shed light on how climate variations affect ice - affiliated species living in this region . "

One of the few things i miss when programming in Scheme is ML - style function currying .
ML , Haskell and OCaml come with this handy feature that allows you to obtain new functions from a given one by calling it with an ‘ incomplete ’ number of arguments .
Fortunately , we have macros in our programmable programming language , and actually there ’re lots of them floating around providing implementations of currying in Lisp .
But today , Piet Delport posted ( during a discussion in # scheme ) the nicest currying macro i’ve seen so far :
( define - syntax curried ( syntax - rules ( ) ( ( curried ( ) body ... ) ( lambda ( ) body ... ) ) ( ( curried ( arg ) body ... ) ( lambda ( arg ) body ... ) ) ( ( curried ( arg args ... ) body ... ) ( lambda ( arg . rest ) ( let ( ( next ( curried ( args ... ) body ... ) ) ) ( if ( null ? rest ) next ( apply next rest ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define - syntax define - curried ( syntax - rules ( ) ( ( define - curried ( name args ... ) body ... ) ( define name ( curried ( args ... ) body ... ) ) ) ) ) ;;;;
Sample usage : ( define - curried ( foo x y z ) (+ x (/ y z ) ) ) ; ; foo has arity 3 ( ( foo 3 ) 1 2 ) ; ; ( foo 3 ) is a procedure with arity 2 ( ( foo 3 1 ) 2 ) ; ; ( foo 3 2 ) is a procedure with arity 1
This code shows the elegance and power of hygienic syntax - rules macros , which allow you to extend the language seamlessly , incorporating new features as if they were native .
It also makes for a pretty instructive demonstration of how to take advantage of higher - order functions and recursion , nicely combined .
All that in just a few lines !
If you ’re new to Scheme and want to learn more about similar magic , be sure to read JRM ’s syntax - rules Primer for the Merely Eccentric .
You ’ll have a great time .

I ’ve always considered it arrogant of humankind to burn enough fossil fuel to kill off half the earth ’s species .
But the NASA chief would call me arrogant for judging .
What ’s really arrogant , he says , is assuming that climate change wo n’t be for the better .
So NASA does n’t prioritize studying climate change from space in its $ 17 billion budget .
NASA Administrator Michael Griffin , a Bush appointee , tells NPR :
I have no doubt that …a trend of global warming exists .
I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with … .
I would ask which human beings — where and when — are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today , right now is the best climate for all other human beings .
I think that ’s a rather arrogant position for people to take .
Right .
Why wo n’t future generations be better off after the sixth great extinction ?
What ’s wrong with displacing 1 billion of the world ’s poorest people ?
Who are we to judge ?

North Waziristan provides a base for cross - border attacks
On Tuesday the Pakistani government signed a peace agreement with pro-Taleban militants in North Waziristan , a semi-autonomous tribal area next to the Afghan border .
Over the past year the army has been targeting Taleban and al - Qaeda fugitives who use the lawless region as a base to launch attacks in Afghanistan .
But their supporters among the local tribes were drawn into the fight , leading to fierce battles that killed hundreds .
The accord is meant to end the violence , and it is viewed here as an implicit admission that the government 's military strategy has failed .
Deal brokered
According to the terms of the deal , the tribesmen promised to stop attacking the army and to stop crossing the border to fight in Afghanistan .
The government agreed to halt major ground and air operations , free prisoners , retreat to barracks , compensate for losses and allow tribesmen to carry small arms .
A 10 - member committee is charged with implementing and monitoring the agreement .
A driving force behind the negotiations was the governor of North West Frontier Province , which borders North Waziristan , Lt Gen Ali Mohammed Aurakzai .
He welcomed the accord as " unprecedented in tribal history " , and said the inter - tribal council that brokered it had resolved a complicated issue within a few weeks .
Some commentators , however , declared it a victory for the militants .
Possible outcomes
" The government policy has swung from one extreme to another , from the use of brute military force to what appears to be total capitulation to militants , " wrote Ismail Khan of the Dawn newspaper .
I think this accord will give legitimacy to the militants
Rahimullah Yusufzai
Taleban expert
But will it work ?
Similar deals in neighbouring South Waziristan did stop attacks on Pakistani soldiers , although it strengthened the hand of locals who shared the ideology and views of the Taleban .
The accord may ease domestic pressure on President Musharraf , especially from religious parties , which have accused him of waging war on his own people .
Whether it stops cross - border movement remains to be seen .
Implied message
There could be initial success as the various stakeholders seek to show the deal is working .
But regional observers are sceptical .
And the government will face US , Nato and Afghan demands to resume operations at any sign of violation .
The accord highlights what many analysts here see as the contradiction at the heart of Gen Musharraf 's leadership .
As a key US ally in the " war on terror " , he is under pressure to crack down on Islamic extremism .
But politically that is difficult in a country where sympathy with the Taleban and opposition to American policy run deep , including within his own armed forces .
He will no doubt be explaining details of the peace deal in Kabul .
But it is unlikely either the Afghans or the Americans want to hear the message it seems to imply - that the solution is to accommodate and work with the Taleban , rather than confront and try to defeat them militarily .

Shane Fernandes in Mumbai was recently speaking to a customer in the US about a credit card scheme .
Many call centre workers in India resent being abused
He thought he had won over the customer , but just at the last minute the American learnt the young , sweet - talking agent was calling from a call centre in India .
" He just refused to deal with me because he found out I was an Indian , " recollects Mr Fernandes .
Others working in India 's burgeoning call centres have been verbally abused and accused of taking jobs formerly carried out in Europe or the US .
Many Indian call centre workers are relatively young , having joined straight from college , and they are not used to and often find it hard to cope with the abuse .
Some leave , others have their confidence sapped .
True , tantrums by customers in the services industry are not uncommon in any country .
But it is the racial overtones that worry young professionals in India 's multi-billion - dollar Business Processing Outsourcing industry .
HAVE YOUR SAY
People who give abuse should remember we 're working to earn a living , we do n't do it for fun
Monica , London , UK
Send us your comments
" Some customers will ask us if we use electricity and watch TV , " says Madhavi , a call centre worker who declined to give her surname and who spoke to the BBC on the condition that her company 's name would not be mentioned .
" You may keep smiling , but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth , " says Gaurav Mantri of Transworks , a Mumbai - based call centre .
" You wo n't believe it .
Once a customer asked one of my colleagues if he goes to work on a bullock cart . "
Job losses
An Indian organisation of professionals , called The Young Professionals Collective , recently compiled a report after talking to many call centre agents in Mumbai , Pune , Hyderabad , Delhi and Bangalore .
Most callers are well behaved towards call centre workers
The body has urged the country 's labour ministry to look into the complaints of racial abuses and prejudices heaped on India 's young workforce .
Mumbai - based lawyer Vinod Shetty , who formed the collective , says most of the abuses reflect the frustrations of the jobs being shifted to India .
" Mostly they say Indians are dirty and that they do n't have brains and they are illiterates , " he says .
" Sometimes , the abuses reflect their prejudices and anger at job losses [ in their own countries ] . "
Answering back
" Once a US customer called , after I read the welcome script he asked immediately where I was located .
When I said India he said he did n't wish to continue and he hung up , " says Mahal , who believes the problem starts when a customer is genuinely upset about a product or when he does n't understand the heavy Indian accent .
Team leader Nikhil urges his junior colleagues to take it on the chin and keep smiling .
But Mr Fernandes answers back .
" I do n't keep quiet on calls like these , but I make sure I do n't cross the limits of decency . "
Mr Fernandes is lucky .
Others who have answered back have been sacked .
But customers who misbehave are in the minority .
" Yes we get loads of callers who do n't think well of us , but in my experience 80 % of callers are pleasant and they even say how much they love India and the Taj Mahal , " says Madhavi , who has been working at a call centre for 18 months .

This article originally appeared in the April '07 issue of Esquire .
Late last November , an episode of 60 Minutes examined the potentiality of a prescription drug called propranolol .
Reported by Lesley Stahl , this was the first time I 'd ever heard of propranolol , and I have n't seen any major news source mention the drug since that evening .
This , I suppose , is not surprising ; in fact , I suspect many people stopped reading this column the moment they hit the word propranolol and did n't immediately recognize what it was .
But propranolol might be the most philosophically vexing pharmaceutical since Prozac :
It openly questions the significance of reality .
This seems wonderful and terrifying at the same time .
Propranolol is the closest society has come to making the 1996 film Brain Candy seem prophetic .
Understanding propranolol begins with understanding adrenaline , specifically how adrenaline impacts memory .
Try to recall the most intense moments of your life ( car accidents , fistfights , over - the - top sexual encounters , et cetera ) .
In most cases , you will remember the details from those events far more vividly than less meaningful , more conventional episodes from everyday existence .
This is ( at least partially ) the product of adrenaline ; the cerebral rush of adrenaline that accompanies intense circumstances burns those memories into your brain .
1
Adrenaline makes us remember things .
When humankind was young , this process offered a sociobiological evolutionary advantage :
If Early Man got especially freaked out by a tiger attack , that hardwiring taught him to stay out of tiger country .
However , tigers are no longer a pressing issue in Modern Man 's life .
Today , adrenaline more often makes Modern Man remember the events he 'd most like to forget .
This is why we have disorders like posttraumatic stress :
Many people ( and particularly war veterans ) cannot psychologically overcome the worst moments from their life ; the experiences never stop seeming vivid .
Adrenaline has galvanized memories they do n't want to recall .
This brings us to propranolol .
Many people ( and particularly war veterans ) cannot psychologically overcome the worst moments from their life ; the experiences never stop seeming vivid .
If a surplus of adrenaline makes us remember , it stands to reason that a deficit of adrenaline would help us forget .
And this is what propranolol does .
It inhibits the chemical rush that makes memories hyperconcrete .
It does n't erase memories , but it makes them more abstract and less painful .
In theory , giving accident victims immediate doses of propranolol could dramatically change how lucidly they remember the horror of a specific experience .
What 's even crazier is the possibility of propranolol working retroactively :
It appears that patients might be able to erode traumas from the distant past by ingesting the drug and self - triggering memories on purpose ( i.e. , you repeatedly take propranolol and fixate on something that happened twenty years ago — over time , that specific memory grows hazy and normative ) .
It is hard to imagine how propranolol , used judiciously , would n't be good for society .
It 's impossible to justify why a nine - year - old who watched his parents get murdered needs to remember precisely what that looked ( and felt ) like ; I 'd feed that theoretical kid a cereal bowl of propranolol .
But the problem ( of course ) is that our society is traditionally terrible at judicious drug use .
And while the application of propranolol almost always seems reasonable on a case - by - case basis , the idea of propranolol2 is significantly more complicated .
How big is your life ?
That is neither a rhetorical nor impossible question .
The answer is easy : Your life is as big as your memory .
Forgotten actions still have an impact on other people , but they do n't have an impact on you ; this is the entire point of Memento .
Reality is defined by what we know , and we ( obviously ) can't know what we do n't remember .
What this means is that propranolol provides an opportunity to shrink reality .
It does n't make past events wholly disappear from the mind , but it warps their meaning and context .
So if people 's personalities are simply the aggregation of their realities ( and if reality is just an aggregation of memories ) , it can be argued that propranolol is a drug that makes people 's lives artificially smaller .
This makes certain kinds of people nervous , including those involved with the President 's Council on Bioethics .
" The place of memory in the pursuit of happiness suggests something essential about human identity , " states the PCOB in a 2003 study titled Beyond Therapy : Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness .
" By ' rewriting ' memories pharmacologically we might succeed in easing real suffering at the risk of falsifying our perception of the world and undermining our true identity . "
As is so often the case with scientific innovations that feel like hypothetical problems , it 's easy to imagine dystopian worst - case scenarios3 involving propranolol .
What if the government used this drug to intensify the brutality of warfare , knowing the long - term cost on soldiers could be chemically mitigated ?
What if people used it simply because they did n't want to fixate over ex-girlfriends4 or the 1982 NFC championship ?
It would seem that propranolol — like virtually everything else invented by man — has a short - term upside and a long - term consequence .
The small picture provides benefits for victims of genuine pain ; the big picture suggests a confused society that consciously elects to expunge the pain that makes us human .
But perhaps there is a third picture that 's even bigger :
Do people have the right to create their reality ?
Who gets to decide the size of someone 's life ?
Do people have the right to create their reality ?
Who gets to decide the size of someone 's life ?
For a variety of reasons , the premise of taking a pill that changes your relationship with a memory seems scary .
But we are already doing this all the time ; our current means are just less effective .
People get drunk in order not to care about things .
People watch escapist movies to distract themselves from the stress of real life .
Most significantly , we all distort the emotive meaning of our own past , usually without even trying ; that 's what nostalgia is .
So let 's assume that propranolol was abused to the highest possible degree ; let 's assume people started taking propranolol to edit every arbitrary memory that contained any fraction of mental discomfort .
Ideologically , this would almost certainly be bad for the health of the world .
But I still do n't think it 's something we could ethically stop people from doing .
The risk , I suppose , is that average people might behave differently if they had no fear of remorse or humiliation ; instead of thinking , I will regret this in the morning , they might think , I better remember to make myself forget this in the morning .
Few things have been worse for society than the cultural evolution away from personal responsibility ; I have no doubt that the world would be better off if more people felt guiltier about more things .
But that sentiment is only my reality , and it's a specific reality I have created .
The PCOB is certainly correct : Drugs like propranolol probably are " undermining our true identity . "
But I 'm pretty sure that 's precisely what a lot of people want .
1 This research is predominantly credited to James McGaugh and Larry Cahill at the University of California , Irvine .
2 Just in case you 're wondering , propranolol was not created for this purpose ; it was originally designed as a heart drug .
3 People do this all the time .
Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996 ; not coincidentally , Gattaca was released the next year .

Amazing things happen when you give people a bit of trust and authority to do things according to their own judgment .
I was reminded of this a few weeks ago when I stumbled upon a Fast Company article called Engines of Democracy .
It describes a revolutionary jet engine plant in Durham , North Carolina that produces some of General Electric 's most important engines : the GE90 , the CF6 , and the CFM56 .
I 'm going to quote from it heavily , but you really should read the whole article .
GE / Durham has more than 170 employees but just one boss : the plant manager .
Everyone in the place reports to her .
Which means that on a day - to - day basis , the people who work here have no boss .
They essentially run themselves .
How does that possibly scale ?
Self - managed teams .
The jet engines are produced by nine teams of people -- teams that are given just one basic directive : the day that their next engine must be loaded onto a truck .
All other decisions -- who does what work ; how to balance training , vacations , overtime against work flow ; how to make the manufacturing process more efficient ; how to handle teammates who slack off -- all of that stays within the team .
Not only are the teams self - managing , they have unprecedented authority and transparency .
Everyone knows how much money everyone else makes , because employees are paid according to his or her skill ...
This plant has no time clock .
Workers leave to go to their kids ' band concerts and Little League games .
The results are pretty compelling :
When it all comes together , GE / Durham can accomplish things that are almost unheard of -- even in the world of sophisticated manufacturing .
Although comparisons between GE plants are difficult -- no two plants do exactly the same kind of work , with exactly the same kind of overhead to support it -- Bob McEwan , who has authority over GE / Durham says simply , " They are the best in the GE Aircraft Engines division . "
The most interesting measure may be one that the people at GE / Durham talk about themselves .
They do n't really think that their main job it so make jet engines .
They think that their main job is to make jet engines better .
Amazing .
But you do n't have to be a highly skilled worker making jet engines to see this at work .
Anyone flying on Southwest Airlines has seen this too .
Scott Gatz , in Trusting a community to get it right , observed the following :
You might think that the SWA gates would be a madhouse , but in fact they are very orderly .
People arrive and begin to lineup into three lines ( A , B and C ) in a quite orderly fashion .
People in each row are cordial to each other asking �is this the line for B to san diego ? � and exchanging niceties and often that question allows people to break into a friendly conversation .
If you were to look at the gate area from above , you�d see what looks like three branches on a tree , they curve around the furniture and the walls , but they are a line .
He goes on to compare it with America West :
A throng of people surrounded the doorway to their gate , each trying to push past each each other so they could get to their seat earlier ( even though they know they are guaranteed to sit in the same seat no matter how quickly they board ) .
And he connected the dots :
It struck me that this is a lot like community on the web , if you give people a little guidance and a benefit , they�ll actually organize themselves just fine .
On SWA , the benefit of being orderly is a smoother travel experience and a good seat and the guidance is telling people where they stand � those that are in line C know that no amount of pushing will get them good seats and those in A know that they are gonna be in a seat they like no matter what .
On AW , they don�t ask anything of the traveller , they don�t trust the travellers to line up , they treat travel as a solitary experience �every man for themselves� .
And it shows .
Duh , right ?
Well , maybe .
On the web , we�ve seen some really interesting communities grow : flickr , delicious , craigslist .
All of them give benefits to people in the community ( tags make it easier to find stuff , the tools allow you to connect with friends or meet new people or sell stuff , etc ) and all give a simple amount of guidance �to get those benefits , we�d like you to tag , post , rate , report bad stuff , etc� .
And you know , the community organizes itself .
Those communities police themselves a bit .
There�s abuse ( �people cutting line� ) , but its buried deep down in the site because the community won�t rate it or will report it .
Those communities help me find where the good stuff is , because , that�s what they�d want someone to do for them .
And the sites actually ask people to do it and reward people for doing it right .
Really quite simple .
To summarize : give people some trust and authority .
They deserve it .
You 'll be amazed at what they can do without you supervising their every move .
It works for employees and customers .

In a move which has single - handedly brought the worldwide average respectability of journalists down by at least two points , the UK's free Metro newspaper has run the complete non-story of a young Animal Crossing : Wild World player , whose mother has banned her from playing the game due the filth and depravity inherent to its makeup .
The girl 's mother has taken this action after everyone 's favourite cute and cuddly village simulator apparently used the phrase " f*** ing cow " , unprovoked and completely without warning .
Either oblivious to , or ignoring the fact that AC : WW is not only an online game , but also allows players to customise its lexis , the woman seemingly then felt the need to take the " news " to the Metro , who then ran it .
I despair , I really do .
Not only does one look at the screenshot of the incident in the Metro 's story make it plainly clear that the phrase in question was a a piece of user created dialogue ( identified by its blue highlighting ) but the fact that a national paper like the Metro saw this as newsworthy , rather than a blatent piece of stupidity or attention seeking , is thoroughly depressing .
Whether the phrase was the work of another player , a previous owner of a second hand copy , or the girl herself may never be known ; but regardless of the explanation , the fact that this was printed at all is embarrassing to all concerned .
While the Metro have been steadily building a reputation for slack - jawed sensationalism for quite some time , this is a step up even for them , and I can't imagine the girl 's mother is going to be too impressed once she gets to the bottom of things either .
A bit of research , people ...
Seriously , it helps .

60 Minutes tells the story of how pharmaceutical industry lobbyists literally wrote the historic Medicare Prescription Drug Bill and twisted arms to get the necessary votes to have it passed in the middle of the night .
Correspondent Steve Kroft documents how many of the congressmen and staffers who worked on the bill later went on to work for the drug companies their legislation helped enrich .

" The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill , " says [ Republican Congressman Walter ] Jones .
" The bill was over 1,000 pages .
And it got to the members of the House that morning , and we voted for it at about 3 a.m. in the morning .... I 've been in politics for 22 years , and it was the ugliest night I have ever seen in 22 years . "
CBS :
If you have ever wondered why the cost of prescription drugs in the United States are the highest in the world or why it 's illegal to import cheaper drugs from Canada or Mexico , you need look no further than the pharmaceutical lobby and its influence in Washington , D.C .
In January , one of the first things the new Democratic House of Representatives did was to make it mandatory for Medicare to negotiate lower prices with the drug companies .
A similar measure faces stiff opposition in the Senate , where the drug lobby is spending millions of dollars to defeat it .
The president has already announced that if the bill passes , he will veto it .

One Daddy Too Many
December 13 , 2006 .
James C. Dobson 's op - ed piece on Mary Cheney 's pregnancy in the current issue of Time reveals his ignorance on a number of counts and says nothing that would indicate he knows enough about parenting to be the head of an organization called Focus on the Family .
The motto of that organization is " Nurturing and Defending Families Worldwide . "
Dobson is clear that the only family he will defend is the one with a daddy , a mommy , and kids .
His best family ever would be a Christian family .
Some of those families are quite nice .
The daddy does n't abuse the mommy and the kids are n't whacked by the parents on a regular basis .
The parents spend a lot of time with their children as they are growing up .
They nurture them , teach them important values , and love them enough to stand back when they grow up and let them make their own way in the world .
However , unless my local newspaper editor and the managers of every television station in America are part of a conspiracy to keep the truth from us , the fact is that having a daddy around might be the worst thing in the world for many mommies and kids , even Christian mommies and Christian kids .
What inspired Dobson to write his essay " Two Mommies is One Too Many " was the news story that Mary Cheney , the lesbian daughter of Dick Cheney , is pregnant with a child she intends to raise with her partner , Heather Poe .
Dobson 's sure that the child would be better off if Ms. Poe were replaced with a Mr. Anybody .
How does he know this ?
Like anybody defending the indefensible , Dobson cites scientific studies that show how it 's better to have a daddy in the home .
Anyone who can't find a baker 's dozen contrarian scientists to support the insupportable is n't trying very hard .
However , Dobson cites the work of Dr. Kyle Pruett of Yale Medical School , who has publicly stated that " There is to date no credible research that says children raised by gay and lesbian couples are at risk . " *.
I guess Dobson thought he could intuit Pruett 's work by reading the title of his book : Fatherneed : Why Father Care Is as Essential as Mother Care for Your Child ( Random House , 2001 ) and copping a few quotes that sounded to his liking .
Dobson also finds comfort in an unnamed article that appeared in Psychology Today ten years ago .
The bottom line ?
" A father , as a male parent , makes unique contributions to the task of parenting that a mother cannot emulate , and vice versa . "
Dobson takes this to mean that science has shown that you need a penis to teach a child things like " justice , fairness and duty . "
Penisless people can teach " sympathy , grace and care " and " give a child a sense of hopefulness " but science has shown that you need a penis to " provide a sense of right and wrong . "
We know what sense of right and wrong Mr. Cheney has displayed publicly * lying and deceit are right , even if it means thousands will die , as long as your agenda is promoted  but we can only wonder what moral lessons he taught his daughter .
You may need a penis to provide a child with a sense of right and wrong , but that does n't mean that the sense of right and wrong you provide is right .
In any case , Dobson 's views are n't those of most scientists who have studied the issue of raising children .
Media Matters for America has noted ( here , here , and here ) that studies have consistently found that children raised by gay or lesbian parents suffer no adverse effects in their psychosocial development because of their parents ' sexual orientation .
One exception might be that such children are subject to taunting and physical abuse by the children of good Christians and others with homophobic fathers .
Anyway , Dobson believes it is important that boys learn " maleness " and they can only get that understanding from men , " ideally from their fathers . "
He does n't elaborate on what " maleness " is but given his other Christian notions of how people should behave and relate to each other , we can speculate that maleness involves dominating , protecting , and providing for females and disciplining children in the tried and true methods of hitting them and threatening them with eternal suffering if they do n't toe the line .
Dobson might even recommend that fathers with " maleness " imitate his hero , the god of the Old Testament , who drowned people or otherwise caused them great torment and suffering before annihilating them for not doing his will .
A little waterboarding or death by stoning might be just the right measure for a disobedient child .
If a child has two mommies the kid might grow up too hopeful or too sympathetic .
God forbid .
Dobson also thinks that his intuition is right on this issue .
Children need a mother and father , he says .
No , they do n't .
Children need loving , caring parents who wo n't intimidate them with threats of eternal damnation for themselves or their friends .
Children would certainly benefit from having a good mother and a good father who raise them , but they do n't need either one .
A single male or female can provide a better environment for a child than many two - parent households .
It all depends on what the parents are like , not on whether there is at least one person with a penis and one with a vagina ruling the roost .
Dobson says that he believes that " birth and adoption are the purview of married heterosexual couples . "
Yet , he would not hesitate to make it illegal for a married heterosexual woman to get an abortion .
If it were up to him , Mary Cheney would give up her child to a married heterosexual couple .
This is the kind of " maleness " that many Christians adhere to .
They would and have taken children away from their mothers to have those children raised as Christians .
What kind of moral imbecile does n't recognize that it is immoral to take a child away from a mother who is willing and able to care for her child ?
I 'm not saying Dobson is advocating taking Cheney 's child from her .
I 'm saying that he is implying that it would be better for the child if she were to give it up for adoption to a married heterosexual couple .
He has no rational argument to defend this position so he claims it is part of " God 's design " and " divine plan . "
He should study some other religions .
Some , with as much validity as Dobson , claim that polygamy is god 's plan .
If he reads the Bible , he 'll find all kinds of absurd notions about " maleness " and how fathers act toward children .
Anyone who thinks the Bible provides a model for good family values is not worth listening to .
Read Judges 19 .
The story is about an old man who gives up his concubine to a group of men who rape her all night so they wo n't sodomize him .
( His host was willing to offer up his daughter to the rapists . )
The next day he slices her up with his knife and " together with her bones , into twelve pieces ... sent her into all the coasts of Israel . " *
The man is not condemned for his evil behavior .
Read Luke 14:26 : If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother , his wife and children , his brothers and sisters — yes , even his own life — he can not be my disciple . *
Nobody takes this literally , I would think .
But the message is clear :
You must detach yourself from the people and things you love in this world if you are to be a disciple of Jesus .
Read Matthew 10:34 - 37 :
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword .
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law .
And a man 's foes shall be they of his own household .
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
Even the most benign interpretation of this passage can't twist it to reflect the kind of family values that many Christians like Dobson claim their religion supports .
These are the kinds of indecent values extolled by the mob and street gangs .
Dobson makes the mistake of comparing homosexuals having or adopting children to no - fault divorce , which he notes has caused a number of social problems .
Economic and emotional differences between fatherless or motherless homosexual families and single parent families resulting from divorce result in many fewer social problems with the former .
When homosexual families break up , they suffer the same kinds of problems that plague heterosexual families that break up .
But to compare every homosexual family to divorced families is unfair and irrelevant .
Dobson 's last bit of displayed ignorance is his claim that Cheney and Poe are part of " another untested and far - reaching social experiment . "
Where has he been for the past half century ?
The experiment is over .
The data is in and Dobson 's missed it .
He 's living in a biblical dream world if he thinks that his idea of the traditional family is the " foundation on which the well - being of future generations depends . "
In any case , we do n't need another generation of children taught that it is good to believe in irrational stories told by moral busybodies who think they know what is best for the rest of us .
postscript :
The news of Mary Cheney 's pregnancy caught Fox 's Bill O'Reilly 's attention .
Today on his television show , he rhetorically asked Family Pride executive director Jennifer Chrisler : " nature dictates that a dad and a mom is the optimum , does it not ? "
I can't be sure , but I think he means to use the expression " nature dictates " in pretty much the same was that Dobson uses " intuition " or " God 's design . "
It 's like the " I gotcha trump card because this is a no brainer " for these folks .
In any case , even if nature did dictate how the family should be structured , that would not prove that the structure it dictated was the best for the family members .
It would only mean that it was the best for nature and the only meaning I can give to that infelicitous expression is that more offspring would be produced by this structure than any other .
That might be an issue O'Reilly is interested in , but it 's not one that particularly excites me .
There are many things that may be thought of as " dictated by nature " or " natural " that are evil .
Fortunately , humans are rational creatures and are capable of recognizing that nature does n't always know best .
If we listened to nature , for example , we would probably be providing cultural support for polygyny .

The founder and chief executive of JetBlue Airways , his voice cracking at times , called himself “ humiliated and mortified ” by a huge breakdown in the airline ’s operations that has dragged on for nearly a week , and promised that in the future JetBlue would pay penalties to customers if they were stranded on a plane for too long .
David G. Neeleman said in a telephone interview yesterday that his company ’s management was not strong enough .
And he said the current crisis , which has led to about 1,000 canceled flights in five days , was the result of a shoestring communications system that left pilots and flight attendants in the dark , and an undersize reservation system .
Until now , JetBlue and its low fares have enjoyed overwhelming popularity and customer satisfaction ratings .
The crisis began Wednesday when an ice storm hit the Eastern United States .
Most airlines responded by canceling more flights earlier , sending passengers home and resuming their schedules within a day or two .
But JetBlue thought the weather would break and it would be able to fly , keeping its revenue flowing and its customers happy .
On the contrary , JetBlue ’s woes dragged on day after day .
On Saturday night , for instance , the airline said that the 23 percent of flights it had canceled on Saturday and Sunday would also be canceled Monday .
The confusion led to angry exchanges between customers and employees , prompting the airline to call out security personnel .

A judge in Kansas City , Kansas , on Friday issued a temporary restraining order requiring that two area newspapers remove articles from their website which reported on alleged malfeasance by the Board of Public Utilities ( BPU ) .
Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Kelly Moorhouse found in a 3 - page order [ PDF ] that the stories were based on privileged attorney - client information , which was leaked to the newspapers , and that publication of any portion of it would cause " irreparable harm " to the BPU .
The Kansas City Star and The Pitch , a local news weekly , both reported about the forced removal of the material and their intention to appeal the rare judicial decision to censor their reporting .
A story was also run about the matter by AP .
At the end of this article The BRAD BLOG will run the Kansas City Star 's short article in full since it has been ordered removed --- foolishly in our opinion , particularly in the Internet age when such stories are instantly archived , as was this one , by Google 's cache engine --- and appears clearly to be in the best interest of the public and their right to know about how their public utilities are being run ...
The Star 's dangerous version of the story alleges that , according to a confidential " liability analysis " prepared by an attorney for the BPU and then leaked to the papers , " At least 15 projects and upgrades at power plants operated by the Board of Public Utilities of Kansas City , Kan. , may have violated federal clean air laws . "
According to The Star , the document ( which we have n't seen , so we cannot corroborate their reporting ) " layed out the odds for the BPU of the risks of penalties by the Environmental Protection Agency .
It examined 73 projects that may not have followed regulations . "
" Of those , " reported the now - censored paper , " 15 were ' probably not defensible ' and another 15 were ' questionable . ' "
The lede in the Pitch 's version of the censored story ( also now posted in full below ) reports that the BPU " may be liable for thousands of dollars in fines for failing to comply with anti-pollution regulations , according to a confidential document . "
An EPA spokesperson contacted by the Pitch said that " The BPU has not contacted the agency to disclose its failure to seek repair permits and follow regulations when making upgrades " to their coal - powered plants .
" Any one of those projects ' puts BPU at risk ' for an audit by the EPA , " the confidential document reportedly warned .
The BRAD BLOG still strongly believes in the First Amendment , despite the continuing assault upon it over the last several years .
We 've seen a similar case to the BPU matter , in that of Stephen Heller , the courageous whistleblower who we covered here extensively , after he leaked attorney - client privileged documents which revealed wrongdoing by the voting machine company Diebold , Inc .
Heller 's act was performed for the greater good and in the public interest .
Diebold similarly tried to stop the Oakland Tribune from running those documents , but failed in their attempts to stop publication .
Hopefully BPU will eventually fail as well .
According to The Star 's coverage of the censorship , the newspaper 's editor and vice president Mark Zieman said , " To have a published story pulled from our Web site is unprecedented and unbelievable . "
We concur .
Further , the paper reports :
Cases of prior restraint — in which the government tries to prevent the publication of information — are extremely rare .
In Near v. Minnesota , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government attempts to censor the media are presumed unconstitutional .
Over the years , the court has repeatedly ruled that courts can try to prevent the dissemination of information only if it presents a " clear and present danger " or a serious and imminent threat to the administration of justice .
The Pitch reported in their coverage :
“ This judge made a serious error .
The injunction so clearly violates the First Amendment that we have no choice but to fight for these fundamental principles in the appellate courts , ” said Steve Suskin , legal counsel for Village Voice Media , the Pitch ’s parent company .
“ The ruling does n’t just threaten the freedom of the press , it hurts the people of Kansas City , ” added Pitch editor C.J. Janovy .
“ They deserve some answers .
Moorhouse ’s ruling clearly goes against the public interest . ”
With all of that in mind , the Google cache version of the original Star story is here .
But should that be taken down as well for some reason , we 've posted the story in full below , feel free to copy it , paste it , and share it with your friends --- those still in favor of the Constitution and the freedom of the press , in any case ...
UPDATE : The Pitch 's version of the story is also found via Google cache .
It 's still available here .
That story is now also posted in full , in solidarity , below .

At least 15 projects and upgrades at power plants operated by the Board of Public Utilities of Kansas City , Kan. , may have violated federal clean air laws , according to a confidential BPU document .
The document , obtained from an anonymous source by The Kansas City Star , was prepared in 2004 by an attorney to lay out the odds for the BPU of the risks of penalties by the Environmental Protection Agency .
It examined 73 projects that may not have followed regulations .
Of those , 15 were “ probably not defensible ” and another 15 were “ questionable , ” it said .
The document , which calls itself a “ liability analysis , ” says that the utility could be subject to thousands of dollars in fines .
It also says the BPU has the choice of approaching the EPA to reach a settlement or waiting for the EPA to initiate action .
It is unclear which course the BPU took .
EPA and Kansas Department of Health and Environment officials said they did not know anything about possible violations .
BPU officials could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon .

A confidential report reveals the utility did n't follow federal pollution regulations when upgrading its plants .
Justin Kendall
Published : March 1 , 2007
The Board of Public Utilities in Kansas City , Kansas , may be liable for thousands of dollars in fines for failing to comply with anti-pollution regulations , according to a confidential document obtained by the Pitch .
The document was prepared November 16 , 2004 , by lawyer Stanley A. Reigel .
It weighs the pros and cons of admitting to the Environmental Protection Agency that upgrades at BPU power plants did not comply with the federal Clean Air Act .
The report was hand - delivered to Marc Conklin , BPU general counsel and human resources director .
The report is stamped “ CONFIDENTIAL ” and warns against duplication without Conklin ’s approval .
Conklin did not return a call from the Pitch .
BPU spokeswoman Susan Allen also declined to comment and instead sent an e-mail that read : “ BPU cannot comment on a BPU confidential report .
The Pitch should be aware that it possesses a confidential , legally protected document .
The document should be returned to BPU . ”
Mary Gonzales , president of the board of directors that oversees the utility , said Thursday that she was unaware of the report .
Reigel did not immediately return a phone call on Friday to his office at the law firm of Stinson Morrison Hecker in Kansas City , Missouri .
When Reigel ’s report was written , the EPA was auditing utility companies to see whether upgrades and repairs made after 1980 at coal - powered power plants followed federal guidelines .
The letter indicates that the BPU was preparing to respond if audited by the EPA .
However , it ’s unclear what action , if any , the BPU took after Reigel delivered his letter .
Kim Olson , an EPA spokeswoman in Kansas City , tells the Pitch that the BPU has not contacted the agency to disclose its failure to seek repair permits and follow regulations when making upgrades .
According to Reigel ’s letter , his report was spurred by a November 14 , 2003 , analysis of BPU ’s coal - fired power plants by Burns & McDonnell Engineers .
The engineering firm estimated that upgrades to the plants to make them comply with federal regulations would cost the utility nearly $ 160 million .
Reigel ’s 15 - page document identifies 73 repairs or upgrades that may not have followed EPA rules .
The work was done at the utility ’s three power plants : Nearman Creek Power Station , Quindaro Power Station and the now - closed Kaw Power Station .
The work was completed between January 1980 and November 2004 .
Reigel determined that 15 of those repairs and upgrades were “ questionable ” and another 15 projects would be “ probably not defensible ” if the EPA conducted an audit .
Any one of those projects “ puts BPU at risk ” for an audit by the EPA , Reigel warned .
Fines for utility companies in similar cases amounted to $ 1,000 for each megawatt of energy produced by the plant .
Together , the Nearman and Quindaro plants produce 631 megawatts .
The audits Reigel refers to in his letter fall under an EPA initiative called New Source Review .
The program was established by Congress in 1977 as part of the Clean Air act .
It requires permits before construction on new power plants .
It also calls for modifications at plants to be “ as clean as possible , ” according to the EPA ’s Web site .
Reigel ’s report indicates that the BPU did not get the permits “ for any of the projects . ”
“ Thus , failure to conduct pre-project NSR and failure to monitor post - project emission constitutes a violation itself , unless the project is exempt , even if the project does not increase actual emissions above the allowable increment , ” the report says .
Having trouble waking up on time ?
If your boss is on the verge of firing you , or you 're about to flunk out of a class for being good at being late , these 10 easy tips should help you get out of the bed on time .
1 . Make sure you are getting enough sleep .
I do n't care if you 're Superman .
If you try to sleep for only 2 hours each night it just is not going to work .
I 've tried a couple different sleeping arrangements but the most effective will always fall between 5 - 8 hours of sleep a night .
Remember , sleep is vital for muscle growth , fat loss , overall health , mood , and much more .
Get those ZzzzZZZ 's just do n't over or under do it .
2 . Invest in a quality alarm clock that will wake your neighbors up if you had to .
If you think you 're in control of that internal clock , think again .
Get an alarm clock with a nice large display so that you can tell what time it is when it rings .
3 . Before you go to sleep make the conscious choice to wake up at " x " time .
This way when you get your wet dreams interrupted by your ridiculously loud alarm clock , you will see the time and force yourself to get up .
4. Avoid the Snooze Function of Death .
They made the snooze function for one reason and one reason alone .
For you to be too lazy to wake up .
Never use that function .
5 . When your alarm goes off .
Wake up and STAY UP !.
Do not go crawling back to your bed .
Your bed is anchored in your mind as your sleeping haven .
The second you place your groggy hand back on that bed you 'll fall asleep faster than a Jennifer Lopez movie .
6 . Place that alarm clock as far away from you as possible .
There is no use placing the alarm clock next to your bed , you might as well unplug it and cuddle with it while you sleep .
Put the little sucker in a place where it will still scream at you in the morning , but make you work to shut it up .
I preferably like it next to my sink and shower so I can wake up and be there to shower or brush my teeth .
7. Move On !
the second you wake up , move on to your next daily habit .
Brush your teeth , take a shower , drink some coffee ...
8 . Turn some music on when you wake up .
I 'm not talking that little dinky music on your alarm that makes Rap sound like Polka .
Jump on the computer and turn on a jam with a beat .
Music controls emotions and body rhythms , use this tool to energize you in the morning .
9 . Let the light in .
The importance of the sun cannot be explained to a mere mortal like you .
The sun regulates serotonin levels deciding if you 're either happy or like them poor Alaskans , plagued with S.A.D.'s syndrome ( depressed ) .
The sun also regulates your circadian cycle ( your natural alarm clock ) which makes it easier for your grumpy ass to wake up .
10 .
Try to make your days as fun and non-stressful as possible .
It 's a lot easier to wake up looking forward to what is ahead of you then to wake up and want to stay in bed to hide from your troubles .
Be a man and do what needs to be done !
If worse comes to worse , click the email me button on the top of this page , send me your name , number , and address , and I will personally come down with a club to wake you up ( do n't ask me what the club is for ) .

Whatever opinion they hold of the invasion and occupation of Iraq , most people in the UK and the US at least claim to want to see that country governed by democracy and the rule of law , and free from sectarian and ethnic division .
To judge the value of those claims , witness the sheer indifference politicians and the media in those two countries have shown to an independent Iraqi initiative created to achieve those very goals : the Iraqi National Foundation Conference .
The INFC describes itself as an umbrella group " composed of academics , professionals , community leaders , religious scholars and veteran moderate Arab - nationalist politicians .
It straddles sectarian and ethnic divides , and attempts to formulate the widest platform possible " .
In the face of growing societal division , it has revived inter-communal prayers , the hallmark of the 1920 revolution against British colonial rule .
Membership is open to anyone who will subscribe to its minimum points of unity : withdrawal of the occupying forces troops and opposition to any division of Iraq on an ethnic or sectarian basis .
The INFC does not enjoy the publicity enjoyed by the Indian Congress Party before independence , or the African National Congress during apartheid .
But when people who oppose the occupation are asked what they would favour instead , the INFC may well provide some of the answers .
Certainly the anti-war movement in the US and the UK should see building substantive links with the group as an urgent and immediate priority .
Two high - level representatives of the INFC - Media Coordinator , Saad Jawad and General Secretary , Sheikh Jawad Al Khalisi - visited the UK this week .
On Wednesday 5 September they spoke to a group of anti-war activists about the desperate situation in Iraq , and the solutions that their group was proposing .
Since the western political classes have conducted a long debate over the past few years on what is best for the future of Iraq without substantially involving any actual Iraqis in those discussions , the rest of this article will simply relate the words of the INFC representatives at the London meeting .
Saad Jawad said that the occupation was effecting the " demolition " of Iraq .
He said that before the war , western journalists had asked him why he thought the US wanted to invade .
He would offer two reasons : oil and enhancing Israel 's security .
The journalists would laugh and say that there was a lot more to it than that , for example democracy , human rights and so forth , which gave Saad Jawad his turn to laugh .
Now , he feels that the position they took at the time has been demonstrated to be the more accurate .
Saad Jawad said that the US has consistently interfered in the workings of the new government .
It stood in the way of that government 's formation for three months after the election , and then gave it just three months to draft a permanent constitution under its supervision .
In addition , we have heard Hilary Clinton saying that Ibrahim al - Jaafari can not be accepted as Prime Minister and George Bush saying that there will be no Islamic state in Iraq , so one can see clearly that any " democratic " choices that Iraqis make are assessed strictly in terms of what is acceptable to Washington .
Saad Jawad also alleged that oil exports from Iraq are not being recorded , that the counters at oil drilling stations are turned off , and that in effect , the country 's natural resources are being plundered .
Sheikh Jawad Al Khalisi began by saying that the western media ought to be covering this independent project for Iraq 's future .
For him , the phrase " the new Iraq " is a misnomer .
Freedom , democracy and human rights do not exist in this " new Iraq " .
Even Iraq 's new government understands that it is the occupier that pulls the strings .
The occupation works by division , along sectarian and ethnic lines , for example through the Transitional Administrative Law imposed by the US , or through the effects of US military actions .
Since divisions preclude a unified Iraqi response to occupation , one can say that there is essentially no Iraqi state or government in existence .
Furthermore , the new constitution does not reflect the interests of Iraqis .
It is devised to entrench and exacerbate division , and as such could well pave the way to civil war .
The referendum on the constitution is not internationally organised or monitored , and thus is illegitimate .
It is also illegitimate because it comes as the result of the illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq .
Iraq is without democracy and human rights .
But it is also without even the most fundamental necessities required for a basic standard of life to exist ; things Iraqis once took for granted , such as sanitation and security .
To overcome the present situation Iraq must return to legality ; a legality arising from the will of Iraqis .
The UN has recognised this , but the US does not .
There are great dangers in continuing with the occupation because of the divisions it imposes on Iraq : dangers to the country , and dangers to the wider region .
The INFC 's solution is an independent , pan -Iraqi plan for the nation 's future , in accordance with international law and under UN auspices .
The Sheikh told the group a story that might offer some hope for the future , as talk of civil war continues to grow .
Last week , several hundred Shia pilgrims in Baghdad were killed in a stampede sparked by rumours of a suicide bomber in their midst .
The worst of the carnage occurred on a bridge over the river Tigris between Sunni and Shia districts .
A railing broke and many people fell into the river and drowned .
An Iraqi champion swimmer - a Sunni - was on the scene and managed to save six people who had fallen from the bridge .
He then saw a seventh , a Shia woman , but was unable to save her , and they drowned together .
This , the Sheikh said , was already becoming a symbol for Iraqis , who want societal divisions to be overcome at this critical and violent time .
Many people from Falluja gave blood to help the victims of the stampede , so hope for enduring Iraqi unity can be drawn from this story .
The INFC representatives were asked why the constitution could not be accepted as it is and the principle of legal precedent used to build upon it .
Saad Jawad 's response was twofold .
First , why should we Iraqis , who gave the very concept of written laws to the world , adopt a constitution that was essentially written for us by the US ?
To impress them ?
To show that we are civilised ?
Secondly , is it advisable for us to use legal precedent to build on a foundation , the current draft constitution , that is itself fundamentally flawed ?
Sheikh Jawad Al Khalisi underlined this point .
He said that as he understood it , a precedent is a legal step taken in the absence of a specific law .
But the constitution is based upon illegality , and sound legal precedents cannot be made upon such a basis .
The UN Secretary General has said that the invasion of Iraq was illegal .
The legality of the war has been questioned by a great many international lawyers , many of them British .
The constitution is not only based on illegality , but flows from political power , and is designed to serve those ends .
The INFC representatives were asked what steps had been taken to work with the UN .
Sheikh Jawad Al Khalisi said that the INFC has been in contact with the United Nations since June 2004 , before the so - called " transfer of sovereignty " from the occupiers to the interim Iraqi government .
At the time , the INFC put it to the UN that it should be the UN that controls and administers the transitional process .
Lakhdar Brahimi , the UN representative in charge of drawing together the interim administration at the time , agreed with the INFC proposals , but he was removed from the scene and the US instead dictated the course of events .
Iyad Allawi was imposed as interim Prime Minister by the US , against Brahimi 's wishes .
Before the January 2005 elections , the INFC told the UN that , in order for it to participate , the elections should be held within the context of an international legal framework and under international observation .
Failure to meet these basic conditions made the elections illegitimate , and this applies to the forthcoming constitutional referendum and the subsequent parliamentary elections as well .
Sheikh Jawad Al Khalisi said that the INFC welcomes the support of those in the UK who oppose the war and occupation .
He also welcomed the growing anti-war sentiment in the United States , as people there are awaken to the reality of the situation in Iraq .
He said that the INFC has handed to the US detailed , formal requests for the withdrawal of its armed forces .
Any negotiations or discussion between the US and the INFC must be accompanied by a strict timetable for ending the occupation .
When asked what we in the UK could do to help , Saad Jawad asked that people continue to bring pressure to bear on the UK government , particularly regarding the illegality of the war .
A large anti-war demonstration in Central London has been planned for 24 September 2004 and an international peace conference , bringing together US , British and Iraqi groups , will be held at the end of the year .
Saad Jawad said that he and the Sheikh would be happy to attend the peace conference , " if we survive " .

Let ’s admit that the oil price is increasing rapidly and this really burden all of us .
It seems you need to have a lot of cash to fill up the petrol just to go around the city .
We all know that oil will never last long and about 20 - 30 years it will depleted .
So we should look for any alternatives where it is much safer , cleaner and cheaper .
After watching “ Who Killed The Electric Car ” DVD , I ’ve been thinking electric car is the best solution for all commuters to move around the city whether you ’re going to work or for mothers to pick up their kids at school and buy some groceries .
But some of the electric cars can’t really go that far even though it is great for commuters .
There are good signs where battery technology are improving each year and recently the development of other battery alternatives like ultracapacitor or supercapacitor and electromagnetic field will make electric car a dream come true .
Hopefully , these technologies will not be surpressed by oil companies and energy companies that monopolise the economy for centuries .

I always excited about electric cars and hybrid technologies as an alternative solution .
So I ’ve searched a lot of videos on Google and YouTube and also reading some articles about it .
I ’m also amazed how Google also put their effort in to this development .
RechargeIt.org is one of Google.org project where they collaborate with A123 Systems and Hymotion to convert their list of hybrid cars into plug - in hybrid cars .
This is so cool .
I love how they put their data on the site that shows how many miles or kilometers that they can go with fuel on board of the car .
Plus how much voltage are used in a single charge of the battery and comparison of the percentage of Carbon Dioxide emission between the plug - in hybrid cars and average car in the America .
I wish I had one hybrid cars where it could save me from filling up too much petrol in it and also save the environment .

Modern humans are bacteria - killing machines .
We assassinate microbes with hand soap , mouthwash and bathroom cleaners .
It feels clean and right .
But some scientists say we 're overdoing it .
All this killing may actually cause diseases like eczema , irritable bowel syndrome and even diabetes .
The answer , they say , is counterintuitive : Feed patients bacteria .
" Probiotics ( pills containing bacteria ) have resulted in complete elimination of eczema in 80 percent of the people we 've treated , " says Dr. Joseph E. Pizzorno Jr. , a practicing physician and former member of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy .
Pizzorno says he 's used probiotics to treat irritable bowel disease , acne and even premenstrual syndrome .
" It 's unusual for me to see a patient with a chronic disease that does n't respond to probiotics . "
Clinical trial data on probiotics is incomplete , but there are many indications that hacking the body 's bacteria is beneficial .
In sheer numbers , bacterial cells in the body outnumber our own by a factor of 10 , with 50 trillion bacteria living in the digestive system alone , where they 've remained largely unstudied until the last decade .
As scientists learn more about them , they 're beginning to chart the complex symbiosis between the tiny bugs and our health .
" The microbes that live in the human body are quite ancient , " says NYU Medical Center microbiologist Dr. Martin Blaser , a pioneer in gut microbe research .
" They 've been selected ( through evolution ) because they help us . "
And it now appears that our daily antibacterial regimens are disrupting a balance that once protected humans from health problems , especially allergies and malfunctioning immune responses .
" After the Second World War , when our lifestyles changed dramatically , allergies increased .
Autoimmune diseases like diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease are increasing , " says Kaarina Kukkonen , a University of Helsinki allergy expert .
" The theory behind ( what causes ) the diseases is the same : Lacking bacterial stimulation in our environments may cause this increase .
I think this is the tip of the iceberg . "
In a recent study , Kukkonen and her colleagues gave a probiotic containing four strains of gut bacteria to 461 infants labeled as high risk for developing allergic disorders .
After two years , the children were 25 percent less likely than those given a placebo to develop eczema , a type of allergic skin inflammation .
The study was published in the January issue of Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology .
Microbial exposures early in life , scientists believe , cause mild inflammation that calibrates the body 's responses to other pathogens and contaminants later in life .
Without exposure as infants , researchers say , people can end up with unbalanced immune systems .
" Many of the most difficult problems in medicine today are chronic inflammatory diseases , " says Blaser .
" These include rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , atherosclerosis , eczema and multiple sclerosis .
One possibility is that they 're autoimmune or genetic diseases .
The other possibility is that they are physiological responses to changes in microbiota . "
Blaser 's specialty is Helicobacter pylori , a strain once common in every human stomach but now rare in the West .
Its disappearance may have benefits : H. pylori- related inflammation is associated with peptic ulcers and some stomach cancers .
However , H. pylori also reduces acid reflux , which in turn is associated with asthma and esophageal cancers .
H. pylori's decline , says Blaser , correlates with a rapid rise in those afflictions .
H. pylori deficiency may also contribute to obesity , he says , because the bacteria help regulate production of two hormones , ghrelin and leptin , that affect metabolism and appetite .
Low levels of Bacteroidetes have also been linked to obesity .
Studies indicate that bacterial imbalances are associated with irritable bowel syndrome , post - surgical infections and type 1 diabetes .
The health - food movement has moved ahead with probiotics without regard for clinical trial results .
Women commonly use supplements like acidophilus to treat yeast infections .
Other probiotics are making their way into products such as Kashi Vive cereal " to help you care for your digestive system " and Dannon 's Activia yogurt , which in its first year boasted more than $ 100 million in sales .
But scientists say over - the - counter probiotics are of inconsistent quality .
Pizzorno , for example , buys his probiotics from companies that sell directly to doctors .
Consumer probiotics do n't always contain medically recognized bacterial strains , he said , and often the bacteria they contain are dead .
" Most of the companies do n't have any research ongoing at all , " says Stig Bengmark , a University of London hepatologist .
" They buy cheap bacteria from yogurt companies and say it 's good , but it 's never proven . "
To more precisely hack the gut bacteria , Blaser calls for a Gut Genome Project , modeled after the Human Genome Project .
It 's a daunting task :
The human genome , mapped to great fanfare but still dimly understood , contains a tenth of the genes believed to be in our gut bacteria .
But though difficult , such research could prove vital .
" The world is very aware of the concept of global warming , which is a macro- ecological change , " Blaser says .
" I postulate that there are similar micro-ecological changes going on inside us . "
Comment on this story .
Altair is a rapidly rotating star and is elongated in shape
It confirms that Altair , one of the brightest stars in the night sky , is a rapidly spinning , non-spherical body .
Until now , telescopes have only been powerful enough to zoom in on the Sun or on rare giant stars outside of the Solar System .
But researchers , writing in the journal Science , say they got around this problem by combining the light from four separate telescopes .
We 're testing the theories of how stars work in much more detail than ever before
John Monnier
Lead researcher John Monnier , an astronomer at the University of Michigan , US , said : " What may not be obvious to most people is that until now we have not really had the zoom - up capability with our telescopes to make images of stars that are like the Sun . "
Compared with the Sun , which can be imaged in spectacular detail , and some rare gas giants , stars outside of the Solar System simply appear as specks of light through even the most powerful telescopes .
Professor Monnier said : " Even Altair , which is pretty close at 15 light - years away and very bright , would be very challenging to zoom - up on .
In order to do this , you would need a telescope that is about 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) across - and that is a long way beyond our engineering capabilities . "
Elongated shape
To image Altair , which is the brightest star in the Aquila constellation ( The Eagle ) and clearly visible to the naked eye , the researchers harnessed the power of four telescopes at Georgia State University 's Center for High Resolution Angular Astronomy ( Chara ) .
Altair appears as a speck from other telescopes
Professor Monnier told the BBC News website : " By combining and processing the light from the four smaller telescopes , using a new instrument called the Michigan Infrared Combiner , we are creating an image as if it is coming from a much bigger telescope . "
The result was a detailed surface image of Altair .
Previous research had suggested that this bright star was spinning very rapidly - about 60 times faster than our home star .
But until now , the effect of the rapid rotations on its shape was not clear .
Professor Monnier said : " Computer models had given very basic predictions of what happens if you have a star that is spinning very fast , but our image definitely confirmed that this star was elongated in shape . "
The Sun has been imaged in spectacular detail
The centrifugal forces created as the star was spinning were flattening it into an oval shape , he said .
However , the image also revealed that the amount of distortion and changes in surface temperature at the equator differed from current models .
Professor Monnier said : " Since we have a lot more data and the images are very powerful , we can do the modelling again to give a new level of detail .
" We 're testing the theories of how stars work in much more detail than ever before . "
Founder 's Rant
by John Buckman , founder / owner Magnatune was born out of some observations I 'd gathered about the music industry , along with personal experiences from my wife releasing her CD on an Indie record label .
Personal experience :
When my wife was signed to an Indie record label , we were really excited .
In the end , she sold close to 1000 CDs , lost all rights to her music for 8 years ( even though the CD had been out of print for several years ) , and earned a little over $ 100 in royalties ( no one is really sure ) , some of which was paid to her as CD copies of her own CD which she then gave away for promotion .
The record label that signed her was n't evil : they were one of the good guys , and gave her a 70/30 split of the profits ( of which there were few ) .
The label got screwed at every turn : distributors refused to carry their CDs unless they spent thousands on useless print ads , or they did n't pay for the CD 's sold , etc .
In general , all forces colluded to prevent this small , progressive label from succeeding .
She was one of the lucky ones .
We knew several musicians , signed to various labels , who were also frustrated , who received no money ever and who lost the rights to their music forever .
Industry Observations : Radio is boring : everyone I know is into interesting music , yet good music is rarely played on the air .
I 'm into everything from Ambient , Industrial , Goth , Metal to Renaissance , Baroque , Tango , Indian Classical and New Age ( and many other genres ! ) , and so are many of my friends .
Yet , these genres are barely visible in record stores , and totally absent from the airwaves .
Radio is mostly about Country , Pop , and Rock , with a little bit of dull , safe classical thrown in .
CDs cost too much , and artists only get 20 cents to a dollar for each CD sold .
If they 're lucky .
And , most CDs quickly go out of print : I buy more CDs from EBay than Amazon .
Online sales ( such as over Amazon.com ) often cost the artist 50 % of their already - pathetic royalty ( due to a common record contract provision ) .
International sales and mark - downs often net the artist no royalties .
Record labels lock their artists into legal agreements that hold them for a decade or more .
If it 's not working out , labels do n't print the band 's recordings but nonetheless keep them locked into the contract , forcing them to produce new albums each year .
Even hugely successful artists often end up owing their record label money .
Peer to peer software has proven that there 's a huge continuing demand for music , and they want to share it .
Lawsuits may shut Bittorrent down , just as Napster was shut down .
Clearly there 's a huge public demand for Open Music .
Using the Internet to listen to music is usually tedious : there are too many ads , too many clicks , and the sound quality is usually bad .
It 's too much work , not enough reward .
A well run Internet radio station solves that , but the entrenched record industry wants to kill that too , using extremely high fees as the weapon .
I read this article by Courtney Love six months after starting Magnatune , and was stunned by how much I have in common with her vision and understanding of the music business .
And , she 's much more eloquent than I am .
My solution : I thought : why not make a record label that has a clue ?
That helps artists get exposure , make at least as much money they would make with traditional labels , and help them get fans and concerts .
Magnatune is my project .
The goal is to find a way to run a record label in the Internet Reality : file trading , Internet Radio , musicians ' rights , the whole nine - yards .
If you think Magnatune is a worthy goal , please support it .
There are powerful forces who want it to fail , so I need your help if this is going to work .
Magnatune was founded in April 2003 , and is located in the People 's Republic of Berkeley , California .

ST . PETERSBURG , Florida ( Reuters ) -
The remains of Tropical Storm Barry brought high winds and heavy rains to Florida on Saturday , but the downpour was welcomed in a parched state that has been battling stubborn wildfires .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Much of Florida ’s west coast was feeling the brunt of Barry by Saturday morning .
There were no immediate reports of storm - related injuries or damage .
Barry formed as a tropical storm on Friday and began pelting the Tampa Bay area with rain that afternoon .
It was downgraded to a tropical depression with sustained winds near 35 mph ( 55 kph ) late on Saturday morning .
At 5 p.m. EDT ( 2100 GMT ) , the system ’s poorly defined center had moved across the state and was close to Jacksonville , in northeast Florida , and moving north - northeast at about 23 mph ( 37 kph ) , the National Hurricane Center in Miami said .
That track was expected to take it , as a heavy rainstorm , up the U.S. East Coast over the next two days .
It was not expected to strengthen into a hurricane and the hurricane center said it planned no more public advisories on Barry .
All tropical storm warnings and watches were discontinued as Barry weakened .
Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph ( 63 -118 kph ) .
Barry was expected to bring several inches ( centimeters ) of rain to Florida , Georgia , South Carolina and North Carolina .
That was welcome news in Georgia and in Florida , which reported hundreds of wildfires in May and rainfall of less than half of the normal average .
Florida officials said there were 160 fires in progress as of Saturday , down from 180 on Friday .
Friday ’s rain was the first in Tampa in 25 days .
The citrus industry said severely dry weather was putting continual stress on the state ’s orange and grapefruit growing areas .
CUBA HIT
Barry also brought heavy rainfall to western Cuba , where rivers overflowed their banks and caused floods in the tobacco - growing province of Pinar del Rio .
Officials said 1,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas and three small tornadoes damaged 50 houses .
Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico on June 1 , the official start of the six - month 2007 Atlantic hurricane season , which forecasters have predicted will be more active than normal .
“ I think it ’s the first time in 39 years that we ’ve had a storm on the first day of the season , ” said Daniel Brown , a hurricane specialist at the hurricane center .
The season got off to an early start on May 9 with the formation of Subtropical Storm Andrea off the U.S. coast .
Andrea lacked the warm core and organized thunderstorm activity of tropical systems .
The height of the six - month hurricane season is usually not until August and September .

The modestly popular Konfabulator widget application for Windows and Mac ( review ) was snatched up by Yahoo in late July , and the company promptly turned around and started giving it away for free .
We knew that Yahoo was going to use it to promote some of their web services , and they 've delivered on that promise now that the application has graduated to version 3.0 .
And with its first big release in the Yahoo ownership era , it has received a new , Yahoorific name : Yahoo !
Widget Engine .
For the uninitiated , Konf^h^h^h^h Yahoo Widget Engine manages little programs called " widgets " that perform simple tasks like checking your e-mail , showing your system resource usage , providing weather forecasts , and more .
YWE is a useful program , provided the following : plenty of spare RAM screen real estate to spare .
The biggest complaint about this little widget monster has been its appetite for RAM , so I was interested to see if Yahoo had worked any magic on the application .
Surely they'd want to make it more system friendly in order to spur adoption .
With four widgets running under 2.01 , I have 42 MB in use , but with 3.0 that jumps up to 53MB , an increase of 11 MB .
This is the opposite of what should have happened , and it certainly wo n't help YWE 's reputation amongst PC enthusiasts .
So what 's the big justification for 3.0 ?
More self - promotion .
The company has rolled out nine new widgets , more than half of which tie in to Yahoo services .
For instance , the picture frame can now pull pictures from Flickr or Yahoo Photos , and a new notepad applet allows you to keep notes saved on a central server .
Unfortunately , the widget gallery is still a morass of confusing , undifferentiated applets that 's painful to navigate .
Even worse , links to widgets off of their front page result in 404 errors .
YWE brings some other annoyances too .
The default install not only attempts to set your default search engine and web page to Yahoo's offerings ( which is par for the course ) , but the application also wants to install Yahoo !
Central , which monitors those settings and tries to keep them in place .
A minor annoyance , but an annoyance nonetheless .
More irritating , some of my third - party apps now " steal focus " when they update .
For example , my RSS reader pulls itself to the foreground whenever it updates , and there 's no reason for it to do so .
I get the feeling that YWE has been released before it is ready , and it is somewhat disheartening to see that Yahoo's self - promotional interests have been addressed twofold , while other things languish .
The company will have to take some major leaps forward in the near future , however .
Windows Vista will have integrated support for Microsoft 's own widgets , and Google 's Sidebar is already picking up steam ( although the latter is a resource hog as well , eating up 145 MB of RAM on my system ) .
Yahoo Widget Engine is available for Windows XP and Mac OS X 10.3 ( or higher ) .
University of Iowa scientists have made a discovery that broadens understanding of a rapidly developing area of biology known as functional genomics and sheds more light on the mysterious , so - called " junk DNA " that makes up the majority of the human genome .
The team , led by Beverly Davidson , Ph.D. , a Roy J. Carver Biomedical Research Chair in Internal Medicine and UI professor of internal medicine , physiology and biophysics , and neurology , have discovered a new mechanism for the expression of microRNAs -- short segments of RNA that do not give rise to a protein , but do play a role in regulating protein production .
In their study , Davidson and colleagues not only discovered that microRNAs could be expressed in a different way than previously known , they also found that some of the junk DNA is not junk at all , but instead consists of sequences that can generate microRNAs .
Davidson and her colleagues , including Glen Borchert , a graduate student in her lab , investigated how a set of microRNAs in the human genome is turned on , or expressed .
In contrast to original assertions , they discovered that the molecular machinery used to express these microRNAs is different than that used to express RNA that encodes proteins .
Expression of the microRNAs required an enzyme called RNA Polymerase III ( Pol III ) rather than the RNA Polymerase II ( Pol II ) , which mediates expression of RNA that encode proteins .
The study is published in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology Advance Online Publication on Nov. 12 .
" MicroRNAs are being shown to play roles in cancer and in normal development , so learning how these microRNAs are expressed may give us insight into these critical biological processes , " said Borchert , who is lead author of the study .
" Up to now it 's been understood that one enzyme controls their expression , and we now show that in some cases it 's a completely different one . "
Genes that code for proteins make up only a tiny fraction of the human genome .
The function of the remaining non-coding sequence is just beginning to be unraveled .
In fact , until very recently , much of the non-coding sequence was dismissed as junk DNA .
In 1998 , scientists discovered that some DNA produced small pieces of non-coding RNA that could turn off , or silence , genes .
This discovery won Andrew Fire and Craig Mello the 2006 Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology .
Since their discovery , the field has exploded and small , non-coding RNAs have been shown to play an important role in development and disease in ways that scientists are only just beginning to understand .
" Not so many years ago our understanding was that DNA was transcribed to RNA , which was then translated to protein .
Now we know that the levels of control are much more varied and that many RNAs do n't make protein , but instead regulate the expression of proteins , " Davidson explained .
" Non-coding RNA like microRNAs represent a set of refined control switches , and understanding how microRNAs work and how they are themselves controlled is likely to be very important in many areas of biology and medicine . "
Over 450 microRNAs have been identified in the human genome .
Learning how they are turned on and in what cells and what they do , may allow scientists to turn that knowledge to their advantage as a medical tool .

Scientists at Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Discuss Non-Medicative Alternatives for ADD / ADHD
The interesting fact in the excerpt from USA Today below is the high percentage of use , the other interesting observation is the substitution of exercise for the drugs and achieving similar results without the chemical intervention .......
About 4 million Americans take stimulant medications for ADHD , including nearly 10 % of 10 - year - old boys , says Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic .
Nissen and other members of a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel were concerned enough about the drugs ' safety last month that they suggested adding a " black box " warning about possible heart risks .
Last week , another advisory panel recommended adding label information about the risk of hallucinations .
The FDA has not yet acted on those recommendations .
Doctors have n't done many definitive studies about exercise and ADHD , says David Goodman , an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
But Goodman says it makes sense that working out would help people cope with the condition .
Studies show that exercise increases levels of two key brain chemicals — dopamine and norepinephrine — that help people focus .
" Your cognitive function is probably better for one to three hours after exercise , " Goodman says .
" The difficulty is that by the next day , the effect has worn off .
" If kids could exercise strenuously three to five times a day , they might not need medications at all , says John Ratey , an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School .
Ratey is so intrigued by the question that he 's writing a book about how exercise can reduce symptoms of ADHD or at least help patients cope .

The Toledo administration left without filing a lawsuit .
As many people told me , Yale is far more affluent than Peru , and lawsuits are expensive .
When the administration of Alan GarcÃa took office in July 2006 , a commission ( established in Toledo ’s last months , but with the membership now changed ) placed the matter under review .
The ubiquitous Koechlin is on the commission as well .
Last March , I asked Santiago Marcovich , the Foreign Ministry official who then headed the commission , if the GarcÃa government would be as adamant as Toledo ’s in pursuing the claim .
“ I do n’t know , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think so .
I do n’t know .
It ’s a different way of tackling the problem .
We can not be so conflictive .
Or maybe yes .
It depends on the action of Yale .
It is action - reaction .
Peruvian law does n’t allow us to make any concession on matters of cultural heritage . ”
Choosing to be more conciliatory toward a government that might be open to compromise , Yale last month extended a new proposal to the GarcÃa administration .
The university showed me two letters sent to Peruvian officials in which Yale offered to send back “ the museum - quality ( that is , whole ) objects excavated by Bingham at Machu Picchu ” for display in a “ state - of - the - art museum exclusively dedicated to Machu Picchu ” that would be opened in Cuzco in collaboration with Yale on the centennial anniversary of Bingham ’s 1911 discovery of the site .
To help raise money for the museum , Yale would resurrect its touring exhibition , which — including dioramas and ceramics — would end up permanently in Cuzco .
This represents a significant concession over Yale ’s past proposal to divide possession of the approximately 300 display - worthy objects .
The research collection , however , would continue to reside in New Haven .
“ The museum - quality pieces are the ones that people will want to see , ” Shailor , the deputy provost , told me .
“ I do n’t think they will want to see the end of a little finger or five dog bones , but these are extraordinarily valuable from a research perspective . ”
When I spoke with him in early May , Levin said that Yale is prepared to concede Peruvian title to the entire collection , but only after the ultimate physical allocation of the objects has been negotiated .
In other words , Peru ’s pride will be assuaged if Yale ’s research needs can be met .
Whether Peru will consent to those terms — indeed , whether the GarcÃa government is at liberty to do so , legally or politically — is uncertain ; but earlier this month , Peru told Yale that it was prepared to resume talks , with Housing Minister HernÃ¡n Garrido - Lecca , a former investment banker who did postgraduate work at Harvard and M.I.T. , as its lead negotiator .
“ We have clearly stated that we would like to proceed in these negotiations , but first we would like a complete list of the pieces that were taken by Hiram Bingham in his expeditions to Peru , ” Garrido - Lecca told me .
“ We want to have a friendly negotiation .
In the end , we would like to have every piece in Peru , of course .
But we would like to have a long - term relationship with Yale .
We have a totally different attitude toward this matter than the previous administration . ”
Burger and Salazar say they acknowledge the return of the museum - quality objects to Peru as a painful inevitability .
( Salazar winced when I mentioned an attractive pair of dishes decorated with butterflies . )
For both of them , but especially for Salazar , who is currently conducting an inventory , the Bingham collection has provided an outstanding career opportunity .
If the dispute is amicably resolved , their hope is that Yale and Peru will collaborate on educational and scientific programs in the future .
Yale officials would also like to borrow , for display on a rotating basis in the Peabody museum , objects that Bingham excavated at Machu Picchu .
“ We would want to continue some presence , because it is an important part of the Peabody ’s history , ” Shailor told me .
“ Hiram Bingham is such an extraordinary figure . ”
She paused almost imperceptibly , and added , “ For his age . ”
Many of the Peruvians who are clamoring for the return of the Yale collection belittle Bingham ’s achievement .
“ It is increasingly evident that Bingham did not ‘ discover ’ Machu Picchu , ” Flores , the Cuzco anthropologist , told me .
“ The place was not too far away from Cuzco .
It is within a known farm , Cutija .
Machu Picchu was always known by the CuzqueÃ±os , especially by farmers of that area . ”
Flores speaks with authority .
He comes from a leading Cuzco family , and his maternal grandfather acquired the farm opposite Cutija in 1890 .
Flores says that the rector of the University of Cuzco informed Bingham of the whereabouts of Machu Picchu .
And , obviously , the local farmers knew of it : the child of one farmer escorted Bingham to the site , where the American explorer , far from being in terra incognita , photographed graffiti that had been scrawled by another farmer .
“ Because we are getting close to the centenary of the discovery , it has brought up a debate on who really discovered Machu Picchu , ” Flores continued .
“ After the people see that CuzqueÃ±os knew about it , they say : ‘ Who is Bingham ?
He did n’t discover the pieces .
He was told .
And why does Yale have it ?
They should give it back .
Because he did not discover Machu Picchu .
On the contrary , he was someone who took things from Machu Picchu . ’ ”
The notion that Bingham did not really discover Machu Picchu is set forth at the Machu Picchu site museum , where the wall labels pointedly state that “ this place was not unknown to the local inhabitants . ”
Fernando Astete , an archaeologist who has worked at the Machu Picchu park since 1978 and been director of it since 2001 , wants the Bingham collection to be exhibited at the site ’s museum .
When I spoke with him in Cuzco , he said : “ I am happy with the museum .
It has temperature control and humidity control and guards . ”
But when I visited the site museum , which is located about a mile and a half from the Aguas Calientes train station , I found evidence of none of those amenities .
The doors were open to the air , which was moist from the nearby river , and the sole official was a caretaker who sold tickets and then exited the building .
On display in the attractive ( if unguarded ) museum are the finds that Peruvian archaeologists have made at Machu Picchu in the years since Bingham ’s excavations .
“ In the last 30 years , we have found a good collection — ceramics , metal , stone , spondylus shells , very few textiles , ” Astete said .
“ We also have found tombs that Bingham did n’t find . ”
The Machu Picchu museum contains fewer intact ceramics than are at the Yale Peabody .
There is , however , one unique object : a gold bracelet found in 1995 , the only gold ever uncovered at the site .
It was located in the loose - fill foundation of a plaza , most likely placed there as an offering during construction .
Burger and other scholars believe there was no gold for Bingham to find at Machu Picchu because the royal family would take precious objects back to Cuzco when they left the estate .
During his lifetime , however , Bingham was plagued by rumors that he had smuggled gold out of Machu Picchu through Bolivia .
Those rumors persist .
I heard them myself in Peru , from people who told me that their grandparents witnessed Bingham ’s caravans laden with mysterious material , heading east for the border to evade export controls .
Such gossip is wishful thinking .
By the time Bingham came to Peru , there was very little Inca gold remaining anywhere in the world .
It vanished centuries earlier .
When Francisco Pizarro seized Atahualpa in 1532 and held him hostage , the Inca ordered his subjects to collect a ransom .
The obedient populace stripped the enormous gleaming panels and other lavish embellishments from the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco , which were a legacy of Pachacuti .
They dismantled an artificial garden of sculptures of corn , flowers and birds , all realistically made with precious metals .
They conveyed vases , idols , drums , pots , altars , fountains , masks and other creations of the finest goldsmiths — the tribute that this great and isolated civilization had paid to its gods and rulers .
The chronicles record the steady arrival of prodigious quantities of gold , which the conquerors stored alongside their prisoner .
All for naught .
The Spanish executed Atahualpa anyway and melted down the treasure to ship home .
As I talked to people in Peru about the Bingham collection , this tragic history was always flickering in the background .
The Spanish ships heavy with plunder sailed from Peru long ago .
The patrimony is irretrievable , the Spaniards unaccountable .
Yet the drama continues to play out , like a recurring nightmare or a neurotic repetition compulsion , within Peru today .
Precious objects that remain in Peru — things far more beautiful than the Machu Picchu crockery — are still being extracted at a horrifying rate .
In many parts of the country , especially along the coast , tomb - robbing is a major industry : the huaqueros sell the plundered antiquities to middlemen for placement with rich collectors in Lima or abroad .
The dispute with Yale is a sideshow .
Historic relics have pragmatic value : politically , for purposes of national pride and partisan advantage ; economically , for display to tourists , museumgoers , magazine readers and TV - program watchers ; scientifically , as research material for scholars pursuing academic careers ; and , most nakedly , as merchandise for dealers in antiquities .
In comparing the arguments and motivations of the different claimants to the Yale collection , I often identified with historians of the Inca trying to untangle those Spanish chronicles that were spun from the tales of native informants with their own purposes .
The people at Yale say that they have preserved the collection as a legacy of a great civilization and they want to continue to study these artifacts to learn more about that culture .
They are also paying tribute to one of the most colorful and glamorous figures in the university ’s history .
The Peruvians celebrate their own legendary ancestor when they describe the urgency of their case , but they also have very down - to - earth political and commercial uses for the collection .
“ Cultural patrimony ” — the phrase sounds so otherworldly .
Bingham and Pachacuti were both very practical men .
They would not have been fooled for a minute .
Main Features
Picotux is the smallest series of Linux computers in the world .
The smallest of the lot is the Picotux 100 .
It measures 35x19x19 mm and can be compared to the size of an 8P8C modular connector .
Some of the main features of the Picotux are elaborated in this guide .
Communication Interfaces
The Picotux has a couple of communication interfaces :
Half - full duplex Ethernet with speed of 10/100 Mbit per second
Serial port with speed up to 230.4 Kbit per second
Additional 5 line are available for serial or general I/O connections
The Picotux is built on the platform of uClinux and busybox .
You may even use it as a simple telnet or web server .
Technical Specifications
The main technical specifications of the Picotux 100 are as following :
It runs on a 32 - bit ARM7 Netsilicon NS7520 CPU with a clock speed of 55 MHz
It has 2MB Flash memory 8MB SDRAM
µ Clinux 2.4.27 Big Endian is the operating system , which resides on the Flash Memory and measures just 750 KB in size
BusyBox 1.0 is the main shell of the computer
The power consumption for the smallest Linux computer is 250 mA x 3.3 Volts
The operating system also supports GCC for Fortran , C and C ++
The Picotux 100 supports CRAMFS , NFS AND JFFS2 file systems
It supports the GNU Tool chain development system
The computer is shielded by metal body and its overall weight is just 18 g
It has 64KB of code as protected bootloader for update over network
Network
The Picotux stands out for its network capability .
It uses DHCP for determining the IP address , when on reset or power - up .
The Ethernet Interface is powered up only during startup .
The local loopback can be enabled using a command .
Similarly , TCP / UDP can be used for inter process communication using a command .
It is simple to programme the networking IO .
You can use the standard Berkeley sockets .
Programming
Picotux does n’t have any MMU .
Therefore , the fork ( ) system function gets replaced by vfork ( ) .
You can perform multi processing using sub- process programming code in separate exec ( ) functions .
Therefore , dynamic allocation of memory needs to be done carefully .
Picotux ’s root file system is read - only and all the startup options are preset .
It has a mnt directory that can be used for attaching NFS network shares .
Thus , the smallest Linux computer is capable of performing some of the functions of its larger counterparts .
This is the easiest project ever :

It took about 30 minutes to get the wall covered and it only cost $ 20 .
In a comment on the last post , mfoetsch pointed out that a search for BadVista - related terms using Microsoft 's live.com engine was producing rather ... unexpected results .
Many posts and pages turn up that link to BadVista.org , but no results from badvista.org itself appear .
So I did a little testing .
I checked the results at google.com , yahoo.com , ask.com , and live.com .
You can see from the screenshots that there does seem to be a problem .
Is it deliberate ?
No way to know I suppose , though to their credit if you search for " badvista.fsf.org " , you will get some ( rather odd - looking ) results .
So perhaps this is some kind of technical problem with the interaction between their search bots and our site .
Either way , you should let them know about the omission .
Leave a comment here to confirm you did it , so we can keep an informal count .
Let 's see how quickly we can get it fixed .
The greatest challenge facing .NET developers today is discoverability - finding information and answers that already exist .
Like most developers , I find myself spending a great deal of time searching for answers or solutions online , much of that time on Google .
SearchDotNet is based on Google Custom Search technology to search the very best .NET related sites and forums to help make searches more effective , while filtering out unrelated or duplicate content .
Do you know of a site that should be searched by this custom search engine ?
Or would you like to add another custom search engine to this directory ?
Visit our recommendations page .
Other Custom Search Engines
Naturally , many others are creating .NET search engines as well .
My focus with this search engine will be on quality of results over quantity - so I 'm going to be fairly restrictive on the sites I include , focusing on sites with significant quality content , those with significant forum activities ( where one is likely to find questions that have been answered ) , and " expert " sites - those with more advanced content written by experts in the field .
I believe there is going to be room for many different approaches , so as I find out about other .NET search engines , I 'll list them here as I find out about them .

OK , I do n’t want to sound completely negative but I ’m going to start this post by saying that even when Project Management works , things go wrong .
But that ’s OK because things going wrong is n’t necessarily the death knell for a project , it does n’t even have to be particularly problematic .
It ’s all about how you react when things go wrong .
I ’m going to tell a happy Project Management story now .
The project I am just coming to the end of has been one of the best run projects I have ever worked on and in the last ten years of contracting I ’ve worked on a hell of a lot of projects .
I was n’t the Project manager , so I ’m not big - noting myself .
It ’s easy to point out what ’s wrong in dysfunctional projects or dysfunctional workplaces generally but it ’s really refreshing to be able to cite a real world example where most things went right .
Here ’s the summary version : for a major project to work , you need to have ALL of the following in place –
A Plan Flexibility Communication Support Respect
1. A Plan .
It does n’t have to be an exhaustive plan with every task measured down to the micro level ( see my previous Project Management post for my views on this idea ) but you need to have an idea of where you ’re going with clearly defined milestones that tell you when you ’ve reached key points in the project .
2. Flexibility .
Just deal with the fact that you wo n’t have thought of everything in the plan .
Be prepared for the fact your estimates may turn out to be wildly inaccurate .
Being right or wrong is n’t as important as how you react when you are wrong .
When you discover something you did n’t know before , take it on board and analyse how it is going to affect the existing plan and milestones .
DON ’T PRETEND IT ISN ’T HAPPENING !
Do n’t pretend you can stick to the original plan if you work a little harder .
This is why “ Waterfall ” fails – things change and it ’s useless to pretend otherwise .
And if you happen to work somewhere toxic enough to punish you for telling the truth about these sorts of things – get another job .
Quit or quit complaining .
3. Communication .
I ’m not talking about a series of interminable meetings that waste everybody ’s times .
I ’m talking about real communication – letting people know what ’s happening and how it will affect them .
How you do this is up to you – the best method will vary with the situation ; face - to - face , email and / or a wiki are all viable options .
I ’ll do another post on identifying the appropriate levels of communication on another day .
4. Support at all levels of the business .
If everyone involved is n’t fully on board you are going to face a lot of unnecessary fights .
The IT team has to agree , the business has to agree , the users have to agree , management has to agree , external customers have to agree and any vendors involved have to agree .
Every day you spend in the early stages of a project getting various “ champions ” on your side will save you from a week to a month or more further down the line .
5. Respect .
You have to respect everyone in your team .
Your team has to have the respect of other areas of the business .
Without this the project will get derailed by ridiculous shit - fights along the lines of “ this is all going wrong because Bozo over there does n’t know what they ’re doing . ”
The person in question may well be a Bozo who knows nothing .
But if there is n’t professionalism within a project then everyone suffers .
A few war stories from this project .
One of the biggest strengths of this Project manager was that he was always diligent about controlling scope creep .
Every time someone had a new idea he would let them know the implications .
He did n’t start discussions with “ No , you ca n’t have that , ” ( a recipe for nasty conflicts ) but he would always say “ We can look at that but we have to do some analysis first .
That ’s outside the scope we ’ve already agreed on and we need to be sure of what impact it would have on our existing plan . ”
So nobody was ever given a straight “ no ” but the project did n’t turn into some horrific , never - ending death march .
The worst thing that happened was when an influential manager who was nothing directly to do with the project was given the specification documents to read .
It was n’t a bad idea to get his opinion , he ’s an intelligent and experienced IT professional .
But it was a terrible idea to show him the specs for the first time a week before we were planning to send the tender out to potential vendors .
You ca n’t “ un-ask ” someone important ( in the political sense ) for their opinion just because their opinion becomes inconvenient .
The end result of this was that the process of getting the Tender finalised to everyone ’s satisfaction and sent off kept dragging on .
Because this was a totally unplanned event we had no way of knowing how long it would take to resolve and instead of lasting the week we ’d allowed for , it took about 5 weeks .
And every day we were thinking “ maybe we ’ll be finished in another day or two . ”
I almost lost it at week 4 and was ready to go postal on my cow - orkers .
I ’ll finish with what was one of the best surprises of the project .
At a critical point in the evaluation process , the project team had committed to the management steering committee to have a decision within two weeks – an aggressive timeline given the circumstances but one we were confident we could meet .
The head of the steering committee ( the second most senior manager in the entire company ) had a look at our proposal and said :
“ I do n’t think you ’re allowing yourselves enough time .
This is a big decision and I ’d rather it was done right than done quickly .
I think you should spend an extra month on the evaluation and then come back to us . ”
This sort of common sense should n’t be a surprise .
But I do n’t remember the last time someone on the business side said , unsolicited , to an IT project team : “ You should take more time to make sure this gets done right . ”
And now , because I ’m a contractor , I ’ll be moving on .
With my luck , the next place will be the polar opposite of this place – a madhouse where everything gets done wrong .
At least it will provide a lot of blog material .
Coroutines
by
M. Douglas McIlroy
Bell Telephone Laboratories , Incorporated
Murray Hill , New Jersey
Abstract
Unlike subroutines , coroutines may be connected , and reconnected , in nonhierarchical arrangements .
Coroutines are particularly useful for generating and processing data streams .
Semantics for coroutines are developed and examples are given .
1. Introduction
Coroutines were christened by Conway in 1963 [ 1 ] , but they have been used in various special applications at least since 1959 .
Well known as the idea as become [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] , it remains to be clothed in generality and espoused by general purpose programming languages .
( 1)
The essential novelty of coroutines arises from discarding the hierarchical relationship that holds among subroutines .
Whereas members of a linked pair of subroutines stand to each other as superior and inferior , the ``caller ' ' and the ``called , '' coroutines may be linked in a more flexible manner out of which may be constructed democratic as well as hierarchic , and rearrangeable as well as fixed , interrelationships .
More abstractly , coroutines decouple scope , connection and flow of control .
The lifetimes of an identifiable ``generation '' of a coroutine and its local data are not arbitrarily bounded between ``entry to '' and ``return from '' the routine , and communication of parameters between coroutines may be established otherwise than by invocation .
List processing has already decoupled data lifetimes from flow of control ; coroutines do the same for procedures .
Coroutines clarify some obscure areas of programming , especially stream processes such as input - output or sequence generation .
As coroutine arrangements of any complexity are extremely awkward to mimic by traditional methods , coroutines deserve to become a basic feature of general purpose programming languages .
This paper has been written to bring a coherent development of coroutines to the attention of language designers .
Although the paper does not propose coroutines for any specific language , it uses a rough formalism for the sake of example .
The lexical style is that of ALGOL , but the syntax is more nearly that of PL / I , whose list processing and declarative facilities need little extension to encompass coroutines .
In the interest of clarity the style deviates from pure PL / I [ 5 ] in self - evident ways :
The assignment operator is written `:='
A ` repeat ;... end ; ' grouping replaces ` do while ( ' 1 'b ) ; ... end ; '
' grouping replaces ` ' One - bit constants ` true ' and ` false ' replace ' 1 ' b and ' 0 ' b .
' and ` ' replace and .
Procedures of no arguments have an empty argument list .
Data attributes that can reasonably be inferred from context or are irrelevant to the presentation are often left undeclared .
Ambiguous partial qualification is resolved by appropriateness of attributes in context .
DATA STREAMS
Many computing processe manipulate streams of data .
Items are obtained in sequence from one or more input streams , some information is gleaned , and one or more output streams are constructed .
A stream may pass through a cascade of processes , each of which transforms it further .
A program acting ion a data stream may be likened to a bucket brigade .
A bucketeer in the middle of the line sees neither neighbor as dominant .
He simply minds his own pile of buckets , calling upon his left neighbor to replenish it and on his right neighbor to dispose of it .
The only special discipline is that at any instant action is restricted to one bucketeer , who may subsequently pass control left or right as he wishes .
There are no parallel operations .
Once the stream has been established , our man in the middle cannot discern whether the stream is driven by an overflowing fountain at one end or by an unfillable well at the other .
In programming parlance , the bucketeer is behaving as a coroutine .
Merely by rearranging the connections among a set of coroutines , one may adjust the order of processing a data stream .
In particular it is easy to insert new processes into an existing cascade simply by opening connections and dropping them in .
Equally easily a stream may be diverted through alternative processes and switched back without disrupting the overall chain in the slightest .
Input - output programming , the type example of stream processing , is customarily force - fit into the subroutine mold .
A computational main routine is pictured as dominant , calling occasionally on a read routine to deliver some input or a print routine to absorb some output .
On the other hand , the read routine , especially if it does buffering , steadily accepts input from the outside world in a cycle that depends more on the form of the data than on the sequence of calls from the main program .
From the standpoint of the reaqd routine control is seen passing to the main routine whenever a sufficient quantity of input has been accumulated .
Indeed , it makes sense to regard neither the main routine nor the read routine as boss .
Each follows its own relatively autonomous path , suspending occasionally while the other works , but always preserving its internal state while control is with its partner .
When several input streams simultaneously traverse the ``same '' read routine , it becomes even less satisfactory to regard it as a single subroutine .
But thinking of the read routine as a coroutine existing in separate generations for each stream , one can understand exactly how it works and how it keeps book independently on the state of each stream , and one can explain the curious operations of ``opening '' and ``closing '' input streams as activation and deactivation of separate generations of the read routine ( see below ) .
2. LINKAGE
Subroutine linkage is probably the most complex ``primitive '' notion in standard programming languages , and must be dissected into a combination of lesser primitives for coroutines .
To this end , let us partition the mechanism three ways , into
Activation
Connection
Passing control
ACTIVATION
In ALGOL or PL / I a routine is said to be active while its local data remains accessible , or in the terminology of PL / I , while its generation of automatic storage persists .
This definition of activity has been chosen instead of the customary definition in terms of control remaining inside a block or its descendants , so that it may be carried across to coroutines .
The physical manifestation of a single continuous period of activity , or activation , will be called a generation of a routine .
Where no ambiguity can arise , this may be shortened to ``generation . ''
Allocation and initialization of automatic storage occurs immediately upon activation , regardless of whether control is to continue directly in the activated generation .
Parameters upon which allocation and initialization depend must be supplied at this time .
Other parameters , which are intended to be fixed for the entire activation , may also be passed .
The prologue ( allocation and initialization phase ) of a coroutine thus behaves as a subroutine executed as part of activation .
Moreover the entire generation should behave as a subroutine with respect to name or reference parameters and nonlocal variables used elsewhere than in prologue , ( 2 ) for it should not outlive these quantities .
Formalisms for dynamic storage allocation as in PL / I 's list processing or Wirth and Hoare 's proposal [ 6 ] may be adapted for activation of coroutines .
Extending PL / I terminology , a coroutine is a based routine , a generation of which is a based structure .
The based routine , or strictly speaking its prologue , will be understood to be a pointer - valued function .
Activation will be specified by a simple function reference that returns a pointer to the new generation :
pointer := procedure ( arguments ) ;
CONNECTION
A connection is the bond that exists between two generations analogous to the bond between a subroutine and its caller .
A connection is a communication path with at dual purpose - passage of control and passage of arguments .
The period of connection in subroutine linkage coincides with the period of activity of the called generation and with the interval that control is with that generation or its descendants .
Coroutines may be connected more freely , subject only to the restrictions that activation precede connection , and connection precede passing control or accessing formal parameters .
There is no preferred direction of passing control ( i.e. no distinguishable caller ) and no implication of hierarchy nor nesting of generations .
Coroutines may exist in a comparatively anarchic arrangement ; whatever discipline obtains among a particular collection of coroutines must be imposed by their author ; it is not built in .
In general two pieces of information are required at the end of a connection , with complementary information at the far end .
A resumption label tells where execution must start when control passes in through the connection .
An argument list gives the actual parameters to which correspond formals of the far end .
CONNECTORS
Connectors are the portals of routines .
Connection is made by plugging two connectors together , and broken by pulling them apart .
Connectors hold all the information pertinent to a connection .
For definiteness let us suppose a connector to be like ( in the technical sense of PL / I 's like attribute ) the following structure defined in pseudo - PL / I notation :
1 Connector connector , 2 Resumption label , 3 Generation pointer , 3 Address pointer , 2 Mate pointer , 2 Arguments
Connector .
Generation
Connector .
Mate
A connector declaration specifies parameters of the connector .
If the connector is to be accessed from outside its own scope ( in particular to cause connection ) the declaration must also specify its place in the generation structure .
Notations such as the following modifications of PL / I procedure statements and entry declarations suffice :
a : procedure( x ) based 2 b connector(y ) , 2 c connector ( z ) ; declare 1 a entry based , 2 b connector , 2 c connector ;
A MECHANICAL PICTURE
Coroutine generations and connectors may be visualized as in Fig. 1 . A generation appears as a box , and connectors as protruding plugs .
In the figure two generations have been connected .
The left hand generation has three connectors and the right , two .
Fig .
1 . Two connected generations
Conway emphasized the separability of coroutines , that is the possibility of breaking and redirecting established connections without disturbing the generations at either end .
For instance , to change input code conversion , one might interpose a new code converter between input and processing simply by opening a connector and dropping the converter in .
OPERATIONS
Certain operations and accessing specifications apply to connectors :
Connection Initializing the argument list Otherwise setting the argument list Initializing the resumption label Otherwise setting the resumption label Passing control via the connection Indirectly addressing the mated connection Indirectly addressing the mated generation Connector assignment
In the examples connection , ( a ) , will be specified by
connect Connector1 to Connector2 ;
Connector1.Mate := Addr( Connector2 ) ; Connector2.Mate := Addr( Connector1 ) ;
Resumption is a compound of operations ( c ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , whose syntax is parallel to that of a call :
resume connector ( arguments ) ;
resume
Resumption may also be specified in the style of a function reference :
variable := connector ( arguments ) ;
L
g
declare f( x ) connector , g( x ) connector ; connect f to g ; a := f ( 1 ) ; b := x ; stop ; L : c := y+1 ; resume g( c,3 ) ;
a = 3
b = 2
c = 2
1
f
f
g
L
y
1
L
c
2
g
f
f
g
f
a := f(1 )
x
c
f
3
a
3
b
2
To make syntactic distinction between connector access ( as in connector assignment ) and resumption of a function connector having no arguments , resumption without arguments will be indicated by an empty argument list in parentheses .
3. COROUTINES IN USE
PROBLEMS OF INITIALIZATION
Example 1 shows the body of a simple coroutine .
The routine has two connectors and operates in an unending loop , accepting input via connector Left , transforming it according to the function Map , and sending data on via Right .
The declarations state that Left has one formal parameter
In ; it has no actual parameters as shown by usage in the first resume .
An opposite situation holds for connector Right .
Indeed Left and Right of two generations of this routine could be connected to produce the product transform Map ( Map ( ... ) ) .
Example 1
declare Left connector ( In ) , Right connector ( ) ; repeat ; R : resume Left ( ) ; L : Out := Map ( In ) ; resume Right ( Out ) ; end ;
If control were to come in first through Left , then processing should begin at L ; if through Right , then at R .
With only one appearance of each connector , this is self evident , but starting points would have to be specified if there were more .
Further difficulty arises upon writing the main loop this way :
repeat ; resume Right ( Map( Left ( ) ) ) ; end ;
Left
Right
resume ^ Right ( Map( ^Left ( ) ) ) ;
1+Left ( )
Another aspect of initialization is illustrated by Example 2 , where a stream of values x comes from Left with a repetition factor n applied to each .
The process sends the same stream on to Right with a repetition count whose magnitude is limited to 2 or less .
Should control first come in from
Right then the very next quantity to be accessed ( in the while clause ) would be the formal parameter n from Left .
In order for this parameter to have meaning there must be an argument list available from Left even though control had never come in from there .
Suppose for simplicity that another generation B of this limiting routine had been connected at Left .
An argument list ( m , y ) would accordingly have to be available at connector Right in B immediately upon connection .
It is necessary therefore to have argument lists at the starting points initialized as a part of activating prologue .
Example 2
declare Left connector( n , x ) , Right connector ( ) , m initial ( 0 ) ; Loop : repeat ; resume ^ Left ( ) ; y := x ; do while ( n!=0 ) ; m := Min( 2,n ) ; n := n-m ; resume ^ Right ( m , y ) ; end Loop ;
In some cases argument list initialization may be infeasible .
Such a case occurs in the previous example
resume ^ Right ( Map( ^Left ( ) ) ) ;
Right
Left
Left
COMPLETE COROUTINES
We are now in a position to write an entire program in coroutines .
Example 3 is a prime number sieve that works on a novel principle .
The sieve is a pile of ``meshes , '' where each mesh is a coroutine that screens out multiples of a particular value .
If an integer dumped in at the top of the pile falls through to the bottom , it is relatively prime to the divisor in each mesh .
If integers are dropped in sequence , and if a new mesh is added whenever an integer gets through the whole sieve , then this scheme becomes a prime number sieve .
Figure 3 shows the sieve in operation .
At the top is ``dump , '' where integers are poured in :
dump : do j := 2 by 1 ; resume source ( j ) ; end ;
i
m
repeat ; resume ^top ; if ( i mod m ) != 0 then resume bottom ( i ) ; end ;
repeat ; resume sink ; put list ( i ) ; p := mesh ( i ) ; connect p->mesh.top to sink.mate->mesh.bottom ; connect p->mesh.bottom to sink ; end
Fig. 3
seive : procedure based , 2 source connector , 2 sink connector ( i ) ; mesh : procedure ( n ) based , 2 top connector ( i ) , 2 bottom connector ; declare m initial (n ) ; repeat ; resume top ; if ( i mod m ) != 0 then resume bottom ( i ) ; end ; end mesh ; start : connect source to sink ; dump : do j := 2 by 1 ; resume sink ( j ) , end ; hopper : repeat ; resume sink ; put list ( i ) ; p := mesh ( i ) ; connect p->mesh.top to sink.mate->mesh.bottom ; connect p->mesh.bottom to sink ; end ; end seive ;
COROUTINE -SUBROUTINE MIXTURES
Subroutine automatic storage is usually allocated from a last - in - first - out stack , but coroutine automatic storage need not be nested and so must be allocated independently for each generation .
When coroutines and subroutines are intermixed , so that coroutines call subroutines which in turn resume coroutines , each coroutine generation must effectively head a private stack for dynamically descendant subroutine generations .
( 5 )
To see that such mixtures of routines can actually be useful , consider example 4 , a permuation generator ( for illustrative use only , not recommended for efficiency ) .
At each resumption , the generator will construct another permutation and pass it back .
A true - false switch tells when the job is done .
Each level of recursion works on an initial portion of the array A and produces all permutations of that subarray having each possible last element .
The generator might be used this way
declare Next connector ( A ) bit ( 1 ) , 1 Perm entry based , 2 Next connector , A (* ) ; p := Perm ( 5 ) ; connect Next to p->perm.next ; do while ( next ( ) ) ; ... process permutation A ... end ;
Example 4
perm : procedure (n ) based ; 2 Next connector ; declare A ( n ) ; resume ^ Next ( ) ; do i := 1 to n ; A ( i ) := i ; end ; call Perm1 ( n ) ; resume Next ( A , false ) ; Perm1 : procedure (n ) ; declare i ; if n=1 then resume Next ( A , true ) ; else do i := 1 to n ; call Exchange ( A ( i ) , A ( n ) ) ; call Perm 1 ( n - 1 ) ; call Exchange ( A ( n ) , A( i ) ) ; end Perm ;
OTHER TECHNIQUES
Referring to Example 4 let us examine methods that might have been used to render a stream generator in present day ALGOL or PL/I .
Method I . Supply a processing routine as a parameter of revery new permutation .
Can be done in ALGOL or PL/I .
Method II .
Maintain all memory required to get from one permutation to the next outside the routine and pass the remembered quantities as arguments at each invocation of the generator .
Can be done in ALGOL or PL/I .
Method III .
Allocate memory dynamically and keep a pointer to it outside the routine as in method II .
Can be done in PL / I only .
Method IV .
Maintain internal memory in own storage .
Can be done in ALGOL only .
Method V. A functional assignment method showed to me by D. M. R. Park needs detailed discussion and will be put off to the following section .
It works in neither ALGOL nor PL/I .
Each method has its drawbacks .
Method I fails if interleaved streams from two generators are required .
Interleaved streams of permutations may seem unlikely , but interleaved streams of random numbers have been used .
Method II only works well when stream elements are produced at the outermost block leve , otherwise block nesting records ( upon which example 4 depends ) will have to be simulated by some unwieldy curcumlocution .
Moreover , because its memory is outside , a Method II routine can not be transparent to algorithm changes that alter memory requirements .
Method III shares the first objection to Method II , that results ought to be obtained at the top block level .
In PL / I , but not in the record proposal for ALGOL [ 6 ] , a change in algorithm would not be apparent outside , since a single pointer can designate any sort of memory .
This transparency is not above criticism , for it depends on a property of PL / I often considered unhygienic .
Method IV shares in objections to Methods I and II .
Only one steram can be accomodated by own variables , and the technique is difficult if results naturally appear in other than the top block .
The needed dynamic own facility is not often implemented in ALGOL .
None of the above mentioned deficiencies is exhibited by coroutines .
The price of coroutines lies in the extra complexity of nonnested storage allocation .
This price applies too to Methods II and IV , but not so seriously , as they require only one dynamic allocation per stream whose extent is thereafter unchanged , whereas coroutines need a new stack , whose extend is unknown by definition .
FUNCTIONAL ASSIGNMENT
Own variables ( Method IV ) may be dispensed with by a mechanism of functional assignment abetted by certain novel rules concerning persistence of variables .
For instance this random number generator :
Random : procedure ( ) ; declare n static initial ( 1 ) ; n := ( n*r ) mod s ; return ( n ) ; end random ;
Newrandom : procedure ( ) entry ; declare n initial ( 1 ) ; Random : procedure ( ) ; n := ( n*r ) mod s ; return ( n ) ; end random ; return ( random ) ; end Newrandom ;
Gen := Newrandom ( ) ; x := Gen ( ) ;
Many stream generators may be implemented with this style of procedure assignment .
However I know of no way to imitate two - sided coroutines ( see section 5 ) .
The permuation generator of Example 4 can be so rendered , but it is too complicated to show here .
4. LOCALIZATION
Argument lists and resumption labels have been said to belong at the ``transmitting '' end of a connection , in direct opposition to many implementations of subroutines , where these items are kept with the called generation .
Separability makes ours the natural choice -- argument lists and resumption labels localized in the generation to which they refer need no adjustment in response to reconnection .
A function value has been said to be a hidden parameter that appears as an argument when resuming from the function coroutine to the receiver of the value .
This convention opposes an implementation practice prevailing in PL / I , where a function value is taken instead to be a hidden formal of the function .
The convention of the present paper disposes of the rather repugnant idea that all functions set their value as a side effect , but more importantly makes it possible to use an initialized function value even before resuming the function .
To their disfavor , the conventions about function values and argument lists rule out ``suicides '' among function coroutines , contrary to customary practice with function subroutines , which deactivate themselves upon return .
A function coroutine must survive , even after control has left for good , until its value has been used .
Own variables , whose ambivalent nature as locally known globabl variables has caused much heated discussion , can be supplanted by coroutines .
What had been implemented as own variables may become automatic variables and kept where they belong with a persistent generation .
For straightforward programs , the idea of static storage à la PL / I should probably be kept , but ALGOL 's thicket of dynamic own could be swept away in favor of coroutines .
5. CONTROL DISCIPLINE
Coroutines may be connected in innumerable configurations ; even looped arrangements are possible .
However certain discipline must be observed on passing control around a loop .
Envision a string unwinding behind as control passes from generation to generation , and being rolled up again as control comes back .
If string is ever laid along a connector through which string already passes , then the old string must be broken hthere and can no longer be traced back across .
One might forbid laying string into a generation through which string already passes , but that seems overly restrictive .
FORTRAN users have long enjoyed the convenience of a set of routines that call each other in a circle ; also one can easily envision uses of connectors mated right back to their own generation .
Given a system where both are possible , we might as well permit such things .
In terms of control discipline two species of coroutines can be distinguished -- one - sided and two - sided .
In a one - sided routine each connector has a preferred direction ; the control string is always unwinding when control crosses that way and winding up in the opposite direction .
No such preference exists in two sided coroutines .
To my knowledge there have been no implementations of two - sided coroutines , but we have seen ( cf. Example 1 ) that the concept is reasonable and useful .
6. SUMMARY
Couroutine generations may be activated with no requirement for nesting .
The fundamental operations necessary for coroutines are activation ( allocation ) , connection and passing control .
Connection between coroutines is symmetrical in all respects -- passage of control , passage of parameters , and passage of function values can occur in either direction or both .
Coroutines are particularly useful in processing data streams .
Stream processes can be redirected simply by reconnecting coroutines .
Since certain straightforward coroutine applications cannot be cleanly accomplished with traditional language facilities , coroutines are indeed a novel feature for programming languages .

World Bank panel finds Wolfowitz guilty of conflict of interest
Michael Roston
Published : Monday May 7 , 2007 Print This Email This
A World Bank panel has found President Paul Wolfowitz guilty of a " conflict of interest , " according to a breaking report at the New York Times website .
" A bank committee formally transmitted its findings that he was guilty of a conflict of interest in arranging for a pay raise and promotion in 2005 to Shaha Ali Riza , his companion , " wrote Steven Weisman late on Monday afternoon .
The panel 's finding have not been made public , and Weisman added that " It was not clear whether the committee , consisting of 7 of the banks 24 board members , would remove Mr. Wolfowitz from his post or , more likely , express a loss of confidence in his leadership in a manner that might persuade him to resign . "
The news came as Wolfowitz 's adviser Kevin Kellems resigned , complaining that the cloud over the Bush appointed president made his work at the institution useless .
The satirical website Wonkette was reporting rumors late on Monday that Wolfowitz had resigned , but the site was unable to back the rumor up .
THE CELEBRITY SECOND ACT HAS BECOME a staple of pop culture .
The press releases almost write themselves : Comedian becomes reality TV host , reality TV host becomes actor , actor releases mediocre rap album .
But those second acts do n’t always sink to the level of cliché .
Take Peter Weller .
He ’s had a long , meandering Act I .
After a vibrant movie career in the 1980s that included playing the lead in cult hits like RoboCop , he fell into the far less glamorous world of direct - to - video and straight - to - cable .
Then last year , he came back big , in a riveting turn as a bad guy on 24 .
In the interim , though , Weller started getting into character for Act II .
He spent much of the past two decades in Italy and , on a lark , enrolled in classes at the Syracuse University program in Florence .
He soon discovered he had a thing for the aqueducts of long - dead civilizations , and now he ’s working toward a PhD in Italian Renaissance art history from UCLA .
This is no vanity degree ;
Weller teaches courses , writes papers , and is doggedly climbing the academic ladder .
Buckaroo Banzai , the polymath who was arguably Weller ’s most famous character — acclaimed neurosurgeon , race car driver , particle physicist , and , of course , rock star — would be proud .
“ I ’ve always followed my passions , ” Weller says , “ even when it did n’t seem to make much sense . ”
It ’s hard to imagine what freshmen think when they wander into Professor Banzai ’s lecture hall .
Weller reports that he loses a lot of students after the first class .
“ They thought they were going to get the easy A from old RoboCop , ” he says with a laugh .
The 450 - page course reader tells them otherwise .
Those who stay get a view into Weller ’s two worlds .
For example , his class at Syracuse on Hollywood and the Roman Empire requires watching toga - and - sandal epics ( Ben Hur and The Last Temptation of Christ among them ) and reading primary - source Roman authors in an attempt to reconcile big- screen Rome with the real thing .
“ The Romans were an unbelievably complex people , and we are an unbelievably complex people , ” Weller says .
“ We can learn so much about why things are the way they are by looking at what they did . ”
He goes on to explain how the absence of the concept of zero in Greek antiquity laid the foundation for Western philosophical thought .
All this boning up on the ancients has paid off for Weller professionally , too .
He hosts the History Channel ’s Engineering an Empire series , which investigates Mayans , Egyptians , and other ancient peoples .
And his latest acting gig is on stage as the brilliant but troubled architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the play Frank ’s Home , which opened in Chicago before heading off - Broadway .
For an architecture buff , it ’s a dream role .
“ Wright is the one who burst things wide open , really created modern architecture , ” Weller says , and then he ’s off and running , explaining the connections between Renaissance buttressing , the power of the Church in the Middle Ages , and ancient heathen ritu als still practiced on Italy ’s Amalfi Coast .
The curtain rises on Act III .

The Desert Fox
New details have emerged about what has become the largest consumer data theft to date .
TJX , parent company of discount retailers T.J. Maxx and Marshalls , disclosed in a regulatory filing in late March that hackers had stolen data covering over 45 million credit and debit cards over an 18 - month period .
The Wall Street Journal has done some digging ( subscription ) , and what has come to light is a sad tale of poor security and corporate irresponsibility .
Unfortunately , we 've seen it all before .
A ThinkPad and an empty Pringles can ?
It all started in July 2005 with a laptop and a directional antenna .
Some enterprising hackers set up shop outside of a Marshalls store near St. Paul , MN and quickly cracked the security on the store 's WiFi network .
The Journal reports they there were then able to access just about all of the data flowing around the store and were eventually able to locate and compromise TJX's central customer database at its corporate headquarters in Framingham , MA .
In addition to pilfering over 45 million — and possibly as many as 200 million — credit card and debit card numbers , the hackers were also able to obtain other personal data from over 450,000 customers .
This included driver 's license numbers and Social Security numbers .
The cost has been immense .
By the time that the intrusion was discovered in mid-December 2006 , the credit card data stolen had been disseminated far and wide .
Forrester Research estimates that when all is said and done , TJX could be on the hook for over $ 1 billion in costs related to the breach during the next five years .
So far , the costs of the fraudulent transactions have been borne by the banks and credit card companies , but TJX will likely have to provide restitution .
A number of banks have sent letters to the retailer demanding reimbursement for fraudulent charges caused by the data breach .
One group of almost 300 banks in New England have filed a class - action lawsuit accusing TJX of gross negligence in failing to protect consumer data with adequate security measures .
2001 called and it wants its state - of - the art WiFi security back
In many ways , " gross negligence " does n't even begin to describe TJX 's blunder .
When I first discovered that the retailer was relying on WEP to secure its store networks , I was stunned .
WEP has been known to be incredibly easy to hack since the first cracks were demonstrated in 2001 .
When we wrote our Wireless Security Blackpaper in July 2002 , we pointed out the weaknesses of both 40 - bit and 104 - bit WEP .
At the time , that security protocol had already been cracked , and since then , the cracks have become ludicrously easy : a group of German researchers revealed last month that they were able to discover the key to a 104 - bit WEP - encrypted network in under two minutes using a 1.7GHz Pentium M to do the heavy lifting .
Equally alarming is the length of time that elapsed between when the hackers first compromised TJX's network and when their numerous intrusions were discovered .
When taken together , it paints a picture of a company that was careless with its corporate network and , as a result , careless with its customers ' personal data .
Companies playing fast and loose with consumers ' personal data have become a sadly familiar story .
In 2005 , credit card processor CardSystems revealed that millions of credit card numbers — which CardSystems had retained in violation of its agreement with Visa and MasterCard — were stolen by hackers .
Again , lax security was to blame , and the fact that Visa and American Express decided to terminate their payment processing agreements with CardSystems was little comfort to the millions of people who had their card numbers stolen .
The time for talking has passed
It 's troubling that after years of data breaches , little has been done to address the underlying problems .
After both the CardSystems data theft and another 2005 incident involving data services company ChoicePoint , politicians began making noise about enacting stricter controls over how consumer data is collected and disseminated , as well as forcing companies to reveal to customers when data thefts occur ( only a handful of states , including California , currently require companies to notify customers of data breaches ) .
Such legislation is needed on the federal level .
Consumers should be notified within a short period after their personal data is compromised .
In addition , the amount of personal data companies are allowed to maintain on customers without their express consent should be severely limited .
Congress should also ban the sale of Social Security numbers , as it considered doing in 2005 in the wake of the ChoicePoint fiasco .
Most importantly , companies like TJX , CardSystems , and ChoicePoint , who are ultimately responsible for the data breaches , should be heavily penalized .
What I said in June 2005 bears repeating : those trafficking in consumer data have proven themselves completely incapable of self - regulation .
It 's time for Congress to step up to the plate and hold those responsible for the problem accountable .
Law prof : Patriot
Act provision possibly tied to attorney firings did n't ' come out of head of Zeus ' David Edwards
Published : Thursday March 8 , 2007 Print This Email
This A Patriot Act provision which may have led to the allegedly political firing of eight US attorneys " did not come out of the head of Zeus , " according to a renowned legal expert .
On MSNBC 's Countdown Wednesday night , George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley analyzed the current " firestorm surrounding the firings . "
Congress is currently investigating whether the firings were politically motivated , and two of the dismissed attorneys , John McKay and David Iglesias , have already testified that they received inappropriate phone calls from top Republican lawmakers and aides .
According to Turley , the provision in the Patriot Act that allowed such firings was no accident .
" When you see an administration trying to try to put into legislation something this specific , this tailored , it does not come out of nowhere , " said Turley .
" It did not come out of the head of Zeus , " Turley said .
" It came out of the head of someone at the White House who wanted to use it .
I think there are serious questions there and this is a scandal that is getting worse by the day . "
" They re not supposed to be constantly looking over their shoulder to see if Karl Rove is coming on them with a wood chipper , " Turley said of US attorneys , who " are supposed to retain an element of independence . "
Turley added , " I have to say that one of the more troubling legacies of the Bush administration has been the politicization of the Department of Justice . "
The entire interview can be watched below : Excerpts from Wednesday 's Countdown transcript : # STEWART : Our third story in the COUNTDOWN , not only did the Bush administration fire eight U.S. attorneys , not only did many of them say they felt pressured , even threatened by GOP officials , not only did the Justice Department claim they were fired for their job performance , then started backtracking , but there is a little - known provision in the Patriot Act that lets the administration put temporary U.S. attorneys in their place without any oversight .
More of that in a moment with constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley .
First the firestorm surrounding the firings .
Congress is investigating .
Here is the back story :
In January , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told the Senate that , quote , I would never ever make a change in the United States attorney for political reasons .
But in February , U.S. attorney Bud Cummins was asked to step aside so that one of Karl Roves former aides could take his job .
Then yesterday Cummins testified in front of Congress about a phone call he got just last month from the deputy attorney generals chief of staff .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) BUD CUMMINS , FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY : He indicated that there was a viewpoint held among people some people in the management of the department that if the controversy would continue to be stirred up , that more information , more damaging information might be brought out .
I am not attempting to quote him here , but the inference was clear .
( END VIDEO CLIP ) STEWART : Cummins shared the inferred warning about speaking out in an e-mail to his former colleagues , including fired U.S. attorney Carl Lamb .
She was let go while she was in charge of the still ongoing corruption investigation that put Republican Congressman Randy  Duke  Cunningham in jail .
And fired U.S. Attorney John Mckay .
Back in 2004 he was called by Republican Congressman Doc Hastings  chief of staff , asking about investigations into electoral fraud after a Democrat won the gubernatorial election .
And fired U.S. attorney David Iglesias , a month before the 2006 election , he got a call from Republican Congresswoman Heather Wilson , who was in a tight race , asking him about ongoing corruption cases against Democratic officials .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) DAVID IGLESIAS , FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY : She had been hearing about sealed indictments and she says , what can you tell me about sealed indictments ?
The second she said any question about a sealed indictment , red flags went up in my head , because , as you know , we cannot talk about indictments until they are made public , in general .
We specifically cannot talk about a sealed indictment .
I was evasive and non-responsive to her questions .
I said , well , we sometimes do sealed indictment for national security cases , sometimes we have to do them for juvenile cases .
She was not happy with that answer and then she said well , I guess , I will have to take your word for it .
And I said I dont think I responded .
Good bye .
That was the substance of that conversation .
SEN .
CHARLES SCHUMER ( D ) , NEW YORK : Did you feel pressured during that call ?
IGLESIAS : Yes sir , I did .
( END VIDEO CLIP ) STEWART : Two weeks later , Wilsons mentor , Republican Senator Pete Domenici , called Iglesias at home .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) IGLESIAS :
He wanted to ask me about the corruption matters or the corruption cases that had been widely reported in the local media .
I said , all right .
And he said , are these going to be filed before November ?
I said I did not think so , to which he replied , I am very sorry to hear that , and then the line went dead .
SCHUMER : So , in other words , he hung up on you .
IGLESIAS : That is how I took that , yes sir .
SCHUMER : He did not say goodbye ?
IGLESIAS : No , sir .
SCHUMER : Did you take that is a sign of his unhappiness with your decision ?
IGLESIAS : I felt sick after word .
So I felt he was upset at hearing the answer that he received .
SCHUMER : Right , and so is it fair to say that you felt pressured to hurry subsequent cases and prosecution as a result of the call ?
IGLESIAS : Yes sir , I did .
I felt leaned on .
I felt pressured to get these matters moving .
SCHUMER : And , as you say , it was unusual for you to receive a call from a senator at home while you were the U.S. attorney ?
IGLESIAS : Unprecedented .
It had never happened .
( END VIDEOTAPE ) STEWART : Lots of phone calls , lots of curious language .
To help us out , Jonathan Turley , law professor at George Washington University .
Nice to see you Jonathan .
JONATHAN TURLEY , GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR :
Thanks , good to see you .
STEWART : All U.S. attorneys are political appointees , who serve at the pleasure of the president .
So what is the subtle , or maybe not so subtle message to U.S. attorneys that these eight prosecutors believe they have been fired for political reasons ?
TURLEY : Well the message is quite clear .
First of all , it is very uncommon for U.S. attorneys to be fired or asked to resign .
To have eight of them put in this position is truly unprecedented .
It does send a very chilling message to other U.S. attorneys that , but for the grace of god , go you .
These are very successful U.S. attorneys .
And what they re reporting about these phone calls is extremely unusual and extremely unsettling .
STEWART : The attorney general , Alberto Gonzales , told Congress the firings were not political at all .
Now , has he backed himself into a corner , if it is proven in some way that they were fired for simply not toeing a political line ?
TURLEY : Well , this is not the first time that Attorney General Gonzales has been challenged in terms of sworn testimony .
He really had to say they were not fired for political reasons .
He can hardly say we really needed to use the spot for some kid Karl Rove likes .
That would not have gone over very well .
What is really getting to a serious point , are the allegations that some of these U.S. attorneys seem to be threatened or thought they were being threatened about speaking to the media or the public .
Also , these calls from politicians really took me back .
I have to tell you , Im a criminal defense attorney .
I have been around the city in the criminal defense system for a long time .
I find it shocking that politicians today would feel comfortable picking up a phone and calling the U.S. attorney about sealed indictments .
It is other - worldly .
STEWART : Lets talk a little bit about the attorneys who testified yesterday .
They were subpoenaed by the Senate and after one former U.S. attorney , the one from Arkansas , spoke to the Attorney Generals Office , he said he was so freaked out by this conversation that he wrote this message to his colleagues .
Let s put this up on the screen so people can see .
 He , the deputy chief of staff , reacted quite a bit to the idea of anyone voluntarily testifying , and it seemed clear that they would see that as a major escalation of the conflict , meriting some kind of unspecified form of retaliation . 
What does this signal to you about the Department of Justice ?
TURLEY : Well , I think the signal is quite obvious .
Remember , were talking about people here who are Republican appointees .
These are not professional whistle - blowers .
These are the ultimate team players .
These are also people who are quite conservative and showed a great deal of loyalty to the administration .
What they apparently did not show was a type of all lockstep obedience that the Justice Department wants .
I have to say that one of the more troubling legacies of the Bush administration has been the politicization of the Department of Justice .
U.S. attorneys are supposed to retain an element of independence .
They re not supposed to be constantly looking over their shoulder to see if Karl Rove is coming on them with a wood chipper .
They are really supposed to be able to conduct themselves in the interest of justice , not just the interest of Karl Rove or the interest of the president alone .
It is true , he can fire them for any reason , but they serve justice , not him personally .
STEWART : Lets talk about that firing .
The folks at Salon.com have another take on this , that its about the Patriot Act , that bypasses Senate approval of justices .
This provision allows the Department of Justice to appoint these interim U.S. attorneys , essentially , without oversight and possibly indefinitely .
Are we seeing abuse of this ?
TURLEY : We are , but dont you find it amazing how many senators are saying they had no idea it what is in the bill ?
STEWART : Yes , Arlen Specter
It was slipped in , allegedly .
That s the term they used , slipped in .
TURLEY : Yes , most people would say gosh , this is a pretty good job .
You dont even have to read the bloody bill to vote on it .
It is , I think , an example of how these senators for the last four years have done very little to earn their salary .
You know , theyve pretty much voted on bills that they did not read and did not understand and constantly say that they are amazed and shocked that this happened .
Well , it happened because Congress has not done oversight in four years .
I am surprised they even showed up for these votes at all .
STEWART : And that change was made just last year and you have these eight attorneys being fired this year .
Do you believe that is coincidence ?
TURLEY : I have to tell you , I dont .
When you see an administration trying to try to put into legislation something this specific , this tailored , it does not come out of nowhere .
It did not come out of the head of Zeus .
It came out of the head of someone at the White House who wanted to use it .
I think there are serious questions there and this is a scandal that is getting worse by the day .
STEWART : Jonathan Turley , constitutional law professor at George Washington University , thanks for all the information .
TURLEY : Thanks a lot .
STEWART : Congress is nt done probing .
Tomorrow the Senate Judiciary Committee will ask for testimony from five Justice Department officials , including the deputy attorney generals chief of staff .
If they do not come willingly , the Senate says it will subpoena them .

Osram has developed a small light - emitting diode spotlight that achieves an output of more than 1,000 lumens for the first time .
That ’s brighter than a 50 - watt halogen lamp , thereby making the device suitable for a broad range of general lighting applications .
The Ostar Lighting LED , which will be launched on the market this summer , can provide sufficient light for a desk from a height of two meters , for example .
Its small size also enables the creation of completely new lamp shapes .
A lumen ( lm ) is the unit of measurement for the amount of light emitted by a light source .
A 60 - watt light bulb emits 730 lm , while a 50 - watt halogen lamp has an output of approximately 900 lm .
To achieve the 1,000 lm output for the tiny Ostar Lighting LED , the experts at Siemens ’ Osram subsidiary employed a sophisticated system for high chip - packing density , whereby the researchers managed to integrate six high - performance LED lighting chips into the unit ’s small housing .
Each chip has an area of only one square millimeter , which makes for very concentrated overall luminosity .
Different types of LEDs are used today in various areas , for example as background lighting in cell phone displays , as well as in car turn - signal lights , brake lights , and daytime running lights .
The benefits are obvious :
The diodes are extremely small and consume little energy because they efficiently convert electricity into light .
The Ostar Lighting LED , for example , produces 75 lumens per watt at 350 milli-amperes of operating current — much more than an incandescent lamp , which only converts a fraction of the electricity supplied into light , with the rest lost as heat energy .
In addition , LEDs contain no lead or mercury , which makes them very environmentally friendly .
They also last around ten times longer than halogen lamps and 50 times longer than incandescent lamps , thereby helping to significantly reduce maintenance costs .
For many years , however , LEDs were unsuited for room lighting applications because they were n’t bright enough .
The Ostar Lighting LED marks a further step toward suitability for such applications .
Osram has already supplied a Migros supermarket in the Swiss canton of St. Gallen with 18,000 Golden Dragon LEDs , which have a lower output than the Ostar Lighting units .
These LEDs emit neither UV rays nor heat , which means they have virtually no negative impact on delicate grocery items such as milk , meat , fruit and vegetables .

A GoDaddy.com Inc. customer is seriously concerned that this domain registrar and hosting company may not be ready for the switch to Daylight Saving Time ( DST ) on Sunday .
In a series of e-mail exchanges and phone calls , George Baltzell was told by GoDaddy .
com 's tech support team that the company is exempt from patching its servers because it is based in Arizona , which does n't observe DST .
" That 's a silly response , " Baltzell said .
Baltzell , who lives in St. Louis , contacted GoDaddy.com 's tech support after he crafted a short script using the PHP language to verify that the company 's servers had been tuned for the DST switch , which comes earlier this year .
His test showed that the GoDaddy.com servers are still acting according to the old DST rules , he said .
" Thank you for contacting Online Support .
As Daylight Savings [ sic ] does not apply to our servers , since we are on Arizona Time and our time zone does not change , our servers would n't update , " reads one of the replies he received , and which he provided to IDG News Service .
He wrote back to GoDaddy , saying that despite being in Arizona , their servers needed to be patched , otherwise timestamps would be wrong when communicating with computers in other areas .
He even provided them with the code he used for his test , but did n't hear back .
When informed of this situation by IDG News Service , GoDaddy sent via e-mail a statement from Chief Information Security Officer Neil Warner .
It said GoDaddy has conducted risk analysis on all its systems in preparation for the DST switch , as well as contacted its vendors and received recommended patches .
" Further , over the weekend , Go Daddy developers and quality assurance teams will be monitoring the transition process closely .
As for our corporate headquarters being located in Scottsdale , Arizona , while the fact that we do not participate in DST minimizes potential impact , we are taking all precautionary steps to ensure our customers , located all over the world , are not impacted , " the statement read .
Told of GoDaddy 's response , Baltzell was puzzled about the different message he got from the technical support team .
On Friday , his test continued to indicate the GoDaddy.com servers have n't been patched , he said .
The main site he hosts with GoDaddy.com is St. Louis Places to See .
He is particularly concerned for a page in which he tracks power outages in the St. Louis metro area , because timestamps are an important part of it .
Whatever ends up happening , Baltzell 's opinion of GoDaddy.com has been soured by the experience .
" Their tech support response is such a non sequitur , it has me wondering whether I should switch to another company , " he said .
In 2005 , President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 .
Among other things , it orders that , beginning in 2007 , the start of DST be moved from the first Sunday in April to the second Sunday in March .
It also shifts the return of standard time from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November .
On Sunday , people in zones impacted by DST must advance their clocks one hour .
They must set clocks back one hour when DST ends this year on Nov. 4 .
The new DST dates have had a significant impact on the IT industry , as vendors have had to issue patches for their systems and users , both consumers and enterprise IT professionals , have had to adjust their computers .
Dana Priest and Anne Hull , the Washington Post reporters who exposed the scandalous conditions at Walter Reed , are now exposing the disastrous mental health treatment provided to the soldiers returning from Iraq .
In short , one more time , we see glaring evidence that George Bush and his government do not support our troops .
The writers spotlight a returning vet , Jeans Cruz , who sought medical treatment from the Veterans Affairs was told he could not get that treatment , in part , because he had n’t served in combat :
None of that seemed to matter when his case reached VA disability evaluators .
They turned him down flat , ruling that he deserved no compensation because his psychological problems existed before he joined the Army .
They also said that Cruz had not proved he was ever in combat .
“ The available evidence is insufficient to confirm that you actually engaged in combat , ” his rejection letter stated .
Yet abundant evidence of his year in combat with the 4th Infantry Division covers his family ’s living - room wall .
The Army Commendation Medal With Valor for “ meritorious actions . . . during strategic combat operations ” to capture Hussein hangs not far from the combat spurs awarded for his work with the 10th Cavalry “ Eye Deep ” scouts , attached to an elite unit that caught the Iraqi leader on Dec. 13 , 2003 , at Ad Dawr .
Unfortunately , Cruz is not alone .
The problems are rampant :
Jeans Cruz and his contemporaries in the military were never supposed to suffer in the shadows the way veterans of the last long , controversial war did .
One of the bitter legacies of Vietnam was the inadequate treatment of troops when they came back .
Tens of thousands endured psychological disorders in silence , and too many ended up homeless , alcoholic , drug - addicted , imprisoned or dead before the government acknowledged their conditions and in 1980 officially recognized PTSD as a medical diagnosis .
Yet nearly three decades later , the government still has not mastered the basics : how best to detect the disorder , the most effective ways to treat it , and the fairest means of compensating young men and women who served their country and returned unable to lead normal lives .
Cruz ’s case illustrates these broader problems at a time when the number of suffering veterans is the largest and fastest - growing in decades , and when many of them are back at home with no monitoring or care .
Between 1999 and 2004 , VA disability pay for PTSD among veterans jumped 150 percent , to $ 4.2 billion .
This week , the U.S. House actually increased spending for mental health because , of course , Bush ’s budget did n’t deliver :
This bill provides $ 600 million more than the President ’s request for mental health , PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury and makes five polytrauma centers and three Centers of Excellence for Mental Health and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) fully operational this year to care for those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan , including those with TBI .
Just because Bush and his GOP flunkies says they support the troop does n’t mean it ’s true .
In fact , one more time , we see it ’s not true .
What ’s worse is that Bush has known about these problems for a while now , and still refuses to fix them .
FDA approves contraceptive that stops periods
2007-05-22 14:56:00 PDT
WASHINGTON --
The Food and Drug Administration today approved the first birth - control pill that can stop a woman 's period indefinitely .
Lybrel , which is made by pharmaceutical giant Wyeth , contains hormone doses lower than oral contraceptives already available .
It is designed for women to take every day of the month , instead of a cycle of 21 days on and 7 days off that is used for most other birth - control pills .
Unscheduled bleeding can occur while on Lybrel , and the pill will not halt menstruation in all women .
The pill is expected to be made widely available by the end of summer , when it will become clear whether women who have grown accustomed to viewing their menstrual cycle as a sign of health and fertility will embrace the idea of skipping their period altogether .
Other forms of birth control -- including Depo - Provera , a shot given every three months , and Implanon , a drug - coated stick that is implanted in a woman 's arm -- also are known to stop most women 's periods .
And for decades , women have taken oral contraceptives already on the market to stop their periods , either indefinitely or for a temporary convenience .
Lybrel is the first oral contraceptive to be designed and marketed specifically for eliminating periods .
At four months , babies can tell whether a speaker has switched to a different language from visual cues alone , according to a University of British Columbia study .
Researcher Whitney Weikum found that infants are able to discern when a different language is spoken by watching the shapes and rhythm of the speaker 's mouth and face movements .
The findings suggest that older infants , raised in a monolingual environment , no longer need this facility .
However , babies growing up in a bilingual environment advantageously maintain the discrimination abilities needed for separating and learning multiple languages .
In a paper to be published in the May 25 issue of the journal Science , Weikum explores whether babies use visual speech information to tell the difference between someone speaking their native language (s ) and an unfamiliar language .
Weikum is a UBC Neuroscience doctoral student working with Canada Research Chair and Psychology Prof. Janet Werker .
The researchers tested three groups of infants -- ages four , six and eight months -- from monolingual English homes and two groups of infants -- ages six and eight months -- from bilingual homes .
They showed each group silent video clips of three bilingual French - English speakers , who recited sentences first in English or French , and then switched to the other language .
Their findings suggest that visual information alone will prompt the babies at four and six months to pay closer attention and watch the video for a longer period when the speakers switch languages .
" We already know that babies can tell languages apart using auditory cues , " says Weikum .
" But this is the first study to show that young babies are prepared to tell languages apart using only visual information . "
The researchers found that six - month - old babies from both bilingual French - English and monolingual English homes could tell the languages apart visually .
These groups would watch the video clips for a significantly longer period if the speaker switched languages .
However , by eight months , only babies from a bilingual French - English home and familiar with both languages were able to tell the languages apart visually .
" This suggests that by eight months , only babies learning more than one language need to maintain this ability .
Babies who only hear and see one language do n't need this ability , and their sensitivity to visual language information from other languages declines . "

Opponents of Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin spent $ 4 million on ads last year trying to link the Democratic incumbent to a state employee who was sent to jail on corruption charges .
The effort failed , and Mr. Doyle was re-elected — and now the state employee has been found to have been wrongly convicted .
The entire affair is raising serious questions about why a United States attorney put an innocent woman in jail .
The conviction of Georgia Thompson has become part of the furor over the firing of eight United States attorneys in what seems like a political purge .
While the main focus of that scandal is on why the attorneys were fired , the Thompson case raises questions about why other prosecutors kept their jobs .
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , which heard Ms. Thompson ’s case this month , did not discuss whether her prosecution was political — but it did make clear that it was wrong .
And in an extraordinary move , it ordered her released immediately , without waiting to write a decision .
“ Your evidence is beyond thin , ” Judge Diane Wood told the prosecutor .
“ I ’m not sure what your actual theory in this case is . ”
Members of Congress should ask whether it was by coincidence or design that Steven Biskupic , the United States attorney in Milwaukee , turned a flimsy case into a campaign issue that nearly helped Republicans win a pivotal governor ’s race .
Do u txt whl drvng ?
If you are doing so in Washington State , cease and desist , or risk a fine .
Gov. Christine Gregoire signed the nation ’s first law yesterday to ban “ D. W.T. ” — driving while texting with a cellphone , BlackBerry or other mobile device .
“ Would you read a book or newspaper while you were driving ?
No ! ” Governor Gregoire said .
“ Then why would you text while driving ? ”
New Jersey is asking , too .
The Legislature is considering a bill to outlaw D.W.T. ( one of its sponsors , Paul D. Moriarty , admitted to sometimes using his BlackBerry while driving ) .
Some states already ban talking on a cellphone behind the wheel unless a headset is used , and Washington joined that group yesterday .
But while reading or other distracting activities may not actually be illegal behind the wheel , more legislators seem to be worried about the danger of multitaskers tapping away without coming to a stop .
John Reid says identity cards are central to measures
The plan is to stop illegal immigrants getting housing , healthcare or work .
He said the UK was now " throwing out " record numbers of asylum seekers and he hoped to make life " constrained and uncomfortable " for illegal immigrants .
But the Lib Dems said " impersonating Alf Garnett " could not absolve him of responsibility for migration failings .
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg added : " The more John Reid yells at ' foreigners ' the greater the suspicion will grow that he is simply trying to divert attention from this Government 's own incompetence .
" What the public want is quiet competence , not loud incompetence . "
ILLEGAL MIGRANTS
Home office estimate : 310,000 - 570,000 Migration Watch estimate : 515,000 - 870,000
The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants warned against " hyping up public emotions " .
For the Conservatives , the shadow home office minister Damian Green said there was " nothing much new in here ... it is a package of announcements rather than anything changing . "
He said the idea that most illegal immigrants were in the UK " to scrounge off the benefits system " was factually wrong , saying instead that most were in the UK to work .
The Home Office plans include a proposal to run a pilot scheme to send text messages reminding people not to overstay their visas .
Mr Reid plans to use texts to help stop people overstaying their visa
This has been criticised by opposition parties , but Mr Reid dismissed it as a minor measure , stressing instead the core of the package was to beef up the powers of immigration officers to police the borders , as well as compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals seeking to settle in the UK .
Mr Reid told BBC Breakfast : " It is unfair that foreigners come to this country illegitimately and steal our benefits , steal our services like the NHS and undermine the minimum wage by working .
" Year on year , we are going to make it even more difficult for them to do that . "
And he told BBC Radio Five Live : " We are now throwing out more asylum seekers - failed asylum seekers - than ever before . "
REID'S PROPOSALS
' Watch list ' of people not entitled to public services Enforcement teams to track down bosses employing illegal workers Compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals
Text alerts for people overstaying visas Possible £ 20,000 fines for landlords housing illegal immigrants Remove driving licences Pilot schemes to use ID card data to ensure migrants pay for NHS care
Send us your comments
Estimates vary widely as to how many illegal immigrants are living in the UK .
The Home Office ran into trouble last year when it said it had no idea , but later produced an estimate of up to 570,000 .
Pressure group Migration Watch puts the figure at between 515,000 and 870,000 .
Measures being introduced to make life more difficult for illegal immigrants includes a " watch list " to alert government agencies if someone applies for services to which they are not entitled .
Workplace enforcement teams will also attempt to track down companies employing people who should not be in the country .
' Exploitation '
There will also be pilot schemes in three NHS trusts using data from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to ensure migrants pay for care where required to do so .
Mr Reid said most people who came to the UK wanted to comply fully with immigration laws but those who did not should not enjoy the same benefits and privileges .
LEGAL MIGRATION 2004 - 07 EU accession countries : 427,000 ( about 600,000 including self - employed ) Dependants : 36,000 Non-EU settlement : 318,330 Granted asylum : 123,000 Non-EU work permits : 261,235 , plus 87,000 dependants Total : 1,425,565

" That 's why the time is now right to tackle the root cause of the problem - exploitation .
We have to tackle not only the illegal trafficking but also the illegal jobs at the end of the journey .
" This new approach will make life in this country ever more uncomfortable and constrained for those who come here illegally , " the home secretary said .
The policy has been welcomed by the Association of Chief Police Officers .
Spokesman Grahame Maxwell said it was " a really positive step forward for the Home Office , police and other agencies " .
Meanwhile , further education minister Bill Rammell said the Department for Education was " on the case " of colleges which act as a front for foreign nationals to enter the country and stay as students .
If tough rhetoric and gimmicks were enough to sort out our immigration system , we would have the best in the world
Nick Clegg , Lib Dems
However , Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants chief executive Habib Rahman said : " Barring up to half a million irregular migrants in the UK from access to rights and services is not a realistic or humane response . "
He added : " We want a more balanced approach , not just hyping up public emotions on some very emotive subjects . "
He called for action on people trafficking rather than a crackdown on the " victims " of it and an amnesty on illegal workers .
Shadow home secretary David Davis accused John Reid of giving up on trying to deport hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants , preferring to " spam them with text messages " .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg said : " If tough rhetoric and gimmicks were enough to sort out our immigration system , we would have the best in the world . "
Ranking by Failed Requests and Connection time ,
March 1st - 31st 2007
DataPipe , Navisite , MyHosting.com and iWeb8 are the most reliable hosting companies for March 2007 , followed closely by New York Internet and Webfusion .
This marks the first time in the top spot of our monthly rankings for NaviSite and My Hosting.com , although each have been among the top 10 a number of times .
DataPipe has been the most reliable host fives times previously , while iWeb8 was the top performer in January .
NaviSite is a managed hosting company in Andover , Mass. , that also provides content distribution services .
Navisite is publicly held , and was among the best performing U.S. stocks in the infrastructure sector in 2006 , when its shares rose 457 percent .
It has 950 customers in 14 data centers in the US , UK and India .
MyHosting.com is the hosting arm of SoftCom Technology Consulting , which also operates the mail2web email service .
MyHosting.com is based in Toronto , Canada and was founded in 1997 .
The company specializes in hosting on the Microsoft platform , but added Linux hosting in 2004 .
Three of the 10 most most reliable hosts run their web sites on Windows , fiveon Linux and two on FreeBSD .
Netcraft measures and makes available the response times of fifty leading hosting providers ' sites .
The performance measurements are made at fifteen minute intervals from separate points around the internet , and averages are calculated over the immediately preceding 24 hour period .
From a customers ’ point of view , the percentage of failed requests is more pertinent than outages on the hosting companies ’ own sites , as this gives a pointer to reliability of routing , and this is why we choose to rank our table by fewest failed requests , rather than shortest periods of outage .
Fuller information on the measurement process and current measurements are available .
It could just be that the bees are stressed out .
Bees are being raised to survive a shorter offseason , to be ready to pollinate once the almond bloom begins in February .
That has most likely lowered their immunity to viruses .
Mites have also damaged bee colonies , and the insecticides used to try to kill mites are harming the ability of queen bees to spawn as many worker bees .
The queens are living half as long as they did just a few years ago .
Researchers are also concerned that the willingness of beekeepers to truck their colonies from coast to coast could be adding to bees ’ stress , helping to spread viruses and mites and otherwise accelerating whatever is afflicting them .
Dennis van Engelsdorp , a bee specialist with the state of Pennsylvania who is part of the team studying the bee colony collapses , said the “ strong immune suppression ” investigators have observed “ could be the AIDS of the bee industry , ” making bees more susceptible to other diseases that eventually kill them off .
Growers have tried before to do without bees .
In past decades , they have used everything from giant blowers to helicopters to mortar shells to try to spread pollen across the plants .
More recently researchers have been trying to develop “ self - compatible ” almond trees that will require fewer bees .
One company is even trying to commercialize the blue orchard bee , which is virtually stingless and works at colder temperatures than the honeybee .
Beekeepers have endured two major mite infestations since the 1980s , which felled many hobbyist beekeepers , and three cases of unexplained disappearing disorders as far back as 1894 .
But those episodes were confined to small areas , Mr. van Engelsdorp said .
Today the industry is in a weaker position to deal with new stresses .
A flood of imported honey from China and Argentina has depressed honey prices and put more pressure on beekeepers to take to the road in search of pollination contracts .
Beekeepers are trucking tens of billions of bees around the country every year .
In private , Bush administration sub - cabinet officials who have been instrumental in formulating and sustaining the legal " war paradigm " acknowledge that their efforts to create a system for detainees separate from due process , criminal justice and law enforcement have failed .
One of the key framers of the war paradigm ( in which the president in his wartime capacity as commander - in - chief makes and enforces laws as he sees fit , overriding the constitutional system of checks and balances ) , who a year ago was arguing vehemently for pushing its boundaries , confesses that he has abandoned his belief in the whole doctrine , though he refuses to say so publicly .
If he were to speak up , given his seminal role in formulating the policy and his stature among the Federalist Society cadres that run it , his rejection would have a shattering impact , far more than political philosopher Francis Fukuyama 's denunciation of the neo-conservatism he formerly embraced .
But this figure remains careful to disclose his disillusionment with his own handiwork only in off - the - record conversations .
Yet another Bush legal official , even now at the commanding heights of power , admits that the administration 's policies are largely discredited .
In its defence , he says without a hint of irony or sarcasm , " Not everything we 've done has been illegal . "
He adds , " Not everything has been ultra vires " - a legal term referring to actions beyond the law .
A policy in retreat
The resistance within the administration to Bush 's torture policy , the ultimate expression of the war paradigm , has come to an end through attrition and exhaustion .
More than two years ago , vice - president Dick Cheney 's then chief - of - staff I Lewis " Scooter " Libby and then general counsel David Addington physically cornered one of the few internal opponents , subjecting him to threats , intimidation and isolation .
About that time , the tiny band of opponents within approached Karen Hughes newly named undersecretary - of - state for public diplomacy , hoping that the long - time confidante of President Bush , now assigned responsibility for the United States image in the world , might be willing to hear them out on the damage done by continuation of the torture policy .
But she rebuffed them .
On 12 June 2007 , Hughes unveiled her major report , extolling " our commitment to freedom , human rights and the dignity and equality of every human being " , but making no mention of detainee policy .
The action part consists of another of her campaign - oriented rapid - response schemes , this one a Counterterrorism Communications Center , staffed by military and intelligence officers , to rebut the false claims of terrorists .
Asked whether the administration 's policies might be a factor contributing to the problem , Sean McCormick , the state - department spokesman , replied : " You 're always going to get people criticising policy . "
General David Petraeus 's declaration on 10 May 2007 against torture reflected less the ringing authority of an order than the impotence of a personal credo .
" Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal , history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary " , he said .
But his moral sentiment had been dismissed long before he had uttered it .
The commander 's strongly worded statement , putting him by implication in the category of " people criticizing policy " , had no effect on the elaborate system of " enhanced interrogation techniques " , black - site prisons , maintenance of GuantÃ¡namo , or the 20,000 Iraqi prisoners incarcerated on US military bases without due process .
Petraeus has no more influence over the president who says he listens to his military commanders than the commanders who have opposed the policy since its inception .
In the year since the Supreme Court ruled ( on 29 June 2006 ) in Hamdan v Rumsfeld that the Bush administration 's military commissions for detainees violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva conventions - and Bush promptly got the Republican - led Congress to legislate approval of the illegal commissions as well as suspend habeas corpus - further court decisions have thrown his war paradigm into a legal twilight zone .
In February 2007 , a Cheney protÃ©gÃ© , Susan J Crawford , was appointed as the convening authority for military commissions .
An armed - forces appeals - court judge , she had been Cheney 's special counsel when he was secretary of defense under the elder Bush and had become a family friend .
She has long been close to Libby and Addington .
She facilitated the unusual transfer of David Hicks , a former kangaroo skinner from Australia , captured in Afghanistan as a fighter with the Taliban and held at GuantÃ¡namo .
Charged with a host of crimes , including murder , Hicks filed an affidavit alleging torture .
When the Hamdan decision was handed down , the charges against him were dropped , but after passage of the Military Commissions
Act he was newly charged with providing material aid to terrorism .
His five - year detention in GuantÃ¡namo provoked a public outcry in Australia .
Cheney flew there to confer with Prime Minister John Howard , who wanted to defuse the issue .
Soon afterward , a deal was worked out :
Hicks pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of providing material aid , he was released to Australian authorities , and he is serving a reduced nine - month sentence .
Crawford 's appointment , however , did not prevent military - commission judges at GuantÃ¡namo from ruling on 4 June that the commissions had no jurisdiction over enemy combatants who were not designated as " unlawful " .
In effect , this decision threw the commissions into a void .
According to the judges ' decision two prisoners , Omar Kadhr , captured as a 15 - year - old child soldier and accused of killing a US special - forces medic on the battlefield , and Salim Hamdan , one of Osama bin Laden 's former drivers , did not fall under the category that would enable them to be tried by the commissions .
A devastating jugment
On 11 June , the US court of appeals for the 4th circuit , the most conservative in the country , issued a decision striking at the heart of Bush 's conception of the presidency .
In al - Marri v Wright the court ruled that Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , a resident of Qatar , arrested as a student at Bradley University in the United States , accused of aiding al - Qaida , could not be held in indefinite detention as an " enemy combatant " and must be remanded to the civilian criminal court system .
( Al - Marri , in an affidavit , claimed to have been tortured . )
The decision acknowledged that al - Marri might have committed serious crimes .
But the government 's assertion that the president has " inherent constitutional authority " , rooted in his " war- making powers " , is a " breathtaking claim " contrary to US constitutional law and history .
" The President " , the court said , " claims power that far exceeds that granted him by the Constitution . "
This extraordinary decision , citing the framers , declared Bush 's actions - and his imperial presidency - null and void .
It is worth quoting at some length :
" Put simply , the Constitution does not allow the President to order the military to seize civilians residing within the United States and detain them indefinitely without criminal process , and this is so even if he calls them " enemy combatants " ...
Of course , this does not mean that the President lacks power to protect our national interests and defend our people , only that in doing so he must abide by the Constitution .
We understand and do not in any way minimize the grave threat international terrorism poses to our country and our national security ...
The Court has specifically cautioned against â€˜break[ing ] faith with this Nation 's tradition ' - â€˜firmly embodied in the Constitution ' - â€ ˜of keeping military power subservient to civilian authority . '
Reid , 354 U.S. at 40 .
When the Court wrote these words in 1957 , it explained that â€ ˜[t ] he country ha[d ] remained true to that faith for almost one hundred seventy years . '
Id .
Another half century has passed but the necessity of â€˜remain[ ing ] true to that faith ' remains as important today as it was at our founding . "
Then , the court delivered the coup de grÃ¢ce to Bush 's " war paradigm " .
Having cited the framers , it now cited the example of Abraham Lincoln :
" In an address to Congress at the outset of the Civil War , President Lincoln defended his emergency suspension of the writ of habeas corpus to protect Union troops moving to defend the Capital .
Lincoln famously asked : â€ ˜ [ A ]re all the laws , but one , to go unexecuted , and the government itself to go to pieces , lest that one be violated ? '
Abraham Lincoln , Message to Congress in Special Session ( July 4 , 1861 ) , in Abraham Lincoln : Speeches and Writings 1859 - 1865 at 246 , 254 ( Don E. Fehrenbacher ed. , 1989 ) .
The authority the President seeks here turns Lincoln 's formulation on its head .
For the President does not acknowledge that the extraordinary power he seeks would result in the suspension of even one law and he does not contend that this power should be limited to dire emergencies that threaten the nation .
Rather , he maintains that the authority to order the military to seize and detain certain civilians is an inherent power of the Presidency , which he and his successors may exercise as they please .
To sanction such presidential authority to order the military to seize and indefinitely detain civilians , even if the President calls them â€˜enemy combatants , ' would have disastrous consequences for the Constitution - and the country .
For a court to uphold a claim to such extraordinary power would do more than render lifeless the Suspension Clause , the Due Process Clause , and the rights to criminal process in the Fourth , Fifth , Sixth , and Eighth Amendments ; it would effectively undermine all of the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution .
It is that power - were a court to recognize it - that could lead all our laws â€ ˜to go unexecuted , and the government itself to go to pieces . '
We refuse to recognize a claim to power that would so alter the constitutional foundations of our Republic . "
Presidential fiat vs the rule of law
Few , if any , presidents have ever been the subject of such a devastating legal decision .
While presidential actions have been ruled illegal or unconstitutional in the past , they were individual acts .
But in the case of Bush , the al - Marri decision not only discredits Bush 's position but denies his idea of his presidential legitimacy in the American tradition .
The decision also declares that Bush 's idea is a mortal threat to the constitution .
And this ruling was issued by the most conservative court in the land .
And yet , nothing changes .
After such a stinging rebuke as the decision handed down by the 4th circuit , a reasonable president might well contemplate changing his approach .
Instead , Bush digs in , doubles down , surges .
As with his other discredited policies , Bush attempts to salvage them through willpower and extra effort , throwing more resources down black holes .
Ultimately , his position is losing its cloak of legality .
Piece by piece , case by case , the courts are exposing it as ultra vires .
The impulse for supporting the policy , on one level , remains visceral and virulent .
Stephen Holmes , professor at the NYU School of Law , describes the concept of " mirror imaging " in his new book , The Matador 's Cape : America 's Reckless Response to Terror : " If our enemies have renounced the laws of civilization , so will we .
If they organized a sneak attack , then we will respond with a dirty war .
If they terrorized us , we will terrorize them . "
For some , this vengeance - " We need to humiliate them " , according to Henry Kissinger - requires something more ; it involves upholding faith that transcends law .
On 16 June , associate justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court , at an international conference on torture and terrorism in Ottawa , Ontario , sought to resolve the question on a moral basis .
His disquisition consisted of a defence of Jack Bauer , the fictional hero of the torture - porn Fox TV series 24 .
" Are you going to convict Jack Bauer ?
Say that criminal law is against him ?
' You have the right to a jury trial ? '
Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer ?
I do n't think so .
So the question is really whether we believe in these absolutes .
And ought we believe in these absolutes . "
Thus , for this conservative jurist , torture , dramatised through popular entertainment , remained the same obsession with " absolutes " as it had been during the inquisition , which after all developed the enhanced coercive techniques used today .
By contrast , Bush 's stance is merely political , a raw assertion of unaccountable and unlimited power .
Yet the political idea he seeks to defend - a presidency operating by fiat above the rule of law - finds itself increasingly in conflict with the American system of justice , and not only on the question of detainees and torture .

The science curriculum changed last autumn
They have lodged a petition at 10 Downing Street calling for ministers to bring back mathematical rigour into secondary physics education .
They complain that a new GCSE syllabus for physics focuses on debates on topics such as global warming and nuclear power instead of calculations .
The regulator for England , the QCA , says the exams give a core of science .
The petition - signed by 271 people - was started by a secondary school teacher , Wellington Grey .
' How science works '
The London - based teacher , who works in an independent school , has posted an article about the GCSE changes on the internet which is being discussed by various online scientific communities .
He wrote : " I am a physics teacher .
Or , at least I used to be .
My subject is still called physics .
My pupils will sit an exam and earn a GCSE in physics , but that exam does n't cover anything I recognize as physics " .
He says the changes to the physics syllabus have meant a shift away from precision towards the general teaching of " how science works " .
The result is a fiasco that will destroy physics in England
Wellington Grey , physics teacher
" In this course , pupils debate topics like global warming and nuclear power .
Debate drives science , but pupils do not learn meaningful information about the topics they debate .
Scientific argument is based on quantifiable evidence .
" The person with the better evidence , not the better rhetoric or talking points , wins .
But my pupils now discuss the benefits and drawbacks of nuclear power plants , without any real understanding of how they work or what radiation is .
" The result is a fiasco that will destroy physics in England , " he argues .
The GCSE science curriculum was changed this academic year after a review .
Scientists and the government were alarmed at the fall in the number of pupils opting to study science over the past 20 years .
The focus of the new general science curriculum is now meant to be on understanding how science works and making it relevant to interest a wider range of pupils .
The expectation is that those with interest in further science study do an additional science GCSE .
From 2008 , all schools will have to offer three sciences for all pupils showing ability in the field ( those working at level 6 or above ) .
A spokesperson for the AQA exam board said : " Our specifications meet the new requirements for science set by our regulator , the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority , and are fully accredited .
" The revised requirements place a greater emphasis on ' how science works ' .
This is the entitlement curriculum for every student : the focus is on scientific literacy with the aim of engaging all students . "
The new science curriculum and GCSEs provide a common core of science
QCA spokesperson
A QCA spokesperson said : " The new science curriculum and GCSEs provide a common core of science which all young people will need to understand the issues that will affect their lives .
It also provides a thorough grounding for those who will continue studying science at A - level and beyond .
" The vast majority of pupils will continue to study the equivalent of two GCSEs ' worth of science : GCSE Science ( the ' core ' ) plus their choice of appropriate additional GCSEs . "
The Institute of Physics says it is too early to pass judgement on the new syllabus .
The institute aims to encourage more pupils to study the subject at A - level .
Daniel Sandford Smith , from the institute said : " It 's too early to judge what the impact will be .
We will wait to see what the impact on A - level take - up will be " .

Attend a seminar or read any book or article on C++ , and there will be presented more or less the " correct " way to write C++ programs ( or at least the way the author feels is correct ) .
Certain practices are deprecated as " buggy " , " sloppy " , " non-portable " , " undefined " , " illegal " or just plain " bad . "
We are exhorted not to do such things , at the risk of bugs , being fired , or the ridicule of our peers .
But to take an analogy from drag racing , sometime what matters is getting across the finish line the fastest .
How you did it does not matter .
Certainly , everything and anything has been tried by backyard hotrodders .
What are some things that can be done with C++ , that a good backyard hotrodder with greasy overalls and a pack of cigs rolled in his shirtsleeve would do , to get a program speeding over the finish line first ?
The rules of this game are simple — to be a backyard C++ hotrodding modification , it 's got to make the program faster than the " correct " way .
Warning : use of these techniques is rumored to be illegal in at least 5 states .
They may cause you to be fired .
C++ gurus will heap contempt upon your head .
You 'll get an " F " from your professor .
Your warranty will be voided .
So let 's pop the hood and slip that bottle of nitrous in .
Pointer Hydration
Let 's say we have a large , in - memory data structure .
We 'd like to save this data structure into a disk file , and in some other invocation of the program , read it back in and reconstitute the data structure .
The proper way to do this is to serialize the data structure , object by object , into some disk friendly format .
The format is then read , parsed , and object by object , it gets recreated back in memory .
Each object needs a serialize function , where one must figure out how to represent each member on disk , and a constructor that can build a replica of that object from the serialized data .
When the data structure is non-trivial , with cycles , pointers , shared objects , etc. , this is not a simple task .
Furthermore , it is inherently slow .
Each object must be broken down into its serial representation , and when reconstituting , each object must be allocated , constructed , and put back together .
But the data structure is already in memory , in a sequence of bytes .
Could n't that just be copied to disk , and read back in again ?
Yes , if we 're willing to step outside of defined behavior .
The first thing to do is organize the data structure so it is entirely contained within a known block or sequence of blocks of memory .
This means it may not contain any pointers or references to objects outside of itself .
That also means no references to string literals , which are stored in the static program data , or any other static data .
Next , create a custom allocator / deallocator for the objects that go into the data structure , so that they are allocated within a known block or sequence of blocks , and not mixed up with other allocations that are not to be saved .
So , those blocks can then just be rolled out directly into disk files , and rolled back in .
Right ?
Nope , because there are pointers .
When it 's rolled back in , it 's probably not going to wind up at the same address , and the pointers will all be pointing to the wrong place .
We need a way to dehydrate the pointers when writing the blocks to disk , and hydrate them ( just add water ! ) when reading a block back in , so they become real pointers again .
This can be done by walking the data structure , and for each pointer in each object , convert that pointer to an address to an offset from the start of the block .
Each class gets a dehydrate function , which handles all the pointers in its objects .
But there 's a problem .
If the data structure is cyclic , or has multiple pointers to the same object , we need a way to determine if a pointer has been dehydrated already or not .
Just comparing the pointer value to see what range it lies in is not enough , as an offset into the block (s ) may overlap the physical addresses the block is mapped into .
The solution lies in noticing that allocators typically allocate data that is aligned on 2 or 4 byte boundaries ( and since we 're writing custom allocator for this , we can ensure this property ) .
That means , for a valid pointer , the least significant bit will always be 0 .
We can then define a dehydrated pointer as being odd , and a hydrated pointer as being 1 .
Dehydrating a pointer then becomes :
void ptr_dehydrate ( void ** p ) { if ( * p ) *( long *) p |= 1 ; }
int isdehydrated ( void * p ) { return ( ( long ) p & 1 ) !=
0 ; } void ptr_hydrate ( void ** p ) { if ( isdehydrated ( * p ) ) *( char **) p -= ptr_adjust ; }
class
Foo { void * p ; Bar * o ; virtual void dehydrate ( ) { ptr_dehydrate ( &p ) ; if ( o && !isdehydrated ( o ) ) { o-> dehydrate ( ) ; ptr_dehydrate ( &o ) ; } } virtual void hydrate ( ) { ptr_hydrate ( &p ) ; if ( isdehydrated ( o ) ) { o-> hydrate ( ) ; ptr_hydrate ( &o ) ; } } }
Pointers into the middle of strings may already be odd , so this technique wo n't work .
Ensure there are no references to static data or data outside of the block (s ) .
Any objects with virtual functions , or derived from a class with virtual functions , are going to have a vptr member which points to a static vtbl array .
These are all part of the implementation - defined areas of any C++ class implementation .
It 's likely that the vptrs will not be pointing to the right vtbl when the object is reconstituted .
The ways to deal with this is to 1 ) avoid using such classes or 2 ) when the object is being hydrated , jam the right vptr value .
The code will have to be adjusted so that the test / set of the least significant bit of the pointer really is the least significant bit .
Vptr Jamming
vptr
vtbl [ ]
vptr
vtbl [ ]
vtbl [ ]
vptr
vptr
and hydrating it becomes : and for a class :
In practice , this works out really fast .
But since it is " bad " C++ code , there are some problem areas that must be avoided or accounted for : Vptrs are one of the typical under - the - hood implementation details of a class .
Virtual functions are often implemented by adding a hidden member called awhich points to a table of functions called the .
A virtual function call is performed by using theto find the , and then calling the function at a specific index into that .
Therefore , the polymorphic behavior of a class object is controlled by where the hiddenmember is pointing .
Themember is set when the object is constructed by some hidden code added by the compiler to every constructor for that object 's class .
So , by manipulating the vptr ourselves , we can control the behavior of an object , even change its type , without calling a constructor .
This technique is called vptr jamming .
For example , consider a collection class which needs to be very fast .
Most of the time , it will be used in a single - threaded manner , but sometimes , in a multithreaded manner .
The program can go back and forth between single and multithreaded more than once during execution .
It 's got to run as fast as possible , so in single - threaded mode the time spent to do locks is unaffordable .
So , our class might look like :
struct Collection { ... members of the collection ... virtual void foo( ) = 0 ; } ; struct SingleThreadedCollection : Collection { void foo ( ) { ... optimized for single threaded ... } } ; struct MultiThreadedCollection : Collection { void foo ( ) { ... synced for multithreaded ... } } ;
vptr
struct Collection { ... members of the collection ... virtual void foo( ) = 0 ; void toSingle ( ) ; void toMulti( ) ; } ; struct SingleThreadedCollection : Collection { static SingleThreadedCollection tmp ; void foo ( ) { ... optimized for single threaded ... } } ; struct MultiThreadedCollection : Collection { static MultiThreadedCollection tmp ; void foo ( ) { ... synced for multi threaded ... } } ; SingleThreadedCollection SingleThreadedCollection ::tmp ; MultiThreadedCollection MultiThreadedCollection : : tmp ; void Collection :: toSingle ( ) { *( void **) this = *( void **) &SingleThreadedCollection : : tmp ; } void Collection :: toMulti ( ) { *( void **) this = *( void **) &MultiThreadedCollection : : tmp ; }
toXxxx ( )
vptr
tmp
vptr
* this
The desire is to switch back and forth between single and multithreaded operations without having to destruct and reconstruct the object — we want to dynamically change the behavior by switching ( i.e. jamming ) the .
Here 's how that would look :
The assignment in thefunctions gets the value of the rightfrom the static temporarycreated for just that purpose , and jams it into thelocation in .
For most compilers , the vptr is at offset 0 of the struct .
For the rest , this code will have to be tweaked to account .
Naturally , there are problems that must be avoided or accounted for here as well :
All the class types which are to be jammed must be of the same size , or at least , the allocated size must be the size of the largest .
Different compilers , and even different versions of the same compiler , will store the vptr at different offsets within the object instance .
A bit of simple testing and looking at the generated assembler will quickly find it .
at different offsets within the object instance .
A bit of simple testing and looking at the generated assembler will quickly find it .
Vptr jamming assumes that , for each of the class types to be jammed , the vptr will be at the same offset .
This is true of all the compilers I tried it on , but there is certainly no guarantee that this is true .
RTTI Sniping
vptr
vtbl [ ]
vptr
vtbl [ ]
As observed withjamming , the polymorphic behavior of an object instance is controlled by whatitsis pointing too .
It 's not a big leap from that to realize that by testing the value in the , the type of the object can be determined .
The usual way to determine the derived type of an object is by doing a dynamic_cast .
If the dynamic_cast to a derived class succeeds , it returns a pointer to the derived class .
If it fails , it returns NULL :
dynamic_cast is slooooww .
For example :
struct A { virtual int foo( ) ; } ; struct B : A { int foo( ) ; } ; int test ( A * a ) { return dynamic_cast < B*>( a ) !=
0 ; }
a
B
mov EAX , 4 [ ESP ] test EAX , EAX je L24 push 0 push offset FLAT : ___ti?
AUB@@ push offset FLAT : ___ti?AUA@@ push EAX mov ECX , [ EAX ] push dword ptr - 4 [ ECX ] call near ptr ?__rtti_cast@@YAPAXPAX0
PBD1H@Z add ESP,014h jmp short L26 L24 : xor EAX , EAX L26 : neg EAX sbb EAX, EAX neg EAX ret
Here 's the generated assembly code for the test to see ifis really an instance of There are lots of instructions being executed , and a function call .
It also relies on RTTI being generated for the class , which is bbllooaatt .
If only we could snipe the RTTI and figure out the type directly .
If we 've got the need for speed , we can do the following :
B tmp ; int test ( A * a ) { return *( void * * ) a == *( void **) &tmp ; }
vptr
tmp
vptr
a
&tmp
All this does is compare thein a with the vptr in .
Most compilers put theas the first member in a class most of the time , so this will work .
When it does n't , adjust the offset toandto match .
The generated assembler code looks like :
mov EAX, 4 [ ESP ] mov ECX , [ EAX ] cmp ECX , ?tmp@@3UB@@A mov EAX,1 je L15 xor EAX , EAX L15 : ret
__istype
int test ( A * a ) { return a-> __istype( B ) != 0 ; }
mov EAX , 4 [ ESP ] cmp dword ptr [ EAX ] , offset FLAT : ??_QB@@6B@ [ 4 ] mov EAX,1 je L13 xor EAX , EAX L13 : ret
dynamic_cast
vtbl [ ]
dynamic_cast
Holy hotrod , Batman !
That brought the test for the type down to two instructions .
We can even do slightly better .
The Digital Mars C++ compiler has special support for RTTI sniping with thepseudo member function : and we 're down to one instruction :
The obvious question is , why doesn ' tproduce the short , fast code ?
The answer is that RTTI sniping only works if the class type being tested for is the most derived class in the class heirarchy ( because that determines the ) , whereasneeds to work for any derived class .
Once again , there are problems with RTTI sniping :
Some implementations are able to share vtbl [ ] s between classes , so the vptr for class B and class A , where B is derived from A , point to the same value .
This clever compiler optimization must be defeated , sometimes it can be via a switch to " turn on RTTI " , or by some other switch .
Worst case , avoid using RTTI sniping between classes derived from one another .
s between classes , so the for class and class , where is derived from , point to the same value .
This clever compiler optimization must be defeated , sometimes it can be via a switch to " turn on RTTI " , or by some other switch .
Worst case , avoid using RTTI sniping between classes derived from one another .
Some ( generally older ) compilers can generate multiple vtbl [ ] s for the same class , so that two vptr s can hold different addresses , but still be the same type .
Fortunately , such compilers are rarely used these days .
But the problem can still crop up if one DLL generates one instance while another DLL generates another .
The moral is to have all the constructors for a particular object implemented in one source file , and have that be only in one DLL , not many .
The Counterfeit this
Declare the implementation as private : #include " implementation.h " class
Foo { private : ... the implementation ... // the interface public : void bar ( ) { ... manipulate the implementation ... } } ;
The trouble with this , of course , is that the implementation is still there with its bare face hanging out , and in order to compile it , every irrelevant thing that the implementation needs has to be in scope , too .
Use the PIMPL idiom as described by Herb Sutter , where the class contains a pointer to the implementation of the class : // User sees this class definition class Implementation ; // stub definition class Foo { private : Implementation * pimpl ; // the interface public : Foo( ) ; void bar ( ) ; } ; // Separate , hidden version of Foo #include " implementation . h " Foo :: Foo( ) : pimpl( new Implementation ( ) ) { } void Foo : : bar ( ) { pimpl -> bar ( ) ; }
The two conventional methods for hiding the implementation of a class are : This succeeds in hiding the implementation details , at the cost of another layer of allocation and an extra object instance .
But there 's a way to hide the implementation completely without having an extra object .
The idea is to counterfeit the this pointer , so that the user thinks it is one type , but the implementation knows it is another :
// User sees this class definition class Foo { // the interface public : Foo * factory ( ) ; // create and initialize an instance void bar ( ) ; } ; // Separate , hidden version of Foo #include " implementation . h "
Foo * Foo : : factory ( ) { return reinterpret_cast < Foo *> new Implementation ( ) ; } void Foo : : bar ( ) { ( reinterpret_cast < Implementation *> this ) -> bar ( ) ; }
reinterpret_cast
Implementation
Foo
Theis doing the dirty work of counterfeiting the type of the object fromtoand back again .
Caveats :
The class
Foo cannot have any data members , even hidden ones like a vptr .
Therefore , it cannot have any virtual functions .
cannot have any data members , even hidden ones like a .
Therefore , it cannot have any virtual functions .
Foo cannot have any constructors , because we are n't constructing a real Foo , only a counterfeit one .
Conclusion
C++ provides great tools for under the hood optimization , but its use is uniformly and actively discouraged .
If you 're willing to accept that you 're going outside all recommended practice , there are some neat things to be done to hotrod your C++ application .
These techniques are also applicable to the D programming language [ 1 ] .
Sometimes , you just feel the need for speed .

He mangled the thing pretty good , but amazingly it still turns on , albeit with a busted touch - screen .
However , Nintendo ’s customer service provides a happy ( ish ) ending to this story .
Here ’s a rough version of my call to Nintendo :
Nintendo :
Nintendo of America !
This is —- , how may I help you ?
Me :
Yeah … um , my puppy ate my DSlite .
Nintendo :
[ Smothered laughter ] oh no !
Me :
Yeah , it got pretty mangled .
I ’m wondering if there ’s any way I can get it fixed for less than buying a new one .
Nintendo :
Well , that depends – how mangled is it ?
Me :
Well , it still turns on but the bottom screen is busted , there are teeth marks all over the plastic , and …
Nintendo :
Yeah , that does n’t sound like it ’s fixable .
Me :
No , I did n’t think so .
Nintendo :
You said it ’s a DSlite ?
You mean you just got it , huh ?

Wow , that ’s terrible !.
Usually we charge full price for a replacement , but since you just got it let me see if there ’s anything I can do …

Israelis and Palestinians were among the wounded
Hamas vowed to intensify attacks against Israel following the bombing at the main Erez crossing .
Militants identified the bomber as Hamas member Reem Raiyshi , a mother - of - two in her early 20s , from Gaza .
Israel condemned the bombing and warned it might tighten restrictions against Palestinians .
At least two Palestinians were among seven people injured in the blast .
Males ' face obstacles '
Hamas and the al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades , which is linked to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 's Fatah faction , said the attack in Erez was a joint operation .
Hamas said it sent a woman because of growing Israeli security " obstacles " facing its male bombers .
" For the first time [ Hamas ] used a female fighter and not a male fighter and that was a new development in resistance against the enemy , " Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said .
" Resistance will escalate against this enemy [ Israel ] until they leave our land and homeland . "
The BBC's Middle East analyst Roger Hardy says it appears the Islamic movement is putting practical considerations ahead of ideological ones - they are hoping women may have a better chance than men of evading Israeli security precautions .
' Tricked soldiers '

She used this opportunity to enter the building , a metre or two past the door , and blow up , " said Israeli Brigadier - General Gadi Shamni , commander of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip .
Witnesses described chaotic scenes as the woman detonated explosives concealed in her vest .
" Glass and black smoke flew everywhere , " an unnamed Palestinian told Reuters .
" Arabs were screaming , Jews were screaming , nobody knew what was going on . "
Disappointment
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Jonathan Peled said the industrial estate where the attack happened was a good example of co-operation between Israelis and Palestinians .
He suggested that the militants were harming their own people by targeting such places which offered employment .
" They are not only attacking Israelis and blowing up human beings , they are also blowing up any kind of chance for peace and reconciliation between both sides , " he told the BBC .
Correspondents say there will be a lot of disappointment among Palestinians over the attack - there is high unemployment in the Gaza Strip and many are extremely glad of the high wages paid at the industrial estate .
Another government spokesman , Avi Pazner , said Israel might tighten measures against Palestinians following the bombing .
Erez is the main crossing point between Israel and the Gaza Strip , which is surrounded by an Israeli fence to stop suicide bombers entering Israel .
The blast is the first suicide attack since 25 December , 2003 , when four Israelis were killed and over 20 injured in a blast near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv .
It came a day after a 29 - year - old Jewish settler was killed by Palestinian militants in a drive - by shooting near the West Bank city of Ramallah .
Logan already wrote this up , but CNN just did a segment on it and I wanted to follow his post up .
The Iraq war comes back to bite us at home .
I doubt this will be the last time our lack of resources well hamper us unfortunately .
We can only hope Mother Nature is a little kinder to us in the future .
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius :
We need trucks .
We are missing humvees .
We 're missing all kinds of equipment that could help us respond to this kind of emergency .

Wolf Blitzer : In Kansas , the death toll from devastating tornado - packed storms is up to 12 today .
Rescue teams are searching the rubble in communities that were largely wiped out .
The Governor of Kansas says recovery efforts are limited because so many National Guard troops and resources are deployed in Iraq .
Our Brian
Todd is joining us now , he has more on what 's going on .
How strained are the National Guard units when these natural disasters strike ?
Brian Todd :
They are stretched thin all over the country , Wolf .
And it 's mostly a shortage of equipment .
In Kansas , Guard officials tell us it does n't so much affect what they can handle , but how fast .
To recover in Greensburg , tons of debris will have to be cleared away .
Some crucial first responders , National Guard units , are being hampered in this effort .
And officials say troop strength is not the problem .
The American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) is exploring the use of satellite imagery to detect and prove human rights abuses .
It ’s difficult to deny the communication potential of these images :
Larger versions of the images are available ( before and after ) .
The images , analyzed by the AAAS staff , show two views of the settlement of Porta Farm , located just west of the Zimbabwean capital of Harare .
The first , an archived image from June 2002 , shows an intact settlement with more than 850 homes and other buildings ; an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 people lived in Porta Farm at the time .
The second photo , taken by satellite on 6 April this year , shows that the settlement has been leveled .
International rights groups allege that the forced relocations in Zimbabwe — which affected over 700,000 people over the course of six weeks in 2005 — are an attempt by the Mugabe government to supress opposition to the current regime .
The AAAS and other organizations hope to use satellite imagery in the future as a tool in addressing the human rights abuses in Darfur , Burma , and other areas .

Supermodel Cindy Crawford has made the astonishing revelation that she has been using a cosmetic surgeon for the past 11 years .
It had always been assumed that Miss Crawford earned her £ 25 million fortune from her natural looks .
However , in a magazine interview out today , the 40 - year - old mother - two spoke of making regular trips for treatments ranging from Botox , to vitamin and collagen injections .
She went on to reveal that she has been getting such extra help with her looks since the age of 29 .
' I 'm not going to lie to myself : past a certain age , creams work on the texture of your skin but , in order to restore elasticity , all I can really count on is vitamin injections , Botox and collagen , ' she tells this week 's Gala magazine .
Crawford in the past has insisted that a ' miracle mixture ' of ground coffee and olive oil kept her skin in its enviable condition .
Yet with refreshing honesty , she admits : ' I have a very simple , healthy life , which works miracles .
I drink a lot of water , watch what I eat and exercise .
' But I owe the quality of my skin to my cosmetic surgeon . '
The revelation is bound to come as something of a surprise to the hundreds of thousands of woman who have bought her beauty products over the years - making her fabulously wealthy .
Some might think that they have been rather cheated that while they were hoping that her beauty could be attributed to the products she promotes , that is not altogether the case .
Miss Crawford afterall has her own skincare range called Meaningful Beauty .
Products includes facial mask , skin softening cleaners , moisturisers and neck rejuvenating creams .
She says of her products : ' I believe Meaningful Beauty is the best skin care available , and soon you will be able to discover the difference yourself .
' Improve the tone and texture of your skin .
Reduce the look of lines and wrinkles .
Reveal skin that is smoother , softer and more radiant .
They 're products that treat your skin in a meaningful way now for more beautiful , younger - looking skin tomorrow . '
RETURNING to the White House after the Memorial Day weekend in 1975 , the young aide Dick Cheney found himself handling a First Amendment showdown .
The New York Times had published an article by Seymour M. Hersh about an espionage program , and the White House chief of staff , Donald H. Rumsfeld , was demanding action .
Out came the yellow legal pad , and in his distinctively neat , deliberate hand , Mr. Cheney laid out the “ problem , ” “ goals ” while addressing it , and “ options . ”
These last included “ Start FBI investigation — with or w/o public announcement .
As targets include NYT , Sy Hersh , potential gov’t sources . ”
Mr. Cheney ’s notes , now in the Gerald R. Ford presidential library , collected and synthesized the views of lawyers , diplomats , spies and military officials , but his own views shine through .
He is hostile to the press and to Congress , insistent on the prerogatives of the executive branch and adamant about the importance of national security secrets .
Fast forward three decades and that same handwriting appears on a copy of the Op - Ed article in The Times that set in motion events that led to the perjury trial of I .
Lewis Libby , Vice President Cheney ’s former chief of staff .

The Spencer Tunick Experience Newcastle / Gateshead Sunday 17 July 2005
Dedicated to Giovanna
This web essay is the personal detailing of my experiences in participating the Newcastle / Gateshead Installation as created by the artist Spencer Tunick .
Newcastle - upon - Tyne , Sunday 17 July 2005 .
Well - here I am again , ready to strip off at the shout from a megaphone .
Not just any oul ' shout - but those immortal words from Jonathan Porcelli - " Ladies & gentlemen - get your kit off " .
Jonathan is Spencer Tunick 's project director .
Newcastle , the home of Stan .
I was pleased to learn back in May 2005 that Spencer Tunick was coming to " the Toon " so travel plans were launched immediately .
Spencer is widely celebrated for his elaborately posed photographs of multiple nude figures in public settings .
Onto the interweb thingy and flight and hotel booked as quick as a flash - two puns intended .
The website from the Baltic Mill gave extremely detailed information on the installation , so this augured well for the professionalism of the organisation and running of the event .
We all received our notification email ( twice ) about 10 days before the fateful date .
Complete with event details and map of the city came distinct directions for getting to the rendezvous location .
The time to attend said " no later than 03:30 " - so being rigorously punctual I figured 02:30 would be a good time to be there .
I followed the Baltic 's directions to the letter - " It is approximately a 15 - minute walk from Newcastle Central Station to the Quayside .
Turn right out of Central Station .
Continue walking straight ahead ( on Neville Street , which becomes Collingwood Street and then becomes Max Mosley Street - you will cross two sets of road conjunctions ) , past St Nicholas ' Cathedral on your right until you reach a major crossroads ( you will see Niche Hotel on the opposite corner of the crossroads ) .
Turn right and walk down Dean Street , heading down the hill towards the River Tyne .
At the bottom of the hill turn left onto the Quayside .
Walk alongside the river ( river will be on your right hand side ) - towards the Gateshead Millennium Bridge , cross it and you will see the registration point - the Mill Road Car Park - in front of you . "
The directions around Dean Street , as it turned out , were practically the route in reverse we would take on the installation - the other difference is that we all would be in the nude next time .
People were leaving the pubs and clubs along the route as I was walking down the warm gentle evening .
The weather had been great over the previous week and was due to be equally as good for the Sunday - which was to be welcomed , especially remembering the Dr Kevorkian inspired conditions we experienced in Brugge in May .
The lads and lasses of Newcastle were in good form after their evening 's entertainment , I wondered if any of them were heading my way .
Walking down cobblelocked The Side and under the bridge , I met about 5 yellow - jacketed security folk with " Event Cover " emblazoned across their back , walking up towards me .
There were also metal screens strategically placed at the junctions and I surmised , correctly as it turned out , that this was going to be a huge and extensive event - given the amount of public space that was been given over to the installation .
I passed by the Premier Travel hotel on the way down , there were still people revelling inside - later on they would get a grandstand view of the goings on .
The screens were sized to keep prying eyes and demur dispositions safely on the side of common decency .
Down under the Tyne Bridge and out onto the Quayside proper , I met even more security folk milling around and taking up defensive positions .
All this forward planning gave me confidence on what was to come .
There was still some residual warmth from the day 's sunshine radiating from the road and pathways , as I strolled over to the water 's edge - the breeze was still warm also .
Guided by the railings along the bank of the Tyne , I approached the Gateshead Millennium Bridge .
It looked magnificent and seemed a well - chosen stage and frame for the vision of Spencer Tunick - a giant anvil on which he could forge his creation .
As I walked over the river crossing , I checked the installation directions again - I was n't sure of the exact location of the rendezvous point - the Mill Road Car Park .
I was expecting , for some reason , a multi-storey purpose built edifice ( do n't ask me why - maybe visions of Barcelona 's Fira predisposed me ) .
But as I stepped off the bridge onto Gateshead , I could see people gathering on an earth bank just opposite me .
There were a couple of groovy pergola's from B &Q set up at the top of the concrete stairs leading up to the middle tier of the open car park - this must be the registration point so forewarned of .
There were about 50 people already gathered in the carpark at this time .
They were mostly men in small groups and singularly .
There was also no sign of any officials from the organisers at this time of the early morning .
There probably were officials there , but I was half asleep anyway .
I sleepwalked up the steps and onto the rough tarmac that formed the car park - I could n't imagine walking barefoot across this , it was so rough !
On the right hand side of the carpark a number of porta - loos had been set up to provide relief to any reveller coming here later on , presumably .
A huge Cristof like black drape blanked off the back wall of the car park - presumably not to get the text of the hoarding in backdrop on to any of the resultant photographs .
A number of security folk were also present , located strategically on good vantage points above and beyond us .
I wandered around , sizing up my fellow models .
I love watching people without being voyeuristic , viewing their demeanour and attitude as they waited pensively for their Spencer Tunick Experience to unfold .
Everybody was calm and either silent or spoke in hushed tones - the trepidation in most was palpable .
Back down the other stairs I strolled back across the road to the Bridge side .
Satisfied , without actually asking anybody was this the correct place , I was able to take stock of the magnificence of the Millennium Bridge itself .
The surrounding promenade and marbled footways of Baltic Square were invitingly constructed .
The brown marble seating tiers around the crescent near the Riverside café reminded me of the Anfiteatro da Praça Gaspar Moreira , in Santa Maria da Feira in September 2003 .
What a wonderful place that was and Spencer took a fantastic set of photos of us there , that Sunday morning too .
I wondered was this location part of the coming day 's proceedings .
Enough musings - back to people watching .
I leaned on the wall along South Shore Road .
People were now strolling from all directions towards this spot in Gateshead .
From the left and right , down from the higher level car park and from across the River Tyne from Newcastle , the faithful came to this spot on earth .
One 's , two 's and larger groups now started to fill up our location .
Taxis arrived and deposited their cargo and sailed off into the black yonder .
Couples hugged and groups of girls clustered together seeking reinforcement of the sanity of what they were about to let themselves in for .
Four girls clung together , obviously long term friends and comrades given the fantastic colourful punk rocker hairstyles they each sported .
The mix of the assemblage was still predominately male at this stage .
Single girls arrived on their own and struck up common bond acquaintances with fellow females .
Single males stayed single .
Mothers and daughters , fathers and sons , lovers - old and young also congregated .
Gateshead Council workmen in their nifty little road sweeper deftly manoeuvred their contraption around the footways and promenades - cleaning this location made me think we would be lying naked here soon !
Cigarette butts , paper and bits of glass were picked up and taken away .
There seemed to be a coherence of activity between the organisers and stakeholders in the project .
At about 03:00 , a number of floppy badged people , mostly young blokes and girls , started to appear on our side of the river .
These were Spencer 's little helpers - our guides and protectors for our morning 's toil .
Some of these helpers stood at the step off from the bridge confirming more strollers of the correctness of their navigation .
Other helpers began to set themselves up at the pergolas - ready to take our model release forms and verify our ID 's and age as directed in our pre event email notification .
Other helpers , the ones with the walkie - talkies , surveyed the site , checking emplacements , completing radio checks , rounding up errant helpers and preparing to launch the day 's occurrences .
The folks on the hill were the first to experience the wrath of a walkie - talkie toting helper .
This was all in good fun - do n't get me wrong .
A certain level of professionalism is mandated in order to ensure the success of this installation .
The gathered multitude were as ushered to the lower South Shore roadway and requested to queue now at the base of the stairs - it was all starting to kick off for real now .
It was still dark , dawn was about two hours away .
The majority of the crowd started to gather at the base of the right hand stairs .
On the helpers then boomed across the PA that half of us should commence queuing at the left hand stairway .
I joined this queue just behind a glass bus shelter .
We stood there and waited , the queue did n't seem be moving much .
More people were still arriving .
The local constabulary now started to make their presence known - Battenberg Volvos cruised up and down , a transit van fully loaded arrived and sprinkled constables hither and dither .
The line of people was still and silent , nobody was talking - people were deep in contemplation of a once in a life times experience yet to come .
As I queued , a taxi pulled up alongside me and a girl on her own got out and joined the queue two behind me .
How brave she seemed to me .
Her actions , in appearing here this morning alone , seemed very brave and adventurous if with a little trepidation - I admired her for that - this is the spirit of the Spencer Tunick Experience .
More anon .
Our queue started to move now .
It was orderly and polite , people met up with acquaintances and sidled in with them .
Other people finding themselves out of queue where allowed in .
It was a slow move at first .
Border control was rigorously examining the Model Release forms and photocopied forms of identification .
They seemed to be overwhelmed by yet glad to greet the amount of people which had arrived here this morning .
We moved but very slowly .
There was a bottleneck at the bottom of the stairs as the queue approached from two directions .
A security girl told us to get into single file .
A BBC film crew trying to get to the top of the stairs could n't wait for the queue so they legged it up the earth bank .
It was a precarious move , I was waiting for the cameraman to stumble and drop his expensive gear such was his awkward gait - but he made it , phew !
Slowly , we moved up the stairs , there must have been added resources added at the frontier post or else a change in policy , as suddenly the queue of hundreds of would - be models started moving in a more quickened pace .
Everybody on official duty there was very extremely helpful , professional and pleasant - we were made feel very welcome and a huge part of the event .
At the top in the pergola , there were two tables - the girls at the right hand side took our release forms and ID photocopies and at the other table we were issued with a groovy plastic bag - some red , some blue , some purple .
I received a bright yellow one for my use .
A girl cheerfully scribbled a number on each - handy for individual retrieval .
The bags were to be used at the appointed time to deposit our clothes along with our modesty , presumably .
Both could be picked up safely after the event and once donned we could return to normal urbanity .
We also received a pamphlet , which detailed the posing arrangements we would be required to undertake for the first set up on the Quayside .
Service with a smile .
Now at the top of the hill , in the carpark area , we shuffled around omni-directionally trying to find a spot to rest before the upcoming events .
What follows is the usual pre-event gathering .
Friends meet up , mere acquaintances deftly evade each other in case they should see each other naked later on , groups gathered , couples huddle and singletons try to make contact .
The carpark filled up quickly now - and there were still people streaming across the bridge and directed up the stairs .
Yellow jackets pinpointed the scene .
The mix of the crowd also changed .
More girls joined us males to even up the gender mix and the age average also lowered .
Some people were soberly dressed , others lightly dressed ( and ready for a lightning strip ) as per instructions - either way we were all getting cold .
It was still dark and the residual heat of the day had long since departed .
As we waited , the PA boomed into life .
A slow deep voice welcomed us to here this morning .
In an unhurried purposeful tone , he told us to wait up until all the people coming had arrived and more instructions would follow anon .
He went on , though , to apologise for the problems with the time lapse in the PA and explained that in real time he does n't actually speak this slowly - that 's a relief .
Everyone laughed at this .
This was Steve , who was to be our master of ceremonies for the day .
This was going to be another long wait .
I had a watch on but the last thing I did was look at it , so I can't give you the exact timings of the unfolding proceedings .
Some of us used the plastic bags to sit down on the grass verge and wait , other sat or that should be perched on the car parks triangular fence , the majority stood around talking .
At about 03:30 Jonathan , Spencer 's project director , then got atop his A - framed ladder / lectern and told us to gather down his end .
Everybody in unison shuffled to his end to listen to him .
He welcomed us again and gave us a heads - up on the programme for today .
He told us Spencer would now also speak to us .
Up now atop the ladder , Spencer welcomed us again here this morning .
He apologised for seeming a bit sleepy but it was an ungodly hour after all - tell us about it !
He went through the poses that he wanted , some as per the printed sheet .
Spencer also told us of the route we would be taking , walking down the quayside and up a side street .
When we were to cross the swing bridge across the Tyne , due to Health & Safety concerns , we were going to be issued with protective shoes and covering - oh , could n't wait , should that not be Health & Efficiency concerns !
He finally delivered those immortal words - we would only be naked for a short time - yeah right !
Genuinely though , he said we were all part of a beautiful experience and without us , his art could simply not happen .
We would have to wait for the light to get better , as he does n't use flash - I suppose we would be supplying the flashing .
He went then after a few more minutes and to prepare himself at his vantage point for the photographs .
After the great man had spoken , we knew this was for real we were about to begin our own personal Spencer Tunick Experience .
After this bit of excitement , people drifted back to their erstwhile location .
People chatted , some quietly others more flamboyantly , one girl in shocking blue hair was heard all over the carpark , laughing and joking .
All in good fun though .
I sat down again on the grass verge and waited along with a few others .
It was cold now but not too uncomfortable .
Two girls sat down beside me .
They were obviously very nervous at what they had signed up for .
Moneypenny , we 'll call her , kept saying " are we mad , what are we doing here " and just giggled away her fears .
Although people had been told not to undress until told to do so , one girl and about four blokes in a group got naked and just stood around talking as nonchalantly as ever - nude but nonchalant .
They seemed to be full of revelry and were enjoying themselves immensely .
A stag party in fancy dress that were near them also in the carpark , With clothes on , read lurid superhero outfits , they were overexcited and strident and looking like they would be a bit of a poser for the organisers .
But as soon as we were all naked later on they became invisible .
I read later that a hen party joined them in the festivities .
These and others around make for a memorable recollection of these morning events .
I was shivering at this stage with a silver breeze blowing up from the Tyne and somewhere between land - of nod and compos mentis .
A couple of swarthy blokes paraded around topless , exhibiting to all their mighty structure .
Others shuffled off coats and prepared .
I just took off my watch - was n't using it anyway - it was too cold and premature to do anything else .
I knew there was going to be a mad scramble to get naked once we heard the call .
I looked around trying to find a landmark for reference for when I needed to retrieve my apparel at the closing of the installation .
A suitable telecom pole sufficed - thanks BT .
The sky had now turned a brighter blue from its midnight black , and you could begin to sense the ever - increasing level of excitement and anticipation .
The atmosphere could only be described as buzzing .
The car park was now full and spread out with people again .
We waited .
The naked group decided to put some clothes back on again - more in a climactic deference than a societal one .
A long black evening dress and blue flip - flops for the goose pimpled girl and more complicated dressings for the boys completed their succumbment .
The anticipation all around rose steadily .
The time was fast approaching .
A man just wearing a tee - shirt and nothing else , sauntered past Moneypenny .
He sported a plethora of piercings and rings , dangling from his dangly bits .
This freaked her out and just added to her anxiety .
Suddenly from nowhere , he must have beamed on to the top of the ladder , Jonathan boomed across the PA - " Get you kit off " .
No clarification required .
Like a bang from a starter 's pistol , people leapt to their feet and started to disrobe - read , rip their clothes off frantically .
I just about got up to my feet and half of the assembled were already naked .
I struggled with a shoe lace - is n't always the way , in a hurry you can't undo them yet at a formal gathering you can't keep the bloody things knotted !
So I just followed everybody else and ripped off my clothes and stuffed them unceremoniously into my yellow plastic bag .
Moneypenny at this stage was down to her bra and knickers and still giggling nervously , still wondering what she was thinking of agreeing to this .
Her mate had no such trepidation and was really keen .
She was long since naked and ready to proudly take her place in the throng of all the other nude people - no going back now !
Naked myself now , I stood off the grass margin onto the carpark surface .
It was tricky underfoot , to say the least .
Nonetheless , let 's enjoy ourselves .
We all funnelled again towards the stairs - this time in reverse of the way we came upwards and clothed - downwards and naked .
The crowd bunched up now .
We could see that hundreds of naked people had already made their way onto the Millennium Bridge .
Rather than be left behind the carpark overflowed in a Vesuvian like eruption of buff magma ( sorry again Craig ! ) over the sides and down onto the lower level .
I scrambled down the sandy clay bank myself , managing to stay on my feet , but destroying the newly seeded lawn .
From the bottom of the hill , it was a wonderful sight to see all these naked people overflowing and descending towards me - I do n't think Pompeii ever experienced such a hedonistic display ( okay , enough simile ) .
I did n't see anyone looking uncomfortable in his or her new found nudity .
Traversing South Shore Road and down the steps , across the marble promenade we strutted ourselves ten / eleven abreast across the Gateshead Millennium Bridge .
Policemen , council workers and Spencer 's little helpers lined the route - enjoying also this naked parade .
But nobody was embarrassed .
Steve was there too guiding us with his megaphone and cheering us on .
It was a wonderful sight - looking forward and backward .
I do n't think this was exactly what the bridge 's designers , Wilkinson & Eyre Architects had envisioned in their imagination .
At least , with all these people trampling across in resonance there was no wobbling ( from the bridge , I mean ! ) .
I was on the seaward , eastern side of the bridge , right at the waters edge .
There was a sign up for " dual usage " on this side - presumably for clothed and unclothed people .
This side was also decked so as to be comfortable underfoot unlike the other side , which was tarmaced , and rough to the sole .
A couple of blokes started singing " Is this the way to Amarillo " and gestured to the moves of that particular song .
We walked slowly as we bunched up - yet at a polite distance to our neighbours .
I had time to look into the still waters below and saw the reflection of all the naked people above on the parapet .
As we neared the far side of the bridge , most of the crowd had turned left towards the City / Tyne Bridge direction and up along the Quayside .
We were directed though to turn right off the bridge up towards and past the " Pitcher & Piano " pub .
We stood off the bridge onto the quayside proper .
We strutted our stuff up past the hotel opposite the bridge - with Co-operative Society written large on it's top floor .
There we people at the bedroom windows stared out , incredulous at the vista .
People downstairs in the lounge were pressed up against the windows - amazed at the antics .
Camera phones were out snapping merrily away .
We continued walking until we were told to stop , just short of , what looked like a small bandstand with a great big gold ball on the roof .
Although the council workmen had swept the pathways , broken glass littered a spot were people were heading for .
Masterfully , even if I say so myself , I guided the exposed soles away from the danger - knew that training in Hendon would come in handy one day !
We turned around and faced the Tyne Bridge direction .
We were ordered via a voice from the sky to move forward , then back .
Then forward then backward .
Three abreast we stood as per printed instructions .
As we stood and waited , I noticed a naked girl walk back alone across the Millennium Bridge towards the South Shore side .
Do n't know what was going on here , but there was blood on the ground when later we passed the bridge end - it was if somebody had badly cut their foot .
Either way it was a long walk back to the other side for her .
In the opposite direction , from South Shore the last of Spencer 's little helper walked ( fully clothed ) across the bridge and strolled through the naked throng on this side .
One wag in front shouted " streaker " .
People laughed - such was an example of the humour that would permeate the morning .
The PA boomed out to keep quiet , stand still , hands by our side and face the bridge .
We all stood to attention .
A feeble Mexican wave flowed backwards from the front as we were waiting .
We were so far back from Spencer 's position , that he would have needed a Hubble telescope lens to pick us out .
And he kept telling us not to smile .
We would n't be making the pages of any media reports on this one .
Needless to say , we followed orders .
Good humour and obedience to instructions was the order of the day .
We stood still whilst Spencer did the clicking and the whirring .
The morning was now bright and beautiful giving an orange glow on our skins .
A faint breeze whispered on our backs .
We waited silently and time passed by .
That pose over , we were directed once again via PA to take up the Second Pose of set - up Number 1 - the lying on your back with hand at your side one .
So , down gingerly to the ground we went , careful not in touch or invade other people 's space , we lay down on the cobble - lock pathway on the quayside .
We lay motionless as the PA boomed .
Spencer 's little helpers ran up and down the line filling gaps , moving bodies and generally arranging the naked muses .
Spencer could be heard barking at them - they moved very fast under his direction .
The silence again abounded .
We lay there still and quiet , staring into the now empty blue sky .
A couple of birds flew past over us - to gasps from very exposed members of the audience .
Too horrible an occurrence even to contemplate .
We closed our eyes and hoped for the best until the Stukas passed by .
Spencer clicked away again , presumably .
This gave us time to think .
So what exactly were we doing lying naked on a public thoroughfare on a Sunday Morning .
People have their own reasons and motives .
Certainly , it is an individual thing .
People as individuals take away more from a Spencer Tunick Installation than they bargained for .
The fun at the start is stripping off publicly and walking naked around the place with hundreds of other kindred souls .
The rewards come later though in reliving the experience and discovering oneself .
I wish I knew what Moneypenny thought of the day 's events , but never saw her again .
People can express their experiences in many ways .
" Right Folks " and that were that .
Already , we were well into this Experience .
Up to our feet , some more deftly than others .
We dusted our selves down , picked stones from our backs and faced the bridge .
Off we shuffled still three abreast towards the bridge directions .
Steve was there too looking after us .
We walked past the hotel and lounge again .
People were still gawking out at us .
There was a naked guy at one of the bedroom windows - a sort of Spencer Tunick Experience by distance learning .
The BBC had set up near the base of the hotel and cameras abounded , recording our every move .
Down then the quayside , past the Crown Court and opposite some offices we stopped temporarily .
Two over indulged guys could n't wait anymore - nature called .
Bladders full , they headed down a small alley and concealed themselves behind two green wheelie bins in order to relieve themselves .
Another poor bloke , despite the howls and cajoling from the naked mass observing them , decided this was a good idea too .
Bad call .
The BBC cameras had spotted them and were homing in like a heat seeking missile ( do n't need to elaborate where the heat was coming from ) .
By the time the camera crew was ready , the first two blokes were finished and beat a path out of there .
The last bloke then suffered the indignity of being filmed and walking full frontal back into the safety of the crowd .
He just laughed along with us and enjoyed the relief .
On bloke wanted to shake his hand but decided the better of it .
The cheers of amusement from the crowd was light hearted and signified the general good nature of the whole day .
And to cap it all , just 100 metres down the road , the organisers , with their professionalism and consideration that marked the day , had sited a bank of conveniences for our use .
On the move again , naked we continued our morning stroll around the streets of Newcastle and Gateshead .
We were ushered across the road , past the Premier Travel Inn .
More patrons rudely awakened .
People from the bedrooms and lounge windows watched unbelievingly as we sauntered by .
I do n't think they could quite believe their eyes when they saw us - all different ages , sizes and shapes , completely naked - en el buffo !
Camera phones were out , more text messages were flying over the airwaves - " 100 's nud plpe wlk pst my b/rom "
The reply came back " U may stop drinkin now " !
A young couple canoodling passionately in a doorway squirmed in embarrassment - they had clothes on !
" oh get a room " someone advised them - " There 's a time and place for everything " , someone else tutted .
Up then this newly pedestrianised street towards The Side , past an old elevator shaft up to the road deck of the Tyne Bridge .
I was about 3 / 4 of the way back down the human chain at this stage .
We walked and stumbled up under the bridge itself now .
Hundreds and hundreds of our people had located themselves up The Side ( motion to council to rename Backside ) and cascading up the hill around the corner to Blackgate and out of sight .
It was fantastic viewing all these naked people completely taking over a street in this fashion ( or absence of fashion ) .
It contrasted the solidity of the buildings with the softness of our naked bodies .
Nobody felt vulnerable as we joined in with the pack .
We walked on the cobblelock roadway , still under construction in some places .
The flood of people stopped and ebbed backwards and forwards like the tide , until all the ripples had sorted themselves out and we found an equilibrium of personal space .
I stopped outside the Kublai Khan restaurant and looked all around me .
There were a couple of people in flats above the shops and cafés , looking out their windows incredulously .
We waved at them .
They were too embarrassed to way back at us - so in order to alleviate them of their mortification - we waved even more vociferously .
That did the trick - we got a reply - that 'll teach them .
Spencer was now on high - very high - on the Tyne Bridge towering over us .
He was on the megaphone booming instructions down from above to the little helpers below .
Up The Side we were ushered - then down - then up .
Bunch up , spread out , fill that gap - you get the idea now .
You have to be very compliant at a Spencer Tunick Installation - you do exactly what you are told !
But there was great humour at all times .
Whilst shuffling up & down
The Side some wag shouted out to ST " Have you never heard of Photoshop , you only needed a 100 of us "
A BBC film crew snuggled themselves into a restaurant doorway along The Side in order to film our shuffling antics - like pink penguins on an ice flow .
Spencer shouted down at them to get in out of the shot - they made themselves invisible .
We were nearly all set for the first photograph - ready when you are Mr Tunick !
Spencer said later in an article " I needed 1,500 people to make this installation work and so I am happy .
I had to fill up Dean Street and I needed enough to make a thin sliver of bodies .
I got everything I needed and more . "
As Spencer readied himself up aloft , we stood , arms by our sides and faced up to him .
We stood there waiting for a few moments .
A couple of times I thought I heard what sounded like a flock of crickets coming down the hill from Blackgate - it turned out to be a sort of Mexican slap - people slapping their thighs in unison .
Another time we heard " oohs " and " aahs " emanating from the periphery of the naked sea - then suddenly a cool breeze washed down the hill over our exposed flesh - " ooh " I gasped .
That masterpiece of a river of bodies now safely in the can we were invited to adopt the most famous and desirable of all of Spencer Tunick 's poses - the foetal position .
" Turn to your right - down on your knees " we were ordered .
Some turned as directed to their right , the others followed step later on - after working out which right to opt for .
I was down the street a bit now after more shuffling for position outside the " Treacle Moon " restaurant - very apt for this pose .
Everyone groaned as at first we got down on our knees and bent forward .
It is a difficult position to get into , especially when you are cold and not exactly limbered up for this contortion .
I nearly got cramp in my feet , as did others I spoke to later - but held on in there .
But we groaned and creaked , but just got on with it .
When Spencer tells you to keep your head down , you keep your head down .
Head down now , knees curdled up into our chest , palms on the cobblelock - we held this pose .
A few wags passed funny comments about the biggest cycle park in the world .
" ooh " - another breeze .
Time elapsed as our image passed into medium format .
The invisible BBC camera crew filmed away .
Spencer also said later in a BBC interview was that he wanted his work to show the contrast between man 's huge modern constructions in the cities of the world with the vulnerability of the human body in its basic naked form .
Asked whether the urban landscape in the city had influenced his work , he said : " I do n't think the landscape brings information to the bodies .
Bodies bring new information to the landscape . "
" There is a sensual element to it , " Spencer said .
" But it 's not a sexual experience . "
This would be one of the best photographs taken today - each individual looks as though they are a dot of paint on a canvas by a great impressionist artist .
And then that was over .
Up to our feet we jumped - eventually - rising on command to waves of applause .
Glad that was over - but still enjoying every moment of this day .
We were ordered by Steve on his megaphone to head back down Sandhill to the quayside via a different street .
Still naked remember , we strolled past Rumpoli's Italian Kitchen - where 's Cyril Fletcher from " That 's Life " when you need him ?
At the end of this street a barrier had been erected to delineate the closed off area where we had been allowed to pose on this side of the Tyne .
At a gap in the barrier plastic ponchos or " kagoules " I heard described , were being doled out to all and nudie - like the things you get on riverboat cruises near the sprays of waterfalls .
This was the Health & Safety issue that was alluded to earlier on in the proceedings in the car park assembly point .
Seemingly we were now leaving the cordoned off area and proceeding onto the public thoroughfare , certainly in full view of this perched high up on the Tyne Bridge ..
It seem more a deference to decency than Health & Safety and certainly gave fashion a shun .
It was funny looking at people struggle to find the difference between the armhole and the head hole of these contraptions and twist themselves eventually over their clammy skin .
I was handed one and like a true gentleman handed it to a naked woman that just happened to be standing beside me .
Reaching a huge pile of kagoules , people were throwing them still in their chunky packets to the rest of the waiting naked crowd in order to speed up their ascension into decency .
Not wanting to be the last naked person everyone seemed to cover themselves in a common haste .
Finding the part where your head goes , I struggled into mine .
As a fashion item it did absolutely nothing for anyone .
A gentle breeze magnified the propensity of the semi- transparent kagoule to billow up and expose what little decency we had left .
A little further on outside the Guildhall there were numerous cardboard boxes with flip - flops in them .
There were two types - Union Jack ones for the ladies and sultry black ones for the gents .
Finding a box with 11 ( bragger ! ) written large I used my well - honed seafaring skills to decipher the rather convoluted strap arrangements .
Now fully attired we headed up a narrow set of stone steps at the public convenience and onto the roadway that led to the Swing Bridge over the Tyne .
As we walked along the red bridge I looked back down on to the quayside at the Guildhall at the mass of white clad erstwhile nude folk streaming towards me - it was like a scene from a SOCO 's convention , all clinically dressed .
Either that or a scene from a mass escape from a surgical ward - gowns billowing , bums exposed .
In the briskness of the morning the see - through kagoules and flip - flops were in reality very welcome as we crossed the river back to Gateshead .
On the way we passed Buffalo 's Joe 's eatery - namesake of Spencer 's August 2004 installation .
Passing by the Hilton Hotel , I now understood why we needed to " cover up " .
In deference to the patrons of this fine establishment we passed very close to it .
And although the kagoules covered our modesty , they left nothing to the imagination .
We all walked silently and pensively - reflecting on what had gone before us and what was to still come .
A good number of people were again up at the windows and balconies looking amazingly at panorama .
Patrons and staff were out gawking , some taking photographs - we waved as usual in order to cover their embarrassment .
Over the river
Tyne now , back proper into Gateshead we turned left down Bridge Street and under the Tyne Bridge once again .
Under the bridge another barrier had been erected to fence of again the area that was closed to the public but open to the pubic .
We hastily stripped off our kagoules and flip - flops and threw our figleaves in a pile on the left - hand side of the roadway .
Spencer 's little helpers were there to greet us and keep out unwanted guests .
A bottleneck as usual appeared at the gateway to nudie land .
Two of the helpers decided to remove two sections of the barrier to ease the flow .
They struggled a bit with the heavier than expected sheets .
Naked , I assisted them in carrying it to an out of the way location - no need for Health & Safety gear here .
The crowd funnelled faster through the enlarged gap .
Once again we were naked and had a bit of work to do .
We streamed down this roadway past HMS Calliope towards the tiered levels of the Sage 's lower boundary .
As we crossed over the road a woman beside me stubbed her toe on a speed ramp in the middle of the road - her language was colourful , would have make a docker blush , but she carried on like a trooper .
From this side of the river
Tyne we looked back over to the opposite side of the quayside - where we had just come from .
The photographs of those poses must be brilliant .
There were a good number of people in the open space in front of the Sage high above us .
Here to cameras were out too - some professional some less so .
BBC cameras were everywhere .
People on the ground commented how this was being allowed to happen .
This made some participants over - sensitive yet brought out the exhibitionist in others .
Naked folk waved as usual to frighten the terminally embarrassed .
I saw one bloke go out of his way to wave at the cameras , his girl friend in tow was more bashful and did n't thank him for the national exposure .
Spencer was in the middle of the roadway up his perch ready to greet and utilise us .
Whilst we all were swarming naked pass ST on his steps just before the another wag enquired " Can I have your autograph ? "
( Vision of Spencer doing so on his bum sprung to mind - there would n't have been room any place else ) .
A yellow jacketed girl at the base of the ladder , protecting him , seemed flustered at all the naked people , especially naked men passing by her .
People picked up on this immediately and kept asking her silly questions - trying to elicit a confused reply - her replies were always with eyes averted skywards .
Good fun though !
( unless you were that girl ) .
A girl was being reprimanded for still possessing her Union Jack flip - flops presumably as a souvenir - when it was taken off here someone suggested " Follow the shoe " - one of the many examples of pythonesque humour that abounded the day .
Just beneath the Sage we were ordered to stop .
There were still hundred of white clad people crossing the Swing Bridge , as they got around the corner they stripped off and comfortable walked naked down the road towards us .
To me they seemed very self - assured being naked at this stage of the events - it ’s as if they were wearing their bodies proudly .
We waited for all and sundry to collect themselves at the rendezvous .
A couple of blokes chose this moment to head up the bank , for a desperate wee .
To howls of cajoling and jeering , they hid sheepishly behind a couple of bushes .
" We can see you " howled some girls .
Others recounted the scene from " Cool Hand Luke " - " still shaken here , boss " ( the bush I mean ) .
It never amazes me at the resilience of the naked body to overcome such misery in the pursuance of the relief garnered by these poor chaps .
In the middle of the roadway we stood and faced back at Spencer .
He took this opportunity , being as close as he had been all day , to speak to us .
Again he thanked us for being here , helping create his art and being so amenable to his directions .
The girl with the blue hair and another with bright red hair were dispatched unceremoniously to the rear of the assemblage .
Spencer is generally quite strict , but has to be so .
For every set - up , he is very end product aware of not having anybody with any tattoos , tan lines or distinguishing features , so that everyone is anonymous and not distinctive .
However , he now wanted a special favour from us all , one that would give him an amazing opportunity to capture an inspired photograph .
He implored us to accede to his request - what 's this we wondered - there was n't much more we could do - we were naked after all .
" Thank you all so much !
Okay , you guys do n't have to do this if you do n't want to , but I 'm going to ask you a big favour .
I want you guys to climb up to the side of the Sage .
You do n't have to do it if you do n't want to ! "
Oh , is that all .
I do n't think Spencer had permission to utilise the terraces in this manner - he seemed a bit sheepish in requesting it .
But we had no such reticence - so went for it !
Confucius say - easier to seek forgiveness than ask permission !
I have never seen such a mad stampede - everyone made a frenzied scurry for the tiers .
It was like a race to see who could get to the highest tier .
People of all ages , proficiency and gender put aside their modesty and abilities to reach for the stars .
It was like the Tall Ships ' sailors scrambling to the high masts to trim the sails - only more spectacular and without the cloth bit .
" A vast behind ! " some old sea dog exclaimed .
Legs and arms flayed , people pulled themselves up the banks , others pulled lowly folk up to their level .
People on the ground level pushed people up - no problems finding grab handles .
The cheering and shouting was gleeful in its merriment .
Like school kids at the sight of a puddle , everyone had nearly disappeared from the roadway up to the terraces .
Being naked in public is audacious , but climbing up an earthen mound covered in shrubs , chicken wire and construction re-bar whilst naked requires slightly more than just audacity - visualise all the unbecoming contortions you have to put yourself through to reach the zenith !
But art comes first and restraint second , so there was simply nothing to it but to shin up the hill as elegantly as possible .
Being a member of the Flat Earth Society , I stayed on terra firma - a sort of compost mental .
I looked up at an amazing sight of all these naked bodies lining the terraces at the Sage .
It too must have looked fabulous from across the Tyne .
A sort of Herbaceous Plentiflorus cross-pollinated with Genitalia Danglia - ask for that in your local garden centre ?
At first we were looking out towards the Tyne .
Spencer was on the megaphone getting his helpers to fill gaps , pulling people , shifting people and slotting people in here and there until he was satisfied .
" Do n't smile " he barked .
He then directed us to turn left and face him .
As is normal with his photographs he tries to capture the anonymity of the nude in the public landscape .
So for this aim , he directed that we turn only our heads to the right and look towards the Baltic Mill .
This we did in our usual silence when we are working .
Necks creaked as Spencer took the photos .
We gazed again out onto the Quayside on the opposite side of the Tyne .
People were milling about there , looking over at us .
Spencer finished that one and on the megaphone directed us to turn around and face in towards the Sage - more anonymous nudes - only bare backsides showing this time .
Except for the onlookers on the top in the Sage proper , who caught the full frontal view - more cameras snapped away .
We held this pose silently - looking up at our colleagues - everyone all very beautiful .
After a few minutes it was over - we got the megaphone chant to depart from this scene and assemble further on down .
Some people climbed down from the terraces on to the roadway - which seemed even harder than climbing up it , others walked along their chosen terrace to reach the end and some climbed even higher to walk along the top to our destination .
I stood on the far side of the road and watched in awe at the wonderful sight of all these beautiful people move effortlessly and gracefully about .
Naked people streamed down the bank towards me - self - confidant and assured , feeling more empowered about what they were capable of bodily and spiritually .
They had now profited from the Spencer Tunick Experience and you could see the metamorphosis .
As we now approached our original rendezvous car park all those hours ago this morning - the sun shone a magnificent beam of warm orange light down on us - belatedly as if to illuminate our stage - we all gave a cheer .
Everyone breathed this glorious moment in to our memories of our wonderful day .
We approached the car park again and stepped off the even roadway on to the rough car park surface .
We were instructed to go up to the very top level of the car park .
As usual there was a choke point at the stair well .
People were streaming down from the Sage terraces towards the top car park .
I took my place in the orderly queue waiting to rise to the top dais .
A number of people had decided to call it a day at this stage and were heading towards the last resting - place of their apparel .
It certainly had been a long day , but there was a lot to come and a lot still to get out of this experience for many .
As we reached and ascended the stairs there was some relief to step off the rough car park surface and onto the relatively smooth metal steps of the stairs itself .
People climbed slowly and as we turned back around to take the next flight , it gave us an opportunity to take in the multitude of naked folk still heading our way .
Down below I could see my comrades in arms ( bare arms that is ) filing up towards me .
Smiley happy faces crowded together as they slowly bunched .
I recognised a few faces from today 's events - old and young , yet all still energised .
High above us on the reverse side of the Sage parapet there was about twenty / thirty people gathered to view this naked migration .
( note to Ed : left out reference to herd of wildebeest rushing down to the river 's edge ) .
Some had cameras , others were dressed in the yellow jackets of the security people - so I guess they were legitimate in the gathering .
As we approached the top of the ladder , more dressed people , about twenty or so , were collected at the car park proper .
Of these , there were three members of the local constabulary having a great time .
Some said " Allo , Allo . Allo " and they passed by - but the coppers did n't get the funny side - too busy looking at backsides .
Again we were greeted by Steve on his megaphone and urged to proceed into the middle of the carpark .
Spencer had a ladder set up and surrounded at his feet , his little helpers and a BBC film crew had also grouped .
They were filming our every move - but we were used to it at this stage .
I sidled in from the front row so as not to be full frontal on national TV - I 'm not that brave !
I squirmed my way into the crowd , finding a safe spot , I got " tutted " from behind by some smaller guy - yes , I 'm the big bloke that always seems to stand in front of you at a gathering - sorry , can't help it !
We stood waiting for Spencer to arrive .
Steve kept us amused though .
It was a bit colder up on high here .
People shivered and quivered .
Couple hugged each other for warmth .
I just huddled alone - Billy no mates .
Four girls shivering in the cold - huddled together in line astern to share their body heat .
The two in the middle got the best deal - central heating !
A male friend offered to take up the end of the line , but his gentlemanly offer was graciously declined .
Only girls can huddle together and embrace - it is n't exactly a manly thing .
I looked at all the different tattoos people sported .
One bloke had bear paw prints walking up and down his arms and shoulders another had climbing ivy wrapping around his lower calves .
The girl beside me had a balancing scales tattoo - I was about to ask her if she was a Libra as I am one as well - but then demurred as it would have meant admitting that I was looking at her derrière where the tattoo was located .
Us Libran 's are taciturn if nothing else .
Up in the high car park , I had to consciously stop my knees from bopping up and down in the gentle yet cold wind .
People were going up and down the line photographing us as we stood there .
The Constables took it all in - every last detail , such was their intense gaze - is that a truncheon in your pocket or are you just glad to be here ?
- enquired one chap near me .
Along with the other clothed folk the naval gazing continued - some people expressed their disquiet at this .
When Spencer did arrived he climbed the ladder to loud greetings and applause as we faced him .
Spencer uses a medium format camera steadied with a unipod .
He usually has two cameras , as there are only 6 or 8 shots per roll of film .
A little helper supplies him with a change of camera .
Spencer prefers film , a manual camera and a simple fixed lens - this can provide clarity and tonal quality for the full size images and enlarge to impressive sizes as displayed at his exhibitions .
Art is in the mind 's eye of the artist , not in his equipment
The BBC was filming all this setting up and getting ready .
In later reports and photos in the media , I could make myself out in the crowd from these shots - coooeee , Mr Tunick !
Behind us his little helpers had laid out a navy blue rope in a V shape , fanning out towards a block of apartments at the end of the carpark .
Spencer told us to line up within the boundaries of this rope and await further instructions .
This we did .
Shuffling over the coarse tarmac we took up our positions .
Shuffling turned to frantic milling as we were ordered to move back , move forward , fill the gap - you know the story at this stage .
I ended up standing beside taxi girl from this morning - looking very radiant and hypnotised in the sunlight .
Spencer still on his ladder had him cameras ready for more creating .
Spencer took some photos of us standing and looking at him .
He ordered us to close our eyes and then open them rapidly , close them and open them .
This went on for a few more blinks and then a few more open wides .
The guy beside me thought Spencer was trying to hypnotise us .
In his best Matt Lucas " Little Britain " voice said - " You will not order the lobster , you will have something from the set menu for £ 2.95 , wide awake now , your back with us ... "
A few more photos followed .
Spencer was using the megaphone to control the arranging of the bodies - directing his helpers , picking out people .
Some guy with very bad sunburn was dispatched to the back and as usual now the ubiquitous Blue haired girl ( see can you spot her ? ) along with some prominent tan liners were also picked out and banished from the front .
Everyone nearly in position now - and after some more quivering shivering ( and bopping ) we were told that real pain was about to descend on us .
We were directed to lie down on the bed of nails , sorry tarmac , on our sides with our heads on our neighbour 's hips .
No thanks !
It was a difficult position to get into .
We lowered ourselves gingerly on to the jagged surface .
It was tight up there .
We waited for people in front and behind to lie down before each of us could comfortably lay down betwixt and between .
I noticed how everyone 's soles were absolutely black with all the road debris , along with a few bloody toes .
One guy with big feet even had POTS written in the bitumen from were he stood too long at a road junction .
I moved up to let taxi girl lie down and then snuggled my head in between the feet of the bloke above me - at least it kept my ears warm .
We lay there for a few moments on our backs - do n't recall if a photo was taken but we were soon ordered onto our sides .
" Cor Blimey " - or words to that effect , was the general expletive - it was torture .
Every little stone and pebble on the ground grew a diamond tipped drill bit and furrowed itself into our flesh and bones .
We squirmed onto our hips and sought a little relief from the pain - there was none .
We took up our positions dutifully though , as is our gratification for being part of Spencer 's art .
And then more waiting began .
We new this was the end for today and all wanted to make the most of it and enjoy every last moment - for then it was over .
Spencer had taken his last photograph of this momentous day .
" Thanks Folks " boomed the megaphone - and we sprung to our feet - putting as much distance as we could between our skin and the tarmac .
We looked like human bubble rap .
Black things oozed from our flesh and red tattoo emblazoned our skin .
We picked out the black things and waited for our temporary tattoo to disappear .
Over the megaphone , Spencer boomed at us .
He was arranging to have another installation this evening and wanted 500 models - 250 male & 250 female .
He said it would be a " live " installation and would also be broadcast live on the BBC .
He implored us to consider it seriously and to sign up at the tents below us in the lower car park .
I 'll have a bit of that methinks - having travelled all this way from Craggy Island , two installations in one trip is more than a bonus - gift horse , cake , jam , buttered both sides , eating it , carpe diem !
Spencer thanked us sincerely for this day and said that he would meet up with us in the café below and chat to us .
People clapped and cheered .
Spencer as he made his way down the ladder and hove out of sight .
We struggled again over the upper car park towards the stairs .
Naked we were for the last time now - some of us anyway .
Dressed people formed a line of honour ( more naval gazing ) at the stair entrance as we lined up to rejoin civilisation .
We were all silent and ruminative - the magnanimity of the day 's achievements finally dawning on us when we realised that we would now have to dress and cover once again our nudity .
Slowly we shuffled towards the stairs - engulfing a parked car .
Below we could see people scampering around - some naked , some dressed - all searching for friends and plastic bags .
There was a pergola set up at the end of the carpark to take registrations for this evening 's installation .
With only 250 men allowed , I thought I would n't make it .
We passed by the dressed people and descended into normality .
The BBC still filmed away .
I looked back up the stairs at the line of beautiful people streaming behind me .
Down onto the lower car park and walked naked through a throng of dressed and civilised citizens - but no one looked at me .
People milled around dressing and exchanging stories with their companions .
Friends searched for missing loved ones .
I found my yellow plastic bag with my initials writ large still in its original location opposite the telephone pole - cool !
Moneypenny was no where to be seen .
The four punk girls were there on scene as happy as ever and we all dressed together .
Struggling with my shoelaces once again , I gathered up my memories and headed for the pergola .
The queue split naturally into male and female - blue invites for the boys and pink for the girls .
I saw taxi girl walk away from the registration point clutching her pink invite contentedly .
Some blokes entered the queue ahead of me , joining up with their mates .
You could see heads bopping nervously - like in the five items or less lane at the supermarket checkout , counting the items in the basket in front of you ( is a six - pack one or six items ? )
Would I make the magic 250 or would those queue jumpers gazzump me ?
Selfridges all over again .
The bloke standing beside me , spoke to me - the only person all day to do so .
We struck up a conversation there and then .
He too had a great day and could n't miss such an opportunity to go for it again .
Made it to the girl on the registration desk and she asked me my name - made it !
I was handed a blue invite numbered 245 - Phew !
We were also adorned with a white surgical wristband and told not to take it off .
The bloke in front of me asked the girl was it water proof , as he wanted to have a shower .
She looked at me sheepishly for guidance and a pertinent reply - what could I say ?
You bath away son - it ’s the least of your troubles !
Happy now and clutching our invites , Carl and I headed for the Riverside café at the base of the Baltic Mill .
Steve was at the steps of the promenade .
We said hi and thanks to him for the genuinely good time and attention that he gave to all of us today , ( note to Spencer - pay rise for Steve ) .
We did n't have an installation in this location at the small marbled amphitheatre after all - in the end there would have been too many people , maybe this evening ?
There was about forty / fifty people already there so we joined the queue .
Other people joined in our conversation , a bloke and a girl from Wales recounted their total enjoyment of the day .
We chatted of our own day 's recollections and anecdotes as the line snaked its way around to the tea urn .
Steve , sans megaphone , came into the café still looking for volunteers for the evening 's BBC3 installation .
Anybody would do , such was the desperation in his manner .
We showed him our own invites , much to his disappointment - no point in cajoling us - bummer !
He moved around the line , trying to press the King 's shilling .
Most of the die - hards had signed up any way and the few he converted did n't seem too reliable for another installation .
We eventually reached the hub of the oasis and with our drinks , we went outside and sat down .
We talked with other people sitting around on the café 's patio furniture .
Steve was still doing the rounds .
I heard some Dutch and French voices from people sitting around at the tables .
People recounted their worst and best times during all the moving and shaking .
The seagulls and the foetal position came out the worst .
Everything was good for me though .
Carl recounted how earlier on at the start of the installation he saw a woman from his work at the disrobing point .
He said he beat a hasty retreat as he was too embarrassed if she had have seen him naked .
I said she would have probably been more self conscious that he had seen her naked .
I think it would make for a great place in work if a number of one 's colleagues took part in an installation .
We dragged out what little was left of this momentous day 's experiences here on the Gateshead side of the Tyne - but it was time to go - for now !
Carl and I walked over the Millennium Bridge and back into Newcastle .
We walked down the Quayside , around by the Premier Travel Hotel and up past Kublai Khan .
We picked out all the places and situations we had each found ourselves in as we strolled past each landmark .
Up Dean Street now , all the nudie barriers had by now been removed - normal people could return to the Quayside .
Time for a cup of tea , we thought in unison .
But do you think we could find a place open ?
Shirley , there must be a place open in Newcastle at 11:30 on a Sunday morning for tea or coffee !
No - it was n't 11:30 it was only about 08:30 ( take the watch out of your pocket Al , and who 's Shirley ? )
This had been one very , very long day and our minds were still experiencing the absolute highs of the great time we had during the installation - time and civilisation had been abandoned .
Carl gave me a guided tour of Newcastle , all the hotspots and landmarks including St James ' and Gray 's Monument .
As we walked around we spotted a good number of people who must have been at the installation .
We did n't actually recognise their faces or what they were wearing ( how could we ? ) - but they were all clutching their colourful plastic bags from the installation .
We nodded politely in their direction - acknowledging our preceding naked proclivity - a sort of covert society in an overt world .
We eventually found our way back down to the Central Station - Shirley , they would be open at this hour .
There was - phew !
We sat down and had a coffee , saluting more colourful bag wielding individuals milling around the station - presumably catching trains back home to wherever .
So that was that , for this historic morning of Sunday 17 July 2005 .
Back to my hotel then and borrowed an industrial strength degreaser to try to get all the bitumen etc. from the soles of my feet .
Even though I had been up since 02:00 that morning , I was n't tired or at least could n't sleep - such was the high I was still experiencing .
The reminiscing and recollections of the day ran continuously in my mind 's big screen .
I went out for a walk and found myself following the path of the installation once again .
Down the Side and over the Swing Bridge was busy with people at the Sunday market on the Quayside .
I found a discarded kagoule in one of the cardboard boxes beside the Guildhall .
I furtively stuffed it into my bag - might put it up for sale on ebay !
But down past the Sage once more was eerily tranquil - the soles of the faithful had departed .
I took some photographs at all the places we had walked and lain - I would be able fill in the gaps from my memories of this great experience .
Over the Millennium Bridge and glanced past the Pitcher & Piano bar on my right hand side , I took the Quayside route once again up and around the Premier Travel hotel .
The Quayside at this time on a Sunday morning was thronging with shoppers at the market stalls - completely oblivious at the unabashed barefaced cheeks that had previously inhabited their place of commerce - so much for consumerism !
A brass band stood on a corner , pumping out their stuff - they played Ray Steven 's " The Streak " with great gusto ( only kidding )
Soon it was time for another chance at making magic .
At about 5 o'clock in the evening , it was time for me to head down to the Quayside to the rendezvous point at the Pitcher & Piano bar , as per our second invite .
So , I knew the route this time from my hotel without the aid of my map - could tell you every bloody cobble stone on The Side .
Past the Travel hotel and under the Tyne Bridge , I walked on to the Quayside for another adventure .
Strolling parallel to me I met up with taxi girl .
We spoke as we headed towards the bar .
She was still on her own , her boyfriend chose not to partake but wished her his best regards for her adventure - coward !
Her mother would be watching the television to see could she spot her this evening on BBC3's - Naked City - the ongoing documentary on Spencer Tunick 's installation in Newcastle / Gateshead .
Like the rest of us , she had an inspired time this morning and did n't hesitate to sign up again for this evening 's escapade .
We waited outside the Pitcher & Piano bar - we were early and eager .
The groovy pergola from this morning had re-appeared Tardis like now on this side of the Tyne .
Reception tables were set out to collect once again our model release forms and verify our ID's .
The BBC had set up their Outside Broadcast circus near the bar and lighting rigs and TV paraphernalia were strategically located in order to capture and beam out tonight 's episode .
A small outside studio had been set up on the roof terrace of the bar , complete with no less than three TV cameras and along with the boom camera and roving cameramen , every little detail and naked identity should be captured this evening for the nation 's enjoyment .
Carl duly arrived - read bounded down the road with great alacrity .
So the three amigos were now assembled and ready for action - once the formalities of the nomenclatures were revealed - Carl , Kirsty & Alan .
People began arriving over the course of the next while all wearing the white surgical wristbands from this morning .
The population this time was a big older than this morning and tended more to the male side of the species .
I 'm no good at counting crowds , but we heard later that about 250 turned up for this evening 's soiree - out of the 500 S.T. had in mind to fill the Millennium Bridge .
Steve once again was buzzing around - cheering people up as he flittered around .
We waited - the sun shone .
It had been quite a warm and sunny day .
A few people 's faces , including my own , were showing the effects of the sun 's rays from the intervening day - and remember tan lines go to the back , presumably beetroot faces too .
18:00 hours had now arrived .
We shuffled into line astern and queued up to the registration pergola .
We were given new model release forms directly from the BBC and ordered to fill them out , once ID and age was checked we had our white wristbands snipped off .
One girl asked to keep hers as she managed to obtain Spencer 's autograph on hers this morning .
I was glad to see the back of mine - I was going around Newcastle all day like an escapee from some institution for the bewildered ( might have a point ! ) .
Duly authorised and characterised now as a nude model , we went inside the Pitcher & Piano bar .
The bar itself is a long narrow building with glass on three sides overlooking the Quayside .
The bar itself is half the length of the building .
Nothing else to do now but wait - might as well have a drink !
The others ordered pints of lager , I stuck with the mineral water - bad move filling your bladder at a Spencer Tunick Installation , as per this morning 's episodes .
We found some comfy sofa 's left over from the Spanish Inquisition up at the back of the building and sat down - to wait .
More nodding acquaintances from this morning gathered around us and the bar soon filled up .
It was still a beautiful evening outside and we sat and chatted .
Carl candidly shared with us how he relinquished his commando style equipe from this morning to a more comfortable and safer ( his description ) full cotton jacket - Kirsty said thanks for the insight , but was slightly too much on the visual !
A little later on then the show started to kick off .
Spencer with the ubiquitous Steve and Sigismond in tow , began to give us a rundown of what was in store for us this evening .
He ordered the two boy up onto a couple of chairs and proceeded to utilise them like giant Action Men .
As the installation was going out live on TV , Spencer only had a window of about 10 - 15 minutes in which to operate and complete his live installation .
We were to walk out onto the bridge in pairs and face away from him and wave our arms in the air like the motion of the waves .
He then got the boys to demonstrate - we fell about the place laughing at their antics .
If these two could n't wave their arms in unison - how could you expect 250 naked fools to do so ?
Spencer ordered Steve to " go down on Siggi " - Steve scanned swiftly through his contract to check for any clauses precluding such debauchery - but he just picked Spencer up wrong , phew ( this was the BBC after all , not Channel 4 ) .
Spencer wanted us to lie down on the bridge - heads to feet of our partners .
More lying - now were we going to be on the rough side or smooth side of the bridge 's walkway ?
( probably be the rough side ) .
A little later we would go outside for a practice ( clothed ) trial run .
So with that little bit of excitement over , time for another drink .
The anticipation and expectancy levels were beginning to rise , especially around mi compadres .
Some verbalised their nerves explicitly others kept entirely silent yet we understood what we were all going through .
As time passed the moods of excitement and trepidation intermixed .
Camera and researcher activity was going on all around us .
Participants were being interviewed and others , couples and singles , were being lined up for interview .
Each content to verbalise their experience and attitudes to their whole encounter with Spencer Tunick .
Spencer was giving a TV interview from inside the Pitcher & Piano .
Speaking as he prepared to co-ordinate the final installation , he said : " Those who took part have really achieved something .
It is a life - affirming experience and something to celebrate " .
Spencer also commented " My heart goes out to the people who participated and braved the early morning and the cold weather today - but they stayed until the end when the sun came up and warmed the streets .
I hope they feel like they 've accomplished something this morning because I want them , and everyone , to know that I made some wonderful work here in Newcastle / Gateshead and I 'm very excited to share the results with the public . "
So more drinks , and more waiting .
About this time we were issued again with plastic bags for our soon to be discarded apparel and temporary loss of modesty .
I got a red one this time ( cautioned by Diane and Craig not to mention Sunderland FC whilst in the Toon , so no funny remarks here ) .
John , one our now group of eight , brought his own marker pen and we all shared it as we embossed our own particular moniker on them .
Some people wrote just their initials others appended nicknames , others their alter ego .
At about 8 o'clock Turboman and the rest of us heard the call then for us to assemble outside for the trail run or dress rehearsal .
Off we went , abandoning our drinks and mustered outside in a huge posse .
Spencer appeared on the balcony to address us .
He went through all what he expected of us and the tight timeline he had in order to complete the live installation .
For this installation , we had to undress and walk in double file out on to the Millennium Bridge and stick with our partners .
There we would complete two poses .
One facing away from him and waving our arms in the air to mimic the waves and the other to lie down ( knew that one was coming ) feet to head of our partner .
We were also advised that due to the vagaries of live television we may be asked to wait on when the second and last shot was completed - for take two and with better editing , the repeat programme .
Spencer said that during this hiatus we could sit down and talk to the other people around us .
This caused some merriment at the shear though of sitting around naked on national TV making small talk to one 's nude neighbour - what would you talk about ?
( " What 's a girl like you doing in a nice place like this ? " )
Plastic bags in hand we listened attentively and on the order from above , we about faced and lined up double file outside the bar and along the quayside .
I lost my companions at this stage .
Carl said later that I just seemed to bolt for position and he just could n't keep up with me .
Kirsty disappeared deep into the melee also .
I teamed up with some bloke that I had n't met before .
Again we were warned to stay in position , spread out arms length once on the bridge and more importantly , listen .
What did he say ? - I asked my companion .
When the rest of the crew had assembled satisfactorily , we marched off in formation .
Sprightly but surely then we filed two by two out onto the floodlit Millennium Bridge ( with the sound of the Elephant march from Jungle Book playing in my head ! ) .
I was about three - quarters at the back of the queue at this stage .
Past the guardian of the bridge , Steve , we walked on the rough side of the walkway - Kirsty got her wish here , she did n't want the smooth decked side as she did n't fancy peering down into the running water below .
We stopped when the point of the snake reached the Gateshead end of the bridge .
Security people , police and onlookers were accumulating on the high banks of the car park and Sage yonder .
Inhabitants of the blocks of apartments also lined themselves up on their balconies to view the spectacle - garden patio sets ( must have been won on Bullseye ? ) and loungers were laid out and with the drinks flowing above us , the carnival atmosphere was in full flow .
Obeying orders we lined up in twos and spread out our arms front and side to give the requisite clearance to our fellow travellers .
Some people deftly garnered their space , others poked and shoved their companions into position .
We were ordered to move back , then forward , then back - you know the rest .
At some stage , somebody was content .
We were then asked to turn around and face back towards the Newcastle side , where Spencer was located atop the Co - Op hotel .
Now there was a space in front of me .
So fearing the bark , I filled it and so left the space behind me - not my problem anymore .
My erstwhile partner , the nice bloke , was then left with the dilemma .
It took Spencer about 1.77 nanoseconds to spot the gap .
Siggi and Steve were dispatched immediately with another errant model in tow , screaming their innocence , to slot in neatly behind me .
Phew !
Problem solved , but nice bloke never spoke to me again , such was the trauma of Spencer yelling at him over the PA !
( Sorry ! - Confucius say - he who flights and runs away , lives to run away another day )
Patiently we faced Spencer and waited .
I was now about one quarter up the front , as we had reversed out our position on the turn around .
The lights and cameras were beaming into our faces .
My new partner turned out to be none other than Black Marker John .
I spotted Kirsty two rows up from me .
We then practised the second pose for this set - up .
Lying on our back , head in between our partners feet .
We all lay down as directed .
It was very relaxing lying there in the evening sun , I could have stayed there for hours .
Steve went along the line checking everybody .
Finished the trial lay we sprang to our feet and waited for further instructions .
We were then told to remember our exact position on the bridge for when the clapperboard sounded action for real we would n't have time for all this shuffling to and fro .
John accurately counted the cable stays of the bridge in order that he would be able to return to the exact spot .
I took my reference from John 's position - figuring if he's in the correct position , I must be too - big gamble here , AL .
A few more moments dwindled by and we looked out up and down the Tyne and the Bridge to pass the time .
Soon we got the order to fallout and we moved off in unison back to the Pitcher & Piano .
Steve was as usual at the base of the bridge to meet and greet us .
Once back inside , mi compadres rendezvoused at the bar for more drinks .
People took this final opportunity to go to the toilet , in order to save themselves discomfort during the real shoot .
The bar was packed with revellers .
The bar staff themselves were under a lot of pressure as 250 people rushed in and ordered drinks .
But they took it very professionally and amicably .
I would recommend you visit the Pitcher & Piano bar if you 're ever in Newcastle .
Drinks in tow , we all sat down once again up the back on the comfy settee .
We knew the time was fast approaching that once again we would have to disrobe and face the nation .
The nattering ebbed and flowed .
We talked together of the set up on the bridge .
Someone suggested that would n't it be great if they raised the road deck and had us all hang naked from the parapets - no more drinks for you , was the universal response to that lurid suggestion .
Kirsty 's announcement that she was doing a PhD in Structured Virology ( wah ! ) certainly called a halt to one topic of conversation - brainy as well as beautiful .
Carl got more anxious as the minutes ticked by and puffed away on even more cigarettes .
John was too relaxed .
I said how relaxing the lying down pose was and how I struggled to stay awake .
Come the actual pose I might just fall off asleep for real and begged them not to leave me out there for the roadsweepers in the morning - they said they would n't , but I did n't trust them .
Other people gathered around our small group , chatting between themselves with the odd deference coming our way .
Kirsty had collected a new partner from the trial run and he was sitting on the couch beside her , sticking like glue .
People were in general in great spirits and enjoying themselves immensely .
I said that the rehearsal was a great idea but could n't imagine everyone finding their respective positions again in the snake under the pressure of the live event .
I forecasted that everything would go pear shaped .
I was labelled a pessimist - Confucius say , definition of a Pessimist is a well - informed Optimist .
We would see .
At about 9:20 , we all heard the call we were expecting and dreading .
Ok folks everyone outside .
We said our respective adieus and best wishes and proceeded out side .
People lined up some in order , some haphazardly .
Some on the quayside , others on the bar side .
At the back of the bar a temporary high fence had been erected to keep prying eyes and sensitive folk away .
Earlier on two different groups of orthodox religious teenagers had been enjoying themselves on the quayside and at the bandstand .
They would have been astonished , to say the least , of the sight that would have greeted them .
Two Policemen and one Policewoman were guarding us somewhat bashfully .
The two Policemen dived behind the barrier leaving the poor WPC to fend for herself with all these soon to be naked members of the public .
I found John in the line up on the quayside , so knew then I would be in the correct location no matter what was to ensue ( okay Spencer ? ) .
People were much more jittery at this stage of proceedings - nervously anticipating a great occasion .
Cameramen and researchers were milling around .
The big boom camera was whizzing through the air and up and down , capturing us for broadcast .
People were watching the outgoing broadcast on its top monitor and the live feed on the lower one - or what 's known as the bottom monitor ( terrible pun ) .
I do n't think people were aware of the enormity of this enterprise - self - assurance from this morning 's experience had replaced apprehension .
Couples hugged and friends gathered in - groups as per usual .
In general people wore more everyday / mainstream clothing for tonight 's event rather than the loose attire that previously this morning was all the rage .
Carl even announced earlier that he was n't going commando this evening - much to Kirsty 's delight .
I saw a bloke about 25 years old sporting a rather old fashioned dressing gown , but looking very prepared for his metamorphosis into nudity .
He was speaking with a couple of male friends and all were having a great time .
He looked rather dapper , resplendent in his chosen drape .
I read in subsequent newspaper reports of a similar occurrence of a dapper gent in dressing gown complete with pipe and slippers at this morning 's installation kick - off in the car park .
Wonder was it the same bloke - or is this clothing option for future Spencer Tunick Installations - might be ?
On the opposite side of the snake to me I heard a BBC researcher going up and down the line looking for " Paddy 's partner " .
Out of sight , Paddy O'Connell , presenter from BBC2's " Working Lunch " appeared and took his place in the snake .
He must have been doing a nixer on BBC3 .
Paddy 's Partner was soon found and inserted into the vacant slot beside him .
Paddy was wearing a beige pair of trousers and nothing on top .
Radio gear had been strapped onto a flesh - coloured pouch to his back and one of those Rice Krispies microphones was stuck to the side of his face .
He must be going to give a running commentary of the next half an hour or so 's proceedings .
I do n't know whether he intended to take off these trousers or was just using them as camouflage in lieu of complete nakedness - was too busy at the time with my own situation .
Either way , I though to myself , why him ?
Why could we not have had Gillian Lacey - Solymar also from " Working Lunch " instead of him ?
Just our luck !
" Get your kit off " boomed the PA .
Suddenly we were off again - or at least the clothes were off .
Shirts , shoes , skirts trousers , bras and underwear were being ripped from our skins .
It was much more a mad frenzy than this morning relatively leisurely disrobement .
The best way to describe this evening 's undressing would be as more of a fracas .
The snake started to move off even before some people had completed their transformation .
The chap in front of John was still bending down undoing his shoes as people backed up behind him .
Some beckoned genteelly to " shift your bloomin ' ass " - such was the haste in people 's attitudes to this evening 's tight schedule and resultant emphasis on strict time keeping and pace .
I just overtook him and ran to try to catch up with the end of the now naked centipede disappearing into the distance .
Walking naked to traverse this break , I felt exposed and vulnerable in the glare of the cameras - for the first time today .
I soon caught up those in front and slotted into the throng .
As we slowed down at the gated entrance to the Millennium Bridge , all the people I left behind had now collected themselves in line astern me - presumably having dealt with the slow undresser .
Steve was as usual at the bridge entrance greeting and encouraging us .
As we turned the bend off the quayside , a BBC mobile cameraman had sited himself low down as the naked swarm glided past - he must have got some great shots of surprised faces .
People wobbled as they hove into him and evaded his aim , left and right .
Others folded their arms across their chest or placed a hand strategically in front of below - all you have to do in these situations is cover your face , that 's all you can be recognised from !
Onto then the rough bitumen surface to the walkway of the bridge .
John appeared beside me , but no sign of Kirsty and Carl .
We picked up new neighbours for our naked evening stroll across the Tyne .
The air was still warm even as we reached the mid point of the bridge over the now black river below - much warmer than this morning .
In fact it was decidedly balmy and it was pleasant to be naked .
I looked back along the quayside and saw the wonderful sight of all these naked people strolling along the cobblelock and heading my way .
The gantry lights were blaring down on us , illuminating our breathtaking circumstance .
We moved over the mid point towards the Gateshead end of the bridge .
I was about one quarter ways from the front now but still in my correct position beside John .
His reckoning though had let him down despite his counting of the cable stays we were miles from our original position .
Arms outstretched and ranged , we shuffled to find the requisite spacing - one metre from the balustrade and one metre apart .
The girl behind me poked me in the shoulder for good measure - must have been only 0.99 m apart .
We waited .
The sound of another herd of crickets resounded across the Tyne .
I declined the opportunity for self - flagellation once again - life 's too short to beat your self up !
People were gathered in the distance on the car park and Sage 's earthen banks , civilians mingled with yellow clad security and police folk .
You could see the tiny flashes in the distance from cameras privately recording this wonderful event .
Spencer on the PA summoned us to turn around and face the music .
Thus we did in union - synchronised posing .
Silently we waited and then were ordered to turn around again - did that too !
Now in the appropriate position on the dais we were instructed to commence our wave motioning with our arms aloft - to and fro .
I watched the people in front wave their outstretched arms mimicking breakers and rollers .
I looked down at the river Tyne below us .
It was absolutely still , not even a ripple - it looked exactly like a gigantic black mirror .
Spencer must have got an impressive shot of our image in the parallel reflection .
I took a more leisurely pace of arm waving than some of my fellow models - I was trying to recreate the tender lapping of an ebb tide kissing a pebble strand ( actually my little arms were tired ) .
John on the other hand must have graduated from the Dustin Hoffman School of Method Acting - he was giving it large with a massive onslaught eroding the White Cliffs .
I assume Carl and Kirsty were waving majestically also .
But in truth is was a brilliant sight of all these naked people waving their arms in unison on the bridge .
Then we got the order to lay down in our second mandated pose .
Lowering ourselves gingerly once again , we found our spots - me with my feet against the rails and head between John 's feet .
The bitumen was warm and not too hard this time - maybe our backs were like leather after this morning 's trials and just did n't notice anymore .
Careful now not to fall asleep , I pondered on the magnificence our endeavours and Spencer 's imagination .
It too was a superlative sight to see us all lying naked stretched out in parallel over the black river below and the indigo sky above .
All calm now we waited and pondered .
A warm breeze from the east caressed my feet .
Cameras were rolling and Spencer was capturing our image from his artist 's visionary eye .
The BBC was broadcasting all of this to the nation at this time - VCR 's were whirring in many homes .
Time passed and I managed to stay awake during this period both of contemplation and deliberation .
" Right Folks " boomed the PA - it was " over " ( nod , nod , wink , wink , say - no - more ! ) .
We sprung like gazelles ( on sedatives ) to our blackened feet .
We clapped and cheered and congratulated ourselves for a job well done .
We also picked the tiny stones from our skin .
And then waited again .
The orders from above came for us to hang around for a few moments and chat amongst ourselves .
I spoke to the naked lady that earlier had poked me in the shoulder - she was kinder to me this time .
She said what a wonderful time she was experiencing and how surreal it all was .
Could n't agree more .
Some people sat on the bitumen surface others made use of the seating provided along the walkway .
We lazed around naked for a while , curled up and alone and most of not all probably musing over our exposed artistic state .
Apart from the odd whispered conversations , everybody was hushed and introspective - all quite visceral .
After a while we got the order again to reoccupy our positions and recommence imitating the waves .
Spencer , I presume in the meantime , had completed his BBC interviewing duties and with cameras fully loaded once again , was going to capture for real his vision on the bridge .
Once our ruminations were discarded , we recommenced our erstwhile gesticulations .
So arms raised once more , we were off .
I was trying to recreate the tender lapping … ( yeah , yeah , yeah ! )
John was gesturing demonstratively and everyone else was doing their own thing .
Spencer as usual did not use a flash , relying normally on natural light or in this case the artificial light off the specially erected gantry lights - they radiated an eerie white light over the scene .
In these conditions Spencer would have been using a long exposure to capture the image on film .
Our arm waving would therefore be somewhat blurred and contrasted against the sharp image of our bodies and the bridge .
This image would capture the effect of the arms ' movements .
As we waved , the people on the balconies and the earth banks continued to gaze in awe at our nakedness .
Small flashlights blinked like stars from deep within the darkness - I wondered would they be picked up in Spencer 's long exposures ?
We waved until we were told to slow down - phew !
Then we were told to wave our arms faster and faster .
People were trying the utmost to wave faster than their neighbour - an arms race of sorts !
I just held on as the tempest of limbs heaved to and fro .
Slow down , we were ordered - flashes flickered , we slowed down to a light breeze .
All together this took about a half an hour but again it was great fun to do .
It must have been a truly awesome sight , us all on the bridge , naked and waving in the floodlight night .
Maybe we 'll see the results some day .
And then it was over - and this time over for real .
We got the " Thanks Folks " recall command and we stopped what we were doing .
Everything had gone according to plan - just like I said it would !
We had completed the " Spencer Tunick Nude Workout " video .
Time to return to normality .
Turning around for one last time , we trundled off and waved goodbye to the inhabitants of Gateshead .
We mingled as we walked , daring to break out of our regimented double file .
We headed back over the Millennium Bridge towards the Newcastle side of the Tyne , just has we had done all those hours ago this morning , and still naked .
We took in the enormity of the life changing events that we had been fortunate to have participated in .
One could nearly sense the disappointment of the experience now being over .
People were much quieter than they had ever been throughout the whole day .
Reaching the end of the Bridge , Steve was there as usual to greet us .
He was sweating a lot from the energy he must have expended organising and tendering to Spencer 's orders - relief for him was palpable .
So stepping onto the quayside , we began the closing ceremony of this momentous day - the final dressing .
Finding our bags was the last step in dispelling with the legitimacy of our nudity .
As we dressed some people took photos of their partners - some posed playfully others more seriously .
But now being naked amongst mostly clothed people made these same people feel vulnerable and somewhat bashful .
Dressed now , we all looked different , naked we were comrades .
We gathered our thoughts and memories into the plastic bags and began the long trek back into society .
I met up with Kirsty and we went into the Pitcher & Piano to pick up the rest of the posse .
She was on her mobile texting home to see did her folks and boyfriend see her naked on national TV - they had been watching the BBC3 programme live .
She seemed disappointed that did n't see her .
As before with the trial run and previous comings and goings , there is a rush of 250 people up to the bar .
Quite a number of people had decided the best thing to do here was head for the bar first and then dress .
It was amazing to see naked people standing around nonchalantly supping their pints as clothed people intermingled with them - it was like a mini Saatchi .
But we were now back in a decent social order , so we behaved more refined and cultured as is society 's norm - i.e. we elbowed our way up to the bar , pushing small / weak people to the ground without remorse as we forged a path to the alcohol .
As we stood around drinking , there was two blokes standing nude at the window in the bar talking to and drinking with another two dressed blokes .
With everybody else in the bar completely disregarding this as nothing out of the ordinary - a photo of this sight would be as if Harvey Drouillard had gatecrashed Spencer 's party .
We found the rest of our missing crew after a bit of shouting across a crowded room and sat once more and for one last time up at the back on the comfy sofa .
John was n't staying but I shook his hand , bid him good luck and thanked him sincerely for sharing his experience with me today in Newcastle .
Spencer was now going around the bar speaking to people .
He seemed more relaxed and took time in holding conversations with us .
The rest of us just sat around and reminisced .
Mobile number , emails and home addresses were exchanged as we recounted each other 's experiences today - hoping maybe to vicariously enhance our own individual recollections .
Kirsty told us later how she scaled to the heights at the Sage with no care for lady like decorum , Carl only went up two or three levels .
Each said it was more " dangerous " coming down though - you can guess the rest !
There were some great stories going around - and all genuinely remarkable for the memories they elicited and the bond of friendship and unity they forge .
Everyone was talking about the BBC3 " Naked City " documentary , wondering if they could be seen on it - waiting for the reactions tomorrow in work from colleagues who had picked them out .
Peter , one of our now enlarged group , found himself right at the front of the snake on the bridge when we turned around and took the full barrage of the cameras - full frontal that is .
He was sure he was in for a rough ride tomorrow .
We can't receive BBC3 where I live , but Kirsty promised to send me a video copy of the programme - thanks Kirsty .
But then it was really over - the physical bit anyway .
We packed up about 11 o'clock and moved off through the Pitcher & Piano - it had been reopened to outsiders .
Slowly as we departed we said our farewells to the smiley happy faces that we had the great fortune to have been acquainted with and encountered in all this time .
Out onto the Quayside again for one last time , we strolled past the bridge still illuminated by the BBC 's gantry lights .
I asked could I take a photo of mon amis standing at the " Gate ad Millennium Bridge " ( that 's what it says on it ! ) .
Carl asked did I want them naked - I said no , let 's do something daring and have our photo taken at the bridge but this time with clothes on .
It must have been the mineral water talking !
So down the Quayside on this warm evening , we passed the Premier Travel Inn and found ourselves once more in The Side .
Carl and I said our goodbyes to Kirsty and Peter and the flew off in a taxi .
We walked back up Dean St and towards the Central Station and my hotel and Carl 's omnibus .
I did n't sleep a wink that night - between the mental DVD of the day 's events projecting around the inside my eyelids , the GNR 's thundering up and down the iron horse and the blisters on my feet .
But it was all worth it .
I sit here on Monday 01 August 2005 finally getting to the end of my account .
What more can I say ?
Spencer Tunick 's decision to select the city as the backdrop for this historic art installation strengthens Newcastle / Gateshead 's growing reputation as a culturally vibrant destination .
A place where world - class arts and cultural events are encouraged , supported and celebrated - The Barcelona of the North
The images from this installation will be seen by millions of people across the UK and the world , once again showcasing Newcastle / Gateshead 's spectacular and iconic landscapes on an international stage .
So the results are in - Douze Points Mr Tunick , Newcastle and Gateshead .
I have formed new special friendships with so many other wonderful people who enjoyed the same experience of creating art with Spencer Tunick .
That is why the Newcastle installation was a very extraordinary and affirmative experience .
There is nothing really more fundamental about a Spencer Tunick Installation than actually being there , naked and being a participant in his incredible creative process .
Those who participate are immortalised .
Getting naked in public is not in everybody 's nature but I assure you , it may well empower and vitalise you for life to participate in such an artistic phenomenon .
Thanks to everyone …
Alan

Rice University scientists today revealed a breakthrough method for producing molecular specks of semiconductors called quantum dots , a discovery that could clear the way for better , cheaper solar energy panels .
The research , by scientists at Rice 's Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology ( CBEN ) , appears this week in the journal Small .
It describes a new chemical method for making four - legged cadmium selenide quantum dots , which previous research has shown to be particularly effective at converting sunlight into electrical energy .
" Our work knocks down a big barrier in developing quantum - dot - based photovoltaics as an alternative to the conventional , more expensive silicon - based solar cells , " said paper co-author and principal investigator Michael Wong , assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering .
Quantum dots are " megamolecules " of semiconducting materials that are smaller than living cells .
They interact with light in unique ways , to give off different - colored light or to create electrons and holes , due partly to their tiny size , partly to their shape and partly to the material they 're made of .
Scientists have studied quantum dots for more than a decade , with an eye toward using them in medical tests , chemical sensors and other devices .
One way towards cheaper solar cells is to make them out of quantum dots .
Prior research by others has shown that four - legged quantum dots , which are called tetrapods , are many times more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity than regular quantum dots .
But ,
Wong said the problem is that there is still no good way of producing tetrapods .
Current methods lead to a lot of particles with uneven - length arms , crooked arms , and even missing arms .
Even in the best recipe , 30 percent of the prepared particles are not tetrapods , he said .
CBEN 's formula , which was developed by Wong and his graduate student Subashini Asokan with CBEN Director Vicki Colvin and graduate student Karl Krueger , produces same - sized particles , in which more than 90 percent are tetrapods .
Significantly , these tetrapods are made of cadmium selenide , which have been very difficult to make , until now .
The essence of the new recipe is to use cetyltrimethylammonium bromide instead of the standard alkylphosphonic acid compounds .
Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide happens to be safer -- it 's used in some shampoos , for example -- and it's much cheaper than alkylphosphonic acids .
For producers looking to eventually ramp up tetrapod production , this means cheaper raw materials and less purification steps , Wong said .
" One of the major bottlenecks in developing tetrapod - based solar cell devices has been removed , namely the unavailability of high - quality tetrapods of the cadmium selenide kind , " Wong said .
" We might be able to make high - quality nanoshapes of other compositions also , using this new synthesis chemistry . "
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation , 3M Corp. , Advanced Aromatics LP , the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Rice University .

Professor Hawking , who suffers from motor neurone disease , was able to float free , unrestricted by his paralysed muscles and his wheelchair .
The two - hour flight over the Atlantic took a series of dramatic dives , allowing the professor to experience 25 - second spurts of weightlessness .
The event could be a step closer to Hawking 's goal of going into space .
Space , here I come !
Prof Stephen Hawking
The modified Boeing 727 jet simulated the experience of weightlessness as it took a series of eight plunges .
" It was amazing , " Prof Hawking said after the flight .
" The zero - G part was wonderful and the higher - G part was no problem .
I could have gone on and on .
Space , here I come ! " he said .
Initially , the organisers had planned to go through between one and three zero gravity sessions .
In the end eight were completed , and Prof Hawking experienced weightlessness for about four minutes .
US firm Zero Gravity normally charges a fee of $ 3,750 ( £ 1,915 ) for its passengers , but that fee was waived for the Cambridge physicist .
He was not given many years to live when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in the 1960s , aged 22 .
Long - held ambition
The plane took off from the space shuttle 's runway at Nasa 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
The planes used for parabolic flights are commonly referred to as " vomit comets " .
During the flight , Professor Hawking 's aides lifted him out of his chair and placed him gently on the floor of the plane during the sharply angled climb into the sky , in preparation for the first plunge .
The jet 's interior was padded to protect the weightless fliers and equipped with cameras to record their adventure .
" We had a wonderful time .
It was incredible , far beyond our expectations , " said Peter Diamandis , chairman and CEO of Zero Gravity Corporation .
" The doctors felt he was in tremendous condition .
His heart rate , blood pressure , oxygen levels were all normal and perfect , " Mr Diamandis said .
Prof Hawking , 65 , is one of the best - known theoretical physicists of his generation .
Some of his groundbreaking work focuses on black holes and on the origins of the Universe .
He has at least one other motive for taking the weightless flight : he believes private space ventures are vital to reduce the cost of space tourism and make it accessible to a greater number of people .
" I think the human race does n't have a future if it does n't go into space , " Professor Hawking earlier told the BBC News website .
He has a reservation for a sub-orbital flight with Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic venture , scheduled to begin service in 2009 .
In November last year , he told the BBC : " My next goal is to go into space ; maybe Richard Branson will help me . "
Virgin Galactic will own and operate at least five spaceships and two mother ships , and will charge £ 100,000 ( $ 190,000 ) to carry passengers to an altitude of about 140 km on sub-orbital space flights .
Requirements
Maybe it was that southern drawl .
Or maybe it was because I got mad .
I 'm not sure why I still remember this moment so clearly , but I do .
It happened when I was at Spyglass , over ten years ago .
Several of us developers were in a meeting with Steve Stone , then recently - hired as director of the Champaign office .
We were talking about a possible new feature .
Steve , in his Alabama accent , asked ,
" So is that a requirement ? "
A couple years later , I realized that I misunderstood the question .
I did n't have enough project management background to know the particular way that he was using the word " requirement " .
For me at the time , the word " requirement " had connotations of absolute necessity .
So when Steve asked the question , here is what I heard :
" So is this feature something that absolutely must be in the next release of the product ? "
On top of that , I 'll confess I was sort of generally crabby at that point in my life , especially with respect to Steve Stone .
Instead of promoting me or one of the other lead developers to run the Champaign office , Spyglass had hired Steve from the outside .
In fact , Spyglass asked me to interview Steve , but only after the interview did they tell me I had actually been interviewing my new boss .
Anyway , I was in a generally foul mood when I misunderstood this question .
I suppose that 's why I answered Steve by saying something like this :
" How the @ % $ * should I know if this feature has to be in the product or not ?
You 're new here , so let me explain how things go .
Management moved the headquarters to Chicago after years of promising that they never would .
Here in Champaign , nobody tells us anything .
We 've got no marketing people except the team who spent 3 months deciding which Pantone color is the right shade of red for our company logo , which nobody ever sees because our product is an OEM component .
The only way we ever know that a feature absolutely must be in the product is when one of our Sales Guys calls up and tells us that he already promised it . "
Steve was a very patient man .
I assume anybody who lived in Alabama would have to be . :-)
He just smiled as he listened to my rant ( footnote 1 ) .
But my career with Spyglass did n't last too much longer after that .
A few months later , in a moment when I was ready to throw another tantrum , I decided to just quit instead .
And I went out on my own and founded SourceGear .
We started out doing contracting projects .
One of our first clients asked me for a Software Requirements Specification ( SRS ) and a Traceability Matrix .
That was n't a very good day .
But not long after that , I learned what the word " requirement " means when used in the context of software project management .
And I learned what Steve Stone had really meant when he asked that infuriating question .
When Steve said :
" So is that a requirement ? "
What he was really asking was :
" So it sounds like we just identified something that should become part of our spec .
You guys have a spec around here somewhere , right ?
Who is responsible for updating that spec to capture this new item ? "
What is a Requirement ?
I define a requirement as " one piece of a spec " .
Is that definition complete and immune to attack ?
No , but I think it 's the simplest definition that works .
Of course , it relies on the definition of a " spec " , so let 's go there .
What is a Spec ?
A spec is short for " specification " .
A spec is something that describes what a piece of software should do .
For the moment I am being deliberately broad and inclusive .
If you are experienced in software project management , you probably have something very specific in mind when think of the words " spec " or " requirement " .
In fact , it is possible that you are not willing to acknowledge that something is a spec unless it matches up fairly well with your image of same .
That 's okay .
Just stay with me .
For now , I 'm saying that anything that is a " description of what a piece of software should do " can be considered a spec .
This may include :
A document
A bunch of 3x5 note cards
A spreadsheet containing a list of features
I am currently involved in a project where my role is " The Walking Spec " .
In other words , I am the person who mostly knows everything about how this piece of software should mostly behave .
When people need a spec , they ask me a question ( footnote 2 ) .
I 'm not saying that I am a good spec , but I do n't think I 'm the worst spec I have ever seen , and I am certainly better that no spec at all . :-)
Seriously , a spec needs to be in a form which is accessible to more than one person .
It needs to be written down , either in a computer or on paper .
But how ?
Document or Database ?
There is a constant tension over the form of a spec .
Should it be a document or a database ?
I 'm using the words " document " and " database " as names for the two extremes which create this tension .
When a spec is more like a document , it looks like a bunch of paragraphs and prose and pictures .
When a spec is more like a database , it looks like a bunch of bullets and lists and outlines .
When a spec is being written , it wants to be a document .
It 's easier to describe what a piece of software should do when we can use paragraphs and prose and formatting .
Maybe this is because the primary content of a spec is usually coming from someone other than a developer .
We developers sometimes write apps for ourselves , but that 's not the common case .
More often , we 're writing software that somebody else wants .
We do n't know how the software should behave .
They do .
In order for the software to be born , they need to express to us everything they know about what the software should do .
That expression is a spec .
And in all likelihood , that expression is more naturally going to be like a document and less like a database .
The person will want to tell stories and give examples and rationale .
They may want to include pictures or video to explain .
But right after a spec is written , a document is usually the wrong form .
It started out as a document only because that form was most convenient for the author .
But a document is not the most convenient form for the people who are reading or using the spec , and those people have the author outnumbered .
Most of those readers / users want that spec to be a database instead of a document .
They want the spec to be logically broken up into a bunch of little pieces .
Each piece should be a self - contained statement about one single detail of how the software should behave .
Breaking a spec into little pieces allows us to use that spec more effectively .
We can more easily divide the software construction tasks across a team by assigning different pieces to different people .
We can then print the pieces as a list , put boxes to the left of each one and use it as a checklist to make sure we 're getting everything done .
So , let 's return to the original question .
What is a " requirement " ?
A requirement is a piece of a spec .
When we take a spec and put it into its more useful form by breaking it into bite - sized pieces , each of those pieces is a requirement .
Corollary
If you are in the habit of ignoring specs , you can ignore requirements in exactly the same way .
They 're no different . :-)
Writing Requirements
" Dad , where do products come from ? "
" Well , son , when a company and a market segment really love each other , they ... "
Every software product starts out as a gleam in the eye of some guy who wants to make money .
He sees a bunch of people who have money .
He pauses to reflect upon how much nicer life would be if that money were moved from their wallets into his own .
So , he pursues a process which involves the following two steps :
Find an idea for a product Build that product
Things usually fall apart between steps 1 and 2 , mostly because these two steps are done by different people .
The product is not being built by the same person who had the idea and the gleam .
Step 1 is usually somebody in marketing .
Step 2 is a team of developers .
So , in order for the developers to know what product to build and how , we need to describe it to them ( via a spec ) with lots of details ( requirements ) .
Construction and Testing
With a well - written requirements spec , the development of a software project is easy .
Let 's assume the project starts out with a spec that is :
Complete .
The spec describes everything the product needs to do .
Nothing was forgotten .
.
The spec describes everything the product needs to do .
Nothing was forgotten .
Stable .
The spec is n't in flux .
It 's not going to change along the way .
.
The spec is n't in flux .
It 's not going to change along the way .
List - oriented .
The spec is like a database ; each item being a self - contained requirement .
All the prose has been appropriately broken up into little pieces .
This is the dream scenario for a development manager .
Translate all the requirements into a set of tasks .
Divide up all the tasks between the developers on the team .
How hard can that be ?
Similarly , the testing lead has a very straightforward path with this kind of a requirements spec .
For every requirement , create one or more tests that can be used to verify that the software meets that requirement .
Automate as many of those tests as possible .
Every time the developers create a new build , run the tests and report what happened .
Easy , right ?
Unfortunately , projects do n't always work that way .
In fact , projects almost never work that way , because most requirements specs are badly written .
Bad Requirements
A bad requirements spec is considerably more likely than a perfect one .
Certain kinds of problems are common .
For example , let 's suppose we are building a game which is designed to be played by middle school girls in a library .
The following examples show some typical problems with requirements :
Missing Requirements
Very often , the spec simply is n't complete .
Somebody forgot to include an important detail .
For example , since we know the game is supposed to be played in libraries , users will need to turn the sound down or off .
So we need the game to be playable without sound .
If we forget to mention this requirement specifically , there 's a decent chance the dev team will create a game where sound is important to game play .
Unclear Requirements
Sometimes requirements are ambiguous .
Here 's an unclear requirement :
The game must be compatible with DirectX .
Which version ?
Can we use DirectX 10 , thus requiring Windows Vista ?
Or should we target DirectX 9 and stay compatible with Windows XP ?
It 's not clear .
Non-prioritized Requirements
A good requirements spec contains priority information to help the dev team make the right tradeoffs .
If some requirements are more important than others , the spec should say so .
Consider these two requirements :
The user must be allowed to save a game in progress and resume it later .
The main character in the game must resemble Dakota Fanning without looking exactly like her .
The schedule is getting tight .
Only one of these two features is going to make it .
Do you want to leave this choice entirely up to the dev team ?
Or do you want to make it clear that save / load is a more important feature than making the main character resemble a certain child actress ?
( footnote 3 )
Missing Anti-Requirements
Sometimes the problem is that the development team tries to go above and beyond the call of duty and sneak something in that was n't part of the spec .
This can be a good thing , but it can also be a bad thing .
A good requirements spec will contain " anti-requirements " , explicitly spelling out things that should not be done .
For example :
This game must not have a grenade launcher .
Believe me , if you leave too much latitude on a game project like this , we developers will turn it into a first person shooter .
Yes , we can see from the spec that the target customer is a 12 year old girl playing in a library .
But still , our intuition is that all games need a grenade launcher , so you 're gonna get one if you do n't explicitly tell us otherwise .
Changing Requirements
If a project gets all the way to completion with bad requirements , the likelihood is that the software will be disappointing .
When this happens , the resulting assignment - of - blame exercise can be fun to watch .
From a safe distance .
More often , during the project somebody notices a problem with the requirements and changes them along the way .
Marketing :
By the way , I forgot to mention that the application has to be compatible with Windows 95 .
Development : Windows 95 ?
You 're kidding , right ?
People stopped using Win95 over a decade ago !
Marketing : Oh , and Mac OS 7.6 too .
Development : What ?
We 're building this app with .
NET 3.0 and we 're already 40 % done !
Marketing :
You 're half done ?
That 's great !
Oh , and I forgot to mention we need compatibility with the Atari ST .
Development :
Why did n't you tell us this before we started ?
Marketing : Sorry .
I forgot .
It 's no problem to change it now , right ?
Changing requirements mid-project can be expensive and painful .
However , it is very rare to have a project where all the requirements are known and properly expressed before development begins .
So , it behooves us to prepare for changes .
If we choose a development process which rigidly requires a perfect spec before construction can begin , we are just setting ourselves up for pain .
We need to be a bit more agile .
Agile
I lament the loss of the word " agile " .
A minute ago when I used the word " agile " , most readers immediately thought I was talking about Agile software development practices such as Scrum or Extreme Programming .
That means your reaction was probably polarized toward one of the following two extremes :
Oh , great !
I 'm five pages into this article and suddenly I find out Eric Sink is one of those Extreme Programming fanatics ?
I guess that 's 15 minutes of my life I 'll never get back .
Sorry , I do n't mind visiting once in a while like on Christmas or Easter , but I 'm just not interested in having somebody tell me how to live my life .
And I do n't want some Agile priest telling me that I 'm not a true believer just because we do n't do pair programming .
Oh , great !
Here 's Eric
Sink trying to pretend like he 's a believer when everybody knows he 's not .
Actually I guess I should check the Central Membership Roll just to be sure .
Nope , I was right .
He 's not .
Even if he was , we would have to excommunicate him anyway .
Anybody who reads the drivel on his blog knows darn well that his doctrine is seriously screwed up .
I just want to use the word " agile " without all those connotations .
My copy of Merriam Webster 's Tenth Edition says that " agile " means " marked by ready ability to move with quick easy grace " .
At a high level , that 's all I 'm trying to say .
Sometimes requirements change .
Be ready .
In more practical terms , I 'll admit that the body of wisdom literature produced by the Agile movement has some very good stuff in it .
But Agile is no different from any other major religion like Christianity or Buddhism .
You can learn some great principles and practices there , but formally becoming a member is a decision that should not be made lightly .
:-)
Traceability
I 've tried to write this article at a fairly high level , focusing more on principles than practices , staying inclusive of the broad range of viable methods for getting projects done .
However , the truth is that the word " requirement " is usually associated with stricter and more formal ways of doing things .
We developers say that we do n't like formality and strictness , but I think we 're confused .
We do n't like being told what to do .
We do n't like stupid rules that do n't make sense .
We do n't like working for some stupid pointy - haired - boss who draws arbitrary boundaries that we 're not allowed to cross .
But we spend our entire day using a compiler , and compilers are very formal and strict .
In C , if we type primtf instead of printf , the compiler will let us go no further until we stop and fix it .
In C# , if we try to use an uninitialized local variable , our compiler will scold us for stepping outside the boundaries .
Do we go out after work and gripe about our compiler ?
" I am sick and tired of that stupid compiler !
When I do something right it never says a word , but if I do the slightest little thing wrong , it throws a fit .
Why does it have to nitpick about every little mistake I make ? "
Nope .
Actually , we like compilers .
We like the formality and strictness .
We know having a compiler to catch our mistakes is a good thing because it allows us to go faster .
It 's safe to sit down and crank out a thousand lines of code as fast as we can because we know the compiler will find a lot of the little errors that happen .
Would n't it be great if every phase of the software development process had a compiler ?
I want a piece of software that tells me if I forget to implement one of the requirements .
When my requirements conflict with each other , my " spec compiler " should output an error .
When one of my requirements is n't being verified by anything in the test suite , some piece of software should tell me .
The compiler I want does n't exist today , but there are things we can do to approximate that style of work .
For example , code coverage can be used to help verify that things are getting tested .
Automated testing can help catch bugs that slip in .
The concept which may eventually get us the compiler I want is called " traceability " .
The idea is that everything should be traceable back to something else .
Every piece of code in the project should exist because it helps meet one or more requirements .
Traceability should allow us to ask , " Which requirement motivates this piece of code ? "
If the answer is " none " , then that piece of code should be excised .
Every requirement needs to be tested .
Traceability should allow us to ask , " Which tests verify that this requirement is being met ? "
If the answer is " none " , then we need to write some more tests .
Lacking my super - duper application lifecycle compiler that verifies that everything is traceable , we can keep track of some of this stuff using a traceability matrix .
When it functions more like a compiler than a pointy - haired - boss , a little extra formality and strictness can be very helpful .
Requirements Management Software
Naturally , we want to use software to manage our requirements .
Many folks do this with a general - purpose tool like a word processor or a spreadsheet .
That works fine .
Some people track requirements in a bug - tracking system .
This can work , but it 's not a perfect solution .
Requirements and bugs are different .
For example , requirements do n't change status from Open to Closed to Verified .
Another approach is to use something which is specifically designed to track requirements .
Application Lifecycle Management ( ALM ) software often contains features for managing and tracking requirements .
The ALM solutions from companies like IBM Rational , Serena and Borland are examples , but it should be noted that these solutions are very expensive and designed for large enterprise environments .
My own company will soon be releasing an ALM solution which is designed specifically for smaller teams .
We call it SourceGear Fortress .
However , the 1.0 release will not have any features specifically designed for tracking requirements .
We do intend to include this and other features in the future as we evolve Fortress into a mature and complete ALM solution .
Microsoft made a similar choice with Visual Studio Team System .
However , since their product is enterprise - focused , it has been criticized for not having any requirements features in the first release ( footnote 4 ) .
I suspect that this is a hole they plan to plug at some point in the future .

New office has a better view
Marketers usually boast about what they have added to their products .
Increasingly , though , they are bragging about what they are taking out — by cutting down on packaging and its impact on the environment .
Procter & Gamble , for example , has introduced rigid tubes for Crest toothpaste that can be shipped and displayed on shelves without boxes .
Aveda , a beauty products company , is expected to soon roll out a men ’s care line that is packaged in bottles made of 95 percent recycled materials .
And Coca - Cola plans to cut the plastics in its Dasani water bottles by 7 percent over the next five years , just by tweaking the shape of the bottle and the cap .
“ Waste of any kind is inefficiency , and inefficiency equals cost , ” said Scott Vitters , Coca - Cola ’s director of sustainable packaging .

The ban reflects a growing unease about using the " N - word "
The resolution to ban the so - called " N - word " is largely symbolic as it carries no weight in law and those who use the word would face no punishment .
But it reflects a growing unease that the racial slur is now part of everyday conversation and that the taboo against its usage has been swept away .
The word is in common usage among sections of the younger generation in the United States .
' Throwback to slavery '
For many years the " N - word " has been used by young African Americans who have appropriated it as a , perhaps ironic , term of endearment .
Now , other ethnic groups have started to use it in a similar context , and those who insist it should be banned are growing increasingly outraged .
Many African American community leaders , with the backing of fellow lawmakers , say it is offensive in every context and that is a word which should never be said .
For them the word is loaded with offensiveness .
They regard it as degrading and a throwback to the times of slavery when blacks were regarded as sub - human , to be bought and sold by their white owners .
The New York City resolution was sponsored by Councilman Leroy Comrie , who says the " N - word " was derived solely out of hate and anger and that its meaning cannot be changed .
But for America 's so - called hip - hop generation using the word among themselves is about self - empowerment .
Its usage is habitual and seems culturally fixed and to stop it is likely to take a change in their attitudes rather than an edict from elected officials .
What is appscript ?
Please note that appscript is no longer developed or supported , and its use is not recommended for new projects .
Appscript is a high - level , user - friendly Apple event bridge that allows you to control scriptable Mac OS X applications from Python , Ruby and Objective - C. Appscript makes these languages serious alternatives to Apple 's own AppleScript language for automating your Mac .
For example , to get the value of the first paragraph of the topmost document in TextEdit using appscript :
app (' TextEdit') .documents [ ' Read Me'].paragraphs [ 1].get ( )
This is equivalent to the AppleScript statement :
tell application " TextEdit " get paragraph 1 of document " Read Me " end tell
Benefits
Appscript provides :
a robust , polished API extensively field - tested since 2003
excellent compatibility with existing " AppleScriptable " applications , from venerable Carbon - based workhorses to the latest Cocoa - based releases
a powerful interactive help system for exploring scriptable applications ' object models and dictionaries
a clean , object oriented - like syntax for ease of use
free developer tools ASDictionary exports application dictionaries in plain text and HTML formats ASTranslate converts AppleScript commands to their appscript equivalents
full support for Mac OS X 10.4 and later .
Implementations

Viacom owns a number of well - known brands
Viacom , which owns MTV and Nickelodeon , says YouTube uses its shows illegally .
Viacom alleges that about 160,000 unauthorised clips of its programmes have been loaded onto YouTube 's site and viewed more than 1.5 billion times .
Google says it is " confident " that YouTube has respected the legal rights of copyright holders .
However the internet search giant saw its shares fall $ 11.72 , or 2.6 % .
' Clearly illegal '
As well as more than $ 1bn in damages , the legal action seeks an injunction to prevent what Viacom calls " massive intentional copyright infringement " .
" You Tube 's strategy has been to avoid taking proactive steps to curtail the infringement on its site , " said Viacom in a statement .
There is no question that YouTube and Google are continuing to take the fruit of our efforts without permission
Viacom
Google 's copyright nightmare
" Their business model , which is based on building traffic and selling advertising off of unlicensed content , is clearly illegal and is in obvious conflict with copyright laws . "
Last month , Viacom , which also owns cable networks VH1 and Comedy Central , told YouTube to remove 100,000 " unauthorised " clips .
Viacom said its demand came after YouTube and Google failed to install tools to " filter " the unauthorised video clips following negotiations .
" There is no question that YouTube and Google are continuing to take the fruit of our efforts without permission and destroying enormous value in the process , " it said .
We will certainly not let this suit become a distraction
Google
Check Google 's share price Check Viacom 's share price
" This is value that rightfully belongs to the writers , directors and talent who create it and companies like Viacom that have invested to make possible this innovation and creativity . "
Doing deals
A Google spokesperson said : " We have not received the lawsuit but are confident that YouTube has respected the legal rights of copyright holders and believe the courts will agree .
" YouTube is great for users and offers real opportunities to rights holders : the opportunity to interact with users ; to promote their content to a young and growing audience ; and to tap into the online advertising market .
" We will certainly not let this suit become a distraction to the continuing growth and strong performance of YouTube and its ability to attract more users , more traffic and build a stronger community . "
The soaring popularity of YouTube has led traditional media to worry that the displaying of clips from their programmes - without compensation - will lure away viewers , and , as a result , advertising revenue .
Google , which paid $ 1.65 bn for YouTube last year , has been trying to win permission from media companies to broadcast output legally on YouTube in exchange for payment , avoiding the threat of legal action .
Separately , the BBC has struck a content deal with YouTube to showcase short clips of BBC content .
The BBC hopes that the deal will help it reach YouTube 's monthly audience of more than 70 million users and drive extra traffic to its own website .
The corporation will also get a share of the advertising revenue generated by traffic to the new YouTube channels .
Gore says logic , reason on the decline Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday May 17 , 2007 Print This Email This
In his forthcoming book , The Assault on Reason , former Vice President Al Gore says the country 's headlong rush into war demonstrates the extent to which " logical debate " is under assault in the way America governs itself , according to an excerpt published by Time magazine .
" Faith in the power of reason -- the belief that free citizens can govern themselves wisely and fairly by resorting to logical debate on the basis of the best evidence available , instead of raw power -- remains the central premise of American democracy , " Gore writes .
" This premise is now under assault . "
Gore 's re-emergence has fueled calls for him to enter the 2008 presidential race .
Although the vice president has said he does n't intend to run , his not - quite - certain denials have sustained hope among Gore faithfuls that he could enter the race at the last minute .
In a New York Times Magazine interview to be published Sunday , Gore left open the possibility he might change his mind .
" Having spent 30 years as part of the political dialogue , I do n't know why a 600 - day campaign is taken as a given , " Gore told James Traub of the Times , " and why people who are n't in it 600 days out for the convenience of whatever brokers want to close the door and narrow the field and say , ' This is it , now let 's place your bets ' --
If they want to do that , fine .
I do n't have to play that game . "
In his book , Gore blames the decline in newspaper readership and the rise of television -- especially news coverage of frivolous stories like Britney Spears 's breakup with her husband -- for leading to a populace that is not only less informed but less able to adequately participate in a national conversation .
The former vice president , who lost the White House to George W. Bush in 2000 , has traveled the world as a high - profile spokesman for environmental causes , and his film An Inconvenient Truth won this year 's Oscar for best documentary .
The Assault on Reason , which will be released Tuesday , is Gore 's third book .
In it , he lays out the extent to which public opinion can be manipulated through television advertisements and the damaging potential as Americans elect their leaders based more on style than substance .
He says political targeting efforts that play on individualized appeals aimed at highly specific demographics have " magnified the power of propagandistic electronic messaging " that threatens open and fact - based discourse .
" As a result , our democracy is in danger of being hollowed out , " Gore writes .
" In order to reclaim our birthright , we Americans must resolve to repair the systemic decay of the public forum . "
Gore says the Internet has the potential to create this new public forum , but he warns that voters must resist efforts by corporations to control information on and access to the Web .

Prices for PDA - style Windows SideShow devices will start from about $ 80 , according to a developer that demonstrated prototypes to Texyt.com today .
The touchscreen handheld gadgets share many of the features of PDAs , smartphones , and media players like Apple 's iPod , but they connect wirelessly to a PC to send or receive data .
A high - end SideShow device with a slide - out Qwerty keyboard will cost ' approximately $ 150 ' , said staff of Taiwan - based chip manufacturer , Winbond , which makes CPUs and other chips for the devices .
A smaller device with a square 3.5 - inch touch screen will cost ' about $ 80 ' , they predicted .
Bluetooth to connect to outside world
The SideShow handhelds connect to a host Windows Vista PC via Bluetooth to synchronize email , contacts , appointments , RSS feeds , documents and other data , said Winbond senior sales manager , David Sung .
They can download and play music , games , and media files .
Prototype developer
While Winbond did not identify the prototypes , which are marked with Microsoft labels , they appear to be engineering samples developed by US - based Ricavision , which is working closely with Microsoft on the first standalone Windows SideShow devices .
Ricavision is developing several SideShow devices .
These include the MK 140 FM ' Fridge Magnet / Scribbler Device ' , which appears to be the smaller of the two prototypes shown by Winbond .
The larger prototype with a sliding keyboard appears to be Ricavision 's ' MK140 eChatter ' .
This has a 5 - inch rectangular screen .
Realtime wireless chat via keyboard
The small keyboard allows users to edit documents , or respond to email hand have the response sent the next time they synchronize with the host PC .
The keyboard can also be used for real time instant messaging via Bluetooth - if a host PC is within range .
A maximum range of 100 meters is possible , Winbond staff claimed .
However , this is likely to be reduced by interference from other wireless devices , they pointed out .
The devices have a USB socket to recharge their internal batteries , and for data synchronization if Bluetooth is unavailable .
Both products will run for 16 hours on battery power , according to Ricavision .
Ricavision is also developing the ' Home E - Reader ' , a Windows SideShow handheld with a large , high - contrast , low power e-Paper display .
The E - Reader is designed for off line reading of downloaded documents and e-books .
Another new market for Microsoft
Microsoft is stressing to its partners that SideShow devices are intended to be a companion to Windows Vista PCs – or at least , that is how they should be presented .
One manager from a hardware developer attending Microsoft 's WinHEC conference in Taipei , who did not wish to be named , claimed that Microsoft is hoping to create a new market for low cost SideShow devices without alarming the smartphone and PDA makers who are using its Windows Mobile OS and Pocket PC platform .
However , with the potential for overlap in features and end users , this is difficult , he said .
Smartphone makers are said to be worried that corporate customers might opt for cheaper , less feature - rich phones if they can rely on a cheap SideShow handheld for contacts , e-mail and scheduling .
Microsoft has announced that Windows Mobile will soon support SideShow gadgets , perhaps alleviating this concern .
Winbond brings chip price down
Winbond has developed an integrated controller chip for SideShow , the WPCE521L , which incorporates a 32 - bit ARM RISC CPU core , a LCD interface , USB interface , power management , and other functions .
The company also offers SDRAM and other chips for SideShow products .
Staff estimated the cost of the key chips for a standalone SideShow device at about $ 10 .
The most expensive component is the color LCD touchscreen , they said .
Winbond is offering a complete reference design , making it easy for manufacturers to rapidly develop their own low cost SideShow devices using its chips .
Until recently , the main chip developer for SideShow devices was PortalPlayer , which also designed the chips inside the original iPod , and was recently acquired by Nvidia .
The new handheld SideShow devices are expected to be on the market well before the end of the year , Winbond staff said , but could not give a precise date .
Ricavision has already begun marketing a final version of a SideShow remote control for Windows Media Center PCs .
Correction :
An earlier version of this article erroneously stated that PortalPlayer was acquired by Apple .
PortalPlayer was in fact purchased by Nvidia .
Thanks to Jerry Kindall for the correction .
There 's a document on the GnuPG explaining how to set up your system to use a smartcard .
There a few people around claiming that it works on a standard Debian Sarge by using udev .
Up to today I have had no luck with that however , but that finally changed !
I 'll skip narrating all the thing I tried in vain , including compiling new kernels from backports.org .
So if you happen to have an SCM Microsystems SCR335 smartcard reader ( which is listed on the HOWTO as supported ) like me this should get it to work .
Packages you 'll have to install :
gnupg
pcscd
libpcsclite - dev
a 2.6 linux kernel
udev
Everything else will come in as a dependency .
After that you also need a file in /etc/udev/rules.d/gnnupg-ccid.rules and no , do n't use the one they suggest in the HOWTO .
This one line is much better as it does n't need the speparate script ( and actually works ! ) :
BUS==" usb " , ENV{ACTION}==" add " , SYSFS{idVendor}= = " 04e6 " , SYSFS{idProduct}== " 5115 " , GROUP = " users " , MODE = " 0660 "
Note the ENV bit .
You 'll have to adjust the SYSFS values if you have a different reader .
Lastly there 's the GROUP and MODE to play with , I really do n't see why you need to create yet another group for this .
Why would n't all users be allowed to use a smartcard ?
Now you should have the green led on the reader on when you insert the card .
And gpg -- card - status should give you output too .
Start playing .
If you find any errors in the above ( I missed a required package or so ) please tell me and I 'll update the description .
Ah , the joys of a road trip .
Sit back , relax … take in the wind , the open road .
But wait , something weird is going on in this picture .
It took me a while to notice it , but once I finally did , it reminded me of that road trip I took with Manute Bol last Summer .
Though I ’m not quite sure , I ’d guess this photo was taken somewhere in Central / Eastern Europe , where the automobiles are often battered , and the men gigantic .
I ’m thinking Hungary .

THE Bush Administration has run a systematic campaign to play down the dangers of climate change , demanding hundreds of politically motivated changes to scientific reports and muzzling a pre-eminent expert on global warming , the US Congress has been told .
The testimony on Monday to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform painted the Administration as determined to maintain its line on climate change even when it clashed with the findings of scientific experts .
James Hansen , who heads the Goddard Institute for Space Science in New York , said in testimony : " The effect of the filtering of climate change science during the current Administration has been to make the reality of climate change less certain than the facts indicate , and to reduce concern about the relation of climate change to human - made greenhouse gas emissions .

Next month the Washington Times , the conservative newspaper with close ties to every Republican administration since Reagan , celebrates its 25th anniversary .
Former President George H.W. Bush will be the headliner .
And the former President deserves the honor .
Barbara Bush ought to get a rousing cheer as well .
The two of them have been beating the bushes for Reverend Sun Myung Moon for years .
Moon and his Unification Church came to America in the 1970s and quickly plunged into Washington politics .
“ In the 1970s , church officials organized prayer breakfasts and rallies in support of President Richard M. Nixon , dispatched young female members to infiltrate congressional offices and had extensive ‘ operational ties ’ with the Korean Central Intelligence Agency as part of the agency ’s efforts to influence U.S. officials , according to a 1978 report by a House subcommittee , ” the Washington Post would later report .
Those ties became fodder for the 1976 Koreagate scandal , which centered around the figure of Washington lobbyist Tongsun Park , a man legendary for his lavish parties and gifts of cash in white envelopes .
He , too , was long suspected of being connected to Korean intelligence ; he was also an influence peddler of great renown , and anywhere from 30 to more than 100 members of congress were said to be under his thumb at the time .
Park was never charged with any crime in connection with Koreagate , but last year he was convicted on conspiracy charges for his role in Saddam Hussein ’s United Nations oil - for - food machinations .
Moon was not prosecuted in connection with Koreagate , but he later became a target of an IRS investigation and in 1982 was convicted of conspiracy and filing false tax returns .
He spent 18 months in federal prison .
It was also in 1982 that he launched the Washington Times , which — with its access to conservative figures and reporters drawn from the newsroom of the defunct Washington Star — soon became essential reading for political news junkies .
Through the early 80s , while Bush served as Vice President , Moon operatives were building ties with the New Right — flying Hill staffers to junta - ruled El Salvador , and supporting the Nicaraguan contras ’ fight against the Sandinista government .
The late Terry Dolan , chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee ( NCPAC ) and often credited with pioneering the modern political attack ad , helped Moon burrow into the conservative mainstream .
A Moon group , the Confederation of Associations for the Unification of the Societies of the Americas ( CAUSA ) , contributed $ 500,000 to Dolan ’s Conservative Alliance in the early 1980s .
“ We ’re trying to combat communism and we ’re trying to uphold traditional Judeo - Christian values , ” James Gavin , special assistant to Moon ’s top deputy , Col. Bo Hi Pak , told the Washington Post .
“ The Washington Times is standing up for those values and fighting anything that would tear them down .
Causa is doing the same thing , by explaining what the enemy is trying to do . ”
Four years after leaving the White House , in 1996 , Bush traveled to Buenos Aires for the opening of Moon ’s pan Latin American newspaper , Tiempos del Mundo , and according to the Washington Post received $ 100,000 for his trouble .
Then he accompanied Moon to Uruguay to help open a seminary .
His son Neil received $ 1 million from a Moon foundation for an educational company .
( Much of what is known about Moon comes from the efforts of a tiny group of reporters , including blogger John Gorenfeld , as well as Robert Parry , the former AP reporter who broke many of the Iran contra stories .
Bill Berkowitz and Fred Clarkson are two others in a small band of reporters who have followed the Bush - Moon connection . )
The Houston Chronicle in 2006 obtained evidence that Moon ’s Washington Times Foundation had contributed $ 1 million to Bush ’s presidential library using the Greater Houston Community Foundation as a conduit .
The deal came to light in a rather roundabout way .
When he was asked if Moon ’s $ 1 million went to the library , Jim McGrath , the family spokesman , told the Chronicle , “ We ’re in an uncomfortable position . …
If a donor does n’t want to be identified we need to honor their privacy . ”
He was then asked whether the money was meant to suggest to the Bush family that the time was at hand for President George W. Bush to grant Moon a pardon for his 1982 conviction McGrath replied , “ If that ’s why he gave the grant , he ’s throwing his money away .
…
That ’s not the way the Bushes operate . ”
For the Washington Times extravaganza on May 17 , Bush will appear in the National Building Museum ’s monumental Great Hall .
Moon , resplendent as always , will deliver the Founder ’s Address .

Or , ‘ Raising Hell , The Dr Laura Way ” .
It seems Dr Laura Schlessinger , scourge of the morally lax parent , may herself have raised a sociopath .
Oh , how I love the smell of hung petards in the morning ….
First a little backstory , for non-Usanians like me who may not be that familiar with ‘ Dr Laura ’ , the bizarro - Oprah of talk radio .
Dr Laura Schlessinger is a rightwing radio ‘ therapist ’ , wannabe tv star and self - help book author , whose fans absolutely lap up her harsh strictures on sexuality , relationships and child - rearing .
Her show ’s syndicated on Clear Channel radio US - wide ; Clear Channel , part - owned by Mormon presidential hopeful Mitt Romney ’s private equity firm , Bain Capital ( which has all kinds of interesting connections with some decidedly neofascist types ) has a history of manufacturing and broadcasting far - right reactionary radio ‘ personalities ’ .
So far , so usual for the US rightwing media machine and its creatures .- but Dr Laura is special .
First off she ’s a doctor , of sorts ; even though it ’s a Phd. in physiology not pychology it authenticates her very subjective advice as somehow quasi-medical and so iher personal emotional hangups ’re adopted as sound principles by her rightwing supporters , some of whom are so loyal to her personally that they describe themselves as ‘ Dr Laura ’s Army ’ .
Dr Laura fits the Clear Channel mould perfectly ; she ’s a cruel homophobe and a hypocrite with a shady past ( by her own stated standards ) who preaches to others what she does not practice herself .
She ’s a vicious piece of work with it , as I ’ve discovered the more I ’ve read :
Even more shocking was her treatment of a Connecticut eighth - grader for an award - wining essay on free speech on the Internet .
Attacking the girl by name , she maliciously asserted : “ If she was my daughter , I ’d probably put her up for adoption .
. . . When she makes her marriage vows , and her husband has sex with someone else , let ’s see if she thinks that this philosophy works .
She also suggested that the girl be “ sacrificed , ” Inca style !
Someone who could treat a child that way should never be allowed near one in a therapeutic or a parental sense , IMHO .
Who knows how many children ’s lives she ’s affected with her self - interested , twisted ideas ?
Well , one at least has been severely affected according to this report , and having found out what unpleasant child - rearing ideas his mother has it comes as no surprise – in fact it almost seems inevitable .
Dr. Laura son linked to lurid Web page
Site contained violent , sex - oriented images one official called ‘ repulsive ’
By Matthew D. LaPlante
The Salt Lake Tribune
Article Last Updated : 05/19/2007 12:15:45 AM
MDT
The soldier son of talk radio relationship counselor Laura Schlessinger is under investigation for a graphic personal Web page that one Army official has called “ repulsive . ”
The MySpace page , publicly available until Friday when it disappeared from the Internet , included cartoon depictions of rape , murder , torture and child molestation ; photographs of soldiers with guns in their mouths ; a photograph of a bound and blindfolded detainee captioned “ My Sweet Little Habib ” ; accounts of illicit drug use ; and a blog entry headlined by a series of obscenities and racial epithets .
The site is credited to and includes many photographs of Deryk Schlessinger , the 21 - year - old son of the talk radio personality known simply as Dr. Laura .
Broadcast locally on 570 KNRS , “ Family Values Talk Radio , ” the former family counselor spends three hours daily taking calls and offering advice on morals , ethics and values .
She broadcast a show from Fort Douglas , in Salt Lake City , last week . [… ]
“ Yes . . . F—ING Yes !!! ” said one blog entry on the Schlessinger site .
“ I LOVE MY JOB , it takes everything reckless and deviant and heathenistic and just overall bad about me and hyper focuses these traits into my job of running around this horrid place doing nasty things to people that deserve it . . . and some that do n’t . ”
Dr. Laura ’s publicity people and the US Army are now trying to suggest that this site was created by mysterious ‘ enemies ’ engaged in ‘ information warfare ’ .
Uh , huh , right , yeah , because Al - Qaeda or the Mahdi army have got nothing better to do than to fuck around creating fake MySpace pages about the batshit crazy sons of psychotic wingnut radio personalities .
After the Salt Lake City Tribune published this report ‘ Dr Laura ’s Army ’ leapt to her defence in the papers ’ pages , bombarding it with oddly similar emails , the overall tone of which was ‘ do n’t blame her for the decisions her child makes ’ .
Bollocks to that , she does n’t get off that easy – particularly since a major part of her schtick appears to be telling parents that they are indeed responsible for their child ’s behaviour .
Her catchphrase is even “ I am my kid ’s mom , ” , FFS .
Dr Laura was once asked a very pertinent question a while back about the kind of behaviour her own son is apparently exhibiting , by CNN ’s Larry King :
KING : And then how do you explain those where you had parents that drifted and the kid turned out terrific , and other places where the parents did all the things you said to do and he turns into a serial killer and everyone on the block is shocked ?
SCHLESSINGER : When we take the fringe of the bell curve of exceptions and try to make them speak for the rule we ’re not being fair .
We ’re taking extremes to try to get away from a truth that we know morally , intuitively we know what we need to do .
I think human beings — I mean , from the time we ’re born we have the ability to be selfish , we have the ability to be selfless .
But I think small creatures are basically selfish , and we always have to strive against our selfishness every day in every way .
Shorter Dr Laura – “ I do n’t know what makes psychos .
Ask me another ” .
But she did know the answer all along .
Laura Schlessinger ’s appearance in Utah last week included a visit with Army families at Fort Douglas .
In an interview with The Tribune , she said , “ We raised our son to be a warrior . ”
Now see , there ’s the problem right there .
This is the kind of ‘ warrior ’ he became under Dr Laura ’s tender care – at least according to what may admittedly beunreliable sources , ie someone who says they were at at school with Schlessinger Jr. :
I was in school with Derek in fourth and fifth grade .
He was a sadistic bully then .
He was a terribly unhappy kid who boasted about all the money his mom made and threatened , bullied , and beat up younger kids .
If a teacher tried to discipline him or in any way thwart him he would threaten that his mom would get them fired and would sue them .
I do n’t know if she could but I know it scared a lot of teachers I do n’t know a kid in school who was sorry to see him go when his mom put him in private school .
We used to call him Malfoy because he reminded us of the character from Harry Potter .
I would n’t be amazed by anything the guy is assused of , up to homicide .
He is a nasty piece of work .

From : KEN KORNFELD
Now , Schlessinger Jr. has been serving in special forces , and there might be those who ’ll say PTSD !
but that ’s a copout .
Special Forces are the soldiers who did this .
This typifies what ’s on young Deryk ’s MySpace page :
In one of the stick drawings , a top - hatted man laughs as he rapes a bound and bleeding woman in front of her family .
In another depiction , a man forces a boy to perform oral sex at knifepoint as the child ’s mother pleads for her son ’s life .
No doubt Dr Laura herself will be one of those who scream “ PTSD ! ” too , supporting her little ‘ warrior ’ and his pyschotic tendencies to the end .
But there ’s no evading her responsibility : as she ’s said herself –
SCHLESSINGER : … men are born of women , they are trained by women , they date marry that are trained by women , they marry women they are trained by women .
A lot of what women get from men is their own doing , and that ’s why I wrote this book because we primarily have the control in the relationships of the quality of the relationships .
How does that petard feel , Dr Laura ?
A little uncomfortable , perhaps ?
Story Highlights • NEW : Gonzales " optimistic , feeling good " after testimony , Justice official says
• Senior administration officials say Attorney General Gonzales should resign

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Several administration officials and the House Republican Conference chairman said Friday that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales should step down , following the harsh response to his Senate testimony on last year 's firing of eight U.S. attorneys .
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee grilled Gonzales for hours Thursday about the dismissals .
The attorney general has been roundly criticized for his handling of the shakeup and for the shifting explanations Justice Department officials have given for the changes .
( Watch how pressure on Gonzales to resign is growing )
Gonzales said more than 60 times that he " could n't recall " certain incidents .
His former chief of staff , Kyle Sampson , used that explanation 122 times during his testimony weeks ago .
Detractors say the Justice Department has not been straightforward about the reasons the attorneys were dismissed .
The controversy has led to allegations of political interference with pending investigations .
" He did not distinguish himself in the hearing , " said Rep. Adam Putnam , House GOP conference chairman .
" There remains a cloud over the department . "
" I think that they would be well - served by fresh leadership , " said Putnam , who is often a spokesman for House Republicans .
He said no one was doing " high fives " after the testimony .
During the hearings Thursday , while Democratic senators criticized Gonzales ' leadership , some of the sharpest criticism came from Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee , including one who called for his resignation .
Sen .
Tom Coburn , R - Oklahoma , said Gonzales should resign .
" The communication was atrocious .
It was inconsistent -- it 's generous to say that there were misstatements ; it 's a generous statement .
And I believe you ought to suffer the consequences that these others have suffered , " Coburn said , adding , " I believe the best way to put this behind us is your resignation . "
( Watch Coburn tell Gonzales he must " suffer the consequences " )
On Friday , another Republican , Sen Jeff Sessions of Alabama , told CNN that Gonzales should consider leaving office .
" I think the attorney general ought to take the weekend and think about this and ask himself whether he can effectively reconstitute the attorney general 's office , " Sessions said , " and I 'll be thinking about the same thing .
" If he feels like he cannot , then it would be best for the president and the country to resign . "
Justice official : Gonzales ' feeling good '
According to a senior Justice Department official , Gonzales spoke to some senators Friday .
The official would only say they included Sen.
Arlen Specter , R - Pennsylvania , " and others " and was not sure whether he spoke to any Democrats .
" The conversations went well , " the official said but provided no details .
The official also said , " Attorney General Gonzales is in good spirits .
He 's optimistic , feeling good . "
" He is eager to get on with the other important work of the department , " the official added .
The attorney general plans to participate in private and public events in the coming week in Washington .
After Gonzales ' testimony Thursday , White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino said Gonzales has the full backing of the president :
" President Bush was pleased with the attorney general 's testimony today .
After hours of testimony in which he answered all of the senators ' questions and provided thousands of pages of documents , he again showed that nothing improper occurred .
He admitted the matter could have been handled much better , and he apologized for the disruption to the lives of the U.S. attorneys involved , as well as for the lack of clarity in his initial responses , " Perino said .
White House insiders : Gonzales hurt himself
But White House insiders told CNN after the testimony that Gonzales hurt himself during his testimony .
The sources , involved in administration discussions about Gonzales , said two senior level White House aides who heard the testimony described Gonzales as " going down in flames , " " not doing himself any favors , " and " predictable . "
" Everyone 's putting their best public face on , " one source said , " but everyone is discouraged .
Everyone is disappointed . "
( Watch a recap of the testy hearing )
And the administration officials who talked to CNN on Friday agreed that Gonzales ' statements did little to help him regain credibility on Capitol Hill and , in fact , may have lost him the few supporters he had left .
One official , who works closely with Gonzales , described him as " out of touch " with the political pulse in Washington .
The official said the attorney general is still optimistic that he can remedy the situation .
The White House sources acknowledge that no one knows what the president will do .
No one is looking for a replacement yet , sources said , and the White House is waiting to see how this plays out with the public and members of Congress over the next couple of days .
Another White House insider said it 's up to the president to save him .
( Strategy Session : Should Gonzales go ? )
" He and Al have to work this out ... " he said .
" There is no indication that Gonzales thinks he needs to leave . "
Former solicitor general mentioned as possible replacement
Several other officials said Republicans have begun discussing a possible replacement .
One name that consistently comes up is Ted Olson , former solicitor general .
Olson is seen as having the experience , reputation and credibility needed to steer the department for the next year and a half , through the end of Bush 's term .
However , officials note that Bush has been a longtime defender of Gonzales , whom he hired as his general counsel in 1994 when he was elected Texas governor .
He may not be willing to give in to congressional demands to remove him , unless he becomes convinced that keeping Gonzales will hinder his agenda , they said .
Sen .
John Cornyn , R - Texas , indicated to CNN that he is ambivalent about the possibility that Gonzales might leave .
" If Al Gonzales were to quit tomorrow , it would n't end it .
It would just , I think , add fuel to the fire , especially with Democrats controlling the Senate , " he said .
" We 'd have a confirmation hearing with the new attorney general , with a year and half left to serve in President Bush 's second term in office .
I think it would be more chaotic than it would if he were to stay and try to do the best job he can under very difficult circumstances . "
CNN 's Terry Frieden , Kelli Arena , Dana Bash , Ted Barrett , Kevin Bohn and Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report .
It 's plainly evident that when you hit bottom , you should stop digging .
No one ever told that to Dick Wadhams .
In this morning 's Richmond Times - Dispatch , Wadhams made a wild and outrageous charge of anti-Semitism against the Webb campaign .
In an article titled , " Allen : Webb camp anti-Semitic , " George Allen 's campaign manager wildly and irrationally tagged the Webb campaign and the pro-Webb corner of the blogosphere as Jew - haters .
" Anti-Semitic themes run through the Webb campaign .
I distinctly make that assertion and that charge , " said Wadhams .
Perhaps Dick should have made sure not to cite Raising Kaine , run by Jewish Virginian Lowell Feld .
More after the jump .
In what is clearly an attempt to rescue a foundering campaign once thought to be on easy street , Wadhams and Allen are seeking to use the Jewish community as a bludgeon to deflect their own hatemongering and project their intolerance onto Webb .
They even trotted two of the grand total of three Jewish Republicans in Congress -- Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor and Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman -- to help out in the effort .
The Allen campaign specifically noted stories on Raising Kaine as some sort of evidence that the Webb campaign is rife with anti-Semitism :
Wadhams referred to posts on Democratic blog sites that address Allen 's Jewish ancestry , Among the sites mentioned by Wadhams : raisingkaine.com , operated by Webb campaign blogger Lowell Fulk ( sic ) .
Fulk ( sic ) is Jewish .
" To call me in any way , shape or form anti-Semitic is just a little ridiculous , " said Fulk ( sic ) , who put up a post after the Fairfax County debate that included video of Allen 's testy response .
" Wadhams is just trying to turn George Allen into some sort of victim . "
On several blogs , some friendly to Webb , posts chided Allen for his fierce reply to the question by a Washington television station .
Others poked fun at the senator or raised questions about his forthrightness .
Some Republican blogs carried posts defending Allen and critical of those who questioned his lineage .
Fulk ( sic ) said by attacking Democratic blogs , the Allen campaign is " trying to change the subject .
. . .
They 're shooting the messenger . "
Note that the pro-Allen rag , Times - Dispatch , gets Feld 's last name wrong .
Lowell Fulk was a Democratic candidate for House of Delegates last year from Rockingham County .
Like Lowell Feld , I am a Jewish Virginian .
I know what anti-Semitism is , and calling George Felix Allen out for his deeply aghast reaction to being asked if he was Jewish is not anti-Semitism .
In an era where synagogues are advised to undertake heavy security measures on High Holidays , where victims like Ilan Halimi are kidnapped , tortured , and murdered for being Jewish , anti-Semitism is a serious concern .
That George Felix Allen would simply spit on those victims to make a cheap point and use our religious community as a weapon only further underscores what more and more Virginians realize every day : he is unfit for public office .
The life of 12 - year - old Adam Fuhrer , which takes place largely against the peaceful suburban backdrop of Thornhill , would seem as normal as any .
He is tall , long - limbed and taciturn .
He wears braces , which he shields shyly with a half - smile .
He loves his electric guitar , hanging out with friends , and is a close follower of the chancy playoff race in which his favourite team , the Toronto Maple Leafs , is currently embroiled .
" Dunno , " he mumbles , when asked recently if they 'll make it , shrugging and glancing at his feet – another gesture entirely typical of a 12 - year - old boy .
But then there 's this :
In his bedroom , Adam has a computer .
Through that computer , Adam transforms , from shy pre-teen to one of the most potent influencers in the rapidly growing world of social bookmarking .
On sites like Reddit ( Adam 's favourite ) , Digg ( the largest of the group , with 20 million users ) , Del.icio.us and StumbleUpon , Adam and other users talk amongst themselves , pointing out the latest , coolest , most interesting or just plain weirdest things they can find .
It 's a realm that has quickly moved from chatty online fascination to a potentially potent marketing tool – a holy grail for niche advertisers for whom web ad - buying remains a relative shot in the dark .
Social networking sites pare down the guesswork as users like Adam drive heavy traffic to the sites they post .
And the most important users are the ones that consistently lead where others follow – like 12 - year - old Adam .
Using an online pseudonym , which his father , Gerald , requested not be revealed in this article ( Adam was " all right " with it being revealed ; " You 'd be `all right ' with having your face on the front page of the paper , " Gerald laughed ) , Adam scours about 100 of his favourite websites , looking for points of interest .
" Tech sites , blogs , news , " he says , his hand over his face as he scans updates onscreen on his Google reader .
When he finds items he judges to be sufficiently interesting – recently , a story on how Fox News devoted three times as much airtime to the death of Anna Nicole Smith than to the Scooter Libby trial ; some images of a giant sinkhole in Guatemala City – he posts them on Reddit.com , one of a groundswell of sites where users share what they deem to be the tastiest tidbits found in the vast smorgasbord of information the Internet serves up , minute to minute , hour to hour .
Once they 're posted , the community – in Reddit 's case , several hundred thousand strong , from all over the world – votes , up or down , posting comments and creating conversation around the posting .
If you 're voted up , your story climbs the list and entrenches itself in the community 's sightlines .
Voted down , or not voted at all , and the story freefalls into oblivion .
Adam has been good at staying on top .
He clicks on a listing of top users – those with the most " up " votes , which result in karma points – Reddit 's measure of success .
" I 'm here , " he says , sweeping the mouse to the top of the screen .
Number 8 . " Not bad , " he says , smiling shyly .
To some , it may seem that Adam is a particularly engaged hobbyist .
He 's interested in information , its churn , and , of course , the rush of competition .
Eight months ago , he and two friends joined Reddit at the same time .
His choices skyrocketed , while the others foundered .
" I got 500 karma right away , and they started saying ` Adam , find us some stories to post . ' "
In the end , his friends gave up .
" They did n't want to compete with me , " he smiles .
But Adam is also a member of an Internet vanguard which is helping , through its own naïve enthusiasm , to impose structure on a rapidly expanding , increasingly chaotic Internet universe .
" At the beginning , I did n't think anyone would vote for my articles , " he says .
He was quickly proven wrong , as he climbed user charts and stayed there for months .
When the Wall Street Journal , in a story about the Net 's most influential players , recently revealed his age , there was a furor online .
" Is Adam Fuhrer fictional ?
Is someone at the WSJ playing with our heads ? " wrote one user , laprice .
" Do n't believe a word of it , " wrote jamal , another user .
" BUT he is 21 , not 12 . "
An understandable , if entirely incorrect , assessment .
( Adam 's bar mitzvah is in June . )
" I just kind of sat back .
There was a lot of controversy , " he said .
As the social bookmarking realm has grown , it has gone – like many things online – from community to corporate concern .
CondéNet , the online division of publishing giant Condé Nast , recently acquired Reddit ; Del.icio.us is owned by Yahoo !
The anonymity of the users raises an ongoing Internet controversy :
Who is directing traffic on the Web – and why ?
Marketing companies already have their hooks into Digg , promising they can place clients on the site 's front page .
To do so requires those companies to pay off Digg users to vote up content , reducing the community 's like - minded conversation to a sales pitch .
( Digg and its brethren say they can police these pushes . )
As these sites mature into media phenomena in their own right , there is a resistance to over - regulate what was born as an open , egalitarian model .
" It 's been a wild experience , really , " says Alexis Ohanian , the 23 - year - old co-founder of Reddit .
So far , the corporate parent has allowed the community to evolve naturally .
" We have a motto here – let the users do the hard stuff , " Ohanian says .
The original concept – self - policing , democratic community , built on common interests , still holds .
For now , at least .
At his desk , Adam scans his reader , clicking through links , looking for things to post .
He clicks one , and considers " House Creates Special Global Warming Committee , " from the U.S. Congress , then dismisses it .
He eschews hockey news , despite his own interest .
" People in Europe , or Asia do n't care about that .
They wo n't read it , " he says .
Nor will they vote on it , costing him valuable karma points .
He 's always looking for the home run – like the sinkhole , which scored him nearly 700 points .
( Anna Nicole vs. Scooter Libby garnered a respectable 168 . )
He settles on a story about Adobe Photoshop introducing image authentification , in response to a handful of photojournalistic images that were revealed to be doctored in the past year .
But Adam is drawn less to the news than to the image that accompanies it : a diver climbing a rope ladder into a hovering helicopter beneath the Golden Gate bridge – and the massive great white shark leaping up to make a snack of him .
The image is dramatic , funny , and clearly doctored .
" People click on pictures – which is funny , because it's ` Reddit , ' " he says , and posts it quickly .
Gerald watches with bemused pride .
" At first , I was thinking , ` What 's he doing up there ? ' " he says .
" Now , I tell everyone I know .
I mean , it 's crazy , right ?
He can find these subjects that start conversations that go for a thousand posts .
" He may start a conversation that changes the way someone thinks about something , and that 's really interesting . "
Mrs. M. is adamant .
People are saying her left side is paralyzed , and she knows they are wrong .
Several days ago the 76 - year - old Californian suffered a stroke .
She now sits in a wheelchair while a doctor in a crisp cream - colored suit bends over her , asking questions .
She answers them with perfect coherence .
Does she know where she is ?
Yes , she is in a hospital , brought here by her daughter .
Does she know what day of the week it is ?
Of course .
It is Tuesday afternoon .
Then the doctor starts in again about her hands .
Can she use her right hand ?
Yes .
Her left ?
Yes , of course .
He asks her to use her right hand to point to a student who is taking notes , and she obliges .
He asks her to point to the student with her left hand instead .
This time she does n’t move .
Mrs. M. , why did n’t you point ?
asks the doctor .
For the first time , she hesitates .
Because I did n’t want to , she answers .
In fact , fibers in the motor cortex on the right side of her brain , which controls movement on her left side , have been irreparably damaged by the stroke , and she will never use her left arm again .
But Mrs. M. is not a stubborn old woman refusing to admit a difficult truth .
A few minutes later Mrs. M. looks at her left hand , resting inertly in her lap .
Doctor , she asks , whose hand is this ?
Whose hand do you think it is ?
Well , it certainly is n’t mine !
Then whose is it ?
It is my son ’s hand , Doctor .
Mrs. M.’s claim would be peculiar enough if her son were in the room , but he is miles away , unaware that in his mother ’s mind his hand has become attached to her arm .
Mrs. M. is suffering from a condition called anosognosia , which sometimes appears when a stroke has cut off blood being supplied to the brain through the middle cerebral artery .
The stroke damages regions in the brain ’s right hemisphere that include a territory called the right parietal cortex , a patch of neurons about two - thirds of the way back along the brain .
The two parietal cortices ( there is one in the left hemisphere also ) are known to be involved in directing the brain ’s attention to movements , objects , and sensations on the opposite side of the body , as well as in the perception of that entire side of the body in space .
While otherwise clearheaded , patients with damage to the right parietal cortex are unable -- not just unwilling -- to acknowledge the radical change that has overcome the left side of their body .
( The term anosognosia derives from nosos and gnosis , the Greek words for disease and knowledge . )
One of the best - known victims of the condition was Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas , who suffered a right - hemisphere stroke in 1974 that paralyzed his left side and eventually forced his retirement .
He initially dismissed the paralysis as a myth , and weeks later he was still inviting reporters to go on hiking expeditions with him .
When one visitor asked about his left leg , he claimed that he had recently been kicking 40 - yard field goals with it in the exercise room and soon planned to try out for the Washington Redskins .
Mrs. M. ’s form of anosognosia is even more extreme : she not only flatly denies she is paralyzed , she refuses to admit that the limp limb on the left has anything at all to do with her .
One such anosognosiac became so incensed that somebody else ’s leg was cluttering up his hospital bed that he heaved the thing out and was subsequently amazed to find himself on the floor .
Another claimed that the arm on the left belonged to his daughter , who was trying to seduce him .
We are used to thinking of our bodies as our selves , says Vilayanur Ramachandran -- the inquisitive doctor in the cream - colored suit .
Something has gone wrong here that calls that fundamental truth into question .
Anosognosia is a fleeting condition , in most cases fading away within two weeks of the stroke that caused it .
In the interim , however , patients like Mrs. M. may provide a window through which we can glimpse how we all perceive reality , how our minds organize and cope with the cognitive blitz of everyday life .
While most of us have no trouble fessing up to ownership of our various body parts , we all are sometimes willfully ignorant of signals our bodies send to our brains -- there might , for example , be a tiny twinge of ankle pain that we ’d rather not notice just before that weekend tennis game .
In a new theory , Ramachandran claims that anosognosia can help explain why , how , and even where in the brain such everyday denials take place and how we combine them into a representation of the world around us .
If he is right , this theory may also shed light on the function of dreams , and even on the mechanisms of memory itself .
Looking at patients like Mrs. M. can be spooky at first , says Ramachandran , a neuroscientist and physician at the University of California at San Diego , and the Salk Institute nearby .
But then you realize you ’re really looking at yourself , in amplified form .
Ramachandran has made a career out of using spooky phenomena to reveal the workings of the brain .
With optical illusions , he has explored the neural circuitry of vision .
More recently he helped track down the neural basis for phantom limb , the sensation that most amputees have that their lost arms or legs are still attached to their bodies .
His findings helped illuminate how the brain restructures itself during learning .
From patients who feel phantom arms in the empty space beyond their shoulders , it was a logical step to look next at patients who denied arms that were indisputably real .
Ramachandran was unsatisfied by the two conventional explanations for the rending of body image demonstrated by anosognosiacs .
The first is Freudian : to protect the ego against the appalling truth that one side of the body has been rendered permanently senseless , the mind simply refuses to admit to the facts at hand .
But patients with paralysis caused by stroke in the left parietal cortex rarely deny their condition .
Why should only people with right - brain stroke need to protect their egos from the truth ?
The second explanation is more neurological and less psychoanalytic : anosognosia is a special case of a more general syndrome that textbooks refer to as unilateral neglect .
Some stroke patients with damage to the right parietal cortex fail to recognize anything in the left side of their perceptual domain .
If they are asked to follow an examiner ’s finger as he moves it across their visual field from right to left , their eyes track the finger up to the midpoint , then stop .
Patients with unilateral neglect may eat food from only the right - hand side of a plate , or shave only the right side of the face .
Anosognosiacs like Mrs. M. often exhibit such behavior , too .
Perhaps they are simply neglecting their paralysis in the same way they disregard everything else on the left side .
Clearly the two phenomena seem related .
Yet Ramachandran thinks this explanation , too , leaves much unaccounted for .
Patients with neglect will ignore an object in the left side of the visual sphere , but they will readily acknowledge the object if their attention is drawn to it -- if , for example , an examiner wiggles his finger in the neglected side of their visual domain and says , Now do you see it ?
Anosognosiacs , on the other hand , do not passively ignore their paralysis ; they actively deny it , in spite of their complete inability to move .
If pressed to account for such a conflicting state of affairs , they remain silent or try to explain it away , often concocting elaborate stories or chillingly surreal rationalizations .
Neuroscientist Edoardo Bisiach at the University of Milan in Italy reported one 74 - year - old stroke patient who repeatedly claimed that his left hand belonged to the doctor examining him .
The doctor finally grasped the paralyzed hand between his own two and held it up to the patient ’s face .
Whose hands are these ?
he asked .
Your hands , the patient replied .
How many of them ?
Three .
Ever seen a man with three hands ?
the doctor asked .
A hand is the extremity of an arm , said the patient .
Since you have three arms , it follows that you must have three hands .
There is more going on here than simply an indifference to or neglect of the left side of the body , says Ramachandran .
And that ’s what ’s crying out for an explanation .
One explanation might be that anosognosiacs only appear to be ignorant of their paralysis while in fact they are fully aware of what has happened but for some reason do not wish to express it .
To test this hypothesis , Ramachandran devised a devilish experiment .
He presented Mrs. M. and two other elderly stroke victims with a simple choice .
They could win themselves a small box of candy or some other trivial reward by completing a task requiring one hand , such as fastening a large nut onto a bolt mounted on a heavy base or stacking some blocks .
Alternatively , they could earn a much larger box of candy by successfully finishing an easy activity requiring two hands , such as tying a bow or cutting a circle out of paper with scissors .
All three subjects exhibited neglect and denied the paralysis on their left side , but they were otherwise alert and aware of their physical condition .
( One even responded to the choice by chiding , I am diabetic , Doctor .
I do n’t eat candy .
You should know that !
)
For control subjects Ramachandran chose two stroke patients who were also recently paralyzed on the left side by stroke and showed clear signs of neglect but no trace of anosognosia .
As might be expected , the controls unhesitatingly chose to obtain the small box of candy by performing the task requiring only one hand , expressing surprise that anyone would even present them with such a choice since the two - handed tasks were obviously beyond their ability .
But in 15 out of 16 trials , the anosognosiacs opted to try to win the large box of candy .
After fumbling feebly with the laces or scissors , they would remain silent or offer some excuse for their failure .
( I guess my arthritis is acting up .
Oh , I ’ve never been very ambidextrous . )
Curiously , they never seemed to learn from their previous botched attempts or even remember them from one trial to the next .
It ’s very strange , says Ramachandran .
No matter how often they failed , they never showed any sense of surprise or frustration .
The inextinguishable faith in their two - handed abilities seemed to indicate that if the anosognosiacs knew they were paralyzed , that knowledge lay deep , buried well below the level where it could be freely accessed by their conscious mind .
Yet certain things they said hinted at tacit knowledge of their condition , meaning that the information had been recorded in some part of the brain , whether or not it was immediately available .
After failing repeatedly at the bimanual task of tying a shoelace , Mrs. R. , a former journalist who was now in her seventies , later told a student that the nice Indian doctor asked me to tie a lace , and I did it , with both hands .
Normal , unparalyzed people do n’t feel the need to draw attention to the fact that they can use both hands ; they just do it , says Ramachandran .
As Shakespeare said , ‘ The lady doth protest too much . ’
To probe the depth of that tacit knowledge , Ramachandran made use of an experiment performed earlier by Bisiach and his colleagues .
They had temporarily reduced the symptoms of an anosognosiac by the simple means of pouring a small amount of cold water in her ear .
The treatment was n’t as far - fetched as it might sound .
In addition to hearing , our ears function as our gyroscopes .
They house fluid - filled canals lined with microscopic hairs that sense acceleration ; this information is transmitted through nerves known as the vestibular system to different parts of the brain .
Some of these parts direct our bodies to make the adjustments needed to maintain our balance .
Other parts , like the parietal cortices , are responsible for letting our eyes steadily track moving objects .
To do so , they need to have information about how our bodies are moving in space -- thus the connection between the vestibular system and the parietal cortices , and the basis for Bisiach ’s seemingly bizarre treatment .
Bisiach ’s patient , a right - brain stroke victim in her eighties , claimed that her arm belonged to her mother , who had apparently left it behind in the bed when she was discharged from the hospital .
When Bisiach poured cold water in the woman ’s left ear , her overstimulated vestibular system began to send confused signals to her brain , which concluded that her head was turning , and after a few minutes she involuntarily began moving her eyes rapidly back and forth to compensate - - a process known as nystagmus .
The patient was asked again whom the arm belonged to , and this time she admitted that it was her own .
Bisiach ran a series of cold - water trials and found that it took anywhere from 15 seconds to two hours for the effect of the cold water to wear off .
But once it did , the woman would invariably lapse back into the eerily unconcerned delusion that her arm was her mother’s .
Look , it ’s queer , but that ’s how it is , she said .
Ramachandran decided to try Bisiach ’s experiment on Mrs. M. Working with fellow San Diego neuroscientists Leah Levi and Lance Stone , he poured cold water into her left ear and waited until the rapid eye movement of nystagmus appeared .
Asked to identify the owner of the arm lying in her lap , she stated that it was hers , of course .
She also acknowledged that the arm was paralyzed .
When Ramachandran asked her how long she had been in that condition , she accurately replied that she had been unable to move her arm for several days .
Remarkably , it seemed that all the time Mrs. M. had been denying her paralysis , the knowledge of it was nevertheless being recorded in her brain .
Yet when the effect of the cold water wore off several hours later , she not only reverted to denying the paralysis , she had no recollection of ever having come out of that state of denial .
It was as if there were two completely separate Mrs. M.’s : an anosognosiac version who was convinced that she was perfectly able to move her arm , and a cold - water version who acknowledged her paralysis but expressed total ignorance that she had ever denied it .
The curious effect of the cold water on Mrs. M. fit neatly into a hypothesis brewing in Ramachandran ’s own mind .
At any given moment in our waking lives , our brains are flooded with information pouring in from various senses , all of which has to be fitted coherently into a perspective that ’s based on what our stored memories already tell us is true about the world .
In order to act , the brain must have some way of selecting from this superabundance of detail and ordering it into a consistent belief system , a story that makes sense of the available evidence .
But what happens when the information arriving from some source conflicts with the existing plot ?
If the conflicting information is only mildly important , one easy response might be to just ignore it .
The twinge of pain in the ankle of that weekend tennis player , for instance , does not jibe with the reports received from other joints and muscles , much less with his senses ’ appreciation of the glorious sunny day and his memory of last week ’s exciting game .
To keep the story consistent and intact , his brain edits out the information coming from pain receptors in the ankle .
He might deny to himself that the pain exists , or he could rationalize it to fit with the prevailing belief system , perhaps by telling himself it will go away as soon as he loosens up .
As an analogy , think of a military general in a war room , planning for a battle , says Ramachandran .
He would ordinarily collect evidence from a large number of scouts , add it all up , and arrive at a decision on what to do next .
Let ’s say the information from his scouts led him to call for an attack the next morning .
But just before the scheduled attack , imagine one more scout arrives and tells him that he has underestimated the enemy ’s strength by a quarter .
Even though that new information contradicts everything else he has been told , the general cannot afford to rethink the whole decision .
Instead , he simply ignores the report from the new scout or tells him to get in line with what everybody else is thinking .
He may even tell him to lie in order to preserve troop morale .
Ramachandran describes this metaphoric general -- who roughly corresponds to Freud ’s concept of the ego -- as a die - hard conservative coping with reality by promoting the status quo and denying or rationalizing away any information that threatens it , in the interest of preserving stability .
Such everyday defense mechanisms are not really maladaptive : they keep the brain from being hounded into directionless indecision by the sheer number of possible stories that might be written from the material available from the senses .
Frequently , however , new , conflicting reports arrive that are too critical to ignore .
If a scout presents a general with last - minute news that the enemy possesses nuclear weapons , it would be disastrous for the commander to carry on according to the existing plan .
Likewise , the weekend tennis player can deny knowledge of his sensitive ankle without penalty , up to a point .
If the pain receptors in his ankle are commanding attention whenever he puts weight on the leg , to ignore them would defeat the purpose of having pain receptors in the first place .
Instead , the tennis player abandons the prevailing story -- Tennis anyone ?-- and constructs a completely new one in line with the undeniable truth shooting up his leg from his ankle :
Better rest up this week .
To balance the conservative , maintain - the - status - quo strategy of the general , there must therefore be another decision maker , an anomaly detector , as Ramachandran calls it .
The anomaly detector ’s job is to constantly evaluate the general ’s official story , decide when the conflict between the old belief system and new information passes a certain threshold , and then intervene , destroying the official story and working with the general to write a new one .
Mrs. M. ’s anomaly detector has fallen asleep at the post .
Her brain endeavors to construct a plausible story about her body image according to the evidence received from various sensory systems , just like a normal brain .
But then a radically conflicting report arrives , one that a normal brain would quickly perceive as too anomalous to fit into preexisting beliefs .
( I am telling my hand to move , and it is not responding ! )
Since the anomaly detector is not doing its job , however , the incongruous information is swallowed into the existing story , and Mrs. M. ’s brain fails to recognize its incompatibility .
The general is free to file away the tragic news of her paralysis , maintaining the status quo with a blanket of denials , rationalizations , and confabulations that can accommodate even the most bizarre conflict because there is nothing holding it up to scrutiny .
Since we know which part of the brain is disabled in anosognosia , the curious delusions of a damaged mind may thus provide the means to anchor the airy abstractions of Freudian psychology in the physical flesh of the brain .
In Ramachandran ’s scenario , the story - building of the conservative general -- Freud ’s ego -- largely involves the left side of the brain , where the language centers called Broca ’s area and Wernicke ’s area are also located .
Challenging the general ’s story , on the other hand , can take place only in a healthy right hemisphere .
So according to his theory , when Ramachandran poured cold water into Mrs. M. ’s left ear , and by means of the vestibular system stimulated brain areas in her right hemisphere , he reawakened the anomaly detector , which promptly saw that the general ’s story had been clearly outrageous for several days .
She was then able to grasp the reality of her condition until the cold - water stimulation faded and the anomaly detector went back to sleep .
Does that mean the anomaly detector actually resides in the right parietal cortex - - an area known to be damaged in anosognosiacs like Mrs. M.?
It would be unreasonable to suggest that such a complex cognitive function exists in some precise location in the brain , Ramachandran says .
But given the breakdown in anomaly detection shown in anosognosia , it would seem that the parietal cortex and associated areas damaged by the stroke are somehow involved .
A key question to resolve is whether the extreme denials of anosognosiacs represent a breakdown in anomaly detection in general or are only an isolated aberration specific to how they perceive their bodies .
One circumstantial hint that Ramachandran has tapped into a global process is a certain common pattern in stroke victims .
Patients with right - brain stroke damage , even those who do n’t exhibit anosognosia , often appear oddly oblivious to illness or other problems , carelessly shrugging off news that they have a malignant tumor or that a loved one has been in a serious accident .
Since the right side of the brain is commonly thought of as the emotional hemisphere , such blasé responses have previously been considered a result of the stroke ’s suppression of emotional circuits .
Ramachandran ’s model suggests instead that the affected circuits are involved with anomaly detection : the patients do not react to disturbing information , because their active left - brain circuits have filed it away as too threatening to the status quo , and no complementary critique of that action takes place in the right hemisphere of the brain .
Meanwhile , it is common for victims of stroke in the left side of the brain to suffer a contrary fate .
Far from denying their illness and problems , they dwell on them , their obsession with all that is wrong spiraling down into deep depression .
In the global model Ramachandran envisions , these people have no left - brain general operating to smooth over life ’s difficulties by repressing information .
Instead , they struggle to attend to every unpleasant detail .
Ramachandran plans several lines of research to test his hypothesis experimentally .
One is already under way : he is studying the responses of anosognosiacs to a situation in which sensory information about their arm has been intentionally brought into conflict .
The experiment makes use of a trick wooden chamber .
The subject ’s hand is placed in the box through a hole in the front , and the subject looks down on it through a hole in the top .
Unbeknownst to her , however , the box contains another hole in the rear and a system of mirrors that enables a hidden accomplice of the examiner to extend a hand into the box from behind a partition .
The mirrors substitute an image of the accomplice ’s hand for the subject ’s .
( Both hands are gloved , to mask the deception . )
The examiner can then tell the patient to move her hand or keep it still , at the same time giving a surreptitious cue to the accomplice to do just the opposite .
The subject ’s visual system thus receives one message while at the same time her sense of body position and movement is sending a completely conflicting one .
In a recent trial , an anosognosiac ’s paralyzed left hand was placed in the box , and she was asked to watch her hand and move it to the beats of a metronome .
The accomplice was given a cue , and the hand in the box began to move accordingly .
On the first trial , the patient ’s response left everyone utterly perplexed .
Not only did she show no surprise at seeing her hand moving up and down , she denied seeing any hand at all .
When Ramachandran repeatedly asked her what she saw , she admitted that the box was not empty .
But there was definitely no hand inside .
There was a wedding cake .
Though it is only guesswork , Ramachandran believes that in response to such a bizarre mix of signals , her brain simply canceled all inputs and substituted a hallucination in their place .
In a later trial , a different patient reported that her left hand moved when she was asked to move it , a result that might be expected given her professed denial of her paralysis .
But then Ramachandran asked her to place her good right hand in the box instead and move it .
Once again she said she could see the hand moving -- even though his accomplice was keeping her hand still .
Thus the patient was patently denying an obvious truth that had little to do with the left - side paralysis itself -- an indication , perhaps , that the functions damaged by the stroke involved more than the specific circuits concerned with the left side of the body .
The minute there was a discrepancy in the existing story , she tried to make it fit , because her anomaly detector was n’t there to catch it , says Ramachandran .
To better test whether the anomaly detector is global or specific to body image -- or whether it exists at all -- Ramachandran plans a series of experiments using a brain scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging , which can pinpoint areas of the brain activated by stimuli .
It would be extremely suggestive , for instance , if part of the right parietal cortex implicated in anosognosia was activated when normal subjects detected the anomaly in an object quickly glimpsed , such as a flashed image of a red ace of spades .
Until Ramachandran has a chance to use this high - priced imaging equipment , though , he is the first to admit that his theory of the nature of mind is highly speculative .
But he does n’t mind speculating further .
Much of his reasoning hangs on the mysteriously therapeutic effect of cold water poured into an anosognosiac ’s ear .
The most common explanation for this phenomenon follows from the view that anosognosia is a manifestation of unilateral neglect , wherein the stroke - damaged patient ignores all that is happening on the left side of the perceptual domain .
It could be that the shock delivered to the vestibular system by the cold water jump - starts the right parietal cortex , enabling the patient to again pay attention to everything on her left side , including her paralysis .
Ramachandran finds this answer unsatisfying for the same reason he balks at attributing anosognosia to neglect in the first place : the patient is n’t simply ignoring her paralysis , she is adamantly denying it .
He believes instead that the cold - water stimulation triggers circuits in the parietal cortex involved in anomaly detection , allowing a patient like Mrs. M. to perceive the glaring discrepancy between her belief that she can move and the sensory evidence that she patently cannot .
While the cold water ’s effect on the vestibular system is no doubt implicated in Mrs. M. ’s recovery of perception , what fascinates Ramachandran is the rapid eye movement that accompanies this sudden release from denial .
What if her apprehension of the disturbing truth of paralysis was linked to another context in which rapid eye movement appears just as repressed information is allowed to well up to the surface ?
There is only one state in normal life where your eyes move back and forth and you pull up unpleasant memories and disturbing beliefs about yourself , he says , and that is the REM , or rapid eye movement , sleep that produces dreams .
According to Ramachandran , while we are awake the left - hemisphere general is working hectically - - selecting , ordering , and repressing information to produce a coherent story for subsequent action .
Our anomaly detector intervenes only at critical junctures , since the brain ’s story has to be consolidated under the constant pressure to respond to new stimuli .
As a result , some information may end up being repressed that might actually prove useful in the future .
In REM sleep , the brain can review these buried perceptions and memories of the past and rehearse them on the risk - free stage of dreams -- what Ramachandran calls nature ’s own virtual reality .
If the information still cannot be accommodated under existing beliefs , the material is repressed again , unless the dreamer happens to be awakened accidentally and temporarily glimpses the script in progress .
But we remember very little of our dreaming .
Most of it , Ramachandran suggests , is comfortably and invisibly integrated into the belief system supported by the conscious mind , which in the process becomes progressively more liberated from unnecessary defenses .
At the risk of pushing the metaphor too far , Ramachandran says , imagine the general during the day , in the heat of battle .
He does n’t have time to review the contrary reports from every scout who comes in , so he shoves them into file drawers marked Top Secret .
When he has a chance to relax late at night , he takes some of these files out of the drawer and gives them a second look .
The anomaly detector joins the general over drinks , as it were , and shows him where the files dangerously contradict the official story .
In my view , this is what is happening each time you dream .
You open your top - secret files and psychoanalyze yourself , deciding which memories to repress and which to uncover .
The link between the cold - water confessions of an anosognosiac and the normal function of dreams in REM sleep is still hypothetical .
Curiously , however , the currently popular therapy called EMDR ( Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing ) relies on the purported ability of the therapist to relieve the distress of repressed traumatic memories by focusing the patient ’s eyes on a finger waved rapidly back and forth .
Ramachandran does not actively support or plan to use the therapy on anosognosiacs , but he finds the coincidence with his own hypothesis intriguing .
We ’re not saying that putting cold water in somebody ’s ear makes them dream , he says .
But perhaps the stimulation mimics REM and some of the phenomena that happen during dreaming , one of which is this dredging up of unpleasant memories .
His plan to test this aspect of his theory is simple : he intends to awaken anosognosiacs from REM sleep and ask about their dreams .
In contrast to Freud ’s notion that dreams are wish fulfillments , Ramachandran ’s idea predicts that anosognosiacs should dream that they are paralyzed , since during REM their anomaly detector should be reawakened .
It may even be that dreams cure anosognosia .
By reviving the anomaly detector night after night , an anosognosiac integrates the fact of paralysis into his or her belief system over several days .
Ramachandran plans to conduct the same low - tech experiment on victims of anterograde amnesia , in which brain trauma destroys the individual ’s capacity to form long - term memories after the injury occurred .
Anterograde amnesiacs are equally forgetful of emotionally neutral information , such as a list of words , and major circumstances in their lives , such as the identity of people whom they ’ve met since their injury .
Even attending physicians have to reintroduce themselves to anterograde amnesiacs every time they enter their presence -- as if they had never met before .
According to Ramachandran ’s hypothesis , these amnesiacs may have lost the capacity to consolidate any information into a working story in the left side of their brains .
Instead , their generals indiscriminately file all inputs into drawers marked TOP SECRET , where they cannot be accessed by the conscious mind .
Since these are the drawers that are opened during REM sleep , an amnesiac awakened while dreaming might be able to recover memory of some recent events .
In any case , it ’s worth a try .
My colleagues would give this idea maybe a 10 percent chance of being right , Ramachandran says .
I ’d give it 30 to 40 percent .
But even if I ’m wrong about the entire theory , it does suggest some interesting directions , does n’t it ?
Who would have thought to wake up amnesiacs and ask them about their dreams ?
Mark Finkle suggested that I do some speed testing , now that a native implementation of getElements ByClassName has landed in the Mozilla trunk ( destined for Firefox 3 ) .
So I went around and dug up all of the different , existing , implementations that I could find .
Currently , implementations fall into one of three categories ( with some straddling more than one ) :
Pure DOM
This usually involves a calls to .getElementsByClassName ( " * " ) and traversing through all matched elements , analyzing each element ’s className attribute along the way .
Generally , the fastest method is to use a pre-compiled RegExp to test the value of the className attribute .

DOM Tree Walker
Is a less - popular means of traversing DOM documents by setting some simple parameters , as specified by the DOM Level 2 Spec .
For example , you could traverse through all text nodes in a document ( something that you ca n’t easily do in any other way ) .

For example , you could traverse through all text nodes in a document ( something that you ca n’t easily do in any other way ) .
XPath
The most recent technique , to be popularized , was the use of XPath to find elements by classname .
The implementation is generally simple : Building a single expressions and letting the XPath engine traverse through the document , finding all the relevant elements .
I ’ve chosen some implementations that were representative of each of these techniques .
An implementation using the DOM Level 2 Tree Walker methods .
Builds a generic filter function and traverses through all elements .
document.getElementsByClass = function ( needle ) { function acceptNode ( node ) { if ( node.hasAttribute ( " class " ) ) { var c = " " + node.className + " " ; if ( c.indexOf ( " " + needle + " " ) != - 1 ) return NodeFilter .FILTER_ACCEPT
; } return NodeFilter .FILTER_SKIP ; } var treeWalker = document.createTreeWalker(document.documentElement , NodeFilter .
SHOW_ELEMENT , acceptNode , true ) ; var outArray = new Array ( ) ; if ( treeWalker ) { var node = treeWalker.nextNode ( ) ; while ( node ) { outArray.push ( node ) ; node = treeWalker.nextNode ( ) ; } } return outArray ; }
Uses a pure DOM implementation , tries to make some optimizations for Internet Explorer .
function getElementsByClassName( oElm , strTagName , strClassName ) { var arrElements = ( strTagName == " * " && oElm.all ) ?
o Elm.all : oElm.getElementsByTagName(strTagName ) ; var arrReturnElements = new Array ( ) ; strClassName = strClassName.replace(/\-/g , " \\ - " ) ; var oRegExp = new RegExp ( " ( ^|\\s ) " + strClassName + " ( \\s | $ ) " ) ; var oElement ; for ( var i=0 ; i<arrElements.length ; i++) {
oElement = arrElements [i ] ; if ( oRegExp.test(oElement.className ) ) { arrReturnElements.push ( oElement ) ; } } return ( arrReturnElements ) }[ /js ] < h3 >< a href = " http://www.dustindiaz.com/getelementsbyclass ">
Dustin Diaz's getElementsByClass</a></h3 >
A pure DOM implementation , caches the regexp , and is generally quite simple and easy to use .
function getElementsByClass( searchClass , node , tag ) { var classElements = new Array ( ) ; if ( node == null ) node = document ; if ( tag == null ) tag = '*' ; var els = node.getElementsByTagName( tag ) ; var elsLen = els.length ; var pattern = new RegExp ( " ( ^|\\s ) " + searchClass + " ( \\s | $ ) " ) ; for ( i = 0 , j = 0 ; i < elsLen ; i++ ) { if ( pattern.test(els[i].className ) ) { classElements [ j ] = els[i ] ; j++ ; } } return classElements ; }[ /js ] < h3 > < a href = " http://prototypejs.org/ "
>Prototype 1.5.0</a> ( XPath ) </h3 >
Mixes an XPath and DOM implementation ; using XPath wherever possible .
document.getElementsByClassName = function ( className , parentElement ) { if ( Prototype.BrowserFeatures .XPath ) { var q = ".//*[contains( concat(' ' , @class , ' ' ) , ' " + className + " ' ) ] " ; return document._getElementsByXPath( q , parentElement ) ; } else { var children = ( $( parentElement ) || document.body ).getElementsByTagName('*' ) ; var elements = [ ] , child ; for ( var i = 0 , length = children.
length ; i < length ; i++) { child = children [ i ] ; if ( Element.hasClassName( child , className ) ) elements.push(Element.extend( child ) ) ; } return elements ; } } ; [ / js ] < h3 > < a href = " https://johnresig.com/blog/getelementsbyclassname-in-firefox-3/ "
>Native , Firefox 3</a></h3 >
A native implementation , written in C++ ; is a part of the current CVS version of Firefox , will be included in Firefox 3 .
document.getElementsByClassName
The Speed Results
For the speed tests I copied the Yahoo homepage into a single HTML file and used that as the test bed .
They make good use of class names ( both single and multiple ) and is a considerably large file with lots of elements to consider .
You can find the test files , for each of the implementations , here :
https://johnresig.com/apps/classname/
Note : “ XPath ” is just Prototype ’s implementation .
From these figures we can see that the native implementation of getElements ByClassName , in Firefox 3 , is a full 8 x faster than the XPath implementation .
Additionally , it ’s a stunning 77 x faster than the fastest DOM implementation .
Note :
These numbers have been revised from what was originally posted as the lazy - loading nature of document .
getElementsByClassName was n’t taken into account .
The resulting arrays are completely looped - through now , making sure that all elements are accounted for .
Currently , Prototype has the best general - use implementation : Use XPath selectors wherever possible , fall back to fast DOM parsing .
Interestingly , only Prototype actually tries to implement the document .
getElementsByClassName interface ( all others do one - off names ) .
However , Prototype does n’t check to see if the document .
getElementsByClassName property already exists , and completely overwrites the , incredibly fast , native implementation that Firefox 3 provides ( oops ! ) .
In all , the results are quite astounding .
The native implementation is absolutely much faster than anything I could ’ve imagined .
It completely decimates all the other pieces of code .
I ca n’t wait until this hits the general public – users will , absolutely , feel a significant increase in speed .

China wants the games to be its showcase to the world
The flame will be carried through 20 cities in five continents on its journey from Olympia in Greece .
But self - ruling Taiwan , seen by China as part of its territory , has rejected its inclusion on the route , seeing it as an attempt to downgrade its status .
And the inclusion of Tibet , ruled by China since it invaded in 1950 , is likely to provoke protests abroad .
Officials also unveiled the new Olympic torch , a red and silver design shaped like a Chinese scroll .
The 72 cm ( 28 - inch ) high torch is designed to withstand wind and rain , and is also eco-friendly , officials said .
The torch will arrive in Beijing in time for the Olympics opening ceremony on 8 August next year .
Taiwan objection
At a ceremony in Beijing , International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said the torch relay would " be a journey of harmony , friendship and respect to people of different nationalities races and creeds " .
Liu Qi , head of Beijing 's Olympic organising committee , said the route would " cover the longest distance and be the most inclusive " in Olympic history .
But officials in Taiwan were not happy that the planned route would have seen the torch visit Taipei followed by stops in Hong Kong and Macau .
" This route is a domestic route that constitutes an attempt to downgrade our sovereignty , " said Tsai Chen - wei , the chairman of Taiwan 's Olympic Committee .
" It is something that the government and people cannot accept . "
While many in Taiwan are said to be keen for the torch to come , some fear that if the route directly links the island with China it would appear to endorse Beijing 's view that Taiwan is part of its territory .
Everest protest
The highlight of the 137,000 km ( 85,000 - mile ) journey is expected to be the torch 's planned ascent in May of the world 's highest mountain , Everest , which straddles the border between Tibet and Nepal .
But its path through Tibet may trigger protests from critics of Beijing 's rule .
China invaded Tibet in 1950 and its spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , lives in exile in India .
Four US activists were arrested on Everest on Wednesday after unfurling a banner calling for Tibet 's independence as Chinese climbers were carrying out relay assessments .
They were still believed to be in detention on Thursday .
China said it was investigating the incident and warned foreign citizens against engaging in " activities concerning the sovereignty and unity of China " .
The flame will be lit on 25 March in Greece at the site of the ancient Olympics .
It will then be carried by a series of athletes , celebrities and specially - chosen members of the public to Beijing .

The FLAMERS BIBLE
Origin : Unknown ( actually , I wrote the first one a few months ago , but I thought " origin : unknown " looks cool )
Revision 1 : Dec. 2 , 1987 by Joe Talmadge
In the time I have been posting to net , I have encountered flame wars of epic proportions ( Brahms Gang vs. Tim Maroney ) , and flame wars of a more modest nature ( MIT vs. CIT ) .
Flaming has evolved into a highly - stylized art form , complete with unwritten rules and guidelines .
Here , I have attempted to document the Art of Flaming , in such a way as it will be interesting to old hands ( flame masters ) and novices ( virgins ) alike .
Without a further ado , then , I present :
The twelve commandments of flaming
Make things up about your opponent :
It 's important to make your lies sound true .
Preface your argument with the word " clearly . "
" Clearly , Fred Flooney is a liar , and a dirtball to boot . "
Be an armchair psychologist :
You 're a smart person .
You 've heard of Freud .
You took a psychology course in college .
Clearly , you 're qualified to psychoanalyze your opponent .
" Polly Purebread , by using the word ' zucchini ' in her posting , shows she has a bad case of penis envy . "
Cross - post your flames : Everyone on the net is just waiting for the next literary masterpiece to leave your terminal .
From rec.arts.wobegon to alt.gourmand , they 're all holding their breaths until your next flame .
Therefore , post everywhere .
Conspiracies abound :
If everyone 's against you , the reason can't possibly be that you 're a fuckhead .
There 's obviously a conspiracy against you , and you will be doing the entire net a favor by exposing it .
Lawsuit threats :
This is the reverse of Rule # 4 ( sort of like the Yin & Yang of flaming ) .
Threatening a lawsuit is always considered to be in good form .
" By saying that I 've posted to the wrong group , Bertha has libeled me , slandered me , and sodomized me .
See you in court , Bertha . "
Force them to document their claims : Even if Harry Hoinkus states outright that he likes tomato sauce on his pasta , you should demand documentation .
If Newsweek has n't written an article on Harry 's pasta preferences , then Harry 's obviously lying .
Use foreign phrases : French is good , but Latin is the lingua franca of flaming .
You should use the words " ad hominem " at least three times per article .
Other favorite Latin phrases are " ad nauseum , " " vini , vidi , vici , " and " fetuccini alfredo . "
Tell 'em how smart you are :
Why use intelligent arguments to convince them you 're smart when all you have to do is tell them ?
State that you 're a member of Mensa or Mega or Dorks of America .
Tell them the scores you received on every exam since high school .
" I got an 800 on my SATs , LSATs , GREs , MCATs , and I can also spell the word ' premeiotic ' . "
Accuse your opponent of censorship .
It is your right as an American citizen to post whatever the hell you want to the net ( as guaranteed by the 37th Amendment , I think ) .
Anyone who tries to limit your cross-posting or move a flame war to email is either a communist , a fascist , or both .
Doubt their existence :
You 've never actually seen your opponent , have you ?
And since you 're the center of the universe , you should have seen them by now , should n't you ?
Therefore , THEY DON'T EXIST !
This is the beauty of flamers ' logic .
Lie , cheat , steal , leave the toilet seat up .
When in doubt , insult :
If you forget the other 11 rules , remember this one .
At some point during your wonderful career as a flamer you will undoubtedly end up in a flame war with someone who is better than you .
This person will expose your lies , tear apart your arguments , make you look generally like a bozo .
At this point , there 's only one thing to do : insult the dirtbag !!!
" Oh yeah ?
Well , your mother does strange things with vegetables . "
The Golden Rule of Flaming
My flames will be witty , insulting , interesting , funny , caustic , or sarcastic , but never , ever , will they be boring .
Here endeth the scriptures .

Floppy Disk Sculpture
George Hart created this unique 3.5 - inch floppy disk sculpture , which consists of “ an assemblage of thirty 3.5 inch floppy diskettes , slotted and slid into each other gluelessly , embodying a precise five - color pattern ” .
Each diskette is penetrated by diskettes of the other four colors .
Twelve five - sided openings are each bordered by the five different colors in a different cyclic order .
The six of any one color are arranged in the form of an exploded cube .
For any choice of three different colors , there is one point where all three touch in a clockwise order ; at the opposite point , they touch in a counterclockwise order
One of the dirty little secrets about recent claims of massacres is that all too often , they really are not massacres .
The latest case of this now appears to be Haditha , with testimony now emerging that shows that at least eight of the 24 " victims " were armed terrorists .
If so , Haditha would have more in common with the 2002 battle of Jenin ( also claimed to be a massacre ) than it does with My Lai .
The efforts to falsely claim a massacre occurred in Jenin are instructive .
After the 2002 battle , the Palestinian Authority claimed a massacre had occurred .
The mainstream media and human rights groups quickly echoed their claims .
However , further investigations showed that not only had the body count been exaggerated , but that most of those confirmed killed were , in fact , terrorists and not civilians .
In the case of Haditha , the testimony from an intelligence officer and a liaison officer that at least eight of the dead were terrorists calls into question the claims of a massacre and cover -up .
In this case , it seems that the civilians ' deaths may have been part of a firefight that resulted after an ambush .
The initial Haditha investigations uncovered some apparent discrepancies in the Marines ' stories , and a criminal investigation by NCIS was launched .
This , and claims from human rights groups in the media , led to some criminal charges being filed earlier this year .
In this day and age , it does n't take long for a misleading story to spread out .
In 2005 , Newsweek reported that guards at Guantanamo Bay flushed a Koran down a toilet , triggering riots that led to a number of injuries and deaths .
Earlier that year , the false claims were about torture at the detention center in Guantanamo Bay , most notably in a speech by Senator Richard Durbin on the Senate floor .
In both cases , the charges were investigated .
In both cases , the claims proved to have little , if any , bearing to what really happened .
As was the case with Jenin , many of the claims of torture were found to be generally unfounded , and in the few cases where lines were crossed , corrective action had been taken , in some cases immediately ( one such case involved an interrogator who smeared a detainee with red ink after that detainee spat on her ) .
Worse , the lies were already spread around by the time the truth was determined and not reported .
If the testimony about Haditha bears out , then it will just be the latest example of media misreporting .
At that point , though , the real cover - up will begin .
Very little , if any , effort will be made to correct the record .
Politicians like John Murtha , who repeated the most inflammatory charges , will get a pass .
The troops are able to fight the terrorists , and usually win .
Fighting false accusations from terrorists that get repeated by the media , human rights groups , and politicians is much harder .
The worst thing about this is that the myth of the " Haditha massacre " will be used to by various terrorist groups for recruiting , and the new recruits mean that there is a greater chance that troops will get killed .

These products were rather impulse buys , to be tossed in a shopper 's cart just before she pays for a bevy of pillows and spatulas .
In other words , here was strong evidence that gadgets are quickly morphing into the new ChapStick .

And that strikes me as sort of a big deal .
This was n't the first time I 'd noticed low - end electronics being hawked in a store where you would n't expect to find 'em , and near the cashiers to boot .
Last month , while shopping for irregular tube socks at T.J. Maxx , I came across a shelf stuffed with ear buds and , oddly , large - buttoned remote controls — items that had obviously fallen off the proverbial truck .
I did n't notice any takers , but T.J. Maxx ( I suspect ) is n't run by cretins ; I 'm sure someone at corporate headquarters was tipped off that , after a long hour or two of trying on size XXXL sweatpants , your average shopper may be unusually open to the idea of replacing their iPod 's ear buds .
The obvious moral here is that consumers have grown inured to the ever decreasing lifespans of gadgets .
I do n't want to dump on the iPod too much , but I shudder to think what Apple 's done to the next generation 's expectations regarding how long a $ 300 piece of hardware should last .
If no one expects a fancy MP3 player to survive much beyond the warranty 's expiration , then what are they supposed to expect out of a USB beverage warmer ?
Or a shower radio ?
You 've got the admire the sinister genius at work among the tech industry 's powers - that - be .
We 've been conditioned to assume that low - end means low - qual , an equation that need n't necessarily be true .

But you 've also got to consider — and , perhaps , lament — how quickly the satisfaction of buying a new gadget tends to dissipate .
The thing about impulse buys like ChapStick , nail clippers , and breath mints is that folks get them even when they have n't exhausted their previous supply .
That 's the beauty of impulse items , at least from the vendor 's standpoint — I mean , how many tubes of ChapStick or tins of Altoids do you have lying around ?
Probably a lot more than you need at any given moment .
But we keep snatching them off the checkout - line rack anyway , looking for that quick hit of pleasure —
" Hey , new nail clippers !
Life is worth living ! "
For us geeks with deep pockets and short arms , new low - end gadgets tend to elicit the same joyful , albeit very brief , reaction .
You take home your $ 4.99 football remote control , use it that night , then wake up the next morning feeling slightly okay — the same buzz you might feel the day after your team wins the Super Bowl winning $ 5 on a lottery scratcher .
But the ecstasy fades quickly , even if the remote control works as advertised .
You 'd learn your lesson if it cost more but , hey , $ 4.99 ?
You can barely get a decent Long John Silver 's value basket combo for that .
And so the impulse buying continues .

Not that I 'm grumbling too much — I 'm all for the free market , and people are obviously voting with their wallets if a chain like Bed Bath & Beyond sees fit to hawk iBlaster Retractable Ear Buds for $ 9.99 .
But as a controversial , now - legendary Gizmodo Ombudsman column once opined , perhaps it 's wise to resist the urge to buy everything on God 's green Earth that contains a circuit board .
This is precisely what The Man wants you to do , which is why the iSing is positioned , Siren - like , near the Bed Bath & Beyond cash register .
He knows your baser geek instincts will take over once confronted with such a novelty .
Advertisement
I was thisclose to heeding the Siren 's call at Bed Bath & Beyond , but I did n't give in .
Not that I 'm calling myself a hero or anything , but I did save five bucks by resisting the urge .
And I 'm thus that much closer to finally having enough to buy that Apple TV thingamajig that 's been haunting my dreams .
And when that happy day arrives , man , that 'll be a hit of rapture that a zillion iSings could n't equal .
Advertisement
And , no , I do n't expect my Apple TV to last more than a few days beyond the warranty 's expiration .
I just can't help myself on this one , and I 'll bet you can't , either .
( By the way , if you ever see a low - end gadget positioned as an impulse item , please snap a camphone pic and let me know .
Or just take the easy way out and share your finds in comments . )

The iPhone ’s Funny Price
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer on the iPhone , during an on -stage interview at the CEO Forum with USA Today ’s David Lieberman :
There ’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share .
No chance .
It ’s a $ 500 subsidized item .
They may make a lot of money .
But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold , I ’d prefer to have our software in 60 percent or 70 percent or 80 percent of them , than I would to have 2 percent or 3 percent , which is what Apple might get .
Strong words , and an awful lot of competitive FUD packed into one short paragraph .
A few points to keep in mind :
The original iPhones will start at $ 499 and $ 599 this June .
Future models will be both cheaper and more powerful .
Look at what happened with the iPod , which started at $ 399 in 2001 .
The average selling price for an iPod in Apple ’s just - reported Q2 2007 was about $ 160 ; a year ago , it was about $ 200 .
1
There ’s a difference between “ phones ” and “ smartphones ” .
I have no idea how one draws the line , but a good rule of thumb is that smartphones are expensive and regular phones are free ( with plans ) or very cheap .
Apple is n’t trying to sell 10 million phones by the end of 2008 ; they ’re trying to sell 10 million smartphones .
According to Wikipedia ( citing Canalys ) , Windows Mobile currently only has 6 percent market share of the smartphone market , far behind Linux ’s 17 percent and way behind Symbian ’s 72 percent .
Again , that ’s just for smartphones , not mobile phones in general .
I can appreciate that Ballmer — along with every other executive from companies competing in the smartphone market — is sick of questions about the iPhone .
It ’s hard to respond to questions about a competing product that has n’t shipped .
My response would simply be “ We ’ll see . ”
Back in January during an interview promoting the Vista rollout , Ballmer offered his initial reaction to the iPhone : “ $ 500 !
Fully subsidized !
With a plan !
I said that is the most expensive phone in the world .
And it does n’t appeal to business customers because it does n’t have a keyboard which makes it not a very good email machine . ”
In response to that , I wrote :
Here ’s how it ’s going to go .
Starting now , Microsoft will mock the iPhone .
They will mock the price , they will mock the closed software platform , and they will say that phone users demand and crave the wide variety of products in the Windows Mobile market .
But behind the scenes , they ’ve already started working on a Zune clone of the iPhone .
Remember their old party line on music players ?
When asked during this week ’s CEO Forum interview when we can expect a Zune phone , however , Ballmer said :
It ’s not a concept you ’ll ever get from us .
We ’re in the Windows Mobile business .
We would n’t define our phone experience just by music .
A phone is really a general purpose device .
You want to make telephone calls , you want to get and receive messages , text , email , whatever your preference is .
The phone really is kind of a general purpose device that we need to have clean and easy to use .
You can never take someone ’s statement that they ’re never going to release some certain product to mean that they really have no plans to build that product .
( Steve Jobs is rather famous for this — declaring repeatedly , right up until Apple releases something , that Apple is n’t going to build such a thing . )
With a statement like Ballmer ’s above , it could mean exactly what he says .
But it could also mean that they ’re thinking about it or even working on it , and that they do n’t want anyone to know about it yet .
Even an Apple - style “ We do n’t comment on upcoming product plans ” response would lead everyone to think Microsoft was working on a Zune phone , because everyone knows Microsoft loves to talk about upcoming products .
But I ’m now inclined to take Ballmer at his word here : that whatever their plans for the Zune , they do n’t include an iPhone competitor , and that Ballmer genuinely does n’t expect the iPhone to sell particularly well .
I ’ve stashed away a slew of “ iPhone doubter ” links over the last few months from various pundits and analysts , and the iPhone ’s price , by far , is the most frequently cited reason for predictions of doom in the marketplace .
Some of these pundits and analysts are morons .
Ballmer , however , is a very smart man , but what he ’s saying about the iPhone is going to make him look stupid if it ’s successful .
He clearly does n’t get what makes the iPhone so appealing , and his dual obsession with the price and business users is baffling .
Maybe I ’m the moron , but the way I see it , if the iPhone ’s initial price is wrong , it ’s too low , not too high .
Do n’t compare it to other smartphones , which , yes , nearly all cost less than $ 499 when purchased with a plan .
Compare it instead to the prices of the iPod .
Wikipedia has a chart showing every iPod model Apple has sold , with prices .
High - end iPods have sold for $ 399 and $ 499 until 2005 , when prices started dropping .
Even today , though , an 80 GB iPod sells for $ 349 .
And Wikipedia ’s chart neglects to mention that when the iPod Photo debuted , it sold for $ 499 and $ 599 ( 40 and 60 GB , respectively ) .
There are millions of people who have already spent $ 399 –599 on an iPod within the last few years .
With the exception of storage capacity , the iPhone does everything these iPods do , and , well , a whole lot fucking more .
Why would n’t these same people think about spending $ 499 or more on an iPhone ?
Think about how much people would spend on a next - generation iPod that does everything the iPhone does but without the phone : Wi -Fi networking , camera , full - size touch screen , OS X with email and web browsing .
Apple could ( and might ) sell that for $ 499 .
Is the iPhone a sure thing ?
No , of course not — because we have n’t seen it .
But the only ifs are technical :
Is the battery life at least adequate ?
Does the multi - touch display work well ?
Is the gesture - based UI as fun to use in real life as it looks in the demos ?
Does the music player work about as well as an iPod ?
Is the hardware reliable ?
If the answer to those questions is yes , I do n’t see how there ’s any question that Apple is going to sell them as fast as they can make them .
( And do you want to take bets that the $ 599 model outsells the $ 499 one ? )
This misplaced concern over the iPhone ’s price — which , I implore you to keep in mind , is the initial pricing — goes hand - in - hand with the idea that the iPhone is in trouble because it wo n’t appeal to businesses .
Yes , there ’s a market for smartphones targeted at business users .
Hello , BlackBerry .
But most people do n’t get any sort of mobile phone — let alone a nice expensive one — from their employers .
The only people I know who get free smartphones from work are people high enough on the ladder that they can easily afford to buy as many $ 500 gadgets as they want , and many of them already plan to buy themselves an iPhone .
On the other hand , most people I know have spent at least $ 249 on an iPod for themselves .
Why worry about the iPhone ’s appeal to corporate IT ?
The iPod is n’t marketed to businesses and Apple has sold 100 million of them .
The iPod is marketed to people , and the iPhone is , too .
RIM sold 2 million BlackBerry devices in its most recent quarter ; Apple sold 10.5 million iPods in the same period .
And there ’s a huge , fundamental difference between these two markets .
Businesses , typically , want to buy the cheapest things possible for their employees to use .
When buying for themselves , people want to buy the nicest things they can afford .
As for Microsoft , I think there ’s a good chance Apple will quickly pass them in phone OS market share — say , within two years .
Apple ’s in a good position here .
So long as they sell enough iPhones during the first year or so that it is n’t considered a flop — which seems to be a sure thing , frankly — even if they remain behind Microsoft in terms of market share , Apple can say , “ Well , hey , we just got started in this market . ”
But if Apple actually draws even with Microsoft within a year or two — what ’s Microsoft ’s excuse ?
This is a market Microsoft has been after for a long time , going back to when Windows Mobile was marketed as Windows CE , a.k.a “ WinCE ” .
( Who comes up with names like that ?
Wince ? )
Why not treat the mobile phone market as a consumer market like the Xbox and Zune ?
Microsoft , Palm , Motorola , Sony , the other phone carriers ( and maybe even Cingular , too ) — the executives running these companies clearly have no idea how much the software user experience matters when you ’re trying to create a gadget with iPod - like appeal .
If they did understand , they would n’t have spent the last decade selling phones with such crummy UIs .
We ’ll see how long Steve Ballmer thinks the iPhone ’s price is funny .
A favorite recipe in the neighborhood called for garlic powder , an exotic ingredient in 1958 ; chopped onion ; and — gasp ! — Worcestershire sauce .
This avant - garde recipe was treasured and shared sparingly .

What the burgers of my childhood all had in common was high - quality meat , and this is exactly what is missing from most of the backyard barbecues I visit .
I see people buying everything from packaged ground meat to frozen patties .
With these ingredients , the best they can hope for is to mimic fast food .
The key is to avoid packaged ground meat .
When you buy it , you may know the cut of the meat — chuck , for example — and the fat content .
But you have no way of knowing whether the meat came from high - or low - quality animals .
It could come from dozens of animals , and they could all be poor - quality animals — old dairy cows , for instance , rather than cattle raised for beef .
The meat from these animals is ground together in huge quantities .
If the aesthetics of that do n’t give you pause , consider the health concerns .
Massive batches of ground meat carry the highest risk of salmonella and E. coli contamination , and have caused many authorities to recommend cooking burgers to the well - done stage .
Forgive my snobbishness , but well - done meat is dry and flavorless , which is why burgers should be rare , or at most medium rare .
Strolling through Jersey City one evening a year earlier , they had stumbled across some intriguing trash , including a sail and several nautical maps .
The couple began lingering near the house that had discarded them , and , sure enough , one day the owner was on his porch , smoking .
“ We were kind of dazzled by him , ” Ms. Collins said .
“ Here ’s this Hemingway - esque guy who has sailed all over the world . ”
He invited them in and served them top - shelf Scotch .
Barely a year after they met , he offered the couple his boat .
They declined .
“ We ’d never be able to afford a boat like this — never , never , ” Ms. Collins said .
“ But he wanted us to have the boat .
He was like , ‘ Do n’t worry about the finances . ’ ”
So they arranged a deal : “ Whatever we got for Hambo was what we ’d pay him for Sarabande , ” Mr. Nisbett said .
That turned out to be $ 11,000 ; they pay an additional $ 750 a month in docking fees .
The Sarabande is larger and much better equipped than the Hambo .
It has top - of - the line electronics , sophisticated navigation equipment , a water maker ( to make seawater potable ) , a generator and even heat and air - conditioning .
With its diesel tanks full , it can stay at sea for 90 days .
But the Sarabande was in even worse shape than the couple ’s previous boats .
It had been dry - docked — and ignored — for several years .
“ The whole boat was like a mold - ateria , ” Mr. Nisbett said .
“ It was disgusting .
When it would rain , it was like it was raining in here . ”
And so all through the last winter the couple worked , night after night , often long after midnight .
What they did n’t know how to repair , they learned .
“ We are always digging ourselves in too deep , ” Ms. Collins said .
“ We take on projects we do n’t really know how to do , and then we have to tear them out and redo them . ”
Image Credit ... Gabriele Stabile for The New York Times
Mr. Nisbett said , “ We ’ll get to the point where a project is ruining every aspect of our lives . ”
The boat was tented in plastic to keep out the freezing winter winds , but it did n’t have a working bathroom , so they had to walk over to the marina’s .
Initial Thoughts on Boumediene Marty Lederman The U.S. Court of Appeals today by a 2 - 1 vote dismissed the pending habeas corpus petitons of hundreds of Guantanamo detainees .
In an opinion by Judge Randolph , joined by Judge Sentelle , the court held ( i ) that the Military Commissions Act stripped the federal courts of the ( statutory ) habeas jurisdiction that the Supreme Court had recognized in Rasul v. Bush , and ( ii ) that this elimination of habeas was not unconstitutional .
Judge Rogers dissented .
The Court 's constitutional holding , in turn , is based on three propositions : ( i ) that the Constitution ( the Suspension Clause , by implication ) only protects the right of habeas corpus that was recognized at common law in 1789 ; ( ii ) that the common law in 1789 did not provide the right of habeas petitioning to aliens held by the government outside the sovereign 's territory ( and without property within that territory ) ; and ( iii ) that GTMO is outside U.S. territory for constitutional purposes , notwithstanding that the U.S. has complete control over that facility .
I 'm tied up with another project right now , so only have time for a few brief , preliminary reactions to the majority opinion :
1. The Court writes ( page 14 ) that " [ t ] he Supreme Court has stated the Suspension Clause protects the writ 'as it existed in 1789 , ' when the first Judiciary Act created the federal courts and granted jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus .
St. Cyr , 533 U.S. at 301 . "
This is misleading .
The Court held in St. Cyr that the Constitution protects the writ as it existed in 1789 " at the absolute minimum . "
Compare Felker v. Turpin , 518 U.S. at 663-664 ( assuming for the sake of argument that " the Suspension Clause of the Constitution refers to the writ as it exists today , rather than as it existed in 1789 " ) .
The Court has not resolved this question , and thus it was a mistake for the D.C. Circuit not to reach it , even if the 1789 writ would not have extended to these alien detainees .
[ UPDATE : It 's not an innocent mistake , either -- Judge Rogers calls them on it in note 5 of her dissent . ]
2 . The court appears to concede that if an alien detainee captured overseas is thereafter detained in sovereign territory , the detainee is protected by a constitutional right of habeas .
( See its discussion of the Rex v. Schiever case from 1759 , pages 14 - 15 , in which the court entertained the habeas petition of an alien detainee brought to Liverpool . ) .
What this means is this :
Recall that the GTMO detains were all captured halfway around the globe , and then brought to the Western Hemisphere .
Thus , the only reason they are not entitled to habeas rights is that their U.S. captors chose to turn left and take them to the U.S. - run facility in GTMO , rather than turning right to go to a U.S. facility in say , South Carolina .
Indeed , according to John
Yoo 's new book ( and other sources ) , they were taken to GTMO precisely for the purpose of keeping them out of the reach of U.S. courts .
Whatever the constitutional rule ought to be for aliens detained near a battlefield half a world away , it seems perverse , to say the least , that so many important constitutional protections should turn on which direction we choose to direct our ships ( or planes ) carrying detainees a few miles off the Florida coast .
3 . Why does n't GTMO count as U.S. sovereign territory for purposes of the rule Judge Randolph announces ?
After all , the U.S. has complete control over the territory .
According to the court ( pages 20 - 21 ) , the reason is that the Detention Treatment Act of 2005 declares that the term " United States , " " when used in a geographic sense . . . does not include the United States Naval Station , Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . ”
But that definition merely establishes a status for GTMO as a matter of statute ( it explains what Congress was referring to when it used the term " United States " in the DTA ) .
If a statute said that Boise , Idaho was not in the United States , that would n't place Boise outside of any constitutional protections limited to U.S. sovereign territory .
So , too , here -- the court simply does n't do the work necessary to determine whether GTMO falls within the rule it announces ( even assuming arguendo that rule is correct ) .
Moreover , the court ( at page 21 ) cites its 1977 decision in Ralpho v. Bell , 569 F.2d 607 ( 1977 ) , in which the D.C. Circuit held that the Constitution does protect aliens living on the Micronesian island of Jaluit .
Contrary to the court 's suggestion in its opinion today , that island was not U.S. territory -- it was an island that we agreed to hold in trust .
The court does not explain why Jaluit in the years after World War II is distinguishable from GTMO today for constitutional purposes .
( Thanks to Gerry Neuman for this point . )
Prediction :
This part of the opinion will not survive Supreme Court review .
To see why , take a look at Justice Kennedy 's opinions in Rasul and in Verdugo - Urquidez .
The Court is not going to hold that the Executive branch can avoid the constraints of the Constitution merely by the " fortuity " of the fact that it opts to set up shop 400 miles off the coast of Florida .
The constitutionality of the habeas - stripping will instead turn on the question of whether the D.C. Circuit review of CSRT detention decisions is an adequate substitute for habeas review ( see Point 5 , below ) , especially as applied to these detainees who have been held at GTMO for several years .
4 . Although the holding of Judge Randolph 's opinion apparently extends only to aliens held abroad , the logic of his opinion at page 16 suggests that even U.S. citizens held abroad would not be entitled to constitutional habeas protections :
When agents of the Crown detained prisoners outside the Crown ’s dominions , it was understood that they were outside the jurisdiction of the writ .
See HOLDSWORTH , supra , at 116 - 17 .
Even British citizens imprisoned in “ remote islands , garrisons , and other places ” were “ prevent[ed ] from the benefit of the law , ” 2 HENRY HALLAM , THE CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND 127-28 ( William S. Hein Co. 1989 ) ( 1827 ) , which included access to habeas corpus , see DUKER , supra , at 51 - 53 ; HOLDSWORTH , supra , at 116 ; see also Johan Steyn , Guantanamo Bay : The Legal Black Hole , 53 INT ’L & COMP .
L.Q. 1 , 8 ( 2004 ) ( “ the writ of habeas corpus would not be available ” in “ remote islands , garrisons , and other places ” ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) .
( Just to be clear :
The implication of the Randolph opinion is that Congress could abolish habeas rights for U.S. citizens detained at GTMO ( or elsewhere outside the U.S. ) .
The Supreme Court would never go for that -- perhaps not even a single Justice -- and in any event , section 7 of the MCA does not strip citizens of habeas rights :
It applies only to aliens . )
5 . The MCA permits certain review of detention decisions in the D.C. Circuit court of appeals itself .
The court today refused to perform that review , because it concluded ( page 25 ) that the record does not contain sufficient information to review the detention decisions of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals at GTMO .
Therefore , the court did not reach the question of whether the D.C. Circuit review , prescribed in the MCA and DTA , would be an adequate substitute for habeas rights in the event the court is wrong about whether these detainees have constitutionally protected rights to petition for habeas .
Cf. Swain v. Pressley , 430 U.S. at 381 ( “ the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person 's detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus ” ) .
[ UPDATE :
In a very interesting part of her dissent ( pages 20 - 25 ) , Judge Rogers argues that the D.C. Circuit review is not an adequate substitute for habeas .
See also her discussion at pages 29 - 31 , suggesting that " searching " factual review of the grounds for detention is appropriate on habeas , at least insofar as the procedures within the military are less than robust ( note 13 ) . ]
Prediction :
The litigation in the Supreme Court -- and the Court 's ultimate decision -- will primarily focus on this question , rather than on the question of whether the detainees at GTMO are entitled to constitutional protections ( which the Court will answer in the affirmative ) .
6 . Neither opinion discusses the most vexing substantive question that would have to be reached if the habeas claims were entertained -- namely , determining the category of persons who may lawfully be detained by the military as " enemy combatants " pursuant to the September 2001 AUMF and the laws of war incorporated therein .
See note 14 of the Rogers dissent .

No e-mails released on firing of U.S. attorneys during a 16 - day period
• Investigators interested in period between November 15 and December 2 , 2006
• Last e-mail before gap asks whether issue should be raised with the president
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A 16 - day gap in e-mail records between the Justice Department and the White House concerning the firing of U.S. attorneys last year has attracted the attention of congressional investigators .
In an investigation into whether seven U.S. attorneys were fired for political rather than professional reasons , the Justice Department on Monday handed over 3,000 pages of documents to the House and Senate Judiciary committees .
But the documents included no correspondence about the firings in the critical time period between November 15 , 2006 , and December 2 , 2006 , right before the attorneys were asked for their resignations .
In addition , citing executive privilege , President Bush has refused a congressional request to have his key aide Karl Rove and former White House counsel Harriet Miers , who was involved in the firings , testify under oath .
( Full story )
All eyes on the AG
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has come under fire in the past week , as both Republicans and Democrats suggested it might be best if he resign .
( Watch Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer explain why he is unhappy with the White House response )
On November 15 -- the last day before the e-mail gap -- Kyle Sampson , who was then chief of staff to Gonzales , e-mailed Miers and her deputy an outline of the plan to fire the prosecutors and wrote , " The plan , by its terms , would commence this week . "
Sampson resigned last week amid outcry about the firings .
Later in the same e-mail Gonzalez said , " I am concerned that to execute this plan properly we must all be on the same page and be steeled to withstand any political upheaval that might result . "
Miers responded that same morning , saying , " Not sure whether this will be determined to require the boss 's attention " and noted that President Bush had left town the night before .
Sampson then asked , " Who will determine whether this requires the president 's attention ? "
There is no follow - up response in the documents so far released to those questions and no correspondence at all about the plan to fire the attorneys from that point until December 2 , when Sampson e-mailed Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty 's chief of staff , saying , " The list is expanded ; still waiting for green light from White House ( though we would not launch until after 12/7 anyway ) . "
On December 4 , Deputy White House Counsel William Kelley told Sampson , " We 're a go for the US atty [ sic ] plan .
WH leg [ legislative affairs ] , political , and communications have signed off and acknowledged that we have to be committed to following through once the pressure comes . "
Sampson said he forwarded the message to other Justice Department officials , saying , " We are a go for Thursday . "
Justice denies gap in e-mails
There are documents from days in that time period , but they deal with related issues such as setting up an interview for Tim Griffin , who was the replacement for Bud Cummins , the U.S. attorney in Arkansas who was one of the eight asked to resign .
They also deal with a request for a copy of an evaluation of an unnamed U.S. attorney and how U.S. Attorney Paul Charlton was directed to provide a prosecutor for a high - profile trial .
A Justice Department official said " there was no lull " when asked about the time period between mid-November and early December .
The White House has yet to release internal communications that could shed light on the issue .
It has offered to release communications between White House staffers and those at the Justice Department or others outside the White House , as part of negotiations with congressional committees over their access to key White House officials .
The White House , however , has not included internal communications between White House officials in its offer .
Members of a House Judiciary subcommittee voted Wednesday to authorize the committee 's leaders to issue subpoenas to force testimony from key White House and Justice Department figures in the controversy over the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys .
( Full story )
The vote does not mean that subpoenas will be issued ; only that they could be used if at least four White House officials and a former Justice Department official do not voluntarily come to testify before the committee .
CNN 's Terry Frieden and Ed Henry contributed to this report .
LET ’S say you wanted to build an advertising - supported online media business that took in $ 50 million a year in revenue .
How many users would you have to attract to get there ?
Probably too many for most people to even try , if the numbers run by Jeremy Liew , a venture capitalist at Lightspeed Venture Partners , are accurate .
On his blog ( lsvp.wordpress.com ) , Mr. Liew determined that even the type of site that can get the largest advertiser payments per user would have to be immensely popular before it made that kind of money .
The analysis is “ sobering , ” wrote Tim O’Reilly , the chief executive of O’Reilly Media , a publisher of computer books .
“ This may be why more entrepreneurs are going for low - investment sites that do n’t need an exit but provide ‘ lifestyle businesses ’ for their owners , ” he wrote on Radar , his company ’s blog ( radar.oreilly.com ) .
That is , rather than seek venture financing and hire a staff , it may be better for one or two people to create a relatively simple site — say , a hobbyist blog for guitar enthusiasts — and use a service like Google AdWords to , hopefully , make enough money to live on .
Four years ago , the United States went to war in Iraq because we , and , admittedly , the rest of the world , believed that Saddam Hussein was harboring weapons of mass destruction .
Within months after the fall of the Ba’athist regime , the intelligence that supported that conclusion was proven to be completely inaccurate .
Now , it seems that the danger posed by North Korea ’s supposed nuclear weapons program may have been exaggerated as well :
The Bush administration is backing away from its long - held assertions that North Korea has an active clandestine program to enrich uranium , leading some experts to believe that the original U.S. intelligence that started the crisis over Pyongyang ’s nuclear ambitions may have been flawed .
The chief intelligence officer for North Korea , Joseph R. DeTrani , told Congress on Tuesday that while there is “ high confidence ” North Korea acquired materials that could be used in a “ production - scale ” uranium program , there is only “ mid-confidence ” such a program exists .
Meanwhile , Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill , the chief negotiator for disarmament talks , last week told a conference in Washington that it is unclear if North Korea ever mastered the production techniques necessary for such a program .
As the article points out this is n’t exactly what the Bush Administration was saying five years ago :
The administration ’s stance today stands in sharp contrast to the certainty expressed by top officials in 2002 , when the administration accused Pyongyang of running a secret uranium program — and demanded it be dismantled at once .
President Bush told a news conference that November : “ We discovered that contrary to an agreement they had with the United States , they ’re enriching uranium , with a desire of developing a weapon . ”
Fortunately , we were n’t foolish enough to go to war with North Korea over the faulty intelligence we had back then .
Unfortunately , one cannot say the same thing for Iraq .

So here ’s a couple ways to create a successful game online : a ) , Find an investor who ’s crazy enough to give you millions of dollars , or b ) , Put it on a distribution network and hope you get enough customers willing to buy it as a download .
Then there ’s c ) , Make a Flash mini-game , let people play it for free , and watch the ad revenue pour in when the site gets 20 million pageviews a month .
That ’s the option Paul Preece took with his phenomenally popular Desktop Tower Defense , and though he has no professional experience with game development , the Visual Basic programmer is now making , by his estimate , high four figures monthly for his ferociously viral little game .
As such , it ’s an ideal case study for an often - overlooked revenue model for online games , one that developers and investors would do well to learn from .
Working with a low budget on a game designed for maximum stickiness , a small team of developers can create a single title which earns thousands yearly — or in Preece ’s case , close to six figures .
[ digg=http://digg.com/playable_web_games/Desktop_Tower_Defense_the_story_behind_the_hit_Flash_game]
After the break , Preece explains some of the secrets to Tower ’s success .
Take a Well - Known Genre , Make It Better
There are numerous “ Tower Defense ” - style games with the same premise — stop a horde of monsters by building a variety of defense towers .
“ I have been mulling over doing a proper ‘ mazing ’ Tower Defense for a year or so , ” Preece says , “ but I felt that the learning curve for Flash was too great .
Then a good friend of mine created the successful Flash Element Tower Defense , and when I chatted to him about his experience … it suddenly seemed much less difficult than I had thought it was . ”
[ His specific inspiration was a mini - game from one of Blizzard ’s classic real - time strategy titles : “ The basic map layout was based on Autumn Tower Defense , which was one of my favorite Warcraft III TDs . ” ]
Though most of these games are fantasy - oriented , Preece gave his version a quirkier , more cartoonish feel , and added a number of elements that made it more viral — particularly a group - based ranking system which encourages competition between friends and co-workers .
Promote through Web Aggregation Sites
“ I did n’t do any promotion of the game beyond sticking it on StumbleUpon.com , ” Preece tells me .
“ It gave the game a slow start for a week or so — which was good to weed out the bugs .
Then it got ‘ picked up ’ by a few large game sites , then Digg and then I - am - bored.com .
When DTD got Dugg the first time , the server overloaded and I realized that it was becoming popular game . ”
How popular ?
“ I am unsure as to the number of unique visitors , ” he says .
“ My logs show 4 million visitors and 20 million page views for April .
The game itself has had 9 million plays during April ( excluding older versions ) . ”
Debuting in March , his site , http://www.handdrawngames.com, is already among Alexa ’s top ten thousand sites .
Profit Through Ad Revenue and Keep the Budget Low
DTD ’s main revenue source is AdSense , but with its avalanche of popularity , advertisers have approached Preece directly , leading to “ Affiliate deals , sponsorship , custom versions for other companies etc .
The last two are in the pipeline but I thought I ’d add them in at a low level . ”
Preece ’s main expense is running the server .
“ Hosting fees are negligible , ” he says , “ at $ 130 per month .
But I am getting very close to the 1200 GB bandwidth allocation ! ”
That plus “ the continuous supply of late night Red Bull ” comprise the bulk of Desktop ’s budget .
“ I do feel that with a little more market place knowledge I could make a good living from DTD until it stops being popular , ” Preece e-mails me .
“ With less popular games I would probably need two - three on the go every month to make a good living .
That would equate to releasing a game every month which I think is doable . ”
But what ’s that odd voice you hear , when you win the game ?
“ It comes from a children ’s cartoon I grew up with in the UK called ‘ Ivor The Engine ’ , ” Preece explains .
“ It was about a Welsh train , which is where the accent comes from . ”
But keeping the budget low is his main consideration .
So , he adds , “ I have removed it in the next version for bandwidth reasons . ”
Update , 5/28 : Added Preece ’s acknowledgement of Warcraft III as an inspiration for DTD .
It started with free M&M’s .
Now there ’s a country club , on - site Montessori daycare , on - site doctors and nurses , 35 - hour work week , live piano music during lunch , 50.000 square foot fitness center , swimming pools , no dress - code , masseur , on - site car detailing .
And more .
If you need assistance in adopting a child or finding a college for your child or a nursing home for a parent , they have people to help you with that too .
SAS Institute ’s perks are legendary , and the Software Company ’s 9.000 employees certainly know they have it good .
Normally IT companies have employee turnover rates of 20 % .
At SAS it ’s 3 % which saves them an estimated $ 80 million a year in recruting costs alone .
Conservatively .
Why do they do it ?
Are they naïve altruists ?
Jeff Chambers , director of human resources at SAS , puts it like this :
No , we ’re not altruistic by any stretch of the imagination .
This is a for - profit business and we do all these things because it makes good business sense .
There are four interesting points to notice about what SAS is doing :
1 : It works
Their annual report for 2004 rightly brags about their 28th consecutive year of growth and prosperity , a record unmatched in the software industry .
Their revenues in 2004 was $ 1.5 billion .
That ’s pretty impressive .
2 : It ’s possible because they ’re privately owned
CEO Jim Goodnight refuses to take the company public because it might change the way employees are treated and destroy their ability to make long - term plans :
You ca n’t just have a weak quarter and then all of a sudden start bailing out and cutting things .
I am basically my own board .
So , I do n’t have to worry about pressure from the board or being fired if I do n’t improve earnings .
…
There ’s no possible way I can tell you what my earnings are going to be to the penny each quarter .
There ’s only one way to get there to the penny — you have to cook the books .
3 : They ’re committed to treating their people well
Goodnight says it very simply :
If the employees are happy , they make the customers happy .
If they make the customers happy , they make me happy .
4 : It ’s not the perks
SAS employees are happy and stay at the company for years doing good , creative work .
But that ’s not because of the perks – because no amount of perks can make up for lousy leadership , a bad atmosphere or a lack of respect for employees .
The truth is this :
The perks , combined with Goodnight ’s and the company ’s attitude , make people feel valued – and that ’s what ’s making them happy .
This is good news for companies that do n’t have as much money in the bank as SAS .
It ’s not the ( expensive ) perks , it ’s the commitment to your employees ’ happiness that makes a difference .
And that does n’t take country clubs and Montessori schools but can be done on a much tighter budget .

At that time , the panel said , sea levels were 12 to 20 feet higher than they are now .
Muych of that extra water is now trapped in the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica , which are eroding in some places .
The panel said there was no solid scientific understanding of how rapidly the vast stores of ice in polar regions will melt , so their estimates on new sea levels were based mainly on how much the warmed oceans will expand , and not on contributions from the melting of ice now on land .
Other scientists have recently reported evidence that the glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctic could flow seaward far more quickly than estimated in the past , and they have proposed that the risks to coastal areas could be much more imminent .
But the I.P.C.C. is proscribed by its charter from entering into speculation , and so could not include such possible instabilities in its assessment .
Michel Jarraud , the secretary general of the United Nations World Meteorological Organization , said the lack of clarity should offer no one comfort .
“ The speed with which melting ice sheets are raising sea levels is uncertain , but the report makes clear that sea levels will rise inexorably over the coming centuries , ” he said .
“ It is a question of when and how much , and not if , ” he said , adding : “ While the conclusions are disturbing , decision makers are now armed with the latest facts and will be better able to respond to these realities . ”
Achim Steiner , the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program , which oversees the I.P.C.C. along with the meteorological group , said society now had plenty of information on which to act .
“ The implications of global warming over the coming decades for our industrial economy , water supplies , agriculture , biological diversity and even geopolitics are massive , ” he said .
“ This new report should spur policymakers to get off the fence and put strong and effective policies in place to tackle greenhouse gas emissions . ”
The warming and other climate shifts will be highly variable around the world , with the Arctic particularly seeing much higher temperatures , said Susan Solomon , the co-leader of the team writing the summary and the section of the I.P.C.C. report on basic science .
She is an atmospheric scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .

North America 's oldest church may lie beneath a small town in Newfoundland , according to information cobbled together from the research of a historian who recently died before publishing her seminal work .
An Italian friar and sailing companion of explorer John Cabot erected the church during his second trip to the continent in 1498 , according to the late Alwyn Ruddock , said Evan Jones , a University of Bristol researcher who investigated and pieced together Ruddock 's notes .
" To describe Alwyn Ruddock 's claims as revolutionary would not be an exaggeration , " Jones said .
" If Ruddock is right , it means that the remains of the only medieval church in North America may still lie buried under the modern town of Carbonear . "
Ruddock , a historian with the University of London , was one of the world 's foremost experts on Cabot 's voyages until her death in late 2005 .
In keeping with her will , all of her research was destroyed when she passed away , including 40 years ' worth of work for a book about the many mysteries surrounding Cabot 's maligned 1498 expedition .
However , a book proposal Ruddock gave to her publisher and some e-mail correspondences survived , allowing Jones to explore her theories in a recent article published in the journal Historical Research .
Ruddock 's most exciting claims concern an Italian friar named Fra Giovanni Antonio Carbonaro , who sailed aboard one of the five vessels that left with Cabot from Bristol , England , in 1498 and landed in Newfoundland .
" While we have long known that Fra Giovanni accompanied the expedition , along with some other ' poor Italian friars ' , nothing has been known of what happened to their mission , " Jones said .
Ruddock seemed to have found evidence that while Cabot sailed on down nearly the entire eastern shore of North America to the Caribbean — another new revelation — the friar and his brothers stayed on and established a religious colony in Newfoundland , at present - day Carbonear .
" It appears that Ruddock believed the Newfoundland church was named after San Giovanni a Carbonara , " Jones writes , " the locative element ' a Carbonara ' presumably being carried across because it was key to the congregation 's identity . "
The problem with Ruddock 's notes is that they do not include actual documented evidence to substantiate her claims .
" While her correspondence does not give all the answers , it does provide many clues that historians can use to investigate her claims , " said Jones .
Neither Jones nor any other historians involved in the literary reconstruction efforts understand why Ruddock chose to have her valuable work destroyed .
" Even if all the documents she claimed to have found do come to light eventually , the mystery of why she sought to suppress her own basic research may never be resolved , " Jones said .
Station Exchange
Back in 2001 , a professor named Edward Castronova began to study the way markets worked in a place called Norrath .
Norrath does not exist in a physical sense but is the name of the " virtual world " where the online computer game EverQuest is set .
EverQuest is filled with half - elves , castles , sword fights and such , and also involves a fairly complex internal economy , whose currency is platinum pieces used to buy weapons , food and other goods .
Although the goods are digital , it 's not quite right to say that they do n't have real value ; pretty much from the earliest days of Norrath , Castronova discovered , game players found ways to pay real - world dollars for fake - world things .
These black - market , real - money transactions were frowned upon by the game maker but turned out to be unstoppable .
After years of trying to thwart the practice , the owner of EverQuest II , Sony Online Entertainment , capitulated to the realities of the unreal marketplace this summer by creating a site called Station Exchange .
Here , gamers can use real money in an auction format to buy or sell Norrath 's weapons and scrolls and even fully tricked - out characters .
" It was something that , clearly , our players wanted to do , and placed value on , " explains April Jones , a spokeswoman for Sony Online Entertainment .
One of the top prices paid for an item was $ 500 for a set of Shimmering Star Legplates .
But the big money involves buying or selling completely outfitted characters ; members of the Templar class are particularly sought after and have sold for as much as $ 721 .
Jones says so far only one character has sold at the site 's maximum " sanity cap " value of $ 2,000 -- a Level 50 Fury with formidable craft skills .
EverQuest II has an estimated 350,000 players , arrayed over worlds that are tethered to dozens of servers ; it is one of many " massively multiplayer games " with millions of participants around the planet .
The idea is generally for the player to build up skills and strengths over time , through adventures and achievements .
Castronova , whose forthcoming book , " Synthetic Worlds , " looks at the economics and culture of networked games , points out that most of the popular ones have always had built - in ( fake ) currencies and thus marketplaces .
" It 's kind of interesting that it 's considered a core element of the fun , " he says .
" There have been some network spaces where everything is free .
Nobody goes there . "

Arabs try outreach to Israel , U.S. Jews
Saudis , others seek to counter extremists
WASHINGTON — Arab states , led by Saudi Arabia , are making some of their most public overtures ever to Israel and American Jews in an effort to undercut Iran 's growing influence , contain violence in Iraq and Lebanon and push for a Palestinian solution .
The high - profile gestures coincide with Saudi Arabia 's lead role last week in brokering a deal for a coalition Palestinian government .
Last month , Prince Turki al - Faisal , Saudi Arabia 's departing ambassador to the United States , attended a Washington reception sponsored by American Jewish organizations .
The event honored a State Department diplomat appointed to combat anti-Semitism .
The appearance of a Saudi diplomat is " unprecedented , " said William Daroff , Washington office director for the United Jewish Communities , which organized the reception .
Saudi Arabia , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have stepped up contacts with Israel and pro-Israel Jewish groups in the USA .
The outreach has the Bush administration 's blessing : Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said six Gulf states and Egypt , Jordan and Israel are a new alignment of moderates to oppose extremists backed by Iran and Syria .
She has said an Israeli - Palestinian peace deal would weaken militants such as Hamas and Hezbollah .
Contacts have intensified as part of a strategy meant to undercut extremists and build momentum for a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians , said Jamal Kashoggi , an aide to Saudi Prince Turki .
Judith Kipper , a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations , said , " What really concerns pro-U.S. Arab states is that Iran is setting the political agenda in the region . "
Saudi and Gulf Arab contacts with Israelis and American Jews go back more than a decade but have never been so public .
Arab countries have treated Israel as a pariah since it gained independence in 1948 .
Most Arab countries ban travel to Israel , investment there and other commercial ties with the Jewish state and routinely refer to it as the " Zionist entity . "
Only three of 21 Arab nations recognize Israel : Egypt , Jordan and Mauritania .
A 2002 peace plan put forward by Saudi Arabia offers diplomatic relations with the other 18 Arab states if Israel withdraws to the borders it had in 1967 — meaning giving up the West Bank and the Golan Heights — and cedes land for a new Palestinian state .
Among the other recent Arab - Jewish contacts :
• Saudi national security adviser Bandar bin Sultan met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jordan in September , said Daniel Ayalon , Israel 's former ambassador to Washington .
He said it was the highest - level Saudi - Israeli meeting he 'd ever heard of .
• The United Arab Emirates has invited a delegation from the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations .
The conference , a 51 - member umbrella group , is a strong supporter of Israel .
• Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres met the emir of Qatar in late January after taking part in a debate with Arab students there .
It was the highest - level Israeli meeting with the Gulf nation since 1996 , when Peres visited as prime minister .

how reddit encourages mediocrity .
April 27 , 2006
i remember reading a statistic like this once :
" in 1926 , charlie chaplin was voted the best actor in hollywood .
he was also voted the worst actor in hollywood . "
I do n't know what year it was .
i do n't know what the competition was .
Point is that he was both first and last .
The same thing happens all over the place .
I 've seen people listed as both the " best " and " worst " dressed in the same dumb competition .
This pattern is known as " You either love it or you hate it ! " and a lot of the good stuff fits this pattern .
( continues ... )
At the website Reddit , you can give a positive vote , or a negative vote .
Negative votes cancel out positive votes .
If the reddit system was used everywhere , charlie chaplin would 've been a nobody .
each of his ' worst actor ' votes would 've cancelled out one of the best actor votes .
Due to the flawed voting system at reddit , the highest rated articles are not the most popular , but something more obscure and bland .
They 're the ones which have the highest ratio of love to hate .
Reddit promotes the kind of articles that you either love , or do n't care about .
Take Paul Graham for example .
He 's a middle of the road easy listenin kind of guy .
Either you love him or , shrug , who cares ?
And he 's very popular at reddit .
Enough of this .
Here 's a quote that says it so much better than I could :
if you 're not doing something that someone hates , it 's probably mediocre .
from : Death by Risk Aversion at Creating Passionate Users .
The only ironic thing , and which threatens to derail my whole idea , is that the article ' Death by Risk Aversion ' , is one I stumbled across on Reddit .

Recently I suggested to someone a means by which they could give up smoking cigarettes .
This woman was standing outside her friend ’s home while everyone else was inside enjoying their coffee and chocolates .
We were exchanging shouted pleasantries with the woman on the outside and the conversation revolved around how difficult it is to quit smoking .
I told her that I had cut a white pen down to cigarette size and ‘ smoked ’ the pen until I had rid myself of the habit of smoking .
I had discovered from previous attempts that the actual nicotine addiction passes ( with some difficulty , especially to other members of the household ! ) in about three days , but it is the habit that is so terribly difficult to break .
This woman asked me how long it took me to finally give up my pen and I told her it was around six months .
She laughed and said how ridiculous I must have looked to smoke a pen for six months .
Ridiculous !
Hmmm , ridiculous , yes .
But it is not ridiculous to have shouting conversations with your friends because you absolutely HAVE to be outside , even in the freezing cold , while your friends are warm and cozy , because you HAVE to draw poisonous smoke into your lungs every half an hour or so .
Not ridiculous to hand over up to $ 80.00 per week to a multinational tobacco company , who in turn will give you some cardboard , paper , chemicals , and a weed , which you will in turn set on fire and breath in the noxious fumes .
Not ridiculous to befoul your room , house , car , clothes , hair , skin , teeth with this toxic substance , let alone your precious lungs , heart and vascular system .
Not ridiculous to slowly drown in the poisoned fluids your lungs will gradually produce because they no longer can function .
I know how hard it is to rid yourself of this terrible habit .
I know the government pays lip service to helping you because they want to reap the profits from your pain and suffering .
I know how many billions the tobacco companies make out of your addiction each year .
I know how it feels to wonder if there is a life of any kind without smoking !
But do n’t give up trying , and do n’t ridicule what you have n’t tried .
It may just be your answer .

— D. H. Lawrence , Whales Weep Not
News item : A bowhead whale caught recently was more than a century old .
This animal , if not for its unfortunate encounter with an Inuit harpoon , might have proceeded about its stately cetacean business for decades to come — a point that underscores the impressive longevity of this order of mammals .
( Link ) :
A 50 - ton bowhead whale caught off the Alaskan coast last month had a weapon fragment embedded in its neck that showed it survived a similar hunt — more than a century ago .
Embedded deep under its blubber was a 3 ½ - inch arrow - shaped projectile that has given researchers insight into the whale ’s age , estimated between 115 and 130 years old .

Calculating a whale ’s age can be difficult , and is usually gauged by amino acids in the eye lenses .
It ’s rare to find one that has lived more than a century , but experts say the oldest were close to 200 years old .
Whales live a very long time in the wild , and it ’s not even clear whether they undergo organismal aging as such .
Certainly , they ’re not immortal in a practical sense — but as Peter Medawar pointed out long ago , even a theoretically immortal population will be slowly winnowed over time , such that older animals will be rarer than younger animals .
This , in turn , makes the contribution of older animals to future generations smaller , thereby weakening the strength of selection on genes that act in late life , and setting the stage for the evolution of aging per se .
Has this happened with whales ?
( What possible experiment could address the issue ? )
Whether they age or not , whales demonstrate that mammals can live at least twice as long as humans , raising the question of how they do it .
As intractable a model system as even small whales might be for the average bench scientist , it would nonetheless be fascinating to study age - related phenomena in these creatures , perhaps in a cell - culture system where we could ask questions about their cellular senescence , DNA repair , and oxidation .
Text of testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , 18 January 2007
Good afternoon , Senator Biden , and members of the committee .
It is a grave responsibility to testify before you today because the issue , the war in Iraq , is of such monumental importance .
You have asked me to address primarily the military aspects of the war .
Although I shall comply , I must emphasize that it makes no sense to separate them from the political aspects .
Military actions are merely the most extreme form of politics .
If politics is the business of deciding “ who gets what , when , how , ” as Boss Tweed of Tammany Hall in New York City once said , then the military aspects of war are the most extreme form of politics .
The war in Iraq will answer that question there .
Strategic Overview
The role that US military forces can play in that conflict is seriously limited by all the political decisions the US government has already taken .
The most fundamental decision was setting as its larger strategic purpose the stabilization of the region by building a democracy in Iraq and encouraging its spread .
This , of course , was to risk destabilizing the region by starting a war .
Military operations must be judged by whether and how they contribute to accomplishing war aims .
No clear view is possible of where we are today and where we are headed without constant focus on war aims and how they affect US interests .
The interaction of interests , war aims , and military operations defines the strategic context in which we find ourselves .
We cannot have the slightest understanding of the likely consequences of proposed changes in our war policy without relating them to the strategic context .
Here are the four major realities that define that context :
1. Confusion about war aims and US interests .
The president stated three war aims clearly and repeatedly :
* the destruction of Iraqi WMD ;
* the overthrow of Saddam Hussein ; and
* the creation of a liberal democratic Iraq .
The first war aim is moot because Iraq had no WMD .
The second was achieved by late Spring 2003 .
Today , people are waking up to what was obvious before the war — the third aim has no real prospects of being achieved even in ten or twenty years , much less in the short time anticipated by the war planners .
Implicit in that aim was the belief that a pro-American , post - Saddam regime could be established .
This too , it should now be clear , is most unlikely .
Finally , is it in the US interest to have launched a war in pursuit of any of these aims ?
And is it in the US interest to continue pursuing the third ?
Or is it time to redefine our aims ?
And , concomitantly , to redefine what constitutes victory ?
2 . The war has served primarily the interests of Iran and al - Qaeda , not American interests .
We cannot reverse this outcome by more use of military force in Iraq .
To try to do so would require siding with Sunni leaders and the Ba’athist insurgents against pro-Iranian Shi’ite groups .
The Ba’athist insurgents constitute the forces most strongly opposed to Iraqi cooperation with Iran .
At the same time , our democratization policy has installed Shi’ite majorities and pro-Iranian groups in power in Baghdad , especially in the ministries of interior and defense .
Moreover , our counterinsurgency operations are , as unintended ( but easily foreseeable ) consequences , first , greater Shi’ite openness to Iranian influence and second , al - Qaeda ’s entry into Iraq and rooting itself in some elements of Iraqi society .
3 . On the international level , the war has effectively paralyzed the United States militarily and strategically , denying it any prospect of revising its strategy toward an attainable goal .
As long as US forces remained engaged in Iraq , not only will the military costs go up , but also the incentives will decline for other states to cooperate with Washington to find a constructive outcome .
This includes not only countries contiguous to Iraq but also Russia and key American allies in Europe .
In their view , we deserve the pain we are suffering for our arrogance and unilateralism .
4 . Overthrowing the Iraqi regime in 2003 insured that the country would fragment into at least three groups ; Sunnis , Shi’ites , and Kurds .
In other words , the invasion made it inevitable that a civil war would be required to create a new central government able to control all of Iraq .
Yet a civil war does not insure it .
No faction may win the struggle .
A lengthy stalemate , or a permanent breakup of the country is possible .
The invasion also insured that outside countries and groups would become involved .
Al - Qaeda and Iran are the most conspicuous participants so far , Turkey and Syria less so .
If some of the wealthy oil - producing countries on the Arabian Peninsula are not already involved , they are most likely to support with resources any force in Iraq that opposes Iranian influence .
Many critics argue that , had the invasion been done “ right , ” such as sending in much larger forces for reestablishing security and government services , the war would have been a success .
This argument is not convincing .
Such actions might have delayed a civil war but could not have prevented it .
Therefore , any military programs or operations having the aim of trying to reverse this reality , insisting that we can now “ do it right , ” need to be treated with the deepest of suspicion .
That includes the proposal to sponsor the breakup by creating three successor states .
To do so would be to preside over the massive ethnic cleansing operations required for the successor states to be reasonably stable .
Ethnic cleansing is happening in spite of the US military in Iraq , but I see no political or moral advantage for the United States to become its advocate .
We are already being blamed as its facilitator .
Let me now turn to key aspects of the president ’s revised approach to the war , as well as several other proposals .
In addition to the president , a number of people and groups have supported increased US force levels .
As General Colin Powell has said , before we consider sending additional US troops , we must examine what missions they will have .
I would add that we ask precisely what those troops must do to reverse any of these four present realities created by the invasion .
I cannot conceive of any achievable missions they could be given to cause a reversal .
Just for purposes of analysis , let us suppose we had unlimited numbers of US troops to deploy in Iraq .
Would that change my assessment ?
In principle , if two or three million troops were deployed there with the latitude to annihilate all resistance without much attention to collateral civilian casualties and human rights , order might well be temporarily reestablished under a reign of US terror .
The problem we would then face is that we would be opposed not only by 26 million Iraqis but also by millions of Arabs and Iranians surrounding Iraq , peoples angered by our treatment of Muslims and Arabs .
These outsiders are already involved to some degree in the internal war in Iraq , and any increase of US forces is likely to be exceeded by additional outside support for insurgents .
I never cease to be amazed at our military commanders ’ apparent belief that the “ order of battle ” of the opposition forces they face are limited to Iraq .
I say “ apparent ” because those commanders may be constrained by the administration ’s policies from correcting this mistaken view .
Once the invasion began , Muslims in general and Arabs in particular could be expected to take sides against the United States .
In other words , we went to war not just against the Iraqi forces and insurgent groups but also against a large part of the Arab world , scores and scores of millions .
Most Arab governments , of course , are neutral or somewhat supportive , but their publics in growing numbers are against us .
It is a strategic error of monumental proportions to view the war as confined to Iraq .
Yet this is the implicit assumption on which the president ’s new strategy is based .
We have turned it into two wars that vastly exceed the borders of Iraq .
First , there is the war against the US occupation that draws both sympathy and material support from other Arab countries .
Second , there is the Shi’ite - Sunni war , a sectarian conflict heretofore sublimated within the Arab world but that now has opened the door to Iranian influence in Iraq .
In turn , it foreordains an expanding Iranian - Arab regional conflict .
Any military proposals today that do not account for both larger wars , as well as the Iranian threat to the Arab states on the Persian Gulf , must be judged wholly inadequate if not counterproductive .
Let me now turn to some specific proposals , those advocated by independent voices and the Iraq Study Group as well as the administration .
Specific Proposals
Standing up Iraqi security forces to replace US forces .
Training the Iraqi military and police force has been proposed repeatedly as a way to bring stability to Iraq and allow US forces to withdraw .
Recently , new variants , such as embedding US troops within Iraqi units , have been offered .
The Iraq Study Group made much of this technique .
I know of no historical precedent to suggest that any of them will succeed .
The problem is not the competency of Iraqi forces .
It is political consolidation and gaining the troops ’ loyalties to the government and their commanders as opposed to their loyalties to sectarian leaders , clans , families , and relatives .
For what political authority are Iraqi soldiers and police willing to risk their lives ?
To the American command ?
What if American forces depart ?
Wo n’t they be called traitors for supporting the invaders and occupiers ?
Will they trust in a Shi’ite - dominated government and ministry of interior , which is engaged in assassinations of Sunnis ?
Sunni Arabs and Kurds would be foolish to do so , although financial desperation has driven many to risk it .
What about to the leaders of independent militias ?
Here soldiers can find strong reasons for loyal service : to defend their fellow sectarians , families , and relatives .
And that is why the government cannot disband them .
It has insufficient loyal troops to do so .
As a military planner working on the pacification programs in 1970 - 71 in Vietnam , I had the chance to judge the results of training both regular South Vietnamese forces and so - called “ regional ” and “ popular ” forces .
Some were technically proficient , but that did not ensure that they would always fight for the government in Saigon .
Nor were they always loyal to their commanders .
And they occasionally fought each other when bribed by Viet Cong agents to do so .
The “ popular forces ” at the village level often failed to protect their villages .
The reasons varied , but in several cases it was the result of how their salaries were funded .
Local tax money was not the source of their pay ; rather it was US - supplied funds .
Thus these troops , as well as “ regional forces , ” had little sense of obligation to protect villagers in their areas of responsibility .
For anyone who doubts that the Vietnam case is instructive for understanding the Iraqi case , I recommend Ahmed S. Hashim ’s recent book , Insurgency and Counterinsurgency in Iraq .
A fluent Arab linguist and a reserve US Army colonel , who has served a year in Iraq and visited it several other times , Hashim offers a textured study that struck me again and again as a rerun of an old movie , especially where it concerned US training of Iraqi forces .
US military assistance training in El Salvador is often cited as a successful case .
In fact , this effort amounted to letting the old elites , who used death squads to impose order , come back to power in different guises .
And death squads are again active there .
The real cause of the defeat of the Salvadoran insurgency was Gorbachev ’s decision to cut off supplies to it , as he promised President George H. Bush at the Malta summit meeting .
Thus denied their resource base , and having failed to create a self - supporting tax regime in the countryside as the Viet Cong did in Vietnam , they could not survive for long .
Does the administration ’s new plan for Iraq promise to eliminate all outside support to the warring factions ?
Is it even remotely possible ?
Hardly .
The oft - cited British success in Malaysia is only superficially relevant to the Iraq case .
British officials actually ruled the country .
Thus they had decades of firsthand knowledge of the local politics .
They made such a mess of it , however , that an insurgency emerged in opposition .
A new military commander and a cleanup of the colonial administration provided political consolidation and the isolation of the communist insurgents , mostly members of an ethnic minority group .
This pattern would be impossible to duplicate in Iraq .
An infusion of new funds for reconstruction .
A shortage of funds has not been the cause of failed reconstruction efforts in Iraq .
Administrative capacity to use funds effectively was and remains the primary obstacle .
Even support programs carried out by American contractors for US forces have yielded mixed results .
Insurgent attacks on the projects have provoked transfers of construction funds to security measures , which have also failed .
A weak or nonexistent government administrative capacity allows most of the money to be squandered .
Putting another billion or so dollars into public works in Iraq today  before a government is in place with an effective administrative capacity to penetrate to the neighborhood and village level  is like trying to build a roof on a house before its walls have been erected .
Moreover , a large part of that money will find its way into the hands of insurgents and sectarian militias .
That is exactly what happened in Vietnam , and it has been happening in Iraq .
New and innovative counterinsurgency tactics .
The cottage industry of counterinsurgency tactics is old and deceptive .
When the US military has been periodically tasked to reinvent them  the last great surge in that industry was at the JFK School in Fort Bragg in the 1960 ’s  it has no choice but to pretend that counterinsurgency tactics can succeed where no political consolidation in the government has yet been achieved .
New counterinsurgency tactics cannot save Iraq today because they are designed without account for the essence of any “ internal war , ” whether an insurgency or a civil war .
Such wars are about “ who will rule , ” and who will rule depends on “ who can tax ” and build an effective state apparatus down to the village level .
The taxation issue is not even on the agenda of US programs for Iraq .
Nor was it a central focus in Vietnam , El Salvador , the Philippines , and most other cases of US - backed governments embroiled in internal wars .
Where US funding has been amply provided to those governments , the recipient regime has treated those monies as its tax base while failing to create an indigenous tax base .
In my own study of three counterinsurgency cases , and from my experience in Vietnam , I discovered that the regimes that received the least US direct fiscal support had the most success against the insurgents .
Providing funding and forces to give an embattled regime more “ time ” to gain adequate strength is like asking a drunk to drink more whiskey in order to sober up .
Saddam ’s regime lived mostly on revenues from oil exports .
Thus it never had to create an effective apparatus to collect direct taxes .
Were US forces and counterinsurgency efforts to succeed in imposing order for a time , the issue of who will control the oil in Iraq would become the focus of conflict for competing factions .
The time would not be spent creating the administrative capacity to keep order and to collect sufficient taxes to administer the country .
At best , the war over who will eventually rule country would only be postponed .
This is the crux of the dilemma facing all such internal wars .
I make this assertion not only based on my own study , but also in light of considerable literature that demonstrates that the single best index of the strength of any state is its ability to collect direct taxes , not export - import tax or indirect taxes .
The latter two are relatively easy to collect by comparison , requiring much weaker state institutions .
The Iraq Study Group .
The report of this group should not be taken as offering a new or promising strategy for dealing with Iraq .
Its virtue lies in its candid assessment of the realities in Iraq .
Its great service has been to undercut the misleading assessments , claims , and judgment by the administration .
It allows the several skeptical Republican members of the Congress to speak out more candidly on the war , and it makes it less easy for those Democrats who were heretofore supporters of the administration ’s war to refuse to reconsider .
If one reads the ISG report in light of the four points in the strategic overview above , one sees the key weakness of its proposals .
It does not concede that the war , as it was conceived and continues to be fought , is not “ winnable . ”
It rejects the rapid withdrawal of US forces as unacceptable .
No doubt a withdrawal will leave a terrible aftermath in Iraq , but we cannot avoid that .
We can only make it worse by waiting until we are forced to withdraw .
In the meantime , we prevent ourselves from escaping the paralysis imposed on us by the war , unable to redefine our war aims , which have served Iranian and al - Qaeda interests instead of our own .
I do not criticize the report for this failure .
As constructed , the group could not advance a fundamental revision of our strategy .
Its Republican and Democrat members could not be said to represent all members of their own parties .
Thus the most it could do was to make it politically easier for the administration to begin a fundamental revision of its strategy instead of offering a list of tactical changes for the same old war aim of creating a liberal democracy with a pro-American orientation in Iraq .
What Would a Revised Strategy Look Like ?
How can the United States recover from this strategic blunder ?
It can not as long as fails to revise its war aims .
Wise leaders in war have many times admitted that their war aims are misguided and then revised them to deal with realities beyond their control .
Such leaders make tactical withdrawals , regroup , and revise their aims , and design new strategies to pursue them .
Those who cannot make such adjustments eventually face defeat .
What war aim today is genuinely in the US interest and offers realistic prospects of success ?
And not just in Iraq but in the larger region ?
Since the 1950 ’s , the US aim in this region has been “ regional stability ” above all others .
The strategy for achieving this aim of every administration until the present one has been maintaining a regional balance of power among three regional forces 
Arabs , Israelis , and Iranians .
The Arab - Persian conflict is older than the Arab - Israeli conflict .
The United States kept a diplomatic foothold in all three camps until the fall of the shah ’s regime in Iran .
Losing its footing in Tehran , it began under President Carter ’s leadership to compensate by building what he called the Persian Gulf Security Framework .
The US Central Command with enhanced military power was born as one of the main means for this purpose , but the long - term goal was a rapprochement .
Until that time , the military costs for maintaining the regional power balance would be much higher .
The Reagan Administration , although it condemned Carter ’s Persian Gulf Security Framework , the so - called “ Carter Doctrine , ” continued Carter ’s policies , even to the point of supporting Iraq when Iran was close to overrunning it .
Some of its efforts to improve relations with Iran were feckless and counterproductive , but it maintained the proper strategic aim  regional stability .
The Bush Administration has broken with this strategy by invading Iraq and also by threatening the existence of the regime in Iran .
It presumed that establishing a liberal democracy in Iraq would lead to regional stability .
In fact , the policy of spreading democracy by force of arms has become the main source of regional instability .
This not only postponed any near - term chance of better relations with Iran , but also has moved the United States closer to losing its footing in the Arab camp as well .
That , of course , increases greatly the threats to Israel ’s security , the very thing it was supposed to improve , not to mention that it makes the military costs rise dramatically , exceeding what we can prudently bear , especially without the support of our European allies and others .
Several critics of the administration show an appreciation of the requirement to regain our allies and others ’ support , but they do not recognize that withdrawal of US forces from Iraq is the sine qua non for achieving their cooperation .
It will be forthcoming once that withdrawal begins and looks irreversible .
They will then realize that they can no longer sit on the sidelines .
The aftermath will be worse for them than for the United States , and they know that without US participation and leadership , they alone cannot restore regional stability .
Until we understand this critical point , we cannot design a strategy that can achieve what we can legitimately call a victory .
Any new strategy that does realistically promise to achieve regional stability at a cost we can prudently bear , and does not regain the confidence and support of our allies , is doomed to failure .
To date , I have seen no awareness that any political leader in this country has gone beyond tactical proposals to offer a different strategic approach to limiting the damage in a war that is turning out to be the greatest strategic disaster in our history .

At present day it is estimated that about 300,000 people in the USA smoke marijuana for medical purposes , according to ASA data on registered users .
The list of states that allow marijuana use continues to grow .
In April , New Mexico joined the list of 11 states allowing marijuana treatment .
The issue is rarely aroused in court , however more and more employers feel concerned about a worker smoking marijuana during his working hours .
Many companies believe that marijuana use influences employee performance and increases the possibility of accidents at workplace .
So they conduct special tests to reveal the drug users .
If a worker tests positive for the drug , he gets fired , even in case marijuana smoking is sanctioned by the state for medical treatment .
Naturally , employers wonder whether the state laws sanctioning medical marijuana would protect their interests if a worker who used marijuana to relieve pain injured his co-workers or made a job mistake .
It is difficult for example to employ a truck driver smoking marijuana .
Meanwhile , companies in New York and other states that so far prohibit medical marijuana debate over the issue .
Employers are looking for clear answers concerning the matter , as they face a lot of uncertainty .
The majority of the companies ' managers have doubts about clearness of mind of marijuana - smokers .
Some employers say they would create flexible working hours schedule for the employed marijuana users .
Yet , at present day the states with medical marijuana laws do not ask employers to make any accommodations for using the drug in the workplace .
Many employers are not sure whether they can fire or deny people smoking medical marijuana , or whether it is possible to accommodate them by giving permission to use marijuana only at home or in a special smoking room at work .
In some states allowing medical marijuana , patients may take the drug at special dispensaries .
Other states provide authorized caregivers who take care of growing a limited number of marijuana .
According to the Marijuana Policy Project , there have been cases of patients getting their marijuana on the black market .
Federal law still prohibits marijuana use .
Medical marijuana users are usually not prosecuted .
However , people authorized by states for growing or using medical marijuana still face the risk of being arrested by federal officials .
The law conflict leads to real confusion of people involved in the matter .
Marijuana is used by patients who suffer from AIDS or HIV , cancer , hepatitis C , glaucoma , Crohn 's disease , and multiple sclerosis .
Some doctors support medical marijuana to get relief from such symptoms as pain and depression , nausea from their chemotherapy , and loss of appetite .
Yet , not all medical organizations approve marijuana as a pain reliever .
Some of them warn that the substance is of a very high risk for abuse and its use lacks the necessary safety .
Some organizations support the idea the drug has to be studied thoroughly for revealing its influence on patients .

I have read this at linuxinsight , which is amazing .
You can actually record down your typing , screen output even you are running ncurses cli , all the data will store into a file and the timing will be into another file .
With this two files , you can have scriptreplay to replay it all with the correct timing .
Recording goes like this
script -t 2 > tutorial.timing - a tutorial.session
type ‘ exit ’ to end the recording .
Replay goes like this
scriptreplay tutorial.timing tutorial.session
Both session and timing file is readable , if you do not need to be replay , just do
script - a tutorial.txt
You might be asking what have script did ?
logged your input as well as screen output ?
That means the password will be recorded as well when you do sudo ?
The answer is NO , script save only the things that is visible to you , not your keyboard hit .
Same things goes to scriptreplay , it just play what ever is recorded , no real command executing during replay .
I found that generating and replay with two files ( session and timing files ) is a bit messy .
Therefore I created a bash script to cater that , I name it as script.sh .
it will be creating only one file ( it is just a dirty trick , read the bash script you will understand ) , replay and record uses script.sh is convenience .
To record ,
./script.sh -r
To play ,
./script.sh -p
Get script.sh and try it out .
Remember to chmod +x after extract from the tar ball .
Oh ya , I included my output file here – matrix , download it and try to play with script.sh .
./script.sh -p matrix
Have Fun :)

Mr Karzai looked visibly angry
He criticised his Western allies ' " extreme " use of force and said they should act as his government asked .
" Innocent people are becoming victims of reckless operations " because the troops had ignored Afghan advice for years , Mr Karzai told reporters .
He was speaking after a week in which up to 90 Afghan civilians were killed .
More civilians have been killed this year as a result of foreign military action than have been killed by insurgents , correspondents say .
Separately , rockets fired by coalition forces in Afghanistan killed at least nine Pakistani civilians , the Pakistan military said on Saturday .
Coalition forces were fighting militants in Afghanistan close to the Pakistan border when a few rockets came across the frontier , hitting a house .
Pakistan is demanding an explanation , a spokesman said .
Nato said about 60 militants in Afghanistan had been killed in the offensive .
' Indiscriminate '
Mr Karzai was speaking a day after the head of Nato called for an investigation into an air strike in the Afghan province of Helmand in which 25 civilians were killed .
The importance of not killing civilians cannot be overestimated
BBC's Alastair Leithead
Q&A : Readers ' questions
" You do n't fight a terrorist by firing a field gun 37 km ( 24 miles ) away into a target .
That 's definitely , surely bound to cause civilian casualties , " he said .
The south of the country has seen the worst violence since the Taleban were ousted from power in 2001 by US - led troops .
Accusing international forces of consistently failing to co-ordinate with their Afghan colleagues , Mr Karzai said that , in future , every military operation should be co-ordinated directly with his government , in accordance with written plans he said already existed .
" As you are aware over the past several days , as result of indiscriminate and imprecise operations of Nato and coalition forces , our people suffered casualties , " Mr Karzai told reporters in Kabul , looking visibly angry .
" We are thankful for their help to Afghanistan .
But that does not mean that Afghan lives have no value .
Afghan life is not cheap and it should not be treated as such , " he said .
' One too many '
There are two international missions in Afghanistan .
One is the Nato - led Isaf , with 37,000 troops from 37 countries including the US .
Its aim is to help the Afghan government bring security , development and better governance .
The US - led coalition - under the banner of Operation Enduring Freedom - is a counter - terrorism mission that involves mainly special forces .
Both have recently been involved in heavy clashes with insurgents .
Speaking in Quebec City , Canada , on Friday Nato 's secretary general Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said no Nato , coalition or Afghan soldier would knowingly take aim at a civilian , and accused the Taleban of using civilians as human shields .
" Each innocent civilian victim is one too many , " he said .
" Unfortunately it happens . "

It was the drug that fuelled the psychedelic 60s - and was tested as a weapon by MI6 .
But whatever became of LSD ?
Duncan Campbell traces its colourful past , and finds that the acidheads are still out there
' I was seeing what Adam had seen on the morning of his creation - the miracle , moment by moment , of naked existence ... flowers shining with their inner light and all but quivering under the pressure with which they were charged ... words like ' grace ' and ' transfiguration ' came to mind . "
That was the writer Aldous Huxley extolling the benefits of LSD from his vantage point in the Hollywood Hills in 1953 , and he remained , right up to his death - and possibly beyond - an admirer of the substance .
He even took it on his deathbed in 1963 so that he could enter the afterlife with , as it were , his doors of perception wide open .
Some of LSD 's other proponents are still with us .
Albert Hofmann , the biochemical researcher credited with discovering LSD in Switzerland in 1943 - he described it as his " problem child " - celebrated his 100th birthday in Basle last year .
But where does LSD feature in the drugs firmament today ?
This month sees the updated republication , after 20 years , of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love by David May and Stewart Tendler , the book that charted the history of the LSD counter - culture and the so - called Brotherhood that distributed it so energetically in the 60s and 70s .
The book 's epilogue brings us up to date with the surviving members of the tale .
LSD has certainly had a long , strange trip since it gained worldwide attention in the 60s .
Timothy Leary , its most famous promoter , dropped out of his earthly existence in 1996 and his ashes were , appropriately enough , blasted into space .
His book ,
The Politics of Ecstasy , still sells well and there have been reports in the past few months of plans for various feature films .
One of them would involve Leonardo DiCaprio , who knew Leary and has always been interested in a life that involved espousing the drug , being busted , escaping from prison , holing up in Algeria and eventually ending up on the lecture circuit as a double - act with the Watergate burglar Gordon Liddy .
Augustus Stanley Owsley III , the San Francisco chemist who produced the famous " Owsley " dosages of LSD , is now in his 70s .
He has long since left the production game and lives in Australia , where he sells jewellery , carvings and music from a website under his nickname , Bear .
Owsley , described by US agents as " the man who did for LSD what Henry Ford did for the motorcar " and called " God 's secret agent " by Leary , also writes essays on his website , still campaigning against the drugs laws and arguing that " the use of substances which alter in various ways the consciousness of man is an extremely ancient and established practice . "
The Brotherhood of Eternal Love ran the drug 's largest international network , stretching from California to Hawaii and Afghanistan , with a UK branch in the unlikely spot of Broadstairs , Kent .
Described by the California department of justice as " a pseudo - religious organisation responsible for the manufacture and distribution of LSD on a worldwide level " , it operated more or less with impunity between 1966 and 1971 and had an estimated 750 people involved before it came unstuck .
Many of them ended up behind bars , but some are still out there , somewhere , hoping that the FBI has forgotten them .
Britain's best - known LSD network , which prompted what became known as Operation Julie , included a couple of doctors , two chemists , a teacher and an author .
A total of 15 people were jailed for up to 13 years at Bristol crown court in 1978 after they were infiltrated by undercover police , some of whom inadvertently ingested some of the drug and had their own trippy experiences .
The drug also had a sinister sub - life within the intelligence world : the CIA experimented with it and even made an unsuccessful attempt to slip some into Fidel Castro 's system before he made a TV broadcast .
In Britain , in the 50s , servicemen were given the drug without being told , so that MI6 could study its effects .
Last year , three of the servicemen received thousands of pounds in damages for being used as unwitting guinea pigs .
One had described seeing , " Salvador Dali - style faces and cracks in people 's faces " .
He had been told the tabs he was instructed to take were an attempt to find a cure for the common cold .
Officially , the production and use of LSD have diminished considerably since the days when psychedelia was fashionable , but there is still a strong underground market .
" The interesting thing about LSD is that 20 years ago it cost £ 1.75 and it still costs about the same today , " says Mike Jay , a trustee of the drugs policy foundation Transform and author of The Emperor of Dreams , a history of drugs in the 19th century .
" It tends to be distributed now by enthusiasts rather than profiteers .
It 's an insider market and it's a seasonal thing .
Every May or June , reasonably large amounts come in from California and Holland .
The quality is quite good and it's not watered down as it was in the 70s and 80s . "
" It is used much less than even a few years ago , " says Matt McNamee of the drugs advice organisation Release .
" People usually still put much more spiritual significance into it ; they prepare for it in a way they do n't with most other drugs . "
Users preferred the notion of taking LSD while " running across meadows with wildflowers " rather than ingesting it in a noisy club , he says .
Dr Luke Mitcheson , a clinical psychologist with the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust , has just published with colleagues a study of hallucinogens among UK dance users .
They noted that " the marked decline in LSD prevalence would seem very curious ...
One possibility is that LSD 's much longer duration is less compatible with leisure lifestyles that are organised around an evening out . "
But there are still risks for anyone seeking to produce the drug , and dealing in it carries a 14 - year jail sentence .
In 2000 , there was a spectacular bust in Kansas when William Pickard and Clyde Apperson were arrested by Drugs Enforcement Administration agents as they tried to move their mobile lab out of a grain silo .
The agents claimed to have found 41.3 kilos ( 90lbs ) of the drug - enough , they said , to make an estimated 10 million doses .
But by 2004 , a total of just 317,321 doses were seized worldwide .
Seizures in this country are relatively tiny - around 7,000 doses in 2004 , the last year for which figures are available .
Jay reckons that well over 90 % of the LSD trafficked around the world is below the radar of customs officers as it remains one of the easiest of drugs to smuggle , whether in liquid form - in , say , a nasal spray , or on blotting paper hidden in a book or wallet .

" The Brotherhood exists .
We are still brothers because we shared the light .
The Brotherhood is still there between us .
So has the Brotherhood died ?
No , of course not " .

Summary : Having a good designer does n't eliminate the need for a systematic usability process .
Risk reduction and quality improvement both require user testing and other usability methods .
I often hear the following argument against usability : Just hire a great designer , and you do n't have to worry about that pesky user testing .
After all , a great designer will create a great design , and that 's all you need .
The most common example given is Steve Jobs .
Granted , Jobs has been in charge of some great products .
He 's also produced many duds as well , the most famous being the NeXT machine and the Mac Cube .
Even the Macintosh was very nearly a failure , being saved in the nick of time by Adobe and the advent of desktop publishing .
( And , of course , the Mac 's usability is more properly credited to Jef Raskin and Larry Tesler 's user studies in the Lisa group than to Jobs himself . )
In any case , Steve Jobs is a design manager , not a designer .
Having top executives who understand interaction design and care about user experience quality is indeed a boon .
The willingness to delay or cancel a project because of bad UI is rare in the technology business , but it 's necessary if a company wants to build a reputation for good products .
Turning to actual designers , it 's certainly true that you 're better off hiring a good designer over a bad one .
Likewise , a good usability specialist is better than a bad usability specialist , a good programmer is better than a bad programmer , a good writer is better than a bad writer , and a good marketing manager is better than a bad marketing manager .
In all the various disciplines that come together to create a successful interface design , you should hire the best staff you can get .
The Limits of Genius Design
The real question is not whether you should use a good designer , but whether using a good designer eliminates the need for a good usability person .
It does n't .
It 's wrong to rely solely on a " genius designer " for several reasons :
You must run your project with the team you actually have , not the team you wish you had .
In most companies , you wo n't find one of the world 's top 100 interaction designers waiting around to work on your project .
, not the team you wish you had .
In most companies , you wo n't find one of the world 's top 100 interaction designers waiting around to work on your project .
Design is an inexact science ; even if you have a superb designer , not all of his or her ideas will be equally great .
It 's only prudent to reduce risk and subject design ideas to a reality check by user testing them with actual customers .
( Remember , new ideas can be tested at low cost through techniques like agile paper prototypes . )

How do designers get to be good in the first place ?
By learning which of their ideas work and which do n't .
This feedback requires empirical data , which usability testing provides .

Even the best designers produce successful products only if their designs solve the right problems .
A wonderful interface to the wrong features will fail .
And how can designers find out what customers need ?
Through user research .

And how can designers find out what customers need ?
Through user research .
Nobody 's perfect .
Even a very good design can be improved when you follow an iterative process of continuous quality improvements .
For each step of the design , you should conduct a usability evaluation ( testing or guideline review ) , and use the resulting insights as the step - climbing metric to drive your user experience to the next level of quality .
Several decades ' experience with quality assurance says that the best results come from following a systematic quality process , including reality checks every step of the way , rather than simply hoping that you got it right .
Best Principles and Practices
As an analogy , consider accounting .
As with designers , it 's better to have a good accountant than a bad one .
But in either case , your accountant should follow GAAP ( the generally accepted accounting principles , published by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ) .
Best practices exist for a reason , and your risk of failing a tax audit is dramatically reduced when your accountant does n't just make things up on the fly .
Similarly , user experience and website success benefit from following best practices in the form of documented usability guidelines , as opposed to making up your own , inconsistent UI .
The difference between design and accounting is that under rare circumstances you can get a better design by deviating from the generally accepted usability principles .
But how do you know whether your case is indeed one of those rare exceptions ?
You could guess .
But it 's much safer to run a study to find out for sure .
To summarize :
Scientists could generate a black hole as often as every second when the world 's most powerful particle accelerator comes online in 2007 .
This potential " black hole factory " has raised fears that a stray black hole could devour our planet whole .
The Lifeboat Foundation , a nonprofit organization devoted to safeguarding humanity from what it considers threats to our existence , has stated that artificial black holes could " threaten all life on Earth " and so it proposes to set up " self - sustaining colonies elsewhere . "
But the chance of planetary annihilation by this means " is totally miniscule , " experimental physicist Greg Landsberg at Brown University in Providence , R.I. , told LiveScience .
Black holes possible
The accelerator , known as the Large Hadron Collider , is under construction in an underground circular tunnel nearly 17 miles long at the world 's largest physics laboratory , CERN , near Geneva .
Black holes are among a handful of threats to the planet .
But Earth is more resilient than you might think . >>>
At its maximum , each particle beam the collider fires will pack as much energy as a 400 - ton train traveling at 120 mph .
By smashing particles together and investigating the debris , scientists hope to help solve mysteries such as the origin of mass and why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe .
If theories about the universe containing extra dimensions other than those of space and time are correct , the accelerator might also generate black holes , Landsberg and his colleague Savas Dimopoulos at Stanford University in California calculated in 2001 .
Physicists Steve Giddings at the University of California , Santa Barbara and Scott Thomas at Stanford University in California reached similar conclusions .
Black holes possess gravitational fields so strong that nothing can escape them , not even light .
They normally form when the remains of a dead star collapse under their own gravity , squeezing their mass together .
Although black holes can't be seen , astronomers infer their existence by the gravitational effects they have on gas and stars around them .
Making black holes
A number of models of the universe suggest extra dimensions of reality exist that are each folded up into sizes ranging from as tiny as a proton , or roughly a millionth of a billionth of a meter , to as big as a fraction of a millimeter .
At distances comparable to the size of these extra dimensions , gravity becomes far stronger , these models suggest .
If this is true , the collider will cram enough energy together to initiate gravitational collapses that produce black holes .
If any of the models are right , the accelerator should create a black hole anywhere from every second to every day , each roughly possessing 5,000 times the mass of a proton and each a thousandth of a proton in size or smaller , Landsberg said .
Still , any fears that such black holes will consume the Earth are groundless , Landsberg said .
For one thing , theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking calculated all black holes should emit radiation , and that tiny black holes should lose more mass than they absorb , evaporating within a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second , " before they could gobble up any significant amount of matter , " Landsberg said .
Not destroyed yet
CERN spokesman and former research physicist James Gillies also pointed out that Earth is bathed with cosmic rays powerful enough to create black holes all the time , and the planet has n't been destroyed yet .
" Still , let 's assume that even if Hawking is a genius , he 's wrong , and that such black holes are more stable , " Landsberg said .
Nearly all of the black holes will be traveling fast enough from the accelerator to escape Earth 's gravity .
" Even if you produced 10 million black holes a year , only 10 would basically get trapped , orbiting around its center , " Landsberg said .
However , such trapped black holes are so tiny , they could pass through a block of iron the distance from the Earth to the Moon and not hit anything .
They would each take about 100 hours to gobble up one proton .
At that rate , even if one did not take into account the fact that each black hole would slow down every time it gobbled up a proton , and thus suck down matter at an even slower rate , " about 100 protons would be destroyed every year by such a black hole , so it would take much more than the age of universe to destroy even one milligram of Earth material , " Landsberg concluded .
" It 's quite hard to destroy the Earth . "
If the Large Hadron Collider does create black holes , not only will it prove that extra dimensions of the universe exist , but the radiation that decaying black holes emit could yield clues that help finally unite all the current ideas about the forces of nature under a " theory of everything . "
Since the dawn of the electricity in the home , there 's been one problem universal with power outlets the world over : they 're just too damned hard to electrocute yourself with .
Thankfully we have visionaries like Art Lebedev to help solve these vexing problems with innovative new products like the Vilcus dactyloadapter .
Simply insert fingers into the receptacles , and insert the Vilkus into the electrical outlet of your choice for a few soothing , ( heart ) muscle - relaxing volts .
Replaceable plugs for Euro an US slots mean you can take advantage of the grid at home or abroad , and when paired up with a Rozetkus or power splitter means circuit - breaking fun for gatherings of friends and family
If more people knew the facts , a few of the great history - makers would be recognised ( anyone heard of Ub Iwerks ? ) , some famous people would stop taking so much credit , and we would stop blaming apples for everything !
Let ’s start with the following misconceptions …
20 .
Eve ate a bad apple
An apple a day might keep the doctor away , but they have still had bad publicity as the “ forbidden fruit ” that Eve tasted in the Garden of Eden , thereby making life difficult for all of us .
Yet nowhere in the biblical story of Adam and Eve is an apple mentioned .
It is simply called “ the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden ” ( Genesis 3:3 ) .
OK , it COULD have been an apple , but it might just as well have been an apricot , a mango , or any other sort of fruit .
19 . Newton was hit by an apple
Apples continued to get bad press with the famous story that scientist Sir Isaac Newton was under a tree , minding his own business , when an apple fell on his head .
Just as well it provided him the inspiration for the laws of gravity , or the poor apple would never be forgiven !
But while the falling apple is a good story , it probably never happened .
The story was first published in an essay by Voltaire , long after Newton ’s death .
Before that , Newton ’s niece , Catherine Conduitt , was the only person who ever told the story .
It was almost certainly an invention .
18 . Walt Disney drew Mickey Mouse
One of the world ’s most famous fictitious characters , Mickey Mouse , is credited to Walt Disney .
However , Mickey was the vision of Disney ’s number one animator , Ub Iwerks .
Disney , never a great artist , would always have trouble drawing the character who made him famous .
Fortunately for him , Iwerks was known as the fastest animator in the business .
He single - handedly animated Mickey ’s first short film , Plane Crazy ( 1928 ) , in only two weeks .
( That ’s 700 drawings a day . )
But give some credit to Disney – when sound films began later that year , he played Mickey ’s voice .
17 . Marie Antoinette said “ Let them each cake ”
In 1766 , Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote of an incident he recalled from some 25 years earlier , in which “ a great princess ” ( name unknown ) was told that the country people had no bread .
“ Then let them eat cake , ” she replied .
When Rousseau wrote of this , Marie Antoinette was an 11 - year - old child in Austria .
The French Revolution would not begin for another 23 years .
The myth that she spoke these infamous words was probably spread by revolutionary propagandists , to illustrate her cold indifference to the plight of the French people .
In the next chapter of this list , we uncover a tall tale about Napoleon , and find out how witches did NOT die , whatever you might have heard …
16 . The Great Train Robbery was the first feature film
When it was released in 1903 , “ The Great Train Robbery ” pioneered several techniques , includes jump cuts , medium close - ups and a complex storyline .
But the first feature film ?
It was only ten minutes long !
Even most short films are longer than that .
The first feature - length film was a 100 - minute Australian film , “ The Story of the Kelly Gang ” , released three years later .
Even if you think of a feature film as the “ feature ” of a cinema program , the title would go to one of a number of French films made during the 1890s ( but I wo n’t name one , as that could cause any number of arguments ) .
15 . Van Gogh sliced off his ear
Van Gogh is known as the archetypal starving artist , only selling one painting in his lifetime , and – in a quarrel with Gauguin – slicing off his ear , not long before committing suicide .
Though he did face a tragic end , and his own paintings sold poorly , it is worth noting that he spent most of his life teaching and dealing art .
He only spent eight years of his life painting , which helps to explain why he did n’t starve to death .
Also , he did n’t slice off his entire ear , just a portion of his left lobe .
Painful , but not nearly as bad as you might have thought .
14 . Witches were burned at stake in Salem
The Salem ( Massachusetts ) witch trials of 1692 led to the arrests of 150 people , of whom 31 were tried and 20 were executed .
But just as these trials were based on ignorance , there are many misconceptions about them .
For starters , the 31 condemned “ witches ” were not all women .
Six of them were men .
Also , they were not burned at stake .
As any witch - hunter would know , a true witch could never be killed by this method .
Hanging was the usual method – though one was crushed to death under heavy stones .
13 . Napoleon was a little corporal
Some people believe that Napoleon ’s domineering ambitions were to compensate for being so physically small .
Not so .
True , Napoleon was called Le Petit Corporal ( “ The Little Corporal ” ) , but he was 5 feet , 7 inches tall – taller than the average eighteenth - century Frenchman .
So why the nickname ?
Early in his military career , soldiers used it to mock his relatively low rank .
The name stuck , even as he became ruler of France .
12 . King John signed the Magna Carta
The Magna Carta ( Great Charter ) is known as a landmark in history , limiting the power of the King of England and sowing the seeds of democracy .
Paintings show King John reluctantly signing the Magna Carta in a meadow at Runnymede in 1215 .
Fair enough , except for one thing .
As well as being a rogue , John was probably illiterate .
As anyone could see from looking at one of the four original Magna Cartas in existence , he simply provided the royal seal .
No signature required .
11 . Walter Raleigh introduced potatoes and tobacco to England
Sir Walter Raleigh – explorer , courtier , privateer – Is one of greatest myth figures ever to come from England .
Virtually every reason for his fame is untrue .
Was he handsome ?
According to written accounts , he was no oil painting – though somehow he charmed Queen Elizabeth I , and had a reputation as a ladies ’ man .
Did he lay his cloak across a puddle so that the Queen could step on it ?
No , that was pure fiction .
Most importantly , he did n’t return from his visit to the New World ( America ) with England ’s first potatoes and tobacco .
Though Raleigh is said to have introduced potatoes in 1586 , they were first grown in Italy in 1585 , and quickly spread throughout Europe ( even across the English Channel ) .
Also , though people all over Europe blame Sir Walter for their cigarette addictions , Jean Nicot ( for whom nicotine is named ) introduced tobacco to France in 1560 .
Tobacco spread to England from France , not the New World .
10 . Magellan circumnavigated the world
Everyone knows two things about Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan .
One , he was the first man to circumnavigate the world ; and two , during this historic trip , he was killed by natives in the Philippines .
Of course , those two things tend to contradict each other .
Magellan only made it half - way around the world , leaving it to his second - in - command , Juan Sebastian Elcano , to complete the circumnavigation .
9 . Nero fiddled while Rome burned
We all know the story of mad Emperor Nero starting the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD , then fiddling while the city burned .
However , this would have been impossible .
For one thing , the violin would n’t be invented for another 1,600 years .
OK , some versions of the story suggest that he played a lute or a lyre – but then , scholars place the emperor in his villa at Antium , 30 miles away , when the fire began .
Though he was innocent of this disaster , however , there is much evidence to show that he was ruthless and depraved .
8. Captain Cook discovered Australia
Many Australians will agree that this is n’t so – but for the wrong reasons .
They will point out that , many years before Cook arrived in Sydney in 1770 , Australia had already been visited by Dutchmen Abel Tasman and Dirk Hartog , and an English buccaneer , William Dampier .
Of course , it had been previously been discovered some 50,000 years earlier by the indigenous Australians .
But in fairness to Cook , he did discover a new part of the country – and more importantly , this led to the first white settlers ( an opportunity that Tasman , Hartog and Dampier did n’t take ) .
So let ’s say that Cook DID discover Australia !
Fine , but Cook was actually a Lieutenant when he sailed to the Great South Land .
The “ captain ” rank might be a minor point , but it ’s certainly inaccurate – and as he is called “ Captain Cook ” so often that it might as well be his name , it ’s one worth correcting .
7. Shakespeare wrote the story of Hamlet
William Shakespeare is generally known as the greatest playwright who ever lived , even though most of his plays were not original , but adaptations of earlier stories .
“ The Tragedy of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark ” ( 1603 ) , probably his most famous play , was based on an ancient Scandinavian story .
But while it might not have been the original version of the story , we can safely assume it was the best .
6. America became independent on July 4 , 1776
Hold the fireworks !
As most American school children ( and many non-American ones ) are aware , America ’s founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4 , 1776 .
However , the war raged for another seven years before independence from England was finally granted on September 3 , 1783 .
On that day , Britain ’s George III and US leaders signed the Definitive Treaty of Peace .
5. Edison invented the electric light
Thomas Edison is known as the world ’s greatest inventor .
His record output – 1,093 patents – still amazes us , over a century later .
Astonishing , except for one thing : he did n’t invent most of them .
Most Edison inventions were the work of his unsung technicians – and his most famous invention , the electric light , did n’t even belong to his laboratory .
Four decades before Edison was born , English scientist Sir Humphry Davy invented arc lighting ( using a carbon filament ) .
For many years , numerous innovators would improve on Davy ’s model .
The only problem : none could glow for more than twelve hours before the filament broke .
The achievement of Edison ’s lab was to find the right filament that would burn for days on end .
A major achievement , but not the first .
4. Columbus proved that the Earth was round
It was American author Washington Irving , some 500 years after Columbus sailed to America , who first portrayed the Italian explorer as launching on his voyage to prove that the Earth was round , defying the common , flat - earther belief of the time .
In fact , most educated Europeans in Columbus ’s day knew that the world was round .
Since the fourth century BC , almost nobody has believed that the Earth is flat .
Even if that was n’t the case , Columbus would never have set out to prove that the Earth was round … simply because he did n’t believe it himself !
Columbus thought that the Earth was pear - shaped .
He set sail to prove something else : that Asia was much closer than anyone thought .
Even in this , he was wrong .
To further besmirch his memory , it should also be noted that he never set foot on mainland America .
The closest he came was the Bahamas .
Pear - shaped , indeed !
3. Gandhi liberated India
To westerners , Mahatma Gandhi is easily the most famous leader of India ’s independence movement .
He deserves credit for promoting the ancient ideals of ahimsa ( non-violence ) .
However , most historians agree that Indian independence was inevitable .
Gandhi was just one of several independence leaders .
The Indian National Congress was founded as early as 1885 , when he was only 16 .
Gandhi ’s much publicised civil disobedience was only a small part in the movement , and some historians even suggest that India would have achieved independence sooner if they had focused on the more forceful methods that they had used 50 years earlier , and which were still advocated by other independence leaders , such as Gandhi ’s rival Netaji Chandra Bose ( who is also revered in India ) .
2. Jesus was born on December 25
Christmas is meant to celebrate the birth of Jesus , but there is no evidence whatsoever , biblical or otherwise , that He was actually born on that day .
Nor is there anything to suggest that He was born in a manger , or that there were three wise men ( although , as any nativity play will remind you , three gifts were mentioned ) .
There are differing views as to why December 25 was chosen as Christmas day , but one of the most interesting is that the day was already celebrated by followers of Mithras , the central god of a Hellenistic cult that developed in the Eastern Mediterranean around 100 BC .
The followers of this faith believed that Mithras was born of a virgin on 25 December , and that his birth was attended by shepherds …
Which brings us to the number one historical myth – something that is drilled into the heads of nearly all American schoolchildren …
1. George Washington was America ’s first President
Everyone “ knows ” that Washington was the first of the ( so far ) 43 Presidents of the US .
However , this is n’t strictly the case .
During the American Revolution , the Continental Congress ( or the ‘ United States in Congress Assembled ’ ) chose Peyton Randolph as the first President .
Under Randolph , one of their first moves was to create the Continental Army ( in defence against Britain ) , appointing General Washington as its commander .
Randolph was succeeded in 1781 by John Hancock , who presided over independence from Great Britain ( see myth # 6 ) .
After Washington defeated the British at the Battle of Yorktown , Hancock sent him a note of congratulations .
Washington ’s reply was addressed to “ The President of the United States ” .
Eight years later , as a revered war hero , Washington himself became America ’s first popularly elected President – but strictly speaking , the FIFTEENTH President !

Introduction
The Windows community is a universe of uniformity in which users depend on robust commercial applications and standard graphical utilities .
With the Vista release right around the proverbial corner , Microsoft is engaged in much - needed reinvention .
Those of you that have kept up with the Redmond renaissance know that Microsoft will soon unleash a number of powerful new developer frameworks and software construction utilities .
It is clear that our favorite software giant plans to cultivate a culture of developer empowerment .
On the Linux platform , the text - based shell is the nexus of computational control and the point at which proper articulation of will can transform commands into consequences .
The emulated DOS command shell found in Windows is a shallow farce by comparison , and Microsoft has done little over the years to imbue it with greater power .
Now Microsoft is prepared to augment its antiquated command line with a revolutionary new shell that will provide Windows users with a whole new level of control .
The Microsoft Command Shell ( MSH ) features a unique object oriented syntax , extensive support for versatile .NET technology , and an adequate assortment of commands .
Available for free download from Microsoft's Beta site , the second MSH beta release provides profound insights into the future of the Windows command line .
Since the release of the beta , the features and functions of the Microsoft Command Shell have been a topic of discussion in the Orbiting HQ .
How does MSH compare with Linux shell technologies ?
Does it increase user efficiency or is it more trouble than it is worth ?
In an attempt to answer those questions and many others , I decided to put it to the test .
Now you can learn what the fuss is all about as we explore the myriad mysteries of MSH .
This is a moderately technical overview and it contains content that may be difficult for nonprogrammers to grasp , so those of you that do n't have a background in software development may want to skip around and ignore some of the technical details .
Rest assured , there is plenty of content here for regular users and system administrators as well as coders .
The code samples are instructive by themselves , so if you get really bored , perusal of the examples will illuminate many of the features of MSH and save you some time .
A concise introduction to .NET
From an architectural standpoint , the .NET platform ( pronounced " dot net " ) resembles Parrot and J2EE .
The platform consists of a portable development framework and runtime environment that facilitate construction and execution of platform independent applications .
With an emphasis on reflection , network transparency , and rapid application development , the .NET API provides a comprehensive set of classes for robust object oriented programming .
The Common Language Infrastructure ( CLI ) is an official ECMA standard that describes the type system , execution environment , instruction set , and base classes of the .NET framework .
The machine - independent instruction set , called the Common Intermediate Language ( CIL ) , is a stack - based , low - level , human - readable , object - oriented assembly language that ensures transparent interoperability between the various languages that target the .NET platform .
The Common Language Runtime is a virtual machine and runtime environment that effectively implements the CLI standard .
Compilers that target the .NET platform convert source code into CIL , which is then compiled into .NET assembly for deployment in DLL or EXE files that conform with the Portable Executable ( PE ) format .
The .NET assemblies can then be run by the Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) , which translates the .NET assembly into native machine code while execution occurs .
Of the approximately 40 languages that target the .NET platform , many are implementations of other languages like Python , Eiffel , and Scheme .

Kilt owners may have to seek a licence for their sporran
The laws are designed to protect endangered species like otters , whose fur used to be favoured by sporran makers .
The legislation applies to animals killed after 1994 .
Applicants must prove that the animal was killed lawfully before they will be able to get a licence .
The conservation regulations were designed to close a number of loopholes and bring Scotland into line with other EU members .
The law already applied to other vulnerable animals like badgers , deer , wildcats , hedgehogs , bats , lynx , moles , seals , whales , dolphins and porpoises .
Having a licence ... will ensure they will not be prosecuted or have it taken from them under the new regulations
Scottish Executive spokeswoman
The regulations require anyone who owns any part of a protected animal to obtain a licence .
The maximum penalties for breaking the law are a fine of £ 5,000 and six months in prison .
Hamish Husband , spokesman for the Association of Tartan Army Clubs , said the legislation could affect fans who follow their national football team .
" Are the police going to take DNA samples from the sporran of every kilted supporter who walks into Hampden ? " he asked .
" If that 's the case we will need to look into obtaining a licence to cover the entire Tartan Army . "
The legislation is designed to protect animals like badgers
The new rules will also cover fishing flies made from animal hair .
A Scottish Executive spokeswoman said the new rules had been put in place to bring Scotland into line with existing European legislation designed to protect vulnerable species .
" The licence will allow people who possess artefacts made from these species in circumstances compliant with earlier laws to keep them , " she said .
" This could be family heirlooms of various descriptions .
" Having a licence for such an artefact , proving it was obtained legally , will ensure they will not be prosecuted or have it taken from them under the new regulations . "
Wow .
Go read this if you want to learn just how Rove wants to use the legal system to settle political scores .
Of course , I ’ve always felt that Alabama was really a third world banana republic run by the sort of folks who belong in John Grisham novels — but I digress .
And , apparently , it all would ’ve worked perfectly but Dana Simpson , a Republican , had to open her mouth and blow the whistle .
So now the Rovian mafioso - like intimidation begins :
The response to Simpson ’s affidavit has been a series of brusque dismissive statements – all of them unsworn – from others who figured in the discussion and the federal prosecutor in the Siegelman case , who has now made a series of demonstrably false statements concerning the matter .
She ’s been smeared as “ crazy ” and as a “ disgruntled contract bidder . ”
And something nastier : after her intention to speak became known , Simpson ’s house was burned to the ground , and her car was driven off the road and totaled .
Clearly , there are some very powerful people in Alabama who feel threatened .
Her case starts to sound like a chapter out of John Grisham ’s book The Pelican Brief .
Um , national media ?
National media where are you ?
This sounds like something you might want to look into — perhaps ?
Maybe ?
Would n’t it be nice if the folks in the national media did their jobs these days ?
Well someone other than Seymour Hersh of course .
UPDATE
I ’ve updated the link to the post in question .
UPDATE 2
Here ’s an update post about the Siegelman case .
Apart from bitrate , the sound quality of digital music is also affected by its format , which is determined by the software used to compress it , known as a codec .
MP3 is one of the older techniques for compressing audio and is not widely used by online stores .
Apple has chosen a newer format called Advanced Audio Coding ( AAC ) , which plays on iPods and some other devices .
Most other online stores use the similarly modern Windows Media Audio , or WMA , which does not play on iPods .
Image Credit ...
Frank Frisari
All three of these formats are “ lossy , ” meaning the encoding software surgically trims out audio information that is not easy to hear , because it is covered up by other sound or is situated at the highest and lowest ranges of human hearing .
The Norah Jones track “ Come Away With Me ” is 33.4 megabytes when stored in an uncompressed format ; the lossy compression methods bring that down to 6.1 megabytes at 256 kbps , or 3.1 megabytes at 128 kbps , regardless of the codec used .
( When turning your CDs into song files on your PC , you can choose the bitrate you want in the settings of iTunes or Windows Media Player . )
Codecs do vary in quality .
Mr. Wragg of EMI said that as a rule of thumb , an MP3 at 320 kbps is roughly the same as an AAC file at 256 kbps .
“ The difference between WMA and AAC is more difficult to say , ” he added .
“ Each has a slightly different way of getting compression .
But in double - blind tests they perform pretty similarly — bitrate for bitrate they sound similar , but some prefer one over the other . ”
Until now , online retailers have dealt in 128 Kbps tracks — most retailers , that is .
Two years ago , a group of audiophiles created MusicGiants , a digital download store that specializes in “ lossless ” files that are compressed in a way that does not discard any audio information , resulting in tracks that average 25 megabytes in size .
MusicGiants now has more than 500,000 songs from most major labels .
Scott Bahneman , chief executive of MusicGiants , said that comparing lossless tracks and compressed tracks was like comparing photos taken with a high - end digital camera and those taken with a camera phone .
“ Every bit counts when you ’re trying to get sound quality , resolution or anything else , ” he said .
The site ’s core audience is the type of person who spends large sums of money on home theater equipment , and wants music stored as digital files rather than on CD .
Mr. Bahneman said his company planned to offer better - than - CD - quality music in files originally created for the DVD - Audio and Super Audio CD disc formats , which did not catch on with consumers .
Each song will be 250 megabytes , about the same size as one episode of a sitcom on iTunes , but without the video .
These “ Super HD ” files will have a bitrate of up to 11,000 kbps ( that is , 11 megabits per second ) , and will be sold by the album rather than the track , at $ 20 each .
Mr. Bahneman said that with the latest broadband services and huge hard drives , downloading and storing high - resolution audio files should not be a big hurdle .
Learning from Sony : an external perspective Dan Kaminsky DoxPara Research , USA Editor : Helen Martin Abstract Dan Kaminsky takes a long hard look at the reaction ( or lack thereof ) of the AV industry to the Sony rootkit incident and assesses the consequences .
Copyright © 2006 Virus Bulletin
Introduction ' What happens when the creators of malware collude with the very companies we hire to protect us from that malware ? '
Bruce Schneier , one of the godfathers of computer security , was pretty blunt when he aired his views on the AV industry 's disappointing response to the Sony rootkit ( for an overview of the rootkit and its discovery see VB , December 2005 , p.11 ) .
His question was never answered , which is fine , but his concerns were not addressed either , and that 's a problem .
The incident represents much more than a black eye on the AV industry , which not only failed to manage Sony 's rootkit , but failed intentionally .
The AV industry is faced with a choice .
It has long been accused of being an unproductive use of system resources with an insufficient security return on investment .
It can finally shed this reputation , or it can wait for the rest of the security industry to finish what Sony started .
Is AV useful ?
The Sony incident is a distressingly strong sign that it is not .
All things being equal , I 'd rather have the AV industry on our side .
We take it for granted that there are customers for private computer security services .
It did n't have to be this way : someone had to convince users that they were responsible for their own security .
Because of the pioneering work of the AV industry , effective cryptography was non-negotiable , security research could be legitimate , and a free market for security technologies could form .
Indeed , even the spread of broadband and WiFi would have failed if users had n’t been motivated to purchase firewalls to protect their new high - speed networks .
The AV industry made sure the users knew they needed to protect themselves , which is why it is such a great problem when the AV industry refuses to protect them .
Taking control
Let 's be honest ; the AV industry is blessed .
What other software producers can depend on the operating system ( for home users ) or corporate IT departments ( for the office ) essentially demanding that their product runs on every system ?
When was the last time you saw a machine banned from a network for not running Photoshop ?
What is it that customers think they 're purchasing when they buy anti-virus software ?
Is it just safety ?
The safest machine is the one that is turned off .
In fact , users are looking for something beyond mere safety .
Users want control – and they 're willing to pay for it .
We are in the business of putting force behind consent .
Put simply , why ask for something if you can just take it ?
And let 's make no mistake , Sony took control of people 's systems .
Whatever consent people may have granted initially to give Sony access to a system , it cannot be denied that Sony provided no mechanism for users to revoke that consent .
I often invite people into my home .
I expect them to leave at some point , particularly if I ask them to .
I certainly do not expect them to hide in my closet and pretend that they have gone .
And if I call the police because the visitors wo n't leave , I do n't expect them to argue with me about precisely what I agreed to when I first let them in .
Sony had a choice .
DRM is unpopular software , as its primary purpose is to override user intent .
Sony knew that some portion of users would want this stuff removed from their systems .
They had the option to accept the revoked consent , and provide an uninstaller .
Alternatively , they could simply ignore the need for user consent , take control of the system permanently , and simply prevent users from knowing there was anything to uninstall , by deploying a rootkit .
That the rootkit was exploitable by black hat hackers was bad , but ancillary to the argument .
When the way you deal with users wanting to remove your code is by preventing users from knowing your code is running , not only are you operating without consent , but you know it , and everyone can tell .
Been there
Do we really expect the anti-virus industry to square up against companies when they are just trying to defend their copyright ?
Yes , absolutely .
It 's where the AV industry started .
We have just acknowledged the 20 - year anniversary of the first PC virus , and almost everyone has missed the most interesting thing about it .
Brain was not written by some random hacker , nor was it the nefarious creation of shadowy criminal groups .
Brain was all too happy to identify its source : Welcome to the Dungeon ( c ) 1986 Basit * Amjad ( pvt ) Ltd. BRAIN COMPUTER SERVICES 730 NIZAM BLOCK ALLAMA IQBAL TOWN LAHORE - PAKISTAN PHONE : 430791,443248,280530 .
Beware of this VIRUS ....
Contact us for vaccination ...
The first virus was written by an incorporated company .
And why ?
Brain is still in business , so we can ask them .
The following explanation can be found on the company 's website ( http://www.brain.net.pk/aboutus.htm):
' What no American journal had the courage to admit at that time was how badly the virus had hurt America 's painfully cultivated image of the world 's leading copyright protector .
Almost overnight , it had shown Americans to be the world 's biggest copyright violators .
Every time the virus found a new home in the USA , it signalled one more copyright violation by an American . '
Malware in the pursuit of copy protection is nothing new ; the first PC virus was an unambiguous and unapologetic attempt to protect copyrights , by any means necessary .
It has been 20 years .
It is time to recognize the threat of corporate malware .
It is not as if corporate malware is a concept with which anyone is unfamiliar .
One of the most glaring failures of the computer security industry in recent years has been the failure to prevent the spread of spyware .
It took years for the anti-virus industry to start responding to spyware .
The first anti-spyware code was released in 2000 .
One major vendor released nothing until 2003 .
Millions of systems were infected while nothing was done .
Eventually , the AV industry adapted .
I attended a wonderful talk , not long before the Sony story broke , where I heard about the extraordinary steps the anti-virus industry was taking to deal with what can basically be summarized as ' hackers with lawyers ' .
As awful as it is that we have to deal with peer businesses , instead of kids and criminals , it certainly seems that the industry has finally learned to respond to these threats .
Deafening silence
But there really was no response to the Sony situation .
Sony claimed a few AV companies as allies , in order to give its actions the patina of legitimacy .
That did n't work .
The idea of Sony and AV companies in talks was received about as well as if the AV companies had been negotiating with the author of Slammer , agreeing on which exploit he was allowed to hit next .
A few AV companies added code to their products to remove the cloaking component of the rootkit , but as far as I know , nobody actually removed the DRM components for which users were so clearly trying to retract consent .
Only banal excuses , such as ' we 're waiting for Sony to write an emergency uninstaller ' , were heard .
Do we wait for the authors of worms to release uninstallers to clean up their mess ?
Even if they did release one , should we trust people who have written malware in the past ?
Given that Sony 's first uninstaller consisted of a patch to the latestversion , and given that Sony 's code already had a history of unintended security side effects , it was not a surprise to witness multiple useless uninstallers coming out of Sony over the next six weeks .
( And this was after Sony had decided to behave and respond in an extraordinarily responsible manner ! )
There is one industry that knows how to write an emergency uninstaller , one that 's safe , effective and that can be released quickly .
But the AV industry did nothing .
Some have claimed that it would actually have been illegal to have interfered with the Sony DRM , due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
These claims have some merit – the US 's DMCA does indeed take a rather dim view of subverting copyright protection mechanisms .
Ignoring the fact that not all AV companies are American , and that not all victims were American , this legal interpretation opens up an astonishing attack vector .
Imagine a startup – we 'll call it MP3Solutions .
MP3Solutions would combine spyware with DRM .
First , they 'd design some code that detected watermarks in MP3 audio .
Then , they 'd offer $ 10 per deployment to independent third parties , ' no questions asked ' .
The code could be spread via worms , botnets , or drive - by web installs , but since the payload was copy protection software , the DMCA - fearing AV industry would just have to sit back and fail to protect anyone .
It really is amazing what happens once a user 's consent to operate is considered optional .
If this is really how the AV industry is interpreting the DMCA , that 's astonishing and newsworthy .
But the DMCA restrictions certainly would not have prevented the AV industry from complaining , or even asking for explicit permission to remove this particular piece of malware .
Such permission seemed likely to be granted in this case : by the end of November , Sony was taking aggressive steps to manage the situation responsibly , providing free MP3s to affected customers and displaying a banner ad to inform users of their situation .
The only thing Sony was having trouble with was an effective uninstaller – certainly they could have used the assistance of the AV industry !
Perhaps such a request was made , and permission was not forthcoming .
It 's possible .
But another thing the DMCA does not do , is ban the provision of a warning to customers that the service they ’ve purchased would be illegal in this instance : ' Software has been detected on your system whose operation you may not consent to , but which we are legally forbidden to remove .
The vendor refuses to provide consent for us to remove this software for you .
Please contact the following vendor address [ link ] to ask why . '
But instead , Sony got the benefit of the doubt .
We do n't pay the AV industry to give Sony the benefit of the doubt .
The AV industry cannot take money from users and provide services to Sony .
I call upon every anti-virus company to state publicly that , the next time a media company tries to take control of users '
PCs , and decides that the continued consent of the computer owner is n't necessary , they will act .
Poll : Tap wealthy on Social Security By Susan Page , USA TODAY WASHINGTON  Most Americans are willing to endorse painful steps to ensure Social Security 's long - term solvency — steps that nick the rich , that is .
Two - thirds of those surveyed by USA TODAY / CNN / Gallup last weekend say it would be a " good idea " to limit retirement benefits for the wealthy and to subject all wages to payroll taxes .
Now , annual earnings above $ 90,000 are n't taxed .
( Related : Poll results )
But some ideas that President Bush said in his State of the Union address were on the table for consideration are rejected by solid majorities .
By more than 2 to 1 , Americans oppose reducing retirement benefits for those now under age 55 .
Nearly as many say it 's a bad idea to raise the retirement age , and 57 % are against reducing benefits for early retirees .
Six in 10 oppose raising Social Security taxes for everybody , a step Bush has ruled out .
He has n't made it clear whether that also includes boosting the cap on wages that are taxed .
" We do n't want to raise taxes as a solution , " White House spokesman Trent Duffy said Tuesday when asked about that issue .
" But on specifics , we do n't want to negotiate with ourselves . "
The willingness to support sacrifices by somebody else is n't surprising .
" It 's like when you ask about taxing cigarettes , the people who support it , amazingly , are those in the population who do n't smoke , " says Robert Reischauer , president of the Urban Institute and former director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office .
" If the sacrifice includes them , they think twice . "
The strong opposition to most proposals underscores the difficulties ahead .
" There 's no consensus about the solution that a wide swath of Americans support , " Reischauer says .
Even though Bush 's address last week highlighted Social Security , he failed to convince more Americans that the retirement program is in a state of crisis or that his approach is the right way to fix it .
In early January , 18 % of those polled called it a crisis .
Now 17 % do .
Support for Bush 's plan — creating individual investment accounts and reducing guaranteed benefits — is unchanged from January : 40 % call it a good idea ; 55 % say it 's a bad one .
The poll of 1,010 adults , taken Friday through Sunday , has an error margin of +/- 3 percentage points .
Views vary by income :
Three - quarters of middle - income workers — those with annual household incomes of $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 — say it makes sense to limit retirement benefits for the wealthy .
That 's 10 points higher than among those who make $ 75,000 or more .
Three - quarters of middle - income workers support lifting the wage cap so all income is taxed .
That 's 15 points higher than among high - income workers .
Those affluent Americans are more likely by about 10 points to support the idea of reducing benefits for early retirees and raising the retirement age .
There 's another difference between the most affluent and everybody else :
They are the most confident that they would get a higher rate of return than the government provides if they could manage their own investment accounts .
That may be why they are the most likely to support Bush 's plan , by 49 % - 47 % .

The tiny Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda has just won a World Trade Organization ( WTO ) ruling against the US regarding online gambling .
The WTO has ruled that the US " has failed to comply with the recommendations and rulings " of past WTO decisions , opening the way for possible trade penalties against the US .
The case began back in the summer of 2003 , when Antigua and Barbuda requested that the WTO form a panel to investigate US laws against cross - border gambling web sites , many of which are based offshore in the Caribbean islands .
The claim was that the US had not lived up to its obligations under the " General Agreement on Trade in Services " ( GATS ) , and that it was blocking services between WTO member countries .
In November 2004 , the WTO panel concluded that US federal laws ( including the Wire Act and the Illegal Gambling Business Act ) and several state laws incorrectly breached the GATS agreement , and they required the US to change its ways .
In early 2005 , the US and Antigua and Barbuda both appealed portions of the ruling .
The appeal proved more favorable to the US ( it agreed that gambling laws could fall under the " public morals " exception to GATS ) , but the US was still required to change its rules because it remained in violation of Article XIV of the GATS .
An arbitration panel headed by Dr. Claus - Dieter Ehlermann concluded that a reasonable time period for implementation was 11 months and two weeks , which meant that the US should have made changes by April 3 , 2006 .
In the summer of 2006 , Antigua and Barbuda claimed that nothing had yet been done , and they requested a new WTO panel to enforce compliance .
That panel has just issued its report , which takes the US to task for not complying with the earlier ruling .
" Rather than take that opportunity , " the report says , " the United States enacted legislation that confirmed that the ambiguity at the heart of this dispute remains and , therefore , that the United States has not complied . "
The biggest problem is the allegedly discriminatory nature of current US policy , which seems to treat US - based horseracing differently from gambling sites operated in foreign countries .
Without a level playing field , the US does not have the right under GATS to limit similar services from other countries .
The ruling does illustrate the schizophrenic nature of US policy about gambling , which is that it 's not okay — unless it takes place on reservations , " extra territorial " bits of reservations ( i.e. , places that are n't on a reservation at all ) , dog tracks , horse tracks , Las Vegas , Atlantic City , or on riverboats plopped down into artificial lakes made expressly for the purpose .
That has n't stopped the federal government from conducting an active campaign against gambling websites based in other countries and the executives who run them .
This weekend , the founder of BetOnSports ( based in Antigua ) was arrested in the Dominican Republic and extradited to Puerto Rico , charged with purposely providing gambling services to US citizens through the Internet .
The company 's CEO was previously arrested in the US and has been moved to St. Louis , where his trial will be held .
" Cross - border services " are also an issue in Europe , where Denmark , Hungary , and Finland have all shown resistance to some forms of gambling .
The EU is trying to determine if these countries are violating their commitments to allow the free movement of service businesses .
As with the US dispute , the issue in Europe is not about the restriction of gambling , but the fact that many countries regulate foreign gambling sites while continuing to allow or promote homegrown lotteries and casinos .
The complete WTO report ( PDF ) is available for those who want to wade through forty pages of bureaucratic writing at its finest .

超弩級全文検索システ ムHyper Estraier
平林 幹雄 < mikio@users.sourceforge.net >
巷で話題の全文検索システ ムHyper Estraier 。Webサイトやデスクトップの検索システムとして使えることはもちろん、ライブラリとして様々な用途に使うことができます。本稿ではその特徴を説明し、導入から応用までを案内します。
Hyper Estraierのススメ
O型のあなた、デスクトップにウンザリするほどのファイルが散らかっていませんか？
A型のあなた、フォルダで整理したつもりが、階層が深すぎて毎回探すのが面倒になっていませんか？
B型のあなた、人から貰ったファイルの保存場所を忘れて何度も再送してもらうことはありませんか？
AB型のあなた、メーリングリストやメールマガジンに登録しすぎてメーラを開くと大変なことになっていませんか？
そんな皆様にお奨めしたいのが、全文検索システムHyper Estraier（ハイパーエストレイア。以下H.E.）です。
全文検索のスス メ
大量のデータの中からユーザの求める部分を捜し出す技術を情報検索と言います。一口に情報検索と言っても様々なカテゴリがありますが、全文検索もそのうちの一つと言えます。全文検索という言葉に明確な定義があるわけではありませんが、「人間が本の全てのページを通読するのと同じくらいの精度（正確性）と再現率（網羅性）の検索をコンピュータが代行する技術」であると筆者は考えています。私達の身の回りの電子文書の量は日々増大していくばかりで、もはや人間が全てに目を通すことは適いません。したがって、全文検索などの検索技術を賢く使って情報を取捨選択する術を見につけることが今後ますます重要になっていくことでしょう。
Google やYahooで Web上の文書を探すように、自分が持っているデータを素早く捜し出せたら素敵ですよね。H.E.は、そんな希望に応えるフリーソフトウェアの全文検索システムです。コンセプトは、高性能・高機能・簡単の三拍子揃った検索システムということです。
高性能
H.E.の最たる特徴は、とにかく高速に検索ができることです。まず以下のURLのデモサイトにアクセスしてみてください。その速さと便利さを実感していただけると思います。
H.E.は、いわゆるインデックス型の検索システムです。検索対象の文書を登録したインデックスを予め作成（インデクシング）しておくことで、検索時に高速に結果を出すことができます（†column01）。多くの検索システムではインデクシングに多くの時間がかかって管理が面倒になりがちなのですが、H.E.はインデクシングの速度も抜群に速いです。筆者の開発環境（CPUはPentium4の1.7GHz、RAMは1GB搭載のノートPC）で上記のデモサイトの文書約16万件を対象としたインデックスを作成したところ、43分ほどで完了しました。
全文検索システムの性能指標のひとつに、スケーラビリティがあります。インデックスにどれだけたくさんの文書を登録できるかということです。対象文書の内容やマシンの性能やインデクシングにどれだけ待てるのかといったユーザの事情によって限界は異なりますが、少なくとも400万件のメールをひとつのインデックスに登録して運用しているユーザがいます。なお、後述するP2P連携機能を利用すると、複数のコンピュータにインデックスを分散させてさらに大規模な検索システムを構築することもできます。
高機能
H.E.の最も典型的な使い方は、自分のWebサイトに専用の検索機能をつけることでしょう。でも、それだけではありません。会社のファイルサーバにあるWord/Excel/PowerPoint/PDFなどのファイルを対象にした検索システムとして使うこともできます。個人用PCのハードディスク内にあるファイルを対象にした検索システムとして使うこともできます。英語の新聞や論文集を検索対象にして、英単語の用例を調べても便利でしょう。H.E.は、どんな場所にあるどんなデータを対象にしても活用できる汎用の検索システムです。検索対象の文書はファイルである必要すらなく、データベース内のレコードやメールボックス内のメールを扱うこともできます。
H.E.のアーキテクチャをimage01に示します。文書をインデックスに登録するには、文書が格納してある場所（リポジトリ）から個々の文書を取り出す機能（クローラ）と、各文書に記録されているテキストを抜き出す機能（フィルタ）が必要です。H.E.のパッケージには、ローカルのファイルシステムからファイルを収集するクローラと、一般的なファイル形式（プレーンテキスト、HTML、電子メール、PDF、Wordなど）からテキストを抽出するフィルタがバンドルされています。バンドルされたもので対応できない場合は、外部のコマンドを組み合わせたり、独自のプログラムを書いて拡張したりして対応することができます。また、多言語対応というのも特徴の一つです。Unicode（UCS2）の全ての文字を扱えるので、日本語や英語はもちろん、中国語や韓国語やフランス語のテキストも検索できます。
検索機能の典型 はWebインターフェイスによるものでしょう。つまり、Webブラウザに表示された検索フォームに検索条件を入力して検索するものです。H.E.にはiamge02のような画面の検索用インターフェイスがバンドルされています。これはWebサーバ上で動作するCGIスクリプトとして実現されています。既に多くのWebサイトの検索システムとしてH.E.が使われています。なお、スラッシュドットジャパン（†脚注：http://slashdot.jp/）の検索機能にもH.E.が使われています。
デモサイトにアクセスすると、様々な機能があることに気づいていただけると思います。AND、OR、NOTといった論理式はもちろん、フレーズ検索やワイルドカードや正規表現もサポートしています。文書につけたタイトルやサイズなどを対象にした属性検索もサポートしています。さらに、類似文書検索や類似文書隠蔽といった高度な機能も搭載しています（†column02）。
column01：転置インデックスの実装
全文検索の最も重要な技術要素は、パターンマッチングを高速化する手法です。パターンマッチングとは、UNIXのgrepコマンドのように、ユーザが指定したパターン（文字列）がどこにあるかを特定する技術です。しかし、grepコマンドのように全ての文書の先頭から末尾までを読み込んで一致判定していく方法では、対象文書が膨大になった場合には時間がかかりすぎて実用になりません。そこで、一般的な全文検索システムでは、どのパターンがどの文書に現れたかという、本のの巻末索引のようなデータベースを使います。このようなデータベースを転置インデックスと言います。
転置インデックスを作るにあたって、対象文書のテキストからどうやってパターンを切り出すかが重要になります。その方法は主に「分かち書き方式」と「N-gram方式」の2種類に大別できます。例えば、「今日は絶好調です」というテキストがあった場合に、分かち書き方式だと「今日 」「は 」「絶好調 」
「です」というように単語に着目してパターンを切り出すのに対し、N-gram方式だと「今日 」「日は 」 「 は絶 」 「 絶好 」 「好調 」 「調で 」 「です」のように、決まった文字数でパターンを切り出します。両者の比較を表に示します。
分かち書き方式 N - gram方式 検索の速度 速い 遅い 検索の精度 良い 悪い（検索ゴミが多い） 検索の再現率 悪い（検索モレが多い） 良い インデックスのサイズ 小さい 大きい 言語依存性 強く依存（特定の言語のみ） 非依存（多言語対応 ）
N- gram方式は検索モレがほとんど起きないという利点があるのですが、速度やサイズの面で非効率なことから大量の文書を扱うことが難しいので、一般的な用途ではあまり使われていませんでした。全文検索システムNamazuは分かち書き方式ですし、GoogleやYahooも分かち書き方式をベースとしているようです。しかし、近年になってコンピュータの性能が上がってきたので、N-gram方式の検索エンジンが数多く開発されてきています。
H.E.は分かち書き方式とN-gram方式の長所を合わせ持ったハイブリッド方式の全文検索システムです。英語のような、もともと空白で分かち書きされている言語に対しては分かち書きでパターンを切り出しますが、日本語のような、空白で単語が区切られない言語に対してはN-gram方式でパターンを切り出します。また、日本語の形態素解析器MeCab（†脚注：http://mecab.sourceforge.jp/）を組み込むこともでき、その場合は日本語に対しても分かち書き方式を適用します。
分かち書きを使ったら検索モレが発生してしまうではないかと心配する方もいるかもしれませんが、安心してください。H.E.では、2階層のインデックスによってその問題に対処しています。分かち書き方式で切り出したパターンを登録した小さなインデックス（補助インデックス）と、N-gram方式で切り出した全てのパターンを登録した大きなインデックス（メインインデックス）を使います。検索時には、先に補助インデックスを検索して、十分な数の文書がヒットしたらそこで検索を終了します。その場合、分かち書きで作ったインデックスの結果なので精度は高いですし、小さいインデックスなので高速に処理できます。もし十分な数がヒットしなかった場合は、メインインデックスも検索して完全な検索結果を生成します。このような仕組みによって、速度と精度と再現率の全てに秀でた全文検索を実現しています。
column02 ：高度な検索手 法 ユーザが入力したパターンに一致するか否かという条件をANDやORといった演算子で組み合わせることによって対象を絞り込んでいく検索モデルを「ブーリアンモデル」と言います。H.E.を含むほとんどの全文検索システムはブーリアンモデルを実装しています。ブーリアンモデルを拡張する手法として、入力されたパターンをシソーラス（関連語）のOR条件に展開する手法や、対象文書にリンクしているアンカーテキストも検索対象にする手法などがあります。シソーラス展開はH.E.でも実装されています。
ブーリアンモデルとは一線を画す検索モデルとして、「ベクトル空間モデル」が挙げられます。対象文書から抽出したキーワードの出現頻度をベクトルの次元に見立て、検索条件のベクトルとの内積やコサインが小さいものを類似文書として提示する手法です。要するに、単語の出現傾向を元に、類似した文書を捜すことができるということです。このモデルはH.E.でも「類似文書検索」として実装されています。検索結果に含まれる文書の「similar」リンクを選択すると、その文書に類似した文書を類似度の順番で並べて表示してくれます。捜そうとしている文書がはっきりしない場合や適切な検索語が思い付かない場合には類似文書検索が便利です。ただし、計算量がブーリアン検索に比べてとても大きいので、ちょっと遅いのが珠に傷です。
H.E.では、ブーリアンモデルにベクトル空間モデルを組み込んだ「類似文書隠蔽」も実装しています。多くの文書を対象とした検索システムの場合、検索結果が同じ内容の文書ばかりに占められて鬱陶しいことがよくあります。そのような場合に類似文書隠蔽が便利です。検索フォームの「clip」の値を設定すると、表示しようとする各々の文書に対して、既に表示された文書との類似度が指定された値以上だった場合に表示を省略するようになります。つまり、内容が似すぎた文書を折り畳んで表示してくれるのです。また、表示した各文書に含まれる頻出語を絞り込み候補として表示する機能もあります。
学術的には、検索精度とは、検索結果に含まれる文書の中にユーザが意図したものがどれだけの割合で含まれるかという尺度であると定義されます。例えば、検索結果が10000件中に意図したものが1000件含まれれば、精度は10％ということになります。しかし、この尺度をそのまま適用して検索システムの善し悪しを計るのはあまり現実的ではありません。10000件の結果の全てに目を通す人はいないでしょうし、たとえ意図した文書であっても1000件のリンクをクリックする人もいないでしょう。現実的には、検索結果の上位50件くらいの中に意図したものが含まれる割合を高めることと、その50件くらいの中にユーザにとって最善のものが入っていなかった場合にできるだけ簡単に再検索ができるようにすることが重要になります。そのような観点で捉えると、類似文書検索や類似文書隠蔽や絞り込み候補表示機能が単なるオマケではないことがお分かりいただけると思います。
簡単な使い 方
高性能・高機能なだけでなく、簡単に使えるというのがH.Eのコンセプトです。論より証拠。早速インストールして使ってみましょう。
準備
ここでは、ソースパッケージを使ってUNIX系のシステムにH.E.をインストールする手順を説明します。Windowsの方はcolumn03を御覧ください。
gccやmakeといった開発ツールが既にインストールされていることを前提とします。また、zlib（†脚注：http://www.zlib.net/）とiconv（†脚注：http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/）もインストールされていることとします。それらはLinuxやBSDのディストリビューションでは大抵はデフォルトでインストールされています。
QDBMというデータベースライブラリと、H.E.の本体を入手します。以下のサイトからそれぞれの最新版をダウンロードしてください。
ビルドとインストー ル
先 にQDBMをインストールします。QDBMのソースパッケージを展開したディレクトリに入り、以下のコマンドを実行してください。
$ ./configure --enable-zlib -- enable - iconv -- enable - pthread $ make $ su ← rootユーザになる # make install
H.E.をインストールします。H.E.のソースパッケージを展開したディレクトリに入り、以下のコマンドを実行してください。
$ ./ configure $ make $ su ← rootユーザになる # make install
特にエラーが出なければインストールは完了です。
Webサイトの検索機能
検索システム構築の典型例として、WebサイトのHTML文書を検索対象にする例を取り上げてみます。WebサーバにApacheを使っていて、「/home/www」というディレクトリの下をWebサイトとして公開しているとしましょう。その場合、以下のコマンドを実行します。作業は、そのディレクトリに書き込み権限のあるユーザで行ってください。そうすると、「/home/www」の下にある全てのHTML文書がインデックスに登録されます。
$ cd / home / www $ estcmd gather - il ja - sd - cm - cl casket .
$ estcmd extkeys casket
検索用インターフェイスのCGIスクリプトを設置します。以下のコマンドを実行してください。なお、CGI実行の設定についてはApacheのマニュアルを御覧ください。
$ cd /home / www $ cp /usr/local/libexec/estseek.cgi . $ cp /usr/local/share/hyperestraier/locale/ja/estseek.* .
上の手順で設置された「estseek.conf」という設定ファイルをエディタで開いて編集します。「replace:」で始まる行は、ローカルなURLをグローバルなURLに置換する設定です。「{{!}}」の前が置換前の文字列（正規表現）で、後ろが置換後の文字列です。
replace : ^file:///home/www{{!}}http://yourhost.yourdomain/
replace : /index\.html ?${{!}} /
これで設定は完了です。設置された「estseek.cgi」にブラウザでアクセスしてみてください。デモサイトと同じような画面が表示され、検索できるようになっているはずです。H.E.のマニュアルにはさらに詳しい説明がありますので、そちらも御覧ください。
メールボックスの検索機能
mh形式（1メール＝1ファイル）でメールボックスを管理するメーラ（Mew、Wanderlust、Sylpheedなど）を使っているならば、個々のメールを対象にした全文検索のインデックスを簡単に作ることができます。例えば、メールボックスが「/home/mikio/Mail」にあり、その中の businessフォルダかfriendsフォルダに振り分けられたメールを登録する場合、以下のコマンドを実行します。
$ find / home / mikio / Mail - type f | egrep ' inbox /( business|friends ) / [ 0 - 9 ] +$ ' | > estcmd gather - cl - fm - cm casket -
作成されたインデックスは、estseek.cgiを使って検索することができます。mh形式以外のメーラをお使いの場合は、mh形式になるようにメールをエクスポートしてください。
column03 ：Windows版の使い方 Windowsユーザの方はバイナリパッケージを利用すると便利です。以下のURLから最新版を入手してください。

バイナリパッケージには、DLLも含めて、H.E.の動作に必要なファイルの全てが納められていますので、インストールはとても簡単です。ダウンロードしたアーカイブを展開すると、「hyperestraier」というフォルダができますので、それをフォルダごと適当な場所に移動させてください。システムドライブの直下（c:\hyperestraier）にするとわかりやすいかもしれません。あとは、そのフォルダにコマンド検索パス（Path環境変数）を通すだけです。
うまくインストールできているか確かめるために、コマンドプロンプトを立ち上げて、以下のコマンドを実行してみてください。H.E.のバージョン情報が表示されればOKです。 C:\> estcmd version 以下のコマンドを実行すると 、「 D:\doc」以下にあるPDFとRTFとWordとExcelとPowerPointのファイルをインデックスに登録できます。内部でxdoc2txt（†脚注：http://www31.ocn.ne.jp/~h_ishida/xdoc2txt.html）というフィルタプログラムを呼び出しているので、それが対応している形式であれば拡張子のリストを加えることでインデクシングの対象を広げることができます。

。Webサーバに はApacheを使ってもいいですし、IISやAn HTTPdでも問題ありません。WindowsサービスとしてWebサーバを実行する場合、Webサーバの実行ユーザがインストール作業を行ったユーザと異なる可能性があることには注意してください。実行ユーザにとってのコマンド検索パスを適切に設定することが必要です。よくわからない場合は、パッケージ内の全てのDLLをCGIスクリプトと同じ場所にコピーするとよいでしょう。
P2Pの分散検索
ここまでの説明で、一般的な検索システムとして便利なところはおわかりいただけたかと思います。しかし、H.E.の真価はさらに先にあります。P2P（ピア・トゥー・ピア）機構による分散処理です。
P2Pによるメタ検索
PCの性能も年々向上してきているとはいえ、PC1台で扱えるインデックスの規模には限界があります。CPUが2GHzでメモリ1GB搭載の一般的なPCの場合、平均3KBのテキストファイルなら100万件くらい、平均1KBのメールなら300万件くらいが実用的に扱える限界でしょう。それ以上の規模の検索システムを運用するならば、インデックスを複数のPCに分けて配置して分散処理を行う必要があります。100万件の文書のインデックスを管理する10個のサーバを連携させれば、1000万件の文書を扱う検索システムを構築することができるというわけです。インデックスを分ける理由は性能だけではありません。文書の形式や内容によって別々のインデックスに分けて登録しておき、必要に応じて選択したインデックスに対して一度に検索できると便利です。
多数のインデックスを管理することを想定した場合、インデックス毎にサーバを起動するのは非効率です。そこで、単一のプロセスおよび単一のポートで複数のインデックスを管轄できる「ノードマスタ」というプログラムが提供されます。ノードマスタ内の個々のインデックスは独立したサービスを提供するので、ノードマスタは複数のサーバの集合体とみなすこともできます。個々のインデックスを管轄する仮想的なサーバを「ノードサーバ」と呼ぶことにします。各ノードサーバには別々のURLが割り当てられます。ユーザが操作するアプリケーションはノードサーバのクライアントとして位置づけられますが、接続先のノードサーバについてはURLだけ知っていればよく、ノードサーバがどのノードマスタ上に存在しているかをアプリケーション側で意識する必要はありません（image03）。
ノードサーバは別のノードサーバに対して一方的にリンクを張ることができます。クライアントがノードサーバに検索要求を出した場合、依頼を受けたノードサーバは自分がリンクを張っているノードサーバにもクエリを中継し、返された結果を自分のインデックスの結果とマージしてクライアントに返します。つまり、いわゆるメタ検索機能を全てのノードサーバが持つことによって、P2P型の分散処理を実現しているのです。
このようなアーキテクチャは、インターネット環境で不特定多数のノードが連携して巨大な検索システムを構築することを念頭に置いたものです。個々のノードを管理するユーザは自分が検索したい文書を自分のノードに好きなように登録するとともに、自分の興味と似たノードがあればそこにリンクを張ることで労せずして検索対象を拡張することができます。全てのノードがクライアントともにサーバでもあるというP2Pの構成をとることで、中央集権的にノード間の調整をする人がいなくても自律的にネットワークを成長させることができます。
ノードマスタの使い 方
ノードマスタを動作させる準備として、サーバルートディレクトリを作成します。設定ファイルやインデックスなどを格納するディレクトリです。以下のコマンドを実行すると、「casket」というディレクトリが作成されます。
$ estmaster init casket
次に、ノードマスタを起動します。以下のようにします。
$ estmaster start casket
ノードマスタを終了させる場合は、ノードマスタを実行している端末でCtrl-Cを入力するか、別の端末で以下のコマンドを実行します。
$ estmaster stop casket
ノードマスタが起動しているならば 、 「 http://localhost:1978/master_ui」というURLにWebブラウザでアクセスすることで、管理用インターフェイスを使うことができます。アクセスするとユーザ名とパスワードを聞かれるダイアログが出ますので、「admin」「admin」と入力してください。すると、管理用のメニューが表示されます。あとは、メニューに従ってノードサーバを作成してください。
ノードサーバを「 test」という名前で作ったとすると、以下のスクリプトを実行することで、「/home/www」以下のHTML文書を登録することができます。
$ find /home / mikio/public_html/doc / - name '*. html ' - print | > while read file > do > printf '%s
' " $ file " > estcmd draft - fh - il ja " $ file " | > estcall put - auth admin admin http://localhost:1978/node/test > done
その上で 、 「 http://localhost:1978/node/test/search_ui」にブラウザでアクセスしてください。ノードサーバ組み込みのインターフェイスで登録文書を検索することができます。
P2P機構の課題
P2P型の分散処理機能があると言っても、リンク対象となるノードが世の中でたくさん運用されていないと意味がありません。H.E.自体がまだそれほど普及しているわけではありませんし、P2Pで全文検索エンジンを実現するという文化がインターネットで育っているとも言えません。この野望を実現するには、SNS（ソーシャルネットワークシステム）のような、ノード管理者同士を引き合わせてモチベーションを高める仕組みが必要となるでしょう。それにはどのような制度や機能が必要かを筆者は研究しているところです。何か面白いアイデアがあればぜひお知らせください。
一般のユーザがもっと簡単にノードを運用できるようにするためには、Webサイトやデスクトップの文書を収集してノードサーバに登録するのを自動化する機能が必要です。その設定を簡単に行うためのGUIがあるともっと便利でしょう。そういった機能も現在開発中です。筆者以外にもH.E.のP2P機構のアプリケーションを作っている人がいます。中でもmod_estraierは非常に興味深いものです（column04）。
アプリケーション開発のススメ
本誌読者の中には、日常的にプログラミングをしている方や、プログラミングを学んでいる方も多いと思います。そんな皆様には、ぜひともH.E.のライブラリを使っていただきたいと思います。
API の階層
全文検索システムは私達に大変身近な技術であるにもかかわらず、自分で作ろうとすると非常に多くの手間がかかるものです。しかし、H.E.のライブラリを使えば、実用的な全文検索システムを非常に短い期間で作ることができるでしょう。既に紹介したestcmdコマンドをシェルから呼び出したり、estseek.cgiの設定ファイルをいじるだけでもかなりのカスタマイズができますが、それだけでは不可能だった多くのことが、ライブラリを組み込んだアプリケーションを作ることで可能になります。estcmdではファイルとして存在している文書しか扱えませんでしたが、ライブラリを使えば、リレーショナルデータベースに格納されたレコードを文書として扱うアプリケーションを作ることもできます。estseek.cgiはWebブラウザで使うものでしたが、ライブラリを使えば、ネイティブOSのGUIを備えた検索アプリケーションを作ることもできます。
H.E. のAPIは、抽象度に応じて複数の階層に分けらます（image05）。もっとも低水準の「コアAPI」は、インデックスを直接操作するAPIです。排他制御や堅牢性確保の責任をアプリケーション作者が負わねばならない半面、うまく使えば非常に効率的な処理を行うことができます。estcmdやestseek.cgiはコアAPIを使ったアプリケーションです。その上層の「スレッドAPI」は、スレッド間の排他制御をライブラリ側で行うようにしたラッパーです。P2P機構のノードマスタはスレッドAPIを使ったアプリケーションです。ノードマスタはHTTPプロトコルでリモートから制御することができますが、そのプロトコルの詳細を隠蔽して簡単に扱えるようにしたものが「ノードAPI」です。ノードAPIを使うと、P2P機構を使った大規模な検索システムをとても簡単に作ることができます。
上述のAPIはC言語のものですが、JavaやRubyでもH.E.のアプリケーションを開発できるように、コアAPIの言語バインディングが提供されます。これはC言語のライブラリのラッパーとして実現されています。また、ノードAPIに相当する操作をJavaやRubyから行うために、JavaだけやRubyだけで実装されたインターフェイスも提供されます。リスト1は、Ruby用のノードAPIを使って文書登録を行うサンプルプログラムです。こんなに短いコードで独自の全文検索システムが作れるのです。
# Hyper Estraierのライブラリを取り込む require " estraierpure " include EstraierPure # ノードに接続して、アカウント情報を設定する node = Node::new node.set_url ( " http://localhost:1978/node/test " ) node.set_auth ( " admin " , " admin " ) # 文書オブジェクトを作成して、テキストや属性を設定する doc = Document : :new doc.add_attr ( " @uri " , " http://foo.bar.baz/quux.html " ) doc.add_attr ( " @title " , " OSM今月号 " ) doc.add_text ( " 今月も盛りだくさんでお届けします。 " ) doc.add_text ( " Hyper Estraierの記事が特に面白いです。 " ) # ノードに文書オブジェクトを登録する unless node.put_doc(doc ) STDERR.printf ( " error : %d
" , node.status ) end
アプリケーションの配布
mod_estraier以外にも様々なアプリケーションが既に公開されています。gdestraier（†脚注：http://www.mitsuki.no-ip.com/~seagull/software-archives/hyperestraier/gdestraier.html）は、GNOMEデスクトップからファイルを検索する、いわゆるデスクトップ検索ツールです。DesktopHE（†脚注：http://freemind.s57.xrea.com/desktophe/）は、同じくWindows上で動作するデスクトップ検索ツールです。PgEstraier（†脚注：http://pgestraier.projects.postgresql.org/）は、PostgreSQLにH.E.を組み込んでSQL文で操作できるようにするモジュールです。
H.E. はGNU LGPLというライセンスで配布されています。これは、H.E.の本体（ライブラリ）自体を改編した場合はそのソースコードを公開する義務が発生するものですが、H.E.のライブラリを組み込んだアプリケーションを開発する際にはソースコードを公開する必要はありません。したがって、一般的な商用のアプリケーションに組み込んだり、システムインテグレーションの案件でも気軽にH.E.を利用することができます。さらに、ノードAPIのRubyとJavaのインターフェイスはBSD風ライセンスで配布されていますので、ライブラリ自体を改編したものを組み込むことも容易です。オープンソースもそうでない製品も含めて、様々なシーンでH.E.が活用されれば本望です。H.E.のメーリングリストではアプリケーション開発に関する質問や相談も受け付けていますので、気兼ね無く投稿してください。
Airline Security a Waste of Cash
Since 9/11 , our nation has been obsessed with air - travel security .
Terrorist attacks from the air have been the threat that looms largest in Americans ’ minds .
As a result , we ’ve wasted millions on misguided programs to separate the regular travelers from the suspected terrorists — money that could have been spent to actually make us safer .
Consider CAPPS and its replacement , Secure Flight .
These are programs to check travelers against the 30,000 to 40,000 names on the government ’s No - Fly list , and another 30,000 to 40,000 on its Selectee list .
They ’re bizarre lists : people — names and aliases — who are too dangerous to be allowed to fly under any circumstance , yet so innocent that they cannot be arrested , even under the draconian provisions of the Patriot Act .
The Selectee list contains an equal number of travelers who must be searched extensively before they ’re allowed to fly .
Who are these people , anyway ?
The truth is , nobody knows .
The lists come from the Terrorist Screening Database , a hodgepodge compiled in haste from a variety of sources , with no clear rules about who should be on it or how to get off it .
The government is trying to clean up the lists , but — garbage in , garbage out — it ’s not having much success .
The program has been a complete failure , resulting in exactly zero terrorists caught .
And even worse , thousands ( or more ) have been denied the ability to fly , even though they ’ve done nothing wrong .
These denials fall into two categories : the “ Ted Kennedy ” problem ( people who are n’t on the list but share a name with someone who is ) and the “ Cat Stevens ” problem ( people on the list who should n’t be ) .
Even now , four years after 9/11 , both these problems remain .
I know quite a lot about this .
I was a member of the government ’s Secure Flight Working Group on Privacy and Security .
We looked at the TSA ’s program for matching airplane passengers with the terrorist watch list , and found a complete mess : poorly defined goals , incoherent design criteria , no clear system architecture , inadequate testing .
( Our report was on the TSA website , but has recently been removed — “ refreshed ” is the word the organization used — and replaced with an “ executive summary ” ( .doc ) that contains none of the report ’s findings .
The TSA did retain two ( .doc ) rebuttals ( .doc ) , which read like products of the same outline and dismiss our findings by saying that we did n’t have access to the requisite information . )
Our conclusions match those in two ( .pdf ) reports ( .pdf ) by the Government Accountability Office and one ( .pdf ) by the DHS inspector general .
Alongside Secure Flight , the TSA is testing Registered Traveler programs .
There are two : one administered by the TSA , and the other a commercial program from Verified Identity Pass called Clear .
The basic idea is that you submit your information in advance , and if you ’re OK — whatever that means — you get a card that lets you go through security faster .
Superficially , it all seems to make sense .
Why waste precious time making Grandma Miriam from Brooklyn empty her purse when you can search Sharaf , a 26 - year - old who arrived last month from Egypt and is traveling without luggage ?
The reason is security .
These programs are based on the dangerous myth that terrorists match a particular profile and that we can somehow pick terrorists out of a crowd if we only can identify everyone .
That ’s simply not true .
What these programs do is create two different access paths into the airport : high - security and low - security .
The intent is to let only good guys take the low - security path and to force bad guys to take the high - security path , but it rarely works out that way .
You have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to exploit the low - security path .
Why could n’t a terrorist just slip an altimeter - triggered explosive into the baggage of a registered traveler ?
It may be counterintuitive , but we are all safer if enhanced screening is truly random , and not based on an error - filled database or a cursory background check .
The truth is , Registered Traveler programs are not about security ; they ’re about convenience .
The Clear program is a business :
Those who can afford $ 80 per year can avoid long lines .
It ’s also a program with a questionable revenue model .
I fly 200,000 miles a year , which makes me a perfect candidate for this program .
But my frequent - flier status already lets me use the airport ’s fast line and means that I never get selected for secondary screening , so I have no incentive to pay for a card .
Maybe that ’s why the Clear pilot program in Orlando , Florida , only signed up 10,000 of that airport ’s 31 million annual passengers .
I think Verified Identity Pass understands this , and is encouraging use of its card everywhere : at sports arenas , power plants , even office buildings .
This is just the sort of mission creep that moves us ever closer to a “ show me your papers ” society .
Exactly two things have made airline travel safer since 9/11 : reinforcement of cockpit doors , and passengers who now know that they may have to fight back .
Everything else — Secure Flight and Trusted Traveler included — is security theater .
We would all be a lot safer if , instead , we implemented enhanced baggage security — both ensuring that a passenger ’s bags do n’t fly unless he does , and explosives screening for all baggage — as well as background checks and increased screening for airport employees .
Then we could take all the money we save and apply it to intelligence , investigation and emergency response .
These are security measures that pay dividends regardless of what the terrorists are planning next , whether it ’s the movie plot threat of the moment , or something entirely different .

Automated Targeting System
If you ’ve traveled abroad recently , you ’ve been investigated .
You ’ve been assigned a score indicating what kind of terrorist threat you pose .
That score is used by the government to determine the treatment you receive when you return to the U.S. and for other purposes as well .
Curious about your score ?
You ca n’t see it .
Interested in what information was used ?
You ca n’t know that .
Want to clear your name if you ’ve been wrongly categorized ?
You ca n’t challenge it .
Want to know what kind of rules the computer is using to judge you ?
That ’s secret , too .
So is when and how the score will be used .
U.S. customs agencies have been quietly operating this system for several years .
Called Automated Targeting System , it assigns a “ risk assessment ” score to people entering or leaving the country , or engaging in import or export activity .
This score , and the information used to derive it , can be shared with federal , state , local and even foreign governments .
It can be used if you apply for a government job , grant , license , contract or other benefit .
It can be shared with nongovernmental organizations and individuals in the course of an investigation .
In some circumstances private contractors can get it , even those outside the country .
And it will be saved for 40 years .
Little is known about this program .
Its bare outlines were disclosed in the Federal Register in October .
We do know that the score is partially based on details of your flight record–where you ’re from , how you bought your ticket , where you ’re sitting , any special meal requests–or on motor vehicle records , as well as on information from crime , watch - list and other databases .
Civil liberties groups have called the program Kafkaesque .
But I have an even bigger problem with it .
It ’s a waste of money .
The idea of feeding a limited set of characteristics into a computer , which then somehow divines a person ’s terrorist leanings , is farcical .
Uncovering terrorist plots requires intelligence and investigation , not large - scale processing of everyone .
Additionally , any system like this will generate so many false alarms as to be completely unusable .
In 2005 Customs & Border Protection processed 431 million people .
Assuming an unrealistic model that identifies terrorists ( and innocents ) with 99.9 % accuracy , that ’s still 431,000 false alarms annually .
The number of false alarms will be much higher than that .
The no-fly list is filled with inaccuracies ; we ’ve all read about innocent people named David Nelson who ca n’t fly without hours - long harassment .
Airline data , too , are riddled with errors .
The odds of this program ’s being implemented securely , with adequate privacy protections , are not good .
Last year I participated in a government working group to assess the security and privacy of a similar program developed by the Transportation Security Administration , called Secure Flight .
After five years and $ 100 million spent , the program still can’t achieve the simple task of matching airline passengers against terrorist watch lists .
In 2002 we learned about yet another program , called Total Information Awareness , for which the government would collect information on every American and assign him or her a terrorist risk score .
Congress found the idea so abhorrent that it halted funding for the program .
Two years ago , and again this year , Secure Flight was also banned by Congress until it could pass a series of tests for accuracy and privacy protection .
In fact , the Automated Targeting System is arguably illegal , as well ( a point several congressmen made recently ) ; all recent Department of Homeland Security appropriations bills specifically prohibit the department from using profiling systems against persons not on a watch list .
There is something un-American about a government program that uses secret criteria to collect dossiers on innocent people and shares that information with various agencies , all without any oversight .
It ’s the sort of thing you ’d expect from the former Soviet Union or East Germany or China .
And it does n’t make us any safer from terrorism .
This essay , without the links , was published in Forbes .
They also published a rebuttal by William Baldwin , although it does n’t seen to rebut any of the actual points .
Here ’s an odd division of labor : a corporate data consultant argues for more openness , while a journalist favors more secrecy .
It ’s only odd if you do n’t understand security .

The reason the traditional first date used to be dinner and a movie was because the movie gives you something to talk about during dinner .
The value of the movie is not only the quality of the movie itself , but also its ability to give you something to talk about .
This is why newspapers lose when they prevent readers from commenting on their articles .
The reason most people read the paper is that it gives them social currency with others .
The value of the paper is directly proportional to its ability to serve as an object of sociability .
Make the experience more social and the value goes up , less social and the value goes down .
Which is why Reddit has it all backwards .
The idea of content aggregators like Reddit is that they link to the best stories on the web .
These stories are then supposed to serve as objects of sociability that generate interesting discussion .
And I think most of us will agree that what makes one aggregator good and another bad is as much about the quality of the discussion as it is about the quality of the stories themselves .
So far so good .
The problem here lies with the greater fuckwad theory .
That is , once a content aggregator reaches a certain number of eyeballs there becomes an irresistible temptation to cause a little high - visibility mischief .
Or a lot of high - visibility mischief .
And so the quality of discussion seems to be capped at a certain fixed signal - to - noise ratio .
If formatted the same , on some days you'd be hard pressed to tell whether you were reading the comments on Reddit or YouTube .
So the point of the content is to create interesting discussion .
But as a site 's popularity increases , the probability of having an intelligent discussion approaches zero .
How can we solve this ?
Traditionally , the output of social systems is thought to be a combination of the intrinsic qualities of the people there and the systemic forces that drive their interaction .
With content aggregators , these two factors are responsible for both the content that makes the front page and the quality of the discussion .
The problem here is that the factors required to choose good content may be different from those required to produce good discussion .
And what 's more , the factors that encourage insightful content are almost certainly different the factors that encourage informative , interesting , and funny content .
Because of this it seems likely that there either there is no single set of people and systemic forces that will produce both a wide range of quality content and quality discussions , or else if there is then it will be prohibitively hard to find .
1
So why not cut out the middleman ?
Instead of of linking to interesting content , why not link directly to interesting discussions ?
Think of all the benefits :
A ) Being generous , there are maybe ten or fifteen articles and blog posts a day that are genuinely insightful .
Each of these articles creates dozens if not hundreds of discussions .
Instead of trying to find the perfect blend of people and systemic forces to create a new discussion from scratch for each article , why do n't we simply link to interesting discussions that are already happening across the web ?
B ) Linking to discussions is an excellent means of finding quality content .
Interesting discussions almost always have an interesting source , whereas content that seems interesting may in fact produce only vapid discussion .
This is especially true in a world where the stories that top the content - aggregators are mostly chosen by twelve year old boys .
When I was twelve just about every online discussion thread seemed insightful simply because when you 've only been literate and online a handful of years , every idea seems new and fresh .
C ) When using a content - aggregator to create discussions , you are always talking with the same limited group of people .
This rapidly leads to a stagnation of ideas and users outgrowing the virtual discourse group .
When aggregating discussions from around the web this problem would be greatly reduced .
D ) There are certain classic pages that pop up on content - aggregators every few months , which most net natives are more than sick of seeing by now .
There are also most likely several thousand classic discussion threads , but since no one has ever made a discussion aggregator before the majority of them would seem completely fresh .
E ) Linking to a seven - year - old article is lame because it 's out of date .
Linking to a seven - year - old discussion is just as interesting now as it was back then , if not more interesting because of it's added historical interest .
I 'm not claiming that there is no value to traditional content - aggregators , in fact they can be quite useful .
However , since the value of the discussion is as great or greater than the value of the content , it makes sense to at the very least try aggregating discussions in addition to aggregating content , if only to see what happens .
[ 1 ]
The exception is with certain niche aggregators like where you have a relatively small number of like - minded people .
What Murdoch did n’t volunteer is other reasons he has for wanting to own the Journal .
Whatever his commercial successes , he has never produced a great newspaper , and he seems to value even a trophy property like the Times of London less for its prestige than for its influence — its power to help sway elections , to promote his political ideas , and to protect his corporate interests .
“ I wonder how many even of his admirers would argue that Mr. Murdoch , for all his successes , has created even one serious , authoritative and truly independent newspaper , ” the columnist Martin Wolf wrote recently in the Financial Times , alluding to Murdoch ’s ownership of four national newspapers .
“ Mr. Murdoch can take substantial credit for the tide of vulgarity that now floods the U.K . ”
On May 31st , the Bancroft family reversed itself and agreed to meet with Murdoch , issuing a statement that said , in part , “ The mission of Dow Jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization , which may include News Corp . ”
A crucial factor in turning the family around , according to a board participant , was Elizabeth Steele , the family member who had nearly wept at Zannino ’s presentation on May 1st .
During board conference calls , the members discussed who should attend the session with Murdoch , to be held at the Manhattan offices of the family ’s legal adviser , Martin Lipton , of Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz .
Michael Elefante said that he and the three family representatives — Christopher Bancroft , Leslie Hill , and Steele — should attend , along with the board ’s chairman , McPherson .
McPherson suggested that Zannino should be included .
“ That ’s not what we had in mind , ” Elefante responded , according to the board participant .
Elefante decided that no one from management would attend .
“ I read it that Elefante and the family are not happy with Rich , ” the participant said .
At the meeting , which took place on June 4th , Murdoch was joined by his son James , who is thirty - four , the C.E.O. of British - based BSkyB , and by his counsel and chief financial officer .
The four - hour session reportedly did not address what News Corp. would pay for or invest in Dow Jones .
Instead , discussion focussed on whether Murdoch could be trusted to keep his distance from news coverage , and what kind of independent board could assure this .
The Bancrofts wanted a board that the family would control in perpetuity , with the power to hire and fire the editors and the publishers , and leverage to protect employees from Murdoch — an extraordinary proposition .
It is a measure of Murdoch ’s discipline that he did not explode at the implication that he was some sort of uncaged vulgarian or at the idea that the Bancrofts would control the paper after selling it .
Instead , Murdoch said — gently , by all accounts — that he could not invest five billion dollars of his shareholders ’ money in order to become a mere spectator .
He proposed a board like the one he had established for the Times of London and the Sunday Times , where of the fifteen members only seven have no ties to News Corp. , and where he can theoretically hire or fire the editor only with the assent of the board .
In London , the Times board rarely meets , and is reliant for much of its information on Murdoch .
In an interview with two Journal reporters , Steve Stecklow and Martin Peers , excerpts of which were published on June 5th , Murdoch not only made clear that he wanted a similar arrangement — one that permitted the board to “ interview the editor before he ’s appointed ” — but insisted that the board could not get into “ business judgments , ” including newsroom budgets , as the Bancrofts were proposing .
Murdoch said that he would countenance a board that had “ absolutely no business connections to me . ”
What he would not consider was a board appointed by the Bancrofts .
“ The family ’s selling out , ” he said .
“ They ca n’t sell and keep it . ”
No outside board can tame any owner , a former Sunday Times investigative reporter , Bruce Page , told me .
“ Newspapers are like ships , ” he said .
“ They are real - time systems .
You must make your decisions .
It is better to have bad decisions rather than no decisions .
You ca n’t have the captain of the ship appointed by people onshore , and fire him when he comes back to shore . ”
Murdoch and the Bancrofts agreed to keep talking .
In 1995 , I spent several months reporting for a Profile of Murdoch for The New Yorker .
During ten days in his offices , I attended meetings , witnessed negotiations , listened to his phone calls , and conducted about twenty hours of taped interviews with him .
At least a couple of times each day , he talked on the phone with an editor in order to suggest a story based on something that he ’d heard .
This prompted me to ask , “ Of all the things in your business empire , what gives you the most pleasure ? ”
“ Being involved with the editor of a paper in a day - to - day campaign , ” he answered instantly .
“ Trying to influence people . ”
I portrayed Murdoch then as a visionary who could make a large company move with the speed of a small one .
I also saw him as a modern pirate , a press lord in the tradition of men like James Gordon Bennett , who created the New York Herald in 1835 and also became an adviser to politicians ; or William Randolph Hearst , Henry Luce , and Lord Beaverbrook , who used their properties to try to influence events throughout the last century .
Murdoch ’s power and influence , though , reach far beyond one nation .
Murdoch was unhappy with the article , and although he is unfailingly polite in person , he has since declined to sit for an interview with me .
Those who are suspicious of Murdoch ’s pledges of noninterference recall what happened when he first extended his press holdings beyond his native Australia , nearly forty years ago : he persuaded the Carr family of London to sell him the sensational tabloid News of the World , and promised to run the paper in partnership with the family that had owned the paper for nearly eighty years ; he abandoned this pledge after learning , he said , that to honor it would harm shareholders because the Carrs had created “ a total wreck of a company . ”
When he bought the New York Post from Dorothy Schiff , in 1976 , he publicly pledged to leave its liberal editorial stance unchanged , saying , “ The New York Post will continue to serve New York and New Yorkers and maintain its present policies and traditions ” — and promptly reversed course .
But Murdoch ’s approach may best be seen in what happened after he bought the influential and once storied Times of London and the Sunday Times , in 1981 .
At the time , English journalists asked their Australian - born colleague Phillip Knightley to analyze how Murdoch might behave , and as Knightley now recalls , “ The point I made was that Murdoch came from a tradition very different from European and American proprietors .
In Australia , a proprietor owned the paper and considered it was his to do whatever he liked with it .
Proprietors used their newspapers to support or oppose political parties , settle private feuds , and cross-promote their other interests .
Any idea that they could not do this would have met with bewilderment . ”
Within a year of acquiring the papers and promising not to interfere in the editorial operations , Murdoch fired Harold Evans as the editor of the Times and transformed the paper into an often - partisan voice on behalf of Margaret Thatcher .
Evans had been the twelfth editor at the Times in nearly two hundred years ; Murdoch hired and fired five editors in his first eleven years .
Evans , in his 1983 memoir , “ Good Times , Bad Times , ” wrote , “ The most charitable explanation of Murdoch ’s attitude to a promise was that he meant it when he made it ; only circumstances changed . ”
Bruce Page , who left the Sunday Times before Murdoch took control , and who wrote the 2003 book “ The Murdoch Archipelago , ” said , “ Rupert is a very kind man personally .
He bailed out old war correspondents who have hit hard times .
He has great charm , in a certain dry way .
There ’s a lot to be said for Rupert Murdoch the man .
There ’s nothing to be said for Rupert Murdoch the journalist . ”
Murdoch does deserve credit for modernizing England ’s newspaper industry and weaning it from wasteful union work rules .
When he took over the daily Times , it was losing money ; it still is , yet he keeps it alive .
The Times is not nearly the paper that it was in 1981 — stories are increasingly cursory , there is more crime and celebrity news , and since 2004 it has been printed in tabloid format — but it is still a respectable newspaper , as is the Australian , which Murdoch launched as that country ’s first national newspaper , in 1964 , and which did n’t earn a profit for twenty years .
Neither publication , though , can compare to the Wall Street Journal , one of the best newspapers in the world .
And because the Australian and the Times are so unlike typical Murdoch newspapers — tabloids like the Post in New York and the Sun in London — neither really represents his dominant brand of journalism .
Some of his tabloids print photographs of topless women .
His
Fox network pioneered tabloid television , in 1986 , with “ A Current Affair . ”
He personally agreed to publish O. J. Simpson ’s “ If I Did It ” ( in which Simpson teasingly seemed to confess to a double murder ) , along with a two - part , two - hour Simpson interview on Fox — and then cancelled it all when the public outcry became too loud for commercial comfort .
Fox News ’s “ fair and balanced ” slogan is more marketing ploy than conviction .
The Journal “ will become more populist , ” Alan Rusbridger , the editor of the Guardian in London , predicts .
“ All his papers do . ”
The prospect of a Murdoch takeover of the Wall Street Journal has already produced repercussions at the paper .
According to a recent Pew Research Center poll , Americans consider the Journal their most credible newspaper .
Yet a senior executive at the paper says , “ Even before anything happens , there has been so much publicity about this that there are issues with our readers and advertisers .
. . .
We do n’t yet know how best to deal with that issue , or how big an issue it is . ”
In addition , the departure of some of the Journal ’s talent may ensue .
There are fewer opportunities in journalism than there once were , but the best writers , reporters , and senior editors will not find it difficult to move elsewhere .
Editors at the New York Times , Time , Inc. , and Bloomberg have already talked to prospective recruits from the Journal .
Murdoch , however , believes that all talent is replaceable .
To try to forestall a Murdoch takeover of New York magazine thirty years ago , about forty writers and editors and art directors went on strike .
I was at the magazine then , and , with delusions that I was on a diplomatic mission , led a small delegation to visit Murdoch ’s outside counsel , Howard Squadron .
I was certain that , once Murdoch understood that the staff would leave , he would retreat .
Squadron listened politely , and replied , “ You do n’t understand .
If you leave , Rupert will replace you like he replaces furniture . ”
Murdoch has said that he wants to improve the European and Asian editions of the Journal , expand the Washington bureau , invest more in marketing the paper , and boost digital ventures in order to locate “ new business models to get revenues . ”
In the interview with Stecklow and Peers , published in its entirety on the Journal ’s Web site , he said that he would consider making WSJ.com — one of the few successful subscription models ( it has nine hundred thousand subscribers paying up to a hundred dollars annually ) — free , because “ you ’d have ten times as many visitors and let ’s say five times as much advertising . ”
In the interview , Murdoch said of the newsroom , “ I ’d love to wander around .
I ’m not going to have much time to do it .
I find people quite like it if I show an interest in their work . ”
He also said , “ I ’m quite ashamed .
I enjoy popular journalism .
I must say I enjoy it more than what you would call quality journalism . ”
Journalists love the sense that the boss cares about their work , but Journal reporters have every reason to suspect that Murdoch ’s journalistic sensibility is not theirs .
Murdoch ’s offer comes at a time of embarrassment elsewhere in News Corp .
Last month , the Post admitted that Richard Johnson , its Page Six editor , had accepted a thousand - dollar gift from a New York restaurateur whose establishment often appeared on Page Six , and had also accepted a fifty - thousand - dollar bachelor party in Mexico hosted by Joe Francis , of “ Girls Gone Wild ” video fame .
Ian Spiegelman , who worked as a Page Six reporter for four years , swore in a recent affidavit that “ accepting freebies , graft and other favors was not only condoned by the company but encouraged as a way to decrease ” expenses ; that he “ was ordered to kill a Page Six story about a Chinese diplomat and strip club that would have angered the Communist regime and endangered Murdoch ’s broadcasting privileges ” in China ; and that “ Page Six was ordered to kill unflattering stories about Hillary and Bill Clinton on numerous occasions . ”
A spokesman for the Post said that Johnson had been “ reprimanded ” ; he suggested that some of the charges might be true , but labelled others “ a lie , ” while refusing to specify which were lies .

}
MaybeInt printplus ( int i )
{
MaybeInt x = print ( i ) ;
return bind ( print , x ) ;
}
This is a quick followup to a post on reddit .
This time a crude approximation to the Maybe monad implemented in C: Again the idea is that printplus ( ) is a version of printplus_bad ( ) that uses just the two function bind / return interface to the MaybeInt type to achieve its effect .
This time , instead of simply tainting IO with a particular type , the Maybe monad is able to deal gracefully with failure .
If , for some obscure reason , printf ( ) fails , returning an integer less than zero , it returns an object representing this fact .
If , as in printplus ( ) , you have two calls to print ( ) in a row , bind ( ) handles all the plumbing for you automatically .
The really important thing is this : the implementation of printplus ( ) is identical to my previous example , and yet the semantics is quite different because printplus ( ) is able to bail out early .
This bailing out is completely hidden inside bind ( ) .
I hope that this gives some hint of what monads can do to even hardcore non-functional programmers .
If not , I 'll probably write another example soon .
( Remember of course that this is n't meant to be practical code .
It was a response to someone who wanted to at least some some C code for monads to get an idea of what they 're about . )

Over the years , gamers have enjoyed new technology that has greatly enhanced the gaming experience .
One industry that has seen tremendous growth in the casino industry .
Years ago , when DOS was the main operating system , games were basic and not overly innovative .
There were some basic DOS casino games that had been developed and these were basically three - reel slot games , poker games or simple blackjack options .
These games were easy to play and made use of simple keyboard controls , just as with other DOS based games .
While they did capture the essence of the casino game being played , they did not have much to offer in terms of graphics , animations or game features as players enjoy today .
Popular DOS Casino Games
When DOS was the main operating system players had no choice but to play the titles that were offered at the time .
Those that had a love for gambling found there were a few great games that had been developed .
For poker fans , some of the most popular game titles included Strip Poker and Ante Up at the Friday Night Poker Club .
The latter offered versions of five - card stud , seven - card stud , and Texas Hold ’ Em .
Slot games were also available in DOS and some of the top games from the 1990s included Caesars Palace , Arcade Fruit Machines , Hot Slots , and Vegas Bandit .
These games provided access to simple three - reel slots and while the graphics were extremely basic , the games did mimic slots found at land casinos .
Casino Games Today
Gamers who enjoy a retro feel will still be able to download many DOS casino games for free .
However , compared to the games being created today , the DOS versions cannot hold a candle to the impressive graphics and gameplay that players are seeing now .
The casino games that are being played on desktops and mobile devices are designed using state of the art technology .
They deliver many great advantages and provide players with a feeling of actually being in a land - based casino setting .
Let ’s take a look at how the casino games of today offer more features and more exciting ways to play .
Enhanced Graphics and Gameplay
When you play casino games today .
You will find they use the best graphics and animations to create a visual appeal .
Many games offer 3D graphics and when playing , they offer animations that replicate what you would find in a real casino .
With every new game that is created , better graphics are used and the gameplay is smooth .
Games can also be accessed on desktops or mobile devices , allowing the convenience of being able to play at any time , anywhere .
More Game Titles
The software industry has grown over the years and there are now more companies creating top - notch casino games .
You will find thousands of game titles being offered and many games can be instantly loaded through a web browser for immediate connections and exciting gameplay .
Instead of being limited to a few slot selections and the basic card and table games , you will find that casino focused games offer hundreds of titles , many of which are actual games that are found on the gaming floors of popular casinos .
Online Casinos
Online casinos are the best way to enjoy any type of casino game and these casinos attract players from all over the world .
They use outstanding graphics and animations and offer exclusive features that enhance the game .
There is simply no comparison to the games found at the sites to those that were created for DOS .
With an online casino , players have the ability to play games for free without having to risk any money , but they can also place wagers and generate payouts , something that was never possible with older DOS games .
The newest and best online casinos offer thousands of titles from various software providers like Microgaming , NetEnt , Playtech , IGT , Bally , NextGen , and many others .
These games provide the feeling of real play and since plates have the chance to win payouts , these types of games have become a leading choice for players all over the world .
At an online casino , you will find all the popular game types , including three and five - reel slots , blackjack , baccarat , poker , craps , roulette , video poker , and even specialty games like Keno , Bingo , arcade style games , and lottery games .
All of these can be played for various bet amounts to generate payouts .
You will even find high paying jackpot games that can offer thousands or millions in payouts !
Perhaps the best way to experience online gambling is to access sites with live dealer games .
These are simulcast from a land location and offer real - time play with professional dealers .
These games are just like those found at land casinos and they offer social interaction , multiple camera angles , various betting limits , and even side bets that can generate more payouts .
Free Online Casino Games
You do not have to sign up at an online casino or risk any money to enjoy the best casino games today .
There are many free software options that are available along with a number of gaming sites online that provide free play on some of the most exciting games .
With these , players can enjoy a casual experience or they can use access to free games to learn game rules and develop strategies if they are planning on accessing an online casino for real money .
Free games can also be enjoyed on mobile devices and there are many casino apps that can be installed on mobile devices .
You will even find popular social media platforms like Facebook featuring casino style games that can be played .
Over the years , the style and format of casino games have drastically changed .
Gone are the block style graphics and slow gameplay .
Now , you can enjoy fast and instant access to some of the best designed game titles in the industry and with the chance to play these for real money , the options are endless .
Summary :
There are ten usability mistakes that about two - thirds of corporate websites make .
The prevalence of these errors alone warrants attention , especially since they appear on sites with significant investment in usable design .
I typically focus my top - ten lists on issues that I think are the most important and most in need of attention .
This time , I 've used a different criterion : I 've focused on the known usability principles that designers most frequently violate .
Whether big or small , the very prevalence of these usability problems makes them worthy of attention .
The frequency statistics are based on the numerous homepage reviews that my company has performed since I published my book on homepage usability .
This data source introduces a bias , because only big companies or government agencies with a substantial usability commitment will invest $ 12,000 to have an independent expert assess its homepage design .
However , we can turn that bug into a feature : if companies with a demonstrated commitment to usability make certain mistakes , they must be particularly slippery pitfalls .
For each of the ten most frequent mistakes , I state the deplorably low percentage of homepages that follow the guideline .
I 've sorted the list by compliance rate : number one is the guideline that the fewest sites follow ( that is , the mistake that 's made most often ) .
I also list the guideline 's number as it appears in the full guidelines list , in case you want to read more about it .
1. Emphasize what your site offers that 's of value to users and how your services differ from those of key competitors
Compliance rate : 27 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 3
This is one of the most important issues in homepage design , so it 's particularly sad that it's the least followed of all the guidelines .
Websites are incredibly bad at explicitly stating what they offer users .
Instead , they hide their offerings in generic marketese that makes very little impression on prospective customers .
Remember : when users have needs , they typically query search engines and allocate only a few seconds to scan each of the sites that the search engine drags up .
2 . Use a liquid layout that lets users adjust the homepage size
Compliance rate : 28 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 67
Fighting frozen layouts seems a lost battle , but it 's worth repeating : different users have different monitor sizes .
People with big monitors want to be able to resize their browsers to view multiple windows simultaneously .
You can't assume that everyone 's window width is 800 pixels : it 's too much for some users and too little for others .
3 . Use color to distinguish visited and unvisited links
Compliance rate : 33 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 37
Knowing where you 've been is one of the three basic features that all navigation designs should support .
( The other two are " Where am I ? " and " Where can I go ? " )
It 's sad that only a third of corporate homepages tell users at a glance which site areas they 've already seen .
Navigational confusion results when designers disable one of the few useful features of a standard Web browser : having visited and unvisited links appear in different colors .
Our testing has shown that violating this guideline is particularly harmful for elderly users .
> More on changing link colors
4 . Use graphics to show real content , not just to decorate your homepage
Compliance rate : 35 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 56
For example , use photos of people who have an obvious connection to the content as opposed to using models or generic stock photos .
People are naturally drawn to pictures ; gratuitous graphics can distract users from critical content .
Stock photography sellers are doing a brisk business , but users do n't believe that your product will make them happy just because there 's a smiling lady on your homepage .
Better to show your actual product .
5 . Include a tag line that explicitly summarizes what the site or company does
Compliance rate : 36 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 2
Our recent study of how people use corporate image information on websites did find that most users could eventually dig up information about a company 's purpose ( sometimes in the " about us " section ) .
But why do most sites make prospects work so hard ?
In keeping with most advertising slogans , content - free tag lines abound .
Once you 've paid millions to get a useless slogan developed , it 's probably hard to accept that it wo n't work for your website .
I suggest a compromise : put the useless slogan in a graphic banner next to your logo , where it will be ignored .
Then add a true tag line in plain - text format in the content area where people will actually see it .
6 . Make it easy to access anything recently featured on your homepage
Compliance rate : 37 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 33
For the Alertbox , 80 % of the readership happens after a column has passed from the homepage into the archives .
In general , users remember when they 've seen something interesting on a homepage .
However , unless that homepage lists recent features and offers links to them in the archive , users will never be able to find what they 're looking for on subsequent visits .
7 . Include a short site description in the window title
Compliance rate : 39 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 75
This is mainly important for search engine visibility , but why not take advantage of this superior -- and cheap -- form of Internet marketing ?
8 . Do n't use a heading to label the search area ; instead use a " Search " button to the right of the box
Compliance rate : 40 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 49
This is a small point , but there 's no reason to label the search box if there 's a " Search " button right next to it .
Interaction design 's less is more principle tells us that extra elements in a dialogue distract users from the salient points and reduce their ability to understand an interface .
( In other words , with less to consider , people understand more of what 's there . )
9 . With stock quotes , give the percentage of change , not just the points gained or lost
Compliance rate : 40 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 110
This guideline only applies to sites that provide stock quotes , either in the investor relations information or elsewhere .
With stock quotes , the general principle is to help users understand the relative magnitude of a change , and thus its true importance .
( A similar guideline applies to presenting other statistics that change over time . )
A stock increase of $ 0.75 means very different things if the starting price was $ 8 ( a booming 9 % leap ) versus $ 60 ( a modest 1 % gain ) .
10 .
Do n't include an active link to the homepage on the homepage
Compliance rate : 41 %
Guideline number in Homepage Usability book : 43
This is a special case of a guideline that applies to all website or intranet pages : never have a link that points to the current page .
( A button to refresh stock quotes or other changing information is a different matter , and should be presented as a command button rather than a navigation link since it does n't lead to a new location . )
Active links to current pages cause three problems :
If they click it , a link leading to the current page is an utter waste of users ' time .
Worse , such links cause users to doubt whether they 're really at the location they think they 're at .
Worst of all , if users do follow these no - op links they 'll be confused as to their new location , particularly if the page is scrolled back to the top .
Homepage links on the homepage typically result from using a universal navigation bar that includes " home " as an option .
Fine .
But when users are on a page that 's featured in the navbar , you should turn off that option 's link and highlight it in such as way that indicates that it 's the current location .

I 'll present my newest usability guidelines in the tutorial on Fundamental Guidelines for Web Usability at the annual Usability Week conference .
We cover the theory that explains why these things are wrong in the seminars on The Human Mind and Usability : How Your Customers Think and Principles of Interface Design .

A couple were killed when the driver of a minibus veered into their car after being stung by a bee .
David Johnson and his wife Sheila were on the way to their holiday home when they died in the head - on crash .
An inquest heard how their Volvo was struck by 26 - year - old Andrew Workman after he lost control of his vehicle .
He became distracted when the bee flew through his open window and stung him on the crotch , causing him to fail to negotiate an approaching bend .
Mr Johnson , 66 , had no chance of taking avoiding action as the Ford Transit swerved across the road into his path in Shepley , near Huddersfield .
The retired builder died instantly but his wife of 46 years , Sheila , 65 , was able to speak to paramedics before losing consciousness .
The inquest heard the couple , of Ashton - under - Lyne , Greater Manchester , died from multiple injuries .
Werner Welgemoed , who was travelling with Mr Workman , said in a statement : " We were travelling home from work when a bumble - bee flew into the bus on the driver 's side and settled into his crotch .
" He and I looked down and as we looked up we crossed onto the other side of the road and cars were coming towards us .
I passed out . "
Mr Workman , from Honley , West Yorkshire , spoke in court only to confirm what happened but in a police statement he said he was stung and could not stop in time to avoid the crash last June .
Witness Thomas
Hanks , who was travelling in front of the minibus , said : " I looked in my rear - view mirror - I saw the Transit on the last part of the bend .
It did n't take it .
I remember thinking something was going to happen and I just heard a big bang . "
Scroll down for more
Road accident investigator Keith Rayner estimated the combined speed of the two vehicles was no more than 90mph .
Recording an accident verdict , Coroner Roger Whittaker said : " There are lessons to be learned for all drivers in that everyone should try to avoid distractions . "
He described Mr Workman , who was also injured in the crash , as " upset beyond measure " .
No prosecution was brought against him .
But the officials offered no evidence to support their charge that “ the highest levels of the Iranian government ” had authorized smuggling these weapons into Iraq for use against American forces .
Nor could they adequately explain why they had been sitting on this urgent evidence since 2004 .
The only thing that was not surprising was the refusal of any of the briefers to allow their names to be published .
Mr. Powell is probably wondering why he did n’t insist on the same deal .
We have no doubt about Iran ’s malign intent .
Iran is defying the Security Council ’s order to halt its nuclear activities , and it is certainly meddling inside Iraq .
But we are also certain that the Iraq war has so strained the American military and so shattered this president ’s credibility that shrill accusations and saber rattling are far more likely to frighten the allies America needs to contain Iran ’s nuclear ambitions than to change Tehran ’s behavior .
If Mr. Bush is truly worried about Shiite militias killing Americans in Iraq  and he should be  he needs to start showing this evidence to Iraq ’s prime minister , Nuri Kamal al - Maliki .
The president needs to demand that Mr. Maliki stop protecting the militias and make it clear that there will be serious consequences if he continues to refuse .
If Mr. Bush is truly worried about Iran fanning Iraq ’s ever more bloody civil war  and he should be  he needs to stop fantasizing about regime change and start trying to find a way to persuade Iran ’s leaders to help rein in the chaos in Iraq .
And if Mr. Bush is worried that Americans no longer believe him when he warns of mortal threats to the country  and he should be  he needs to start proving that he really understands who is most responsible for the Iraq disaster .
And he needs to explain how he plans to extricate American troops without setting off an even bigger war .
Dignity
It ’s 2:00 AM .
I ’m standing in line at a convenience store holding a half gallon of milk .�
The stores part of a national chain .
I do n’t much care for it but it ’s on the way home .
A young guy and his girlfriend wait anxiously in front of me .
When it ’s their turn at the register the kid over confidently swings a six pack of Budweiser on top of the counter .
His girlfriend , who ca n’t be more than sixteen , drops a pile of candy bars next to the beer .
“ This , ” the kid says , “ And I ’d like some Philly Blunts . ”
The middle aged clerk looks tiredly at the kid .
“ You got some ID ? ”
“ Naw man , ” the kid says .
“ But I ’m twenty - one . ”
“ I need to see a drivers license , ” the clerk drones .
“ Yo man , ” the kid says , his voice quickly filling with frustration , “ I said I ’m twenty one . ”
“ It ’s company policy , ” the clerk says , “ I ’ve got to ID anyone who looks like they ’re under thirty ’ .
The kid shrugs .
‘ Forget it then , ’ he says .
“ Ring up the candy .
I ’ll put the beer back . ”
“ Oh no , ” the clerk says , reaching out to take the beer , “ I ’ll put the beer back . ”
“ Dude , ” the kid says .
“ I can put it back . ”
The clerk puts his arms around the beer like he ’s protecting it .
An annoying grin spreads across his face .
“ I ’ll take care of it , ” he says .
The kid ’s frustration flash boils into anger .
He pushes the candy bars across the counter .
“ You can put everything back then , ” the kid seethes .
The clerk steps back , alarmed .
Candy bars fall to the floor .
The kid grabs his girlfriend ’s hand and they storm out the front door .
The clerk and I watch them go .
“ Those jerks , ” the clerk fumes .
“ Trying to get one past me ?
Who the fuck they think they are ? ”
“ Just an angry young man , ” I say , putting my milk on the counter .
The clerk looks at me .
Hair greasy and unkempt , his faces been pallored by working too many nights under fluorescent lights .
I ’ve been going into this store for years and I ’ve always been frustrated by this clerk ’s maddening slowness .
It takes him forever to ring up a purchase or turn on the gas pump .
I ’ve seen him make customers wait until he ’s done obsessively inventorying the cigarettes .
He reminds me of how angry smallish people slow down while crossing the street , blocking traffic , as if telling the world that these streets are their turf .
Make no mistake about it – this store is the clerks turf .
“ Well fuck those kids , ” the clerk says .
“ I ’m the manager of this store .
No one ’s getting anything past me . ”
“ I guess not , ” I reply .
“ Punks , ” the clerk snorts .
“ It ’s enough that corporate hounds my ass about checking IDs ” .
I say nothing .
There ’s something unsettling in the clerk eyes , a sadness slowly evolving into meanness .
I want the clerk to ring up my milk .
Instead he grabs a piece of paper from under the counter and waves it at me .
“ You see this ? ” he says .
“ All employees got to write down our company ’s pledge not to sell alcohol or tobacco to minors and sign it . ”
I look at the sheet .
At the top ’s written legalese about not selling smokes and booze to children followed by a pledge to always check IDs .
In the blank space provided the employees have copied out the legalese word for word and signed it . \
“ We have to write this out everyday , ” the clerk says .
“ You have to write out the company ’s policy and sign it everyday ? ” I say , aghast .
“ Look , ” the clerk says , pulling out a stack of paper .
“ These are all the forms every employee filled out this week . ”
“ Jesus , ” I reply , “ That ’s like having to write ‘ I will not chew gum in class on the blackboard a hundred times . ' ”
“ Whatcha gonna do ? ” the clerk says , shrugging .
I feel sorry for the clerk .
Between IDing snot - nosed kids , facing the possibility of getting shot during a hold up , and being under video surveillance all day – he has to put up with demeaning corporate bullshit .
I ’d rob my own store .
“ Can I see that again ? ” I say , pointing to the pledge sheets in his hand .
Suddenly the clerk grows suspicious and clutches them to his chest .
“ I really ca n’t let you see these , ” he says .
“ I ’m just curious . ”
The clerk holds up the sheets but takes three paces backwards .
He does n’t want me to read it .
A secretive little shit eating smile spreads across his face .
My anger flares .
This clerk ’s an idiot .
He deserves to be here .
What kind of person shows such blind loyalty to a company that videotapes his every move , treats him like a baby , and , in the end , will dispose of him like yesterday ’s trash ?
I quickly temper my anger .
I have no idea why this fellow ’s doing what hes doing .
Maybe he ’s taking care of sick parents or children .
Maybe being a clerk in a convenience stores a good thing for him .
Maybe he ’s a recovering drunk , an ex-addict , or struggling with mental illness .
Maybe he ’s just a regular guy struggling to provide for his loved ones .
People look at me all the time and wonder why I wait tables .
Maybe they ’re thinking the same things Im thinking .
I struggle to get my judgmental passions under control .
It ’s probably better I do n’t know anything about this guy .
Ignorance is often the hand maiden of compassion .
The clerk rings up my milk .
“ You want a bag ? ” he asks .
“ Yes , thank you . ”
The clerk , with agonizing slowness , peels a plastic bag off the pile .
“ Yes sir , ” he says , proudly .
“ No kids are getting past me .
No way .
Fuck ‘ em . ”
I half remember a quote from Raymond Chandler .
“ Sometimes people spend a lifetime protecting a dignity they never had . ”
This clerk is one of those sad people – building his house on a foundation of sand .
I take my milk , say thank you , and walk out into the cool night air .
I ’m never going into that store again .
Night of the Grizzly
~ A True Story Of Love And Death In The Wilderness ~
Forword
Some readers may find the following information and examination disturbing .
For this , I apologize .
Read at your own discretion .
Others will find it interesting , informative and hopefully educational .
At the very least we can learn from someone else ’s mistakes .
Night Of
The Grizzly chronicles the last remaining moments of Tim Treadwell ’s and Amie Huguenard ’s lives , the discovery and investigation revolving around their deaths and what led up to their tragic end .
An attempt will also be made to theorize what actually took place in camp that stormy night back in 2003 by piecing together bits and pieces of a six - minute audio recording left behind .
As I researched this incident , I quickly realized that Tim and I had quite a bit in common and I totally understood his passion .
The grizzly bear symbolizes wilderness and a simpler time .
There are no highways or skyscrapers in the world of the bear — - but there are boundaries .
However , had we met , Tim and I would have no doubt had some heated discussions about how I thought he was doing more harm than good with his behavior in Alaska .
Habituating bears to the presence of man only increases the chance that harm will someday come to the bear , or another “ man . ”
A special thanks to Rangers Joel Ellis and Rick McIntyre for their interest , their valuable insights , questions and encouragement .
Otherwise this would have sat in the archives gathering “ electronic ” dust .
This is a work in progress .
Any mistakes are mine alone , and hopefully I will catch them sooner or later .
If someone had told me back in October 2003 that I would be investigating and writing about this incident for several years , I would have laughed .
I should have known better .
I hope Jewel Palovak as well as other family and friends of Tim and Amie can somehow find peace in their lives .

The remains of Tim Treadwell , 46 , a self proclaimed eco-warrior and photographer , along with girlfriend Amie Huguenard , 37 , a physicians assistant , both of Malibu California were found Monday October 6 , 2003 in Katmai usgs topo map of kaflia bay , alaska , area of maulingNational Park and Preserve on the Alaska Peninsula after the air taxi pilot Willy Fulton , who had flown in to pick the couple up near Kaflia Bay , contacted the National Park Service and Alaska State Troopers to report that a brown bear was sitting on top of what appeared to be human remains near the camp .
For 13 summers Timothy Treadwell fled California for the wilds of Alaska , where he set his camp among some of the largest and most numerous brown bears left in North America .
Treadwell gained national celebrity status after his appearance February 20 , 2001 on CBS ’s David Letterman Show , promoting his 1997 book “ Among Grizzlies : Living With Wild Bears in Alaska ” , along with his close - up photographs and video footage , often showing him within arms reach of large brown bears or creeping on all fours towards a sow and her three cubs , talking in a soft , child like , sing song voice .

Katmai National Park has about 3000 of the total 35,000 Alaskan grizzly bears ( ursus arctos horribilis ) .
The coastal version referred to in Alaska as brown bears ( ursus arctos ) , most of whom would weigh in excess of 1000 pounds .
( Van Daele 2004 )
The term “ Brown Bear ” is the more correct and scientific use for the specie .
“ Grizzly ” is just common usage in the lower 48 , having first been used during the Lewis and Clark expedition when they referred to “ a brown bear with grizzled appearance ” .
( DeVoto )
All grizzly bears are actually brown bears , having originated in Eastern Siberia — the Russian brown bear .
The black bear is the only native bear in North America ( ursus americanus ) .
For 13 years , Timothy Treadwell camped in several Alaskan parks but Katmai National Park was a favorite , crawling and walking up close to bears and filming them .
Often attempting to touch both cubs and adults .
In the 85 year history of the park no visitor had been killed by a grizzly .
Firearms are prohibited within Katmai National Park .
Bear spray is allowed , however Tim had quit carrying bear spray for protection several summers prior to his death .
Treadwell often established his camp on or near established bear trails , and intersecting bear trails .
During this last season , Tim had also hid and camouflaged his camp at “ the grizzly maze ” within the thick alder brush in an effort to hide from the Park Service , due to a new rule imposed by the park service which required all backcountry campers to move their camp at least 1 mile every 5 days .
( Van Daele 2004 , National Park Service 2003 )
In late June 2003 , Tim and Amie arrive in Katmai and set camp at Hallo Bay , in what Tim referred to as the “ Sanctuary ” .
Amie returns to California after a couple of weeks , and then returns to Katmai just as Tim was moving his camp to “ The Grizzly Maze ” on Kaflia Lake .

Tim sent a letter back with Willy Fulton on Amie ’s return to Bill Sims , owner of the Newhalen Lodge near Katmai and wrote that “ a few bears at his camp were more aggressive than usual ” .
( AP Wire 2003 )
Tim and Amie extend their stay 1 week in an effort to locate a favorite female brown bear not seen earlier .
Tim also writes in his diary that Amie believes he is “ hell bent on destruction ” and that this will be her last season in Alaska with him , leaving him for good , and that she was looking forward to starting a new job and desperate to return to California .
( Treadwell 2003 )
On Sunday October 5 , 2003 , sometime between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm , Tim and Amie make a satellite phone call to Jewel Palovak , program director of Grizzly People , and there was apparently no problem at that time .
Both seem excited and in happy spirits having located the missing sow .

Earlier on that same day Tim phoned his pilot friend Willy Fulton to fly his float plane in to pick them up on the beach the following afternoon .

The Early Years
Tim Treadwell was born in New York in 1957 as Timothy Dexter , the third of five children .
According to Tim , as a teenager his home life disintegrated often getting stinking drunk and once smashed up the families car .
After barely graduating high school , Tim left for Southern California and ended up in Long Beach .
Soon after he arrived , he began working in restaurants while attending college on a swimming scholarship .
After the college party life took over his life and losing his scholarship , Tim began auditioning for parts in various sitcoms , changing his name to Treadwell from his mother ’s side of the family .
According to his book “ Among Grizzlies ” , during this period he continued to indulge in alcohol and drugs and finally overdosed on heroin and cocaine in the late 1980s , and was rescued by a Vietnam vet named Terry , whom he had become close to .
After he was discharged from the hospital , Tim decided to travel to Alaska and watch bears at the urging of Terry .
His early attempts at camping were almost comical .
In his journal he wrote that he was often cold , hungry and tormented by insects , and that the first time he saw a grizzly it ran away .
Tim later said he was sad that any bear would find him a threat .
( Treadwell 1997 )
Mark Emery , a wildlife filmmaker and outdoor guide first saw Treadwell from the air in the early 1990s .
Emery was on a charter flight over Hallo Bay in Katmai National Park with a film crew from National Geographic , when they spotted a guy on the ground desperately waving his arms .
“ Tim said he was learning to be around bears , but that he wanted to get out of there right away because the bears had been in his camp .
I took a picture of him holding a water jug that was crushed by a bear . ” ( Emery 2003 )
Emery goes on to say that Tim “ was camping near the coast and was nearly out of water , although a freshwater stream was nearby ” .
At Treadwell ’s request the film crew contacted a charter service to pick him up .
( Emery 2003 )
Back in California during the winter months , Tim worked as a bartender and stayed sober .
With a previous girlfriend , Jewel Palovak , he wrote his 1997 book “ Among Grizzlies : Living With Wild Bears in Alaska . ”
Together they began Grizzly People , a non-profit group devoted to educating people , especially children , about bears and as a way to fund his travels to Alaska .

Almost from the start , National Park Service officials worried about Tim ’s behavior .
According to park service records , in 1998 Treadwell was issued a citation by park rangers for storing an ice chest filled with food in his tent .
On another occasion he was ordered by park rangers to remove a prohibited portable generator .
A total of 6 park violations or complaints from 1994 to 2003 , including guiding tourists without a license , camping in the same area longer than the 5 day limit , improper food storage , wildlife harassment , use of a portable generator , and misc .
altercations with visitors and licensed guides .
Treadwell also frustrated park rangers because he refused to carry bear spray .
Deb Liggett , superintendent of Katmai National
Park became sufficiently concerned about Treadwell that she met him for coffee in Anchorage several years prior to his death .
“ I told him that if we had any more violations from him we would petition the U.S. magistrate to ban him from the park , ” . ( Liggett 2003 )
Liggett applauded the fact that Treadwell was winning fans for the bears , and was being more careful to warn people not to attempt what he did , but she and other park officials were afraid that “ one swipe of a paw would undo all that and result in a frenzy of stories about fearsome , people - eating grizzlies ” .
( Liggett 2003 )
Amie Huguenard apparently did not share the same concern .
A physician ’s assistant in Aurora , Colo. , Amie first fell in love with Treadwell ’s book and eventually its author .
Huguenard quit her job on Jan. 31 , 2003 and moved to Malibu where she was to start a new job after she and Tim returned for the winter .
The couple had spent parts of the three previous summers together in Alaska .
On September 29 , 2003 , Tim and Amie once again are transported to Kaflia Lake by Willy Fulton , the couple wanted one more chance to be with the bears before winter set in .
Eight days later they are discovered dead .
Discovery and Investigation
Tim and Amie–Last Expedition © Willy Fulton 2003
As scheduled , at 2:00 PM on Monday October 6 , 2003 , air taxi pilot Willy Fulton from Andrew Airways arrives at Kaflia Lake to transport Tim and Amie out of the area for the year and is approached by a large brown bear .
Willy states “ It was rainy and foggy out that morning . ”
After landing , Willy believes that he sees Tim shaking out a tarp and yells for the couple but receives no response .
He decides to hike up the path from the beach and through the thick alder brush towards the camp after he notices a little bit of movement .
When he is about 3 / 4 way up the hill he senses that “ something just did n’t feel right .
Something seemed strange , hollering with no answer ” .
Willy then states that he turned around and headed back down the path through the thick alders “ at a pretty good clip ” and just as he gets to the plane , he turns and spots “ a pretty nasty looking bear ” that he had seen on earlier flights , sneaking slowly down the trail with it ’s head down .
“ Just the meanest looking thing ” .
Willy then takes off and flies over the campsite 15 to 20 times in an attempt to chase the bear away , and sees what appears to be the same bear feeding from a human rib cage , but each time he flies over the camp the bear begins to feed even faster .
( Fulton 2003 , 2004 )

Katmai park ranger Joel Ellis received the call from Andrew Airways at 1:35 PM .
Ranger Ellis then requests that Willy Fulton be contacted by radio and asked that he remain “ nearby , if he could do so safely ” .
Willy then lands again about 1 mile west of the camp on the western shore of the lake .
At 3:20 pm , ranger Ellis joins up with two other park rangers at the airport and depart in a park service Cessna 206 , with ranger pilot A. Gilliland at the controls and ranger D. Dalrymple in the back seat .
Ranger Ellis also has park dispatch report the incident to King Salmon State Troopers as well as Alaska Fish and Game , requesting that troopers meet the park rescue team at Kaflia Lake near Tim and Amie ’s camp .
At 4:26 pm the team arrive at the lake , and ranger Ellis conducts a quick interview with Willy Fulton .
Willy states that he “ could not be 100 % sure , but was confident that something was wrong ” .
( Ellis 2003 , pg 2 )
Willy advises the rangers that there is only room for one plane to park near the camp and climbs into the park service Cessna for the quick taxi to the south shore .
As they approach the area , ranger pilot Gilliland spots a large adult bear near the top of the hill where the campsite is supposedly located .
After exiting the plane , the four begin slowly hiking up the path from the lake , yelling as they walk to help locate any surviving victims , and to alert any nearby bears of their presence .
Ranger Ellis states that “ the visibility was poor with a heavy growth of bushes and tall grass , the camp was located on top of a ridge and out of our sight .
We had radio contact with Alaska State Troopers Hill and Jones ” , who were forced to park their plane 300 meters away and had to hike through the thick brush , “ so we elected to wait at the base of the hill until Troopers Hill and Jones could catch up ” .
Ranger Ellis was standing with ranger Gilliland and Willy Fulton to his left .
Ranger Dalrymple was slightly ahead of Gilliland when Gilliland suddenly yells , Bear ! while pointing to the right .
Ranger Ellis states that he turned and “ saw an adult bear moving toward the group about 20 feet away ” .
All four begin yelling in hopes that the bear would see them and move away .
Ranger Ellis then states that he “ perceived that the bear was well aware of their presence and was stalking them ” .
Ranger Ellis , armed with a 40 cal .
handgun begins to fire at about the same time rangers Gilliland and Dalrymple , who were each armed with 12 gauge shotguns loaded with slugs also begin to shoot at the bear .
Ranger Ellis fires 11 times while rangers Gilliland and Dalrymple each fire 5 times , dropping the bear 12 feet away .
“ That was cutting it thin ” stated Ellis .
After about 10 seconds the bear dies and Willy Fulton then reportedly says “ I want to look that bear in the eyes ” and states that he is sure that this was the bear that chased him back to his plane earlier .
( Ellis 2003 , pg 3 )
Human remains were then found buried by a bear near the campsite , which was in a brushy area with poor visibility .
Site of Tim and Amie ’s Camp © N.P.S .
Two tents were discovered , one for gear and the main tent used for sleeping .
Both were collapsed and torn , however there was no evidence that the bear had pulled the victims from the main tent .
In front of this main tent was a large mound of mud , grass and sticks , five feet long , 4 foot wide , and 3 feet high .
After moving a clump of dirt , ranger Ellis later recalled seeing “ fingers and an arm protruding from the pile ” .
( Ellis 2003 , pg 4 . Gilliland 2003 , pg 10 )
Food was found in the camp secured in 4 or 5 metal bear proof canisters , as well as open snack food found untouched inside the sleeping tent .
Both Tim and Amie ’s shoes were also found neatly still in place at the entrance to the main tent .
Rangers Ellis and Dalrymple then hike back down the path to retrieve cameras from the plane .
Ranger Gilliland states that he was “ standing at the top of the knoll about 10 feet from the mound ” containing Amie , looking around when he spots a large bear about 15 feet away walking up the same trail they had just hiked up , and the same trail that rangers Ellis and Dalrymple had just walked down .
After yelling Bear !
The two troopers , who had arrived at this point , as well as Willy Fulton , begin yelling at the bear “ to get out ! ” .
The bear hesitates for about 2 seconds before turning and walking back down the trail to the lake .
( Gilliland 2003 , pg 10 )
Meanwhile , ranger ’s Dalrymple and Ellis , having just reached the plane and out of ear shot of the activity unfolding back at camp , spot a large adult bear moving down the trail from the camp .
The two climb onto the plane ’s float and yell as the bear continues to move away .
Because the bear did not appear to be acting aggressively , the rangers allowed it to move off .
( Ellis 2003 , pg 4 )
Investigators combing the nearby area around the campsite discover what was left of Timothy Treadwell .
“ His head connected to a small piece of ( spine} ” , and what has been described as a frozen grimace on his face .
“ His right arm and hand laying nearby with his wrist watch still attached ” .
( Fulton 2004 , Ellis 2003 , pg 5 )
Meanwhile , searchers excavating the bear ’s cache back in camp discover Amie Huguenard , who ’s arm and fingers had been exposed to the daylight when investigators first entered the camp .
Appearing as though she were peacefully asleep except that her body , like Tim ’s , had been mostly eaten by the bear .
( Ellis 2003 , pg 5 )

Later , as the helicopter was being loaded , a second smaller bear approximately 3 years old seemed to be stalking the rangers and it was shot and killed as well .
Ranger Ellis states that he “ saw a bear about 30 feet away ” .
Ranger Gilliland fires a warning shot into the air , however the bear did not react .
“ This bear was intermittently visible as it moved through the brush and tall grass .
We were yelling and the bear was looking right at us . ”
As the bear continued to move towards the group ranger Ellis fires a shotgun , while trooper Hill and ranger Gilliland also begin firing at the bear .
“ The bear dropped but continued to move .
Ranger Gilliland moved in and fired a final shot ” killing the bear , states Ellis .
( Ellis 2003 , pg 5 )
Video and still camera equipment , also found at the site , were later analyzed by Alaska State Troopers where it was discovered that the last remaining 6 minutes of video tape , which was found still in the camera bag , had captured the sounds of the attack .
The first sounds from the tape are from Amie , “ she sounds surprised and asks if it ’s still out there ” .
Apparently either Tim had asked Amie to turn the camera on , or Amie just turned it on out of reflex .
( I do n’t believe this latter scenario took place for one minute which I will discuss in detail below ) .
At any rate , the attack was in progress when the camera was turned on .
The next voice is from Timothy as he screams “ Get out here !
I ’m getting killed out here ! ” ( Tim was wearing a remote microphone on his coverall ’s ) .
The sound of a tent zipper is then heard and the tent flap opening .
Amie is heard screaming over the background sounds of rain hitting the tent , the wind , and other storm sounds all mixed in with the bear and Tim fighting to “ Play dead ! ”
Seconds pass before Amie yells again to “ Play dead ! ” ( Van Daele 2004 )
Not surprisingly , with Amie yelling and screaming nearby , this seems to work and the bear breaks off the attack .
( more on this below ) A short conversation ensues as Amie and Tim try and determine if the bear is really gone .
Being trained as a physician ’s assistant , it is believed that Amie made her way to Tim , and from the sounds caught on tape , the bear returns and Amie is forced to back off .
Tim then is clearly heard screaming that playing dead is n’t working and begs her to “ hit the bear ! ” ( Van Daele 2005 , Fallico 2004 )
The sound of rain hitting the tent , along with wind muffle the sounds at this point .
However , Amie is clearly heard yelling to “ Fight back ! ”
She is then heard screaming “ Stop ! Go Away ! or possibly Run Away ! ” as the sound of “ a frying pan is used to beat the top of the bears head and the sound of Tim moaning .
( Fallico 2004 )
It is believed that at this point in the attack , the bear let go of Tim ’s head which the bear had in it ’s mouth , and grabbed him somewhere in the upper leg area .
The sound of Amie screaming very loudly , as Tim is clearly heard over the sounds of the storm , saying “ Amie get away , get away , go away ” .
Tim knew he was going to die at this point and wanted to save Amie from the same fate .
( Herzog , Fallico 2004 )
Amie did not go away .
Tim With The “ Grinch ” © Lion ’s Gate Films 2004
The audio portion of this video tape lasts roughly 6 minutes .
During this period , Tim ’s cries and pleadings can be heard for two - thirds of that time .
He did not die quickly , unlike some traumatic death victims who were lucky enough to drift off into a shock induced dream state .
Tim was obviously very aware and struggling desperately to survive during the last moments of his life .
Unlike what is portrayed in the movies , the bear is nearly silent .
Only low growls and periodic grunts are heard which only adds to the horror of the scene .
Sounds of the bear dragging Tim off , and the fading sounds of his scream ’s indicate that Tim is being pulled and dragged into the brush and away from camp .
As the tape comes to an end , the sounds of Amie ’s high - pitched screams rise to a new level , much like what has been described as “ the sound of a predator call used by hunters to produce the distress cries of a small wounded animal which often attracts bears ” .
Biologist Larry Van Daele , for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game theorizes that Amie ’s screams “ may have prompted the bear to return and kill her . ” ( Van Daele 2004 )
We can only envision the horror of what Amie had witnessed and heard .
Hysterical and “ paralyzed with fear , standing just outside of the tent until the bear returned and attacked her ” .
( I ’m not convinced of this .
More on this below too ) ( Readers Digest 2005 )
On Friday , October 8 , 2003 , two days after investigators first arrived and killed the two bears , a necropsy of the larger bear was conducted at the scene by biologist Larry Van Daele , where it was learned the stomach and digestive tract contained human remains and torn pieces of clothing .
Four garbage bags containing human remains were removed and flown out by helicopter .
( Egli 2004 )
The smaller younger bear had been eaten by other bears before the multi-agency team could return and only the head remained , so no determination could be made as to whether this young bear played any part in the deaths or the consumption of the victims .
Questions and Theories
What happened ?
What caused the first fatal bear attack in Katmai National Park history ?
Rare in itself .
Rarer yet , a bear who then consumes the victims .
It would be easy to say ;
Well , the fact that Tim often walked up close to bears to photograph them caused his death .
However , examining the evidence shows that this was not the case entirely , but was a contributing factor .
The attack and killings took place in camp the night before Willy Fulton flew in to pick Tim and Amie up .
Sunday night , and not during the day while Tim was normally out filming and interacting with bears .
When a bear comes into a camp , especially at night , we know that this is not a typical bear encounter but a bear that has possibly been conditioned to humans and human food , trash , or an older bear no longer able to feed on natural foods as efficiently , and we know that bears sometimes came into Tim ’s camp at night during previous summer excursions .
( Dr. Herrero 1985 , Treadwell 2001 , 2002 , et al )
For Tim , this was nothing unusual .
After all , he camped on established bear trails , or near intersecting bear trails , and had contact with the same bears every year and felt he knew each one personally .
In each case , Tim would leave the tent as soon as he heard a bear nearby , and would calmly talk to them in his often child like voice encouraging and forcing them to leave .
( Treadwell 2001 )
How do we know that ?
He often taped the encounters .
So what happened ?
Here is my theory of what took place that cold and stormy night .
Tim and Amie decide to stay a week later than they had ever stayed in the past , in search of a favorite bear yet unseen .
Bears in Katmai National
Park typically begin to den sometime in October or November and go into hyperpagia in early September , as they try to gain as much weight as possible prior to denning by mass feeding .
The salmon run was at its end , and the river that flowed through the “ grizzly maze ” contained the last remaining salmon of the year .
There is a possibility , as well as some speculation , that wilder unknown bears from the interior had possibly moved in , forcing out the bears
Tim was used to seeing and interacting with each year .
The berry crop was also reported poor by U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents .
The older , larger bear that killed Tim and Amie had been ear tagged in 1990 after the Valdez - Alaska oil spill as part of a larger research project , and had the number 141 tattooed on the inside of it ’s upper lip .
At the time of necropsy , 3 days after Tim and Amie were killed , bear # 141 was reported to be “ a scrawny , but healthy 1000 pound 28 - year - old male that was probably looking to fatten up for winter , with broken canine teeth , and others worn down to the gums ” .
( Dalrymple 2003 , Van Daele 2004 )
Right at the end of a three month long salmon spawn , which would indicate that this bear was no longer able to feed on natural food items as efficiently , as well as in competition with other , younger , stronger , more dominant bears for what little food remained , and we know from past experience that an older bear no longer able to feed on natural foods , will make more use of garbage , and often raid camps and cabins if it has ever had those food items available to it in the past .
Bears are opportunistic in obtaining food .
Whatever is easy to get to while expending the least amount of energy .
Brooks camp , a well known and heavily used fly in fishing camp is 60 air miles from Tim and Amie ’s camp .
My experience with camps like this is , there is always at least some garbage , trash or other food items laying around .
Lets face it , humans are not exactly the cleanest animals on the planet , “ what harm would it do to just toss this banana peal or apple core ? ”
The harder garbage is to dispose of , and in this case all garbage had to be flown out by plane , the easier and more available it is for bears in the area to get to .
Brooks camp would also increase the amount of human encounters .
Habituation to humans results in loss of fear .
However , it is unknown whether bear # 141 had ever gotten into or received some sort of food reward from humans .
We can only speculate .
There was also speculation that bear # 141 was a bear that Tim had never had contact with in past years .
However , from statements made by Willy Fulton , the pilot that transported Tim and Amie in and out each year , “ this was a bear he had seen before ” on previous flights and was “ just a dirty rotten bear , that Tim did n’t like anyway , and wanted to be friends with but never happened ” .
( Fulton 2004 )
Likewise , after reviewing the video tape made by Tim 10 days before he was killed , it is now believed that bear # 141 was a bear that Tim had named “ Ollie , the big old grumpy bear ” .
( Gaede 2005 , et al )
Tim and Amie ’s friends have also speculated that “ bear # 141 was an abused bear ” , because it had been previously trapped , tranquilized and tattooed , and that the bear had actually hunted Tim and Amie that night , and “ came for them ” .
If this were true , then we would have hundreds , possibly even thousands of bears hunting humans each year , which is just not the case and has been an argument made since the early 1960 ’s when bears were first trapped and studied .
That somehow these same bears then want to get back at humans is just too far reaching .
( Gaede 2005 )
Tim At The “ Grizzly Maze ” © Lion ’s Gate Films 2004
Amie and Tim were in the tent on Sunday night chatting about that days filming and returning to “ the world ” .
Open snack food was found in the tent untouched , so they were about to eat a quick snack before bed as the sound of a bear is heard outside .
Tim leaves the tent and walks away from the tent and towards the bear .
As Tim leaves the tent , investigators believe that Amie instinctively turns the camera on , possibly as “ her message in a bottle ” , and then asks Tim if the bear is still out there , and almost immediately the bear attacks .
( Van Daele 2005 , Readers Digest 2005 )
I do n’t believe this for a minute .
Having the presence of mind to turn a camera on with a bear just outside of a thin tent wall could only come from repetition , from someone who had done it many times .
Amie had only spent a few weeks , each of the three years that she had been to Alaska .
Tim on the other hand , had spent months each year for 13 years , five of which carrying a video camera , and literally filmed everything !
Every thought , every bear , every encounter , virtually every moment of every day , so that the camera became an extension of his body , and to think that Amie somehow knew that she and Tim were going to die that night is hard to believe .
I believe Tim left the tent and walked towards the bear a short distance , speaking softly to it as he had on numerous occasions , encouraging the bear to leave .
The bear keeps its distance , and when it appears that this will be like any other encounter , Tim decides to tape at least the audio portion for use in future presentations , yelling out to Amie to turn the camera on , which startles the bear , who had been still up to this point , and triggers the attack .
Up until that point , the bear had probably been sizing Tim up and making a judgment of threat level .
Amie turns the camera on and asks if the bear is still out there .
Tim then yells for Amie to “ Get out here !
I ’m getting killed out here ! ” .
Amie leaves the tent ( the sound of a zipper and the tent door being opened ) and sees Tim on the ground struggling with his head in the bear ’s mouth and yells for him to “ play dead ! ” .
Bears often attack , or defend themselves by first going for the head in an attempt to take out the opponents weapon ; the face , mouth and head .
Bear number # 141 had worn , broken canines and was unable to make use of this tactic , along with the fact that the human head is just too large to fit directly inside of a bears mouth .
“ Often ripping and tearing the scalp , ears , and face ” .
( Herrero 1985 , et al )
In my opinion , Amie was able to drive the bear away initially , because this was an older bear who had become conditioned when dealing with younger , stronger , more dominant bears by moving away from the food it had just obtained after being challenged , and was probably startled by a second animal , Amie in this case , suddenly appearing and making a lot of noise .
After scaring the bear away , Amie and Tim have a short conversation while determining where the bear is , and whether it is still nearby .
Amie is cautious and afraid , the tent is a secure refuge in her mind .
Amie then walks over to Tim , and based on training in the hospital no doubt told Tim to lay still , but is then tested and driven away by the bear , and at this point in the attack I believe Tim realized that this was not a typical bear encounter , and that playing dead was not going to work and the wrong response , yelling at Amie to “ hit the bear ! ” .
Again , I believe this older male bear had become conditioned through repetition .
In the past when this bear had been driven away from a freshly caught salmon or other food item , the need to eat and put on weight had no doubt caused this bear to then test the true strengths of the thief and attempt to re-take its meal .
Hundreds of video taped encounters like this have been filmed over the years with many different bears .
Tim had even filmed such encounters .
Once the bear had driven Amie off , I believe the bears predatory instincts took over and decided to drag
Tim off to a more secure area after Amie returned and began aggressively attacking it with the frying pan , just as the bear would have done when dealing with other more dominant bears and a freshly caught salmon or moose calf .

In video footage recovered from the camp , there was at least some video taken days or hours earlier , showing Amie sitting on the ground as a large bear sits behind her within 10 feet .
In this footage , Amie is obviously nervous and scared as she leans away from the bear .
Likewise , we know from Tim ’s diary that Amie was frightened of bears .
Knowing this , I think Amie was # 1 : Reluctant to leave the tent and approach and attack the bear that was on Tim right from the start of the attack and # 2 :
Not knowledgeable enough about bears herself to know that this was not a typical bear encounter , and that once she was able to push the bear away and had moved over to Tim , that she needed to fight back aggressively to keep the bear from returning , and once the bear tested her and she ran or moved away from Tim , that this triggered a predatory instinct in the bear to protect “ its kill ” , and dragged Tim away to a safer location .
Much as it would have done with a salmon or other food item when approached by other bears in the area .
In previous night time bear encounters around remote camps , individuals who aggressively fought bears that were attacking their friend , were in most cases , able to drive the bear away .
“ Grizzly bears usually enter camping areas at a walk and at night .
Before an attack , a person seldom sees any signs of aggression ” writes , Dr. Stephen Herrero in his book “ Bear Attacks , Their Causes and Avoidance ” .
Individuals who have aggressively yelled at the bear , or thrown rocks or other objects to distract the bear , generally have then had time to move away to safety or , they drove the bear away with the first yell and aggressive action .
Night encounters are much different than surprise encounters during the day and must be handled differently .
( Herrero 1985 , Schullery 1992 , et al )
However , in cases where individuals were able to drive a bear away during night encounters , but then moved away from the victim , either on purpose , or by the bear returning and “ testing ” this healthy person driving them off , the bear has in nearly every case dragged the victim even farther , and then killed and consumed him or her .
Extremely rare , but it has happened .
( Long 2002 , McMillion 1998 , Herrero 1985 , et al )
Had Amie aggressively fought off the bear after she got to Tim , would she have been able to save him and herself ?
Had she helped Tim back to the tent after the bear had moved off after the initial attack , or had Tim and Amie brought a can of “ Bear Spray ” , as they had on earlier expeditions , would they be alive today ?
Those are questions that will never be answered .
Anything is possible .
I believe that , had Tim not walked away from the tent and towards the bear , and had stayed with Amie , or had they both left the tent and backed away from the tent giving the bear room , that the bear would not have attacked and both Tim and Amie would be alive today .
Bears are more reluctant to attack multiple people than they are one lone individual .
In this particular case , the bear came walking down the path that night and had no where else to go , but right through the camp with Tim and Amie ’s tent in the middle of the trail .
I partially agree with the investigators , in that Amie screaming had initiated the attack on her after Tim had been dragged off .
If Amie had remained quiet , I doubt that the bear would have returned to her , which would have given her enough time to back away and get to the beach , where she could have hidden until the next day when Willy Fulton was expected to arrive , but when faced with the horror ’s she had just witnessed , who can blame her for losing her mind and screaming .
However , I do not believe that Amie ’s screams attracted the bear “ like a predator call ” .
There is no doubt that the sight ’s and sounds of Tim being dragged away from camp by the bear horrified Amie to the point where she lost her mind with fear .
When left with nothing else to do and confronted with extreme danger , screamed even louder in hopes that somehow this nightmare would end and the bear would once again leave Tim .
After all , she had screamed earlier and was successful in driving the bear away .
No gun , no weapon of any kind except for a frying pan , screaming was all she had left .
Instead of attracting the bear “ like a predator call ” , I believe this very aggressive bear was still attempting to “ protect its kill ” .
I believe that Amie more than likely ran after the bear a short distance , as it was dragging Tim up the trail screaming at the top of her lungs and striking the bear with the frying pan once again in a last ditch effort to drive the bear away , but was then pushed back to the tent a second time .
The bear was then caught up in the “ cat and mouse ” chase that no doubt resulted around the tent , and the bears predatory instinct was triggered and Amie was killed .
This latter scenario can not be confirmed because thankfully for us the video tape ran out before it occurred .
An Unconventional Person
Photo ©Tim Treadwell 2003
This incident occurred due to ” An unconventional person with unconventional behavior toward bears , camped in the middle of a very dangerous situation . ” .
Such were the words of biologist Larry Van Daele in trying to make sense of this tragedy .
Unconventional ?
Indeed .
Tim ’s foolish disregard for his own safety , and over confidence dealing with bears in the past , luck really , not to mention his mistake of placing anthropomorphic values on bears , and disregarding established federal guidelines when photographing and camping with brown bears contributed to both Tim and Amie ’s death .
Grizzly bears are wild animals and should always be treated as such , wild and unpredictable .
Not a pet , or lovable cuddly bear .
Tim would often tell listeners about the time he calmly defused a dangerous encounter with a bear , by talking softly to it .
When the confrontation was over , he claimed to have laid down and napped next to the sleeping bear .
Likewise , in a 1994 interview when he was asked whether he was ever afraid of the bears , he responded with saying “ They would n’t hurt me ” .
Did Treadwell have a special connection with the bears ?
Not all bear researchers think so .
“ I ’ve been working on bears for a long time , and more and more I ’m convinced that most of the credit for bears and people getting along goes to the bears , ” said John Hechtel , a wildlife biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game .
“ Bears along the Alaskan coast are well - fed because of the area ’s salmon runs .
The salmon attract an extremely dense population of bears .
So , the challenge for the coastal grizzlies is n’t dealing with people — it ’s competing for food ” .
( Hechtel 2003 )
Throughout the movie , Grizzly Man , we see Tim in numerous close encounters , and very nearly attacked on several occasions .
Because he was not attacked says more for the bears than to Tim ’s expertise in handling aggressive bears .
He was just plain lucky for 13 years and became over confident in his own abilities .
The fact that he was not killed earlier , just goes to prove that grizzly bears really want nothing to do with humans and would rather avoid us whenever possible , but will tolerate us , to a point .
There are boundaries in the world of the bear , and in wilderness .
Each year , when Tim set camp within Katmai National Park , he voluntarily became a member of the food chain , and by not placing an electric fence around his camp ( All bear researchers that camp in this area reportedly set up portable electric fences ) , by hiding his camp from park rangers in dense alder brush thickets , as well as refusing to carry bear spray ( firearms are prohibited in National Parks ) and by crawling and walking up close to large brown bears , often touching or attempting to touch adult bears and young cubs , showed a total disregard for his life , the life of his girlfriend Amie Huguenard , and the lives of each bear that he interacted with .
( National Park Service 2003 )
The same bears he claimed to protect .
Who ’s to blame ?
Only Tim , and of course Amie for trusting Tim , but then who can really say ?
It is possible that this incident would have occurred no matter what precautions Tim and Amie might have taken .
It is very easy to sit back in our nice comfortable living rooms and Monday morning quarterback what occurred far away and a week , or even years earlier .
It could be as simple as ; Being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
That ’s the risk we have to take to see the last remaining symbol of wilderness .
Sometimes you get the bear , and sometimes the bear gets you .
The more time you spend with grizzly bears increases the chances that the bear will someday get you .
A sobering thought for someone like myself .
One who spends so much time each year around grizzly bears , but is also the thought that keeps me in check .
It is far too easy to fall prey to your own self confidence .
Always reminding myself that the more time I spend in “ grizzly country ” increases the chances that someday , something could go wrong “ keeps me on my toes ” at all times and always expecting things to “ go south ” at any moment .
Very strange things happen in the backcountry when you are least expecting it .
No matter how many safety precautions you may have taken , or how prepared you might be .
I have to wonder though , Did Tim still think that grizzly bears were “ mainly harmless party animals ” as the bear attacked and then dragged him away from camp ?
( Tim Treadwell )
Hero ’s and Nightmares
The true hero of this sad tale is of course Amie Huguenard , the one person in this saga that we know so little about .
Who , even though horrified at the sights and sounds of Tim being eaten alive , stayed with a man she knew was “ hell bent on destruction ” , overcoming her fear and fought a thousand pound grizzly bear with nothing more than a frying pan for at least 6 minutes in an attempt to save her friend and lover Tim Treadwell .
Knowing that both tents were knocked down , the contents , including open snack food , as well as their neatly placed shoes discovered untouched in the sleeping tent , sends chills down my back when I think about it , and I have often woke in the middle of the night drenched in a cold sweat knowing that Amie had retreated to the main tent as Tim was being dragged kicking and screaming away from camp .
Did Amie try and keep the tents between herself and the bear when it returned ?
Dodging and weaving around one tent , and then the other , out of her mind with fear ?
No where to go , no tree to climb , no police officer to call , and left screaming , running around the only barrier left between her and the bear , only to have the bear finally just go over the top and finally catch her ?
The stuff horror movies are made of .
Stephen King could not have dreamed of a more frightening sequence of events .
I suppose that is my payment for knowing too much information , and being able to fill in the blanks .
I only hope that the end came quick for Amie .
Grizzly Man – The Movie
A final note on the movie Grizzly Man .
In the last few minutes of the film , we see Tim walking across the tidal flats with two red fox following close behind .
Pretty neat , and I have to admit I too have had similar experiences .
Anyone that spends as much time in the field as Tim and I have , will no doubt have had similar experiences .
I remember once out at my bear viewing area sitting alone one day , and feeling a bit sleepy in the warm sun I decided to lay back and close my eyes for a moment , when I remember feeling that something was watching me .
I slowly raised up and looked around , only to discover that a family of 6 coyotes had moved in behind me , the adult alpha ’s sitting within feet of me while the pups played nearby .
After a few minutes , I decided to get up and walk across the meadow , only to have the whole family follow along beside me .
The only difference between Tim and I is , Tim felt that the fox were kindred spirits , whereas I knew that the coyotes were looking at me as they would any other large carnivore in the wild , and that hopefully I would lead them to food much as a bear or wolf would do .
Or maybe , I was the food !
Willy Fulton states ;
“ Tim was a little smarter than most people gave him credit for .
He made it out here a long time before they ( the bears ) got him ” .
No Willy .
Tim was just lucky and his luck finally ran out .
Discovery Channel
After watching the special airing of the movie Grizzly Man on the Discovery Channel February 4 , 2006 .
I , along with many others found it very curious that Tim ’s possessions and ashes were handed over to Jewel Palovak and not to his parents .
From what I could find out , the only possession of Tim ’s returned to his parents was his teddy bear , which he carried with him his entire adult life , including all 13 summers to Alaska .
( I have new details regarding this –to be added–basically , Tim wrote out and signed a letter to the park service claiming that he had no living relatives , and should he be killed , to give his possessions and remains to Jewel Palovak ) .
At the end of the movie , the Discovery Channel had a special interview with his friends , as well as additional out - takes of the movie .
One scene that was not included in the movie was of Jewel Palovak and pilot Willy Fulton looking down on the decayed carcass of a young sub - adult bear .
Jewel states that no bears were poached while Tim was in Katmai , but that after he died 6 bears were poached within the park .
The problem I have with this is , the decomposing bear carcass I saw in the out - take showed no actual sign of being poached , it was just a dead bear .
Bears die all the time , they fight , they starve , they get diseases and other injuries , they die .
In fact , in the movie Grizzly Man , Tim himself had video taped the remains of a young bear that had been killed and eaten by other bears .
Tim ’s friends claim that poaching “ goes on all the time ” and that Tim protected the bears while he was in Katmai , but if in fact there had been 6 bears poached after Tim was killed , I think we would have seen more conclusive evidence of this and probably the main reason why Werner did not include that particular scene in the movie .
A decomposed carcass of a dead bear laying in the grass is just that — a carcass of a bear .
Who knows how it died .
Jewel Palovak also states in her interview , that Tim was working with the park service , providing them with information on boat traffic , weather and other data collected .
In fact , there is no evidence that Tim worked closely with the park service in any way .
If Tim did provide basic information on visitor use , boat and plane traffic , as well as weather information , I would argue that it was more in passing during incidental conversation , and not with official record keeping .
If Tim was working closely with the park service , why did he feel the need to hide his camps from them ?
Not to mention the temper tantrum he threw on camera cursing the park service personnel for harassing him .
( More on this – I discovered only one official document which Tim used to track and record public use from June 27 , 1999 through July 10 , 1999 and one unofficial hand written document regarding weather for June 1 - 13 , 2000 .
No other record keeping by Tim was turned over to the park service . )
© Tim Treadwell 2003
One other thought came to mind after a short conversation with a Yellowstone biologist who is also interested in this story .
It was very interesting , and rather suspicious , that every time Tim reached out to the fox in the movie , the fox would nip at or lick his fingers .
Was Tim feeding the fox ?
Had he also habituated the fox to him , as well as all humans by feeding them ?
If so , his concern for people killing fox then placed those very fox he was so desperate to protect in even greater danger the next time they encounter a human and expect to be fed .
Not surprising the fox followed his every step .
Documented video shot by Tim of him feeding the fox has been uncovered .
There have been quite a few comments made about Tim being responsible for Amie ’s death , I have actually struggled with this for several years now .
Without a doubt , Tim holds some of the responsibility for Amie ’s death .
But keep in mind , Amie was a smart girl , she was a physicians assistant after all , no small feat .
Amie was no doubt in love with this odd - ball , but she was n’t stupid , or weak , She could have left at any time .
Tim did not handcuff or hold her hostage up in Alaska , Amie came and went of her own free will twice each year for three summers .
Watching bears and wolves in the wilderness is addicting .
I know , I ’ve experienced it myself and I have seen folks give up high paying jobs just to be able to do it .
Do n’t ask me why because I can’t explain it myself , and many people would never understand it , even if I were able to explain it .
Amie may have found the adventure of traveling to Alaska romantic and exciting and may have even found spending time with a quirky guy like Tim to be entertaining and a refreshing escape from her work - a - day life in the city , no doubt filled with dangers and freaks of its own , but the truth and reality is Tim did not kill Amie .
A bear killed Amie .
This story just keeps evolving .
The more we learn , the less we seem to know or understand .
I originally had thoughts of turning this into a book , but after much thought and consideration , I decided that in doing so , I would be profiting from someone ’s death .
There are several books that have already been published , much too early in my opinion , and before most of the information I have been able to uncover has been released , all with their own theories and speculation .
I hope that in publishing this story online , that this will prevent those authors from profiting from Tim and Amie ’s death .
Frequently Asked Question
Have you listened to the supposedly “ real death audio ” that is floating around on the internet , including UTube and is it real ?
I have heard it and no it is not real but a fake or spoof .
Jewel Palovak still holds the original tape and has no plans to release it .
I hope that she never does .
There is now a second fake version posted on UTube .
The publisher of this latest UTube version stated to me in an email that he knew the audio he labeled as real , is in fact a fake .
It was posted to draw traffic to his UTube page .
There are several ways to determine whether one of these recordings is real or not .
Just recently I was given access to the first 2 minutes of the 6 minute tape .
There are two sounds that have not been published that are unmistakeable and have been missing in each fake tape that I have heard .
All fake recordings so far have been under 3 minutes in length and the real tape is 6 minutes .
As I reported above in my investigation the bear is nearly silent .
Bears typically make very little sounds , and each fake recording has the sound of a bear roaring , growling , and making all sorts of noises .
In movies , bear noises are dubbed in electronically .

[ Editor 's Note : This article was first published November 24 , 2005 . ]
The US trade deficit is often viewed with alarm and has attracted considerable attention from both the public at large and policy makers .
Much of the uneasiness about the US trade deficit can quite simply be attributed to the term " deficit " itself , which holds with it many underlying negative connotations .
However , in answer to these concerns , one may take the perspective , drawing on the theories of Ludwig on Mises and Friedrich August von Hayek from the Austrian School of Economics , that the US trade deficit is merely a reflection of the competitive advantage that the United States has been enjoying over the past decades .
Opting for a relatively free - market system , the United States appears to have succeeded in providing an environment more conducive to investment and growth than other currency regions , most notably Europe and Japan .
This is evidenced , for instance , in its higher growth and capital return rates .
In the words of Mises , " [ … ] the tremendous progress of technological methods of production and the resulting increase in wealth and welfare were feasible only through the pursuit of those liberal policies [ … ] "
That said , the current deficit in the United States may very well be a result of its adherence to a more efficient economic model than many other currency areas .
" The idea that there is a third system — between socialism and capitalism , as its supporters say — a system as far away from socialism as it is from capitalism but that retains the advantages and avoids the disadvantages of each — is pure nonsense . " [… ]
" The idea of government interference as a " solution " to economic problems leads , in every country , to conditions which , at the least , are very unsatisfactory and often quite chaotic .
If the government does not stop in time , it will bring on socialism . "
Building on what Mises termed the infeasibility of pursuing the idea of a third system , Friedrich August von Hayek in his Fatal Conceit ( 1988 ) asserted that such attempts would interrupt the natural operation of a market economy and individual freedom and yield worse results than a spontaneously working economic order .
In contrast to the fairly strong degree of government interventions in the market system practiced in many Western industrialized countries — be it via taxation , regulation , redistribution of market generated incomes , etc. — the United States may still be inspiring confidence among investors that liberal economic principles and , as a result , a systematic economic outperformance might be preserved .
The upshot of such an interpretation would be that the United States continues to attract funds from abroad as long as internationally scarce resources are allowed to be used most efficiently .
As long as demand for US dollar - denominated assets from abroad exceeds US residents ' demand for assets from the rest of the world , we should see the United States continue to accumulate capital surpluses — here regarded as merely the flip side of trade balance deficits ; an interpretation which echoes the work of Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk ( 1914 ) , who wrote that the capital account would reign over the trade balance .
To shed some more light on such a conclusion , we must take a closer look at the economic precepts underlying our understanding of the US trade deficit .
A country 's transactions with the rest of the world within a given period of time are recorded on its " balance of payments . "
Goods transactions are shown in the trade balance .
A country records a trade deficit ( surplus ) if the value of its exports to other countries falls short of ( exceeds ) the value of imports from abroad .
However , the trade balance shows only " one side " of total transactions , namely a country 's goods transactions .
The other side comprises capital flows , which are recorded in the capital account .
The capital account provides a contrast between a country 's capital imports and exports .
If , for instance , foreigners buy more stocks and bonds in the United States than US citizens purchase abroad , the capital account balance records a surplus .
Japan and Germany , for example , are " chronic " capital exporters , meaning that the amount of assets they acquire abroad exceeds foreign demand for Japanese and German assets .
As a result , the capital account deficits of these countries corresponds with US trade surpluses .
Importantly , when one has a free floating exchange rate , a deficit ( surplus ) in the trade balance will by definition be accompanied by a surplus ( deficit ) in the capital account , and the balance of payments will always be balanced — i.e. , the amount of goods and services bought and sold equals the amount of money spent and received from abroad .
How It Worked Under the Gold Standard
To better understand why a trade deficit is widely viewed as " dangerous , " it is useful to look briefly at the period when the gold standard prevailed .
Under such a monetary regime , countries ' trade balances tended to be zero , with temporary trade surpluses or deficits ironed out over time .
For example , think of a country accumulating a trade surplus during this period .
It would receive gold inflows from importing countries .
The increase in the domestic stock of gold , in turn , would make the domestic money supply " looser , " thereby stimulating output and employment .
The rise in the domestic money supply would then translate , sooner or later , into higher domestic prices , which caused exported goods to be less price competitive and imported ones more attractive .
As a result , a country 's exports declined and imports rose .
The trade balance " deteriorated , " that is to say the surplus declined ( and even became negative ) , as did the stock of domestic gold ( i.e. , money ) ; the latter declined to the same extent to which the trade surplus declined .
So over time , a country 's trade balance tended to follow along the line of a " zero mean reverting " process .
Figure 1 illustrates this point .
It shows the US current account as a fraction of total output on a historical basis .
On average , the ratio was less than 0.5 % ( close to zero ) from 1870 to 1973 , after which the gold standard ( i.e. , the system of fixed exchange rates ) finally broke down .
Since then , the trade deficit has embarked upon a widening trend .
In 2004 , the deficit ratio amounted to 5.5 % , the highest proportion from 1870 to 2004 .
Figure 1
Source : Historical series is from International Historical Statistics , ' The Americas 1750 - 1993 ' , 4th Edition by B. R. Mitchell ; Graph is taken from Pakko , M. R. , ' The U.S. Trade Deficit and the " New Economy " ' .
Under the gold standard , any build - up of export surpluses — and the accompanying " boom " for the domestic economy — was seen as something that needed to be reversed , a process accompanied by unwanted swings in growth and employment .
This explains to some extent why to this day a country 's trade imbalance continues to be seen as calamitous .
However , such concerns are no longer justified in the post - gold standard era .
The " gold automatism " for balancing countries ' trade ended with the transition to paper money at the beginning of the 1970s when we began to see the implementation of flexible exchange rates .
But With Free Floating Exchange Rates ...
With free floating exchange rates and virtually free capital movements , the build - up of persistent trade deficits and surpluses — which are usually referred to as " imbalances " — has become a characteristic of the world trading system .
The latest rush towards an ever - more globalized economy seems to have added greatly to the dispersion of international investment and savings , and thus the build - up of trade surpluses and deficits among countries .
Today , countries ' trade ( e.g. , capital ) account balances reflect the increasing internationalization of investment and savings .
A country with a trade surplus simply saves by investing more in foreign rather than in domestic assets : it sells more goods and services abroad than it imports from the rest of the world , and uses the proceeds for investing abroad ( in bonds , stocks and real investment in such areas as machinery ) .
Likewise , a country showing a trade deficit receives more money from abroad than it is itself saving abroad .
Figure 2
Thomson Financials ; own calculations . —
A rise ( decline ) in the real effective US dollar exchange rate signals an appreciation ( depreciation ) of the dollar against its trading partner currencies .
It is often said that a rising trade deficit will lead to a depreciation of the US dollar .
However , data paint a very different picture .
Figure 2 shows the real effective external value of the US dollar and the US trade deficit as a percentage of GDP from the middle of the 1970s to Q1 05 .
It shows that a rising ( shrinking ) trade deficit has been , on average , accompanied by an appreciation ( depreciation ) of the real value of the trade - weighted greenback .
How can such a finding be interpreted ?
A growing ( shrinking ) trade deficit would imply a growing ( shrinking ) capital account surplus , which should imply rising ( declining ) demand for US balances relative to foreign currencies .
This , in turn , would suggest that a rising trade balance should be , on average , accompanied by an appreciating external value of the US dollar , a result supported by the figure above .
This is not to say , of course , that there is a clear - cut " causality " between the exchange rate and the trade deficit .
It might well be that both variables are driven by other determinants .
Since the second half of 2002 , however , the widening of the trade balance has been accompanied by a depreciation of the real trade - weighted US dollar exchange rate .
Is the latest exchange rate move a precursor to a forthcoming reversal of the US trade deficit ?
Not necessarily .
It might simply be attributable to the latest swelling of US government deficits .
Investors could interpret rising deficit spending as a result of growing societal aversion to a continued reliance on pure market forces and an increasing desire to take recourse through state intervention , which in turn runs the risk of denting investor confidence that a market - oriented system will be preserved .
This leads us to the crucial question :
How long can , and will , the US trade deficit actually persist ?
The widely held notion that a reduction of the US trade balance is inevitable rests on the tenets of the traditional growth theory .
This theory suggests that divergences between currency areas ' growth and capital return rates might prove to be temporary in nature , as they tend to converge sooner or later .
If such a convergence were to hold true , then indeed the US trade deficit would have to shrink at some point .
However , the new growth theory suggests that this very adjustment process might not necessarily unfold .
This theory propounds that institutions — bearing in mind their cultural and traditional variances , as well as deliberately chosen economic systems — could prevent at least a " full " convergence of those factors that are held responsible for determining a country 's growth path .
According to new growth theorists , it is not inconceivable that trade " imbalances " could become entrenched in certain countries .
Foreign Investment Pours In , Increasing the Trade Deficit
As suggested earlier , the continued appeal of investing in the United States relative to other currency areas might be a key factor in the continuance of the US trade deficit .
As long as the United States is perceived by investors as providing the market place with institutions that are conducive to free market economies and which generate favorable growth and capital return rates ( compared to Europe and Japan for example ) , the United States will maintain its position as a favored investment region .
As a result , the United States is likely to remain in a position to accumulate capital account surpluses , with the external value of the greenback remaining under appreciating pressure .
Of course , under such a scenario , any initiative to increase economic growth in trading partner countries would work towards eliminating currently existing trade deficits and surpluses .
As the current US account deficit directly correlates to capital imports , a reduction in the " growth gap " between the United States and the rest of the developed countries would presumably lower capital inflows into the United States , thereby contributing to a lower US trade balance and , correspondingly , lower capital account deficits in the trading partner countries .
In summary , under the prevailing flexible exchange rate regime , the US trade deficit should not be viewed as a worrisome economic " imbalance " that will inevitably have to be corrected .
So far , the US trade deficit seems to be a reflection of the US economy 's strength vis -à - vis its trading partners .
And it might well be that the US trade deficit will continue to widen in the coming years — which would be the case if the United States ' trading partners prove to be unsuccessful in making their economies more conducive to investment and growth compared with the status quo .
So the essential issue about the future of the US trade deficit is whether and how the current relative growth performance constellation in the world trading system will be changing in the coming years .
As long as the United States keeps its preference for a free market regime , it might well retain , or even increase , its competitive advantage in allocating scare resources more efficiently than currency areas where relatively wide - spread government interventions have become a characteristic of societal organization .
In today 's world of flexible exchange rates , the United States ' competitive edge is reflected by a capital surplus , i.e. , a trade deficit .
It ’s like clockwork .
Every year a portion of our top talent decides it ’s time to move on .
Once those bonus or holiday checks are cashed , the flood gates open and the resignation letters start flowing in .
I work in a large company and this is a problem that we have with our IT and Sales groups in particular .
I reached out a to a few peers with other companies ( one is an IT exec and one is actually a Group President ) and as an exercise , we took a bunch of historical data and started identifying the factors that led to the annual exodus .
We focused only the top 20 % of the employees from a performance standpoint .
It ’s not that the remaining 80 % is unimportant , however , from a productivity , growth , and brainpower perspective , the top 20 % of any group is critical .
Moreover , these are the employees that are very difficult to replace .
To do this , we reviewed notes from exit interviews , cross referenced annual reviews and ultimately came up with 178 voluntary terminations from people that would have been considered in the top 20 % .
To try and keep focused on macro issues , we consolidated the responses and placed them into categories :
Money
Unchallenged
Too Challenged
Dead Company
Watch your Levels ( and the BS )
Here is the breakdown of the categories .
I know someone is bound to ask why it does n’t add up so …
Please keep in mind that this will not add up to 178 because several people insisted on listing 2 - 3 reasons when the question only asked for 1 reason .
Money :
This one was obvious however we found some interesting nuggets of information :
The Stats :
Of the 178 files , 83 people listed money as a reason for leaving .
62 listed it as the only reason
In those 62 cases , only 8 were at the top of their pay scale – so there was still room to earn more .
Roughly 46 % of the employees that left did so because of money concerns .
To be honest , I thought this would be a much higher percentage .
I think the most alarming stat to me here is that only 8 out of 83 ( 9 % ) people had maxed out their pay potential .
Keep in mind that these are top employees that would have received above - average pay increases .
My assumption is that they viewed changing companies as the faster path to higher earnings despite the fact that there may have been additional promotions available ( which was the case several times ) .
This may mean a few things :
We are not watching the market rate for these positions closely enough – our “ pay potential ” might be way too low
Our pay scale does n’t increase at the same rate as the market rates
Star Employees know their value .
If you wo n’t compensate them for it , they will look elsewhere in a heartbeat
We are not doing a good enough job at drawing the line towards advancement .
If the employee actually sees advancement as a sure possibility as opposed to a pipe dream , it may slow their decision to jump to another company .
Just because a engineer was hired 3 years ago at $ 70 K and currently makes $ 77 K does not mean that is the going rate simply because you built the comp plan that way .
If your HR group is not benchmarking what these positions are really making in the world , you better .
Unchallenged :
At what point does workplace monotony kill someone ’s drive ?
The Stats : 42 records ( 23 % ) showed this was their # 1 reason for leaving .
One of the forms was completed by an employee that had the exact same job function for 3 years .
He is a great example of this point .
This employee was in the 20 % tier because he had mastered his position and was viewed by many as someone literally doing the work of 2 people .
His performance reviews were flawless .
BUT – and here is the killer , he did n’t feel that way .
He thrived on pressure and having a huge workload was natural to him .
Although his manager did n’t see it , this guy was bored out of his skull and wanted more .
Year after year he exceeded every expectation on his review and he was compensated for it but that was it .
In this case , it was n’t a matter of compensation , it was strictly responsibility .
One might blame this particular employee for not making his own opportunities and being more aggressive .
However , one may also blame the manager for not fully understanding his top employee ’s goals , motivations , or attitude .
It is incredibly important to have a clear understanding on what your star employees think .
The best way to understand this is by simply talking to them .
I am not saying you have to be best friends but as a manager , you have to know how the employee feels .
In fact , it ’s kind of easy to test for .
If there is an employee killing all his goals , try giving him more responsibility .
It could be as small as becoming a mentor for a new hire , or asking him to interview someone for you .
The goal is to keep a star challenged without crossing the line .
Too Challenged : Toss ’em in and see if they swim .
The Stats : 38 records ( 21 % ) showed this was their # 1 reason for leaving .
Remember we are only talking about the 20 % tier so the people that listed this reason , are not the lazy people of the bunch .
They are the ones fed up with bureaucracy , hiring freezes , lack of cooperation , undefined goals , and poor technology .
You can not ask someone to complete 20 tasks and then give them inferior tools and personnel .
A lot of employees will struggle through these problems because of their dedication to the company , however , at some point , the fight is no longer sustainable .
The employee will either leave , OR , become so unmotivated that they lose their star status and become a normal employee and thus under perform .
You can not always depend on an employee to come to you with concerns .
I do n’t care how often you proclaim you have an open door policy – it simply is not going to happen on a regular basis .
To kill two birds with one stone , you could ask key employees for their views on the department , projects , etc .
You can also ask for their solutions to the problems they present .
Sure , their solutions may not always be implemented but at least they are involved and you know how they feel .
When people view themselves as part of a solution , they are less likely to become disgruntled thus delaying the boiling point that forces them to leave .
Dead Company : AKA Death by Boredom
The Stats : 38 records ( 21 % ) showed this was their # 1 reason for leaving
If the leadership team of your company is constantly drab regardless of the company ’s growth or the goals achieved , you are in trouble .
All employees want money and to be challenged but they do n’t want to have to self - motivate 100 % of the time .
For example , I worked for a small company that had n’t created a new product in 10 years .
Nothing ever changed and to make matters worse , the executives were all stiffs .
I do n’t believe I ever saw an executive smile and that attitude trickled down the food chain .
$ 30 K a year with a company full of stiffs is worse to me than $ 28,500 with a fun energetic company .
You can help take this burden off their plates buy injecting a little upbeat atmosphere .
I am not talking about whirley ball , acting like a clown or naming Friday as “ Beer in the office day ” , but your attitude speaks volumes .
I will say that I was surprised that this percentage was just as high as those that felt “ Too Challenged ” from above .
Watch your Levels and the BS
The Stats : 51 people added something random to their primary reason of leaving .
Just because you are an Executive and depend on mid-level managers to do the day - to - day managing , does not mean that you should be ignorant to what is going on .
We added this category after seeing the huge number of people having issues that appeared small , but were large enough for them to leave the company .
So think of this as the micro managing managers , peer conflict sessions gone awry , crying employees in the bathrooms , process trolls , etc .
Let me give you an example :
We saw one case where a department had 2 people leave because they disagreed with the same policy .
So on a team of 9 , the 2 strongest people left .
Does n’t that indicate to management that the policy may be flawed ?
If I had been the VP or executive , I would have certainly been asking the group manager for a huge explanation .
As it stood , the employees left and the policy stayed .
The key here is that your best employees are the best for a reason .
When policies are changed , there is no one better than your star employee to consult with .
This category actually reminds me of a post that Frank did a few weeks back listing 50 Ways a manager can get employees to quit .
Basically , we saw half of these reasons on these forms and they are all things to at least be aware of because managers and team leaders do them all the time .
If you have good ways of keeping your great employees happy and productive , let me know .
Better yet , tell me what you are getting from your manager today that would make you think twice before jumping ship .

Tiny transistor uses a single electron to turn off and on at room temperature .
Field of dreams : flat sheets of carbon could be etched into better transistors .
Nature Materials
The latest contender to succeed silicon 's throne is graphene .
It has been used to make a truly tiny transistor that works at room temperature , offering hope for making faster , smaller electronics devices once silicon reaches its limits .
Graphene is a two - dimensional form of carbon , discovered just three years ago .
It is very thin — just one atom thick — and highly conductive with minimal resistance , which has sent physicists and materials scientists into a frenzy to find applications that exploit these properties .
Andre Geim at The University of Manchester , UK , and colleagues made a device etched out of a sheet of graphene that acts as a single electron transistor ( SET ) .
The device has a tiny restriction , less than 10 nanometres wide , which can hold a single electron .
If an electron is held and trapped here it creates what is known as a Coulomb blockade — no electrons can flow through the device when this electron is in the way .
As a result , the transistor can be turned on or off simply by shunting a single electron into and out of this restriction , which requires only a tiny amount of ' gate voltage ' to accomplish .
The upshot is that a very small change in voltage can cause a large change in current , making the devices very sensitive and fast .
And also small : " The SET relies on controlling electrons one by one ; by definition it has to be very small , " says Geim .
Such devices have been made previously from conventional semiconductor materials , such as silicon , but these only worked at very low temperatures .
At room temperature and at such small scales , silicon oxidizes and decomposes .
Graphene , on the other hand , is stable at room temperature .
News of the tiny transistor is unveiled today in a review article1 , and Geim has submitted more detailed results to the journal Physical Review Letters .
Ragged edge
Pablo Jarillo - Herrero , at Columbia University , New York , works with graphene and says that Geim 's work is a useful proof of concept .
But there are still problems to be overcome .
Etching graphene leaves edges with dangling carbon bonds , he says , which can cause background electrons to scatter .
This makes the transistor less efficient , although the full effect of the scattering is n't yet known .
But the vast knowledge of carbon chemistry should hold the answer to how to overcome this kind of problem , he predicts , by chemically altering those edges .
Current industry predictions suggest that by 2020 silicon devices will have shrunk to about 20 nanometres and have reached their limit in size and performance .
It is only after this that materials such as graphene will come into their own .
And that gives scientists time to perfect the tricky fabrication methods to make such small devices .
ADVERTISEMENT
Geim 's fabrication method has so far relied on luck : they can etch a very small gate , but it is only sometimes actually small enough to be blocked by a single electron .
But he is confident that microfabrication techniques will have this problem cracked by the time silicon breathes its last breath .
" Graphene is not going to kill silicon , " says Geim , but it has the most realistic promise of all materials investigated so far .
" Graphene offers a glimpse of what is possible after silicon becomes unviable . "

Life at home , meanwhile , was bad enough .
Ms. Albert ran away .
She landed in the punk scene , in the East Village , with the hustlers and the addicts .
This was around the time of her initial trip to a psychiatric ward .
She was still in her early teens .
Eventually , she said , her parents sent her to a group home , where she lived as a ward of the state .
( She considered Mayor Koch to be her father . )
The stories of the girls she met were incorporated later into fiction , not unlike the stories of the punks from Tompkins Square .
Then , in 1989 , she moved to San Francisco , where she worked as a maid and a baby sitter and sold her blood in order to survive .
She also worked as a phone sex operator and perfected a sultry Southern accent she would later put to use in interviews as JT Leroy , including one , played in court , with Terry Gross , the NPR host .
It was in San Francisco , she said , that she started calling suicide hot lines from a pay phone on the street .
Incapable of speaking as herself , she adopted the personas of various teenage boys .
One of those was a tattered runaway from West Virginia , a misfit from an educated family , who was living on the street .
His name was Jeremy or Jeremiah : an embryonic version of JT Leroy .
At this point , fractured as it was , Ms. Albert ’s psyche seemed to fracture yet again .
She had , for months , as Jeremiah , been talking on the hot line to Dr. Terrence Owens , a psychiatrist .
When Dr. Owens said he wished to meet , Ms. Albert paid a street waif to appear as Jeremiah , and then went along as his friend and roommate Speedy — which is to say , a patient standing with her alter ego in the third - degree remove of the alter ego ’s friend .
Speedy was a character that remained with Ms. Albert even after “ Sarah ” was released in 2000 to almost instant critical acclaim .
When Steven Shainberg , the proposed director of the film , flew to San Francisco to meet JT Leroy , Ms. Albert , in the guise of Speedy , picked him up and whisked him off to an expensive sushi restaurant , where “ JT , ” played by the sister of Ms. Albert ’s former boyfriend , sat there mute throughout the meal , and then stuck Mr. Shainberg with the check .
一時期パソコン教室の講師をやっていたことによる経験と、昨今Webサービス運用にあたって中高年層からのクレームなどを自分なりにまとめた結果として、50代以上のユーザに対するWebサービス＆PCアプリケーションのUI設計における以下10のTIPSを公開してみたいと思う。...といってもたかだか10個で収まる簡単な話ではないので、思いついたら都度追加して行きたい。
アイコンは理解されない 使う場合は添え書きを ■で停止、▲で再生なんてことすら理解されないことも。家マークを押したらホームに戻る、なんてのは本当にまったくと言っていいほど理解されない。説明すればわかってもらえるが使わないとすぐに忘れる。フロッピーのマークで「保存」とかもう絶対だめ。だいたいいまどきフロッピーに保存なんてせんでしょうMSさん(ぉ どうしても使いたい場合は 「 ■
停止」といった風にキャプションを添えること。
ブラウザにてリンクを新しいウィンドゥで開くのはNG
元の画面に戻る術を知らない、知っていてもウィンドウを閉じるのが面倒と感じる。閉じるアイコン(Ｘ)が意外に小さくクリックしづらいらしい。ALT+F4を使えよ、なんてのはナンセンス。でもブラウザの戻るボタンは使えるんだなこれが。日ごろの鍛錬の賜物だろうか。
1つの画面に多数の機能を並べてはいけない 一般PCユーザはなるたけ1画面に沢山の機能を配し、画面遷移することなく多種多様な操作ができることを好むが、シニアユーザは混乱する。また、多様な機能を配置する際、省スペース化のためにアイコンやプルダウンリストが多様されることも、わかりにくさを助長している。1画面でできることを限定し、画面遷移数は増えても長い説明文を併用したボタン名とするが吉。ちなみに家電のUI設計はわりとこの考え方を取り入れている。 ⇒ だからPCユーザには使いづらい 例：
AJAX や Flashで可能になったからといってドラッグ＆ドロップは使うな 単純にD&Dを知らないユーザが多いだけでなく、マウスの感度を下げている(上げていない)ことが多いため、ドラッグしても目的箇所までカーソルを移動させられない場合が多い。ボタンを押したままマウスを持ち上げ、再度マウスを移動させればいいだけなのだが、その操作ができる人はほとんどいない。また、メンテナンスが行き届いていないマウス，PC付属のしょぼいマウスを使っている場合がほとんどのため、ドラッグ中にボタンから指を離していないにも関わらずドロップされてしまうケースが散見された。
I admit it : I ’m a gadget addict .
I like little devices that do neat things .
At the same time , I also like to save money .
What is a poor modern man to do with these two conflicting interests ?
Simple .
I buy gadgets that can pay for themselves ( and even see a bit of return ) over the long haul .
This usually means I look for energy - efficient gadgets , but it also means that I try to evaluate things in terms of whether or not they can potentially return money to me .
What ’s nice is that many of these gadgets that save me money in the long run make a great deal of environmental sense as well .
Here ’s a list of twenty five neat items I ’ve found that can save a lot of money , along with their cost and the amount of time that it will take before their extra cost is paid for by their utility .
Since they ’re gizmos , they make for great gift ideas , plus you can use the argument that “ this will save money ” when suggesting the purchase of one of these items to your significant other .
In fact , I actually started this list as justification to my wife for a few items I wanted to buy for myself .
1. Filtered Water Bottle
Sample Model : Katadyn Exstream Personal Water Bottle Purifier
Price : $ 39.95 + $ 32.95 cartridge refills

High efficiency showerheads save money by reducing the amount of water that needs to flow through your hot water heater .
An average American household can save as much as 15,000 gallons of water per year by installing high - efficiency shower heads .
Even better : that ’s 15,000 gallons of hot water that your heater does n’t have to heat , cutting down on your energy costs as well .
11 . Fuel - Efficient Scooter
Sample Model : 2006 Vespa PX
150
Price : $ 4,200
Time Until Break Even : 4 years
A high - efficiency scooter is perfect for people who have a relatively short work commute that ’s just a bit too far to walk every day .
Leave that car in the garage and travel on a scooter .
Plus , you can scoot around town and quickly run errands on this thing .
Of course , a bicycle is even less expensive , but scooters are much faster and wo n’t leave you sweaty when you arrive .
12 . Solar Outdoor Lighting
Sample Model : Silicon Solar Innovision LED
Price : $ 12.95
Time Until Break Even : 180 evenings
This is a great choice if you want to light your yard and patio in the evening but do n’t want to spend on electricity all the time .

Their design incorporates solar panels , a nice geek factor , and they can provide wonderful low light in the evening , perfect for a nice ambience .
13 . Dance Dance Revolution
Sample Model : DDR Extreme 2 ( plus peripherals )
Price : $ 200
Time Until Break Even : 8 months ( $ 25 / month gym fees )
If you use the gym for a cardio workout , cancel your gym membership and get a home video game system , DDR , and a good quality dance pad .
The game itself provides all the motivation you need , plus you have to be in pretty good shape in order to play the game for extended periods .
I lost about 20 pounds playing DDR instead of going to the gym once upon a time .
14 . Self - Cleaning Electric Shaver
Sample Model : Braun 8995 360 Complete
Price : $ 169.13
Time Until Break Even : 8 months of daily shaving
A top-quality self - cleaning rechargeable electric shaver saves significant money for each shaving over disposable razors and shaving cream .
Although there are still upkeep costs ( recharging , a rare replacement of the blades , and facial wash ) , the costs are much less than what you ’ll incur with shaving cream and blades .
Plus , you get the unbridled joy of owning a new gadget .
15 . Espresso / Cappuccino Machine
Sample Model : Gaggia Carezza
Price : $ 200
Time Until Break Even : 80 visits to a coffee shop
Do you stop by Starbucks each day to pick up a fresh cup on your way to work ?
If you invest in a decent cappuccino / espresso maker , those visits can go right out the door ; you can make it at home and it tastes at least as good as the stuff at the shops , especially chain ones like Starbucks where they have the “ process ” down to an art form .
Plus , once you get used to using it , you can experiment a lot with different beans and grindings and make some truly sublime homemade coffees .
16 . Programmable Thermostat
Sample Model : Honeywell 5/2 Programmable Thermostat
Price : $ 39.99
Time Until Break Even : 6 months
If you have central air conditioning , you need programmable thermostats .
They provide very precise temperature control and can be programmed to automatically lower your air conditioning and / or heat use while you ’re not home .
Just program it and forget about it ; it will automatically adjust things for you so that you are n’t wasting electricity and money .
17 . Coin Sorter
Sample Model : FastSort Electric Coin Sorter
Price : $ 95.99

Most banks will no longer count change for you , but they will accept pre-rolled coins as deposits .
CoinStar , on the other hand , will cash out change for you , but they have a 10 % surcharge .
Why not just sort and roll them yourself ?
Keep this device on the dresser , dump in your pocket change each night , change the rolls in and out ( the device comes with a bunch of coin rolls ) , and when you go to the bank , take in a bunch of coin rolls and deposit them .
Over time , the device pays for itself over the amount you would lose using CoinStar .
18 . Efficient Space Heater
Sample Model : Honeywell HZ - 315
Price : $ 19.95
Time Until Break Even :
One cold winter
Small , efficient space heaters can save a lot of money because they allow you to not have to spend lots of extra energy keeping some rooms heated ( such as the bathroom ) .
Instead , just put in a space heater and turn it on when you take a shower .
It ’s substantially cheaper than keeping that spare room heated .
Plus , you can use them when working in the basement or other rooms that you do n’t bother to heat , or in the bedroom at night if you lower the house heat during the nighttime hours .
19 . Solar Christmas Lights
Sample Model : Silicon Solar LED Christmas Lights
Price : $ 59.95
Time Until Break Even : 2 Christmas seasons
Instead of buying strands of electric lights for outdoor Christmas decoration , get a set of solar LED Christmas lights .
They eat no electricity as they charge up during the day , come on automatically in the evening , and stay on most of the night .
You can just set them up and let them be with no maintenance cost or effort at all .
The start - up cost is a bit high , but the cool factor of LED solar Christmas lights , plus the energy savings , quickly makes up for it .
20 . Remote Control Power Strips
Sample Model : Lacrosse RS - 204
Price : $ 29.95
Time Until Break Even : 2 years ( depending on use )
Quite often , we find ourselves plugging lots of lights and decorations in during the Christmas holidays , and it becomes a hassle to power them all off and on , so we often leave things on more often than we ’d like , sometimes even overnight .
To solve this problem , install a remote control power strip .
This device can be turned on and off by remote control , meaning that you can have all of the cords out of the way and flip the Christmas tree lights on and off with just a button click .
21 . High Efficiency Washing Machine
Sample Model : Whirlpool Duet Front - Loading High - Efficiency Washer GHW9150P
Price : $ 859
Time Until Break Even : 3 years
If you buy a large - load high efficiency front loading washing machine , you ’ll do many fewer laundry loads per month and each load will take less water than before .
A machine like this can easily save $ 10 over a regular machine in water usage in a family home per month ; even better , a large load machine will save a lot of time .
Given the cost of a normal low - end washer , it should only take three years or so for this machine to pay for itself .
22 . A Laptop
Sample Model : Dell Inspiron E1505
Price : $ 819
Time Until Break Even : 1 year
Now that laptops have reached a usability and reliability standard that approximates desktops , it becomes a serious choice whether or not to replace a desktop with a laptop .
If you make the leap , you ’ll find that the energy savings are tremendous .
I often run it from battery at home and charge it using available outlets in other places , such as the local bookstore , meaning I have very little home energy use from the laptop .
It wo n’t take long for this savings to make up for the differences in cost , plus you ’ll have all of the laptop portability advantages .
23 . TiVo
Sample Model : TiVo Series 2 80 Hour Dual Tuner
Price : $ 49.99 + $ 9.95 a month
Time Until Break Even : 6 months
If you have cable and a TiVo , your needs for DVD purchases and rentals will almost disappear simply because of the plethora of programming you ’ll be able to watch commercial - free .
This will begin to save you money before long , plus it will give you a much greater control over what you watch on television – I skip a lot of programs simply because of the commercials and the inability to pause them to chase my child .
24 . A Hybrid Car
Sample Model : Toyota Prius
Price : $ 22,175
Time Until Break Even : 5 years
If you compare a hybrid side - by - side with a non - hybrid , the hybrid costs more up front .
The savings , though , kicks in over the life of the car with much lower fuel costs .
Plus , it has a great “ geek factor ” and it ’s a solid environmental decision .
25 . A Residential Windmill
Sample Model : Skystream 3.7
Price : $ 8,500 ( including installation )
Time Until Break Even : 8 years
If you want to be “ king geek ” in your area , few things will top this .
$ 8,500 will get you a windmill on top of your house , which can , by itself , take care of almost all of your home electrical needs .
It looks like a high - tech antenna up there , quietly whirring away , using the wind to provide your juice .
For an average household , the device will pay for itself in eight years ; after that , it ’s all gravy .
Plus , you ’re helping the environment by almost eliminating your load on the power grid .
Sometimes , you can buy gadgets to save money .
Recently , I read about Roswell , New Mexico ’s intention to build the Alien Apex Resort , a UFO - themed amusement park , complete with an indoor roller coaster that ’ll take passengers on a simulated alien abduction .
With a price tag hovering around $ 800 million and a target completion date of 2010 , there are lots of factors that could slow down the construction of this weird amusement park .
Until Alien
Apex opens for abductions , er , business , we thought we ’d point out some other unusual amusement parks already ready to show you a good time .
The Nintendo Amusement Park
The The Nintendo Amusement Park is a real - life obstacle course that players navigate using a power - assist harness .
The park features nothing digital , nothing projected , and nothing virtual : both the power harness and the moving parts of the obstacle course are entirely mechanical , giving a player the feeling of being inside a classic video game .
Though it ’s still largely a prototype , if you ’re interested in trying it out , they ’re looking for volunteers in the NYC area to dress as Mario and jump around !
Check out this video ; it looks like fun !
BonBon-Land
Denmark ’s fourth largest amusement park is BonBon - Land , an amusement park that ’s based on a Danish confectionary that makes candy featuring unusual objects and animals .
In addition to some pretty racy attractions and numerous vomiting rodents , visitors to BonBon - Land can enjoy elegantly - named rides , such as The Horse Dropping ; The Crazy Turtle ( who looks like he ’s just about to puke ! ) ; and — my favorite — Hundeprutterutchebane .
Also know as “ Dog Fart Switchback , ” Hundeprutterutchebane takes riders on a fun - filled journey around a hound ’s piles of poop and allows them to listen to the sounds of his farts .
Ah , this ride gives new meaning to the phrase “ the wind in my face . ”
Dickens World
Moving from farting dogs to sweaty wenches , England ’s Dickens World is a brand - new amusement park designed around everyone ’s favorite topic : plague - ridden , sewage - filled 19th century London .
Designed to spotlight the life and times of Charles Dickens , Dickens World features one of Europe ’s largest dark boat rides ; the Haunted House of Ebenezer Scrooge ; and a Victorian School Room — which gives parents the chance to show their kids how lucky they really are .
Not really .
In reality , I imagine it ’s something of a mash - up between a “ real ” amusement park ; a “ living history museum ” ; Vegas ; and the most boring component in the canon of English Literature .
Oliver Twist ?
Puh -lease !
Before you accuse the British of making something fun into something very , very dry , check out Brendan O’Neill ’s experience inside Dickens World .
Either he ’s being nice , or it ’s actually fun … in a giant - turkey - leg - chimney - sweep - polio - filled sorta way .
( Darn , I got scooped by Xach . )
As of 1.0.0.18 SBCL has a proper xref implementation , used for answering questions like " where is this function getting called from " .
I hope it will be more usable than the ( very clever ) heap - groveling hack that M-x slime - list - callers uses .
The intended benefits of the xref over that approach are :
More information : also supports who - macroexpands , who - binds , etc in addition to who -calls .
More usable : Slime will take you directly to the correct form , not just the right toplevel form .
More accurate :
The heap - groveling would for example completely miss inlined functions ( but see below for some examples of less accuracy ) .
More reliable :
The heap - groveling would also lead to assertions being triggered in the SBCL internals that it was abusing .
Faster : lookups should be an order of magnitude faster .
There are some cases where xref information is n't currently stored .
As a rule of thumb , if there 's a defun or defmethod involved on some level , xreffing will work .
Otherwise it probably wo n't .
The latter case covers code like :
A macro expanded at the toplevel ( defmacro def- foo ( ) ) ( def - foo )
Code inside a lambda that 's not inside a named function ( slime - list - callers will show this call to BAR , slime - who - calls wo n't ) ( defvar * a* ( lambda ( ) ( bar ) )
Code in a defclass initform ( likewise ) ( defclass ( ) ( ( a :initform ( bar ) ) ) )
Code inside a macrolet definition body ( defun foo ( ) ( macrolet ( ( bar ( ) ( baz ) ) ) ( bar ) ) )
I have some ideas on how to get xref information recorded also for these , and other similar cases , but have n't yet worked out the details .
If you run into any situations ( other than the ones listed above ) where the xref is n't working as you expect it to , I 'd love to hear from you .
To use new xref , you 'll also need to upgrade to CVS Slime , and the use the normal Slime cross- referencing commands .
Thanks to ITA Software for funding the work on the xref ( and on some other SBCL improvements , which I never got around to blogging about ) .
This is the cronicle of the adventures on the yacht Maiken .
I hope you all have a good time reading it , and maybe it will bring some new thoughts into your head .
Only in Santa Cruz would a graduate student be encouraged to make a chemical that is found in a rare mushroom .
Despite the hippie heritage of the university , it is not magic mushrooms that have attracted the attention of a young chemist and her mentor .
Laura Schuresko , a graduate student at the University of California at Santa Cruz , has been trying to make the elusive mushroom chemical phalloidin , an extremely useful tool for studying the inner workings of cells .
She and her mentor , Professor R. Scott Lokey described their successful quest to prepare a fluorescent variation of the mushroom chemical in a recent issue of Angewandte Chemie International Edition , a leading chemistry journal .
Biology researchers would love to have a steady supply of phalloidin .
By adding a fluorescent label to the molecule , they can use it as a stain to observe the protein as it assembles into microfilaments inside of cells .
The problem is , it is produced by the rare mushroom Amanita phalloides , which is very finicky about where it will grow – it essentially can't be grown domestically and harvested .
This highlights the importance of natural product chemists , scientists that resign themselves to the task of finding a way to synthetically make a natural chemical that is often in short supply .
Academic researchers are often drawn to the task of making rare natural chemicals because it is challenging and extremely important for the pharmaceutical industry .
Molecules like phalloidin have features that are very hard to make .
In this case , the tricky building block of the molecule was a thioether bridge , a sulfur atom that links two carbon atoms together .
Other teams of researchers have made phalloidin
before , but because of difficulties like making that sulfur bridge , they could only produce extremely small amounts of the important chemical in a very wasteful process .
By comparison , Schuresko and Lokey can make it boatloads .

Erlang for C , C++ and Java Programmers
Home
This brief tutorial aims to cover the main concepts and syntax of Erlang in a way which programmers of C type languages can relate to .
It is not a complete description of the language by any means but it does try to give a feel for the main conceptual differences in Erlang .
All comments are welcome – with feedback from readers this might even end up being useful !
1. Erlang is a small and easy to learn language
Erlang was designed from the beginning to be small and easy to learn – Ericsson had to train many C/C++ programmers in Erlang so it was part of the core brief to make it as easy as possible .
There are only a small number of concepts to master and most will already be familiar to C programmers .
2. Fundamental differences in approach
The biggest difference between programming in C and Erlang is in how programs are structured and in the fact that data is immutable – that is once created , you can't change it .
You can only copy it and make required changes as you copy .
( If you do n't need the original any more , it is up to the garbage collector to discover this and reclaim memory . )
This makes the typical way of programming in C — using arrays , whose entries you keep changing , or records , with pointers to things that you keep changing — either wrong or potentially very inefficient .
So what does a program like Wings3D do , for structures ( such as the winged - edge data structure ) that have constantly changing subpieces ?
It would be too slow to copy the entire structure every time , say , you moved a vertex .
The answer : extensive use of gb_trees and gb_sets .
These are binary trees for holding dictionaries and sets , with the very useful property that when you copy them ( in order to modify , add , or delete entries ) , you only change about log( number of elements ) pieces of data ; the rest of the trees are unchanged and can share the old data without copying .
So , for instance , where a C programmer might have a pointer to an edge struct inside a face struct , wings puts an integer index for the edge there , and has a separate gb_trees dictionary to map edge# -> edge record .
While this is no doubt still slower than the equivalent functionality in C or C++ , there are benefits , the main ones being that you avoid a whole class of bugs , and that " Undo " becomes very easy to implement .
3. Data Types
Erlang has obvious basic data types such as floats , integers etc .
There is no need to explicitly type data as Erlang variables carry the type of data round with them .
4. Compound data types
Erlang has a small selection of compound data types some of which will be familiar and some not .
Mostly where a C program would use a large or variable sized array ( or a linked list ) , an Erlang program uses a linked list .
Many ( most ? )
Erlang functions and programs simply iterate over data held in linked lists ( or other more complex data structures like gb_trees ) .
Fortunately Erlang has special syntax for lists and provides nice ways to move around them .
A linked list might be :
[ 1 , 1.5 , " Wings3D " ]
An empty list looks like :
[ ]
There is another basic way to group data together and that is the tuple .
This is a fixed size compound data type typically used to group small amounts of data together .
For example the obvious representation of a 3D vector in Erlang is :
{ 1.0 , 2.0 , 1.5}
The final way of grouping data together is the record .
This is similar to a struct in C .
They must be declared before use in a compiler directive ( starts with - ) :
- record ( vec , {x , y , z} ) .
Creating a record at runtime is done like :
#vec{x = 1.0 , y = 2.0 , z = 1.5}
5. Atoms .
Atoms are a feature not found in many languages but they are very useful in Erlang .
An atom may be though of as a fixed label .
They normally start with a lower case letter so :
ok error vec
are all atoms .
They are used in places where in C one might define a constant :
# define OK 1 # define ERROR 2 switch result { case OK : var = 1.0 ; break ; case ERROR : var = 0.0 ; }
6. Variables and Matching .
Variable assignment looks pretty much the same as in other languages but there is one very useful conceptual difference .
Variable names must start with a capital letter ( this is not it – patience ! ) so the following snippet works fine :
... A=1 , B=2 , C=A + B , io : format ( " ~p " , [ C ] ) .
% The equivalent of printf ( " % d " , C )
The useful difference is that variables are only assigned to once within any function , and the = operator does n't in fact mean assign , it means " match with " .
This idea of " matching " is one of the very few important new concepts to get the hang of as it crops up everywhere and gives Erlang much of its elegance .
If a variable is fresh ( or unbound ) then matching it with some data has the effect of irreversably binding the variable to that value .
After that attempts to change it will result in a runtime exception ( useful for asserts amongst other things ) .
Matching is very powerful and also covers compound data types , so you can do :
{X , Y , Z} = { 1.0 , 2.0 , 1.5} .
Here we match the tuple { X , Y , Z} against our vector , and assuming X , Y , and Z were fresh variables beforehand , after this statement they will each be bound to the value in the matching position .
In other words we have extracted the 3 values from our Vector .
An equivalent example with records would be
#vec{x=X , y=Y , z=Z} = #vec{x=1.0 , y=2.0 , z=1.5}
7. Case and If
Now we have grasped the concept of matching we can see how exactly the same rules apply in two further Erlang constructs .
Case stements are similar in form to C switch statements but are much more generic .
For example study the following code snippet :
... X=1.0 , Y=2.0 , Z=1.5 , ... case {X , Y , Z} of {0 , 0 , 0} -> empty_vector ; % empty_vector is an atom { A , A , A} -> all_the_same ; % so is all_the_same { X1 , Y1 , Z1} -> { X1 + 1 , Y1 + 1 , Z1 +1} end
The case statement tries to match { X , Y , Z} ( which in this case is the same as saying { 1.0,2.0,1.5} as all the values are bound ) against each case clause in turn .
The first one which matches both form and content is selected , and the whole case statement evaluates to what comes after the ->
( We 'll do a bit more on this later ) .
So , first of all it tries to match { 1.0 , 2.0 , 1.5} against the zero vector and fails .
Then it tries to match it against { A , A , A} .
This one looks a little odd – A is not yet bound so we might expect that A will match each of the values 1.0 , 2.0 , and 1.5 .
But this would break the rule that a variable can only hold one value .
What happens is the variables are matched left to right –
The first A is matched with 1.0 and thus bound to this value , then the second A ( now bound to 1.0 ) is matched against 2.0 , which fails and therefore this whole case clause fails .
Finally we try to match against the fresh variables X1 , Y1 , and Z1 – this succeeds and the result of the case is a new vector { 2.0 , 3.0 , 2.5} .
If statements work very much the same but they are more limited .
XXXXX
8. Functions
You might think it odd to leave functions until now but they take advantage of the matching concept in a very powerful way .
Here we also see another radical departure from C like langauges : a function in Erlang may have multiple definitions , and the one to be executed is selected by exactly the same matching rules as we saw in the case statement .
The first level of matching is based on the number of parameters , so the following are two different Erlang functions with the same name .
test ( A ) ->
1 .
test ( A , B ) ->
2 .
the -> construct should be read as " evaluates to " .
The final value in the function is the equivalent of the return value in C so the first one might look like :
test ( int a ) { return 1 } ;
The second level of matching is between multiple function definitions with the same number of parameters .
We can re-write an exact equivalent of our case statement using a single function with multiple definitions :
test ( {0 , 0 , 0} ) -> empty_vector ; % empty_vector is an atom test ( {A , A , A} ) -> all_the_same ; test ( {X1 , Y1 , Z1} ) -> { X1 + 1 , Y1 + 1 , Z1 +1} .
This would be the idiomatic way to write this in Erlang , and in fact ( in R8B ) is evaluated more quickly than the case statement .
In this type of function all the definitions must appear straight after one another in the source code file and be separated by semicolons .
The final one is terminated by a full stop .
We also see here how to return multiple values from a function .
There is no need to pass in pointers to a set of output variables to an Erlang function if you want to return multiple values – you just return a tuple .
( In fact you can't affect the value of any variable passed into the function – Erlang functions are " side effect free " apart from one case we will touch on briefly when we talk about threads and message passing ) .
9. Iteration and Recursion
Now we get to the meat and gravy ( or dhal and rice ) of the Erlang programming model .
There is one new feature of lists we need to understand first though .
That is the | operator .
In a matching context this means " split a list up into two parts : the first element , and the rest of the list " , otherwise it means " insert item at start of list " .
It is this which allows us to extract values from lists and make new lists .
So for example after a match :
[ Head |Tail ] = [ 1,2,3 ] .
Head would be 1 and Tail would be [ 2,3 ]
Then if we did :
L = [ Head|Tail ] .
L would be [ 1,2,3 ]
Ok , so much for that diversion .
Let us say now that we have a list of vectors and we wish to add 1 to all the values .
In Erlang we could use a recursive function like the following :
add ( [ ] ) -> [ ] ; add ([ {X , Y , Z}|T ] ) -> [ { X+1 , Y+1 , Z+1}|add ( T ) ] .
This is the last complicated thing we really need to understand to write complex Erlang expressions , so lets look in detail at our add function by working through an example .
We will call our function with :
add ( [ {1,2,3} , { 10,11,12} , { 20,21,22} ] )
The first time through add ( [ ] ) does n't match so it uses the second definition .
This matches and as we enter the function X is 1 , Y is 2 , Z is 3 , and T is the list [ {10,11,12} , { 20,21,22} ]
This evaluates to the construction of a list with { 2,3,4} at the head and the result of add ( T ) appended afterwards – it is starting to look like the result we want – a list starting with { 2,3,4} , followed by the result of add ( [ { 10,11,12} , { 20,21,22} ] ) .
This is classic recursion – next time though we get { 11,12,13} followed by the result of add ( [ { 20,21,22} ] , next time { 21,22,23} followed by add ( [ ] ) .
Short aside : if you take all the entries out of a list you get left with the empty list , similarly if you make a list by appending the empty list to a list you just get the list .
So when we call add ( [ ] ) the first defintiion is evaluated which results in [ ] and breaks the recursion .
Our result is
[ {2,3,4} | { 11,12,13} | { 20,21,22} | [ ] ]
which by the above rules is simply [ {2,3,4} , { 11,12,13} , { 20,21,22} ]
It is worth experimenting with the | operator at the Erlang shell to get a handle on what it does .
There are a number of other iteration patterns or ways to write the same function .
One very common version of this ( which has the advantage that it executes in constant memory space ) uses an accumulator parameter to build the result :
add ( A ) -> add ( A , [ ] ) . add( [ ] , Acc ) -> lists:reverse( Acc ) ; add ( [ {X , Y , Z} | T ] , Acc ) -> add ( T , [ {X+1 , Y+1 , Z+1} | Acc ] ) .
This pattern creates the list backwards so at the end we need to reverse the list .
10 . Odds and Sods
It is possible to augment matching with guards .
These may be used in function headers , case and if statements and are placed before the -> .
Guard expressions must return either the atom true or false and must not have side effects .
for example
type(A ) when is_integer ( A ) -> its_an_int ; type ( A ) when is_float ( A ) -> its_a_float ; type ( A ) when it_tuple ( A ) -> its_a_tuple ; ...
There is a full list of valid guard expressions in the Erlang documentation
There is also a set of comparison operators including == which also return the one of the atoms true or false .
11 . Global Data .
You may have been wondering how a program maintains state and how it is possible to have global data in an Erlang program when Erlang functions cannot change any data outside their own execution context .
The short answer is that Erlang programs cannot have global variables in the same way a C program can .
They can however maintain state , and the structure in which state is maintained is .. wait for it .. a thread !
An Erlang thread is modelled as a recursive function which just keeps on recursing .
The clever part is that it can be made event driven so it does not use CPU capacity while it is waiting .
The state is held as the parameter (s ) of the function .
A thread might look like :
thread ( State ) -> receive {keypress , Key} -> New_state = handle_keypress ( Key , State ) , thread ( New_state ) ; quit -> quitted end .
While keypresses are being received by the thread it carries on handling the keypresses and going back to wait at the receive statement for the next event .
In this way the state of an erlang system is distributed around all the threads which make up the system .
Threads communicate by sending messages which will be matched by the receive statement of the receiving thread .
All threads have a Process ID or they can be registered with a name ( which must be an atom ) .
The message sending statement looks like :
Pid !
{ keypress , enter}
So for example the Erlang system might have some process receiving raw binary data from the operating system upon each keypress .
This process would decode the raw data and send the application thread the nice message {keypress , enter} .
This is exactly the sort of thing the esdl application does for Wings3D .
12 . Modules
Each Source code file makes up one module .
It must be named module_name.erl and have a - module ( module_name ) .
definition in the file .
Module names have the same syntax as atoms .
To call a function in another module the format is :
module_name:function ( Par1 , Par2 ) .
There are a huge range of modules which come with the Erlang system but one is special .
The module erlang has a bunch of functions which are globally scoped and may be called from any module using the local form .
These include the guard expressions so is_integer / 1 is the same as erlang : is_integer /
1
Some useful modules are maths and gb_trees .
13 . Funs
Erlang has a feature where a generic function can be defined and assigned to a variable .
It may be called any time later and when it is it ' remembers ' the state of the variables at the time it was defined .
For example to define a function to add 1 to a number we could do :
Add = fun( Num ) ->
Num + 1 end . %
Why not try it in the erlang shell
Then to use the function it is just :
Add ( 10 ) .
An example of where we could see that a fun remembers variables would be this function which makes a fun to add any number to the parameter .
e.g
make_add_fun( N ) -> fun( Num ) ->
Num +
N end .
% The value of N from outside the fun is captured by the fun .
This is another way to maintain state , and is used in Wings3D in a quite advanced way to keep track of which mode the gui is in .
Wings3D hold a list of funs which it uses as a stack .
When you right click on a menu the menu fun is added to the head of the list which is called to do it 's stuff and afterwards removed from the top of the list revealing the previous state .
This is tricky stuff ..
Funs are also useful in iterating over lists and other data types .
We can re-write our vector adding function using a standard function from the lists module which does the iteration for us .
So :
add( List_of_vectors ) ->
Add = fun( {X , Y , Z} ) -> { X+1 , Y+1 , Z+1} end , lists : map( Add , List_of_vectors ) .
14 . List Comprehensions
List comprehensions are perhaps one of the most incomprehensible newer features of Erlang !
I never use them but it is important to have a basic understanding to read other peoples code .
The description in the Erlang docs is pretty good :
Erlang / OTP Documentation ( click on Erlang Reference Manual , find List Comprehensions in Section 6.22 )
15 . Summary
There are a small number of powerful concepts which once understood run all through Erlang programming .
Pattern Matching
Function Recursion
Multiple return values
Threads to hold state and receive events ( messages )
Funs
Immutable data ( single assignment variables )
Programs such as Wings3d use these concepts in some very advanced ways but even so they are still just these few concepts .

1 . This project is both very large and fairly old in Internet terms .
At the time it was begun ( 1996 ) , it was not clear that web sites [ and the documents made available there ] would often turn out to be transient .
As a result there is a process called " link rot " - which means that a " broken link " is a result of someone having taken down a web page .
In some cases some websites have simply reorganized sub - directories without creating forwarding links .
Since 2000 , very few links to external sites have been made .

Introduction
The Internet Modern History Sourcebook is one of series of history primary sourcebooks .
It is intended to serve the needs of teachers and students in college survey courses in modern European history and American history , as well as in modern Western Civilization and World Cultures .
Although this part of the Internet History Sourcebooks Project began as a way to access texts that were already available on the Internet , it now contains hundreds of texts made available locally .
The great diversity of available sources for use in modern history classes requires that selections be made with great care - since virtually unlimited material is available .
The goals here are :
To present a diversity of source material in modern European , American , and Latin American history , as well as a significant amount of materal pertinent to world cultures and global studies .
A number of other online source collections emphasize legal and political documents .
Here efforts have been made to include contemporary narrative accounts , personal memoirs , songs , newspaper reports , as well as cultural , philosophical , religious and scientific documents .
Although the history of social and cultural elite groups remains important to historians , the lives of non-elite women , people of color , lesbians and gays are also well represented here .
To present the material as cleanly as possible , without complicated hierarchies and subdirectories , and without excessive HTML markup .
What you get here is direct access to significant documents , not the efforts of some whizkid " website designer " .
In other words , we are interested here in the music , not the Hi-fi !.
Within the major sections , to indicate a few high quality web sites for further source material and research .
Sources of Material Here
The texts on these pages come from many sources :
Files posted to various places on the net .
In some cases , the source URL no longer exists .
Shorter texts created for class purposes by extracting from much larger texts .
In some cases , the extracts have been suggested by a variety of commercial sourcebooks .
Texts scanned in from printed material .
In some cases the printed book may be recent , but the material scanned is out of copyright .
Texts sent to me for inclusion .
Links to other online texts .
In almost all these cases I have made local copies , so please inform me if links no longer work .
Efforts have been made to confirm to US Copyright Law .
Any infringement is unintentional , and any file which infringes copyright , and about which the copyright claimant informs me , will be removed pending resolution .

" If you have a bumper sticker that does not pertain to a political candidate , what does it say ? "
From the Starting January 22 , 2007 , New Jersey 's courts will begin to ask a new voir dire question to potential jurors : From the New Jersey Lawyer ( article not yet available online ) :
The theory [ behind asking potential jurors about their bumper stickers ] is that there 's a difference between " Question Authority " and " Have You Hugged a Cop Today ? "
Of course , a criminal defendant wo n't want a " Hug a Cop " juror deciding his of her fate and the prosecution sure as hell does n't want a " Question Authority " juror just itching to screw it to " the man . "
But what about people who have something like " If You Can Read This , Then You 're To Fucking Close " or " My Kid Beat Up Your Honor Student " ?
Do you want them on your jury ?
In any event , if you want to get dismissed from jury duty in New Jersey , just slap a " Fry Them All " sticker on your car .

Google Maps Street View and Mapplets
The previous rumors are coming true : announced at today ’s Where 2.0 conference , Google has added a feature called “ Street View ” in certain locations on Google Maps .
Also , Google is adding developer - created gadgets callled “ Mapplets ” to Google Maps starting today .
Street View
“ Street View ” displays an interactive panorama photo for certain locations on Google Maps .
Note to get this to work outside the US , you need to add “ &gl=us ” at the end of the search URL .
Below are screenshots for a search for 94111 ( that ’s San Francisco ) .
Camera icons and blue lines indicate the availability of Street View data .
This new view is available for some regions ( Silicon Valley , Las Vegas , Miami , Denver and New York , according to Colin Colehour from the US , who says the Street View button disappears when you move the map away from North America ) , and is an alternative to the existing Traffic , Map , Satellite and Hybrid views .
Clicking it you will see a photograph of the location as if you were standing on the streeet looking around .
The O’Reilly Radar blog , who says the data for these pictures is coming from Immersive Media ( except for San Francisco , which also has a better zoom level , as it turns out ) , comments , “ This is not just a static , A9 - style image .
It will also let you move along the street in a smooth manner and even more amazing it will let you change your angle and continue moving that way . ”
Here ’s a video grab showing Street View in action – this looks & feels amazing , albeit there ’s potential privacy issues due to the level of detail ( you can make out individual faces , license plates and so on ) :
The Google help blurb on the Street View feature , displayed at Search Engine Land , explains how the navigation works :
“ Blue outlines show roads where street view is available . ”
“ [ A person icon on a green arrow ] shows where you are on the map .
The green arrow points in the direction you ’re looking .
You can drag the icon to navigate to a different location .
You can also just click on a blue outlined road to go there . ”
“ Drag the street view to look around 360° .
Use the arrow buttons to navigate down the street .
You can also use the arrow keys on the keyboad . ”
Google in a press release adds that Street View data “ will soon expand to other metropolitan areas . ”
The world is shrinking .
Mapplets
Also today at the Where 2.0 conference , Google announced Mapplets ( as in “ map applets ” ) .
A Mapplet is a special flavor of a Google Gadget , the XML / JavaScript - based widgets you can add to iGoogle – only that this time , you ’ll be adding it to Google Maps .
From a press release by Google :
Mapplets enables third party developers to create mini applications that can be displayed on Google Maps , much like Google Gadgets are displayed on iGoogle .
These Mapplets contain a variety of information , from housing listings to crime data , and tools like distance measurement .
Users can select from a wide range of Google and third party Mapplets to display on the Map , essentially creating their own “ mashup of mashups ” directly on the Google Maps site , while still enjoying the built - in functionality of Google Maps , such as local search and driving directions .
A number of our partners , including WeatherBug , Booking.com and Platial have already created Mapplets .
You can take a first look at this feature at a special preview page .
Mapplets can be found in the Mapplets directory , and a developer documentation is available as well , clarifying that “ Mapplets are mini- webpages that are served inside an IFrame within the Google Maps site .
You can put anything inside this mini-webpage that you can put into a normal webpage , including HTML , Javascript , and Flash .
Google provides a Javascript API that gives the Mapplet access to services such as manipulating the map , fetching remote content , and storing user preferences . ”
Google goes on to say that when a Mapplet is enabled by the user , Google will grab a copy of the source from your server to then serve it from gmodules.com ( the domain currently caching iGoogle Gadgets as well ) .

A Peaceful Marriage is Not Always 50/50
January 12th , 2007
When I got married , I had a lot of grand ideas in my head of what married life should be like .
I thought that our marriage would be 100 % fair , completely diplomatic , and that all household duties would be split 50/50 .
I thought my husband would be constantly self motivated , perpetually thoughtful , and always on my same wavelength .
There would be beauty and harmony in my home .
Never in a million years would I become that shrewish fishwife shrieking from the doorway because my husband had spent the night carousing with the boys in avoidance of his husbandly duties .
A mere month after we said ‘ I do , ’ reality set in .
That perfect democracy fell apart the second I remembered that my husband is a pretty stubborn guy .
If he does n’t want to do something , he ’s not going to do it and fuck you for making him repeat himself .
I would demand that he help me with the housework ; he ’d sit on the couch like a spoiled child and ignore me .
I would refuse to go shopping or make dinner in protest ; he ’d shrug his shoulders and order a pizza .
If I asked him to drop something off at the post office for me , he would forget .
But instead of just breaking down and doing it myself , I ’d remind him .
And remind him .
And remind him again .
There was a phrase for what I ’d become : A fishwife .
Of course , I blamed him .
I was n’t asking for so much .
I just wanted to take turns cleaning the toilet .
Was n’t marriage supposed to be a partnership ?
Why would n’t he help me ?
Why did n’t he care about the things I cared about ?
Why would n’t he just bend to my will ?
Oftentimes , I would dramatically press the back of my hand against my forehead and tearfully exclaim , “ You ’re making me into such a nag ! ”
I was such a fucking martyr .
The fights and the bitching and the nagging and the hurt feelings went on for quite some time .
Then one day , I was taking care of a certain little girl .
I took her to the park where another group of little girls were playing dolls .
Now said little girl did not have a doll to join in , but she just assumed that one of the other girls would share a doll with her .
She was in for a big surprise when all the other little girls refused .
The little girl begged .
The little girl pleaded .
The little girl stomped her feet and with a shrill voice demanded that they be nice her .
She lectured them about politeness and sharing and outright tried to bully her way into that playgroup .
Still , the little girls clutched their dolls to their breasts and refused her access to them .
Finally , with tears of frustration in her eyes , she ran over to me and said , “ Make those girls share with me ! ”
“ No , ” I said , “ It does n’t look like they want to play with you .
And to be honest , I ’m not sure if I would want to play with you , either , with the way you ’re acting . ”
“ But , they are the ones being mean ! ” she raged , “ It ’s nice to share and they ’re not being nice to me . ”
I stooped down to her level and calmly told her , “ Darling , you can not control how other people act .
You can only control how you react to them . ”
She was quiet for a minute and then she whirled around and screamed at the girls , “ FINE !
I WON ’T PLAY WITH YOU THEN !
I ’M GOING TO GO SWING INSTEAD ! ”
Then she stomped off towards the swings .
I leaned back on my heels for a minute and contemplated the entire scenario .
Finally , realization hit me like a cold splash of water .
I thought to myself : Man , I am such a hypocrite !
After that , a single policy was adopted in my house .
Namely :
If it bothers you , do something about it .
Of course this means I usually do the majority of the housework considering that a filthy house does n’t seem to faze my husband in the least .
I also do the majority of the shopping because he ’d brush his teeth with water every day for the rest of his life before he ’d remember to pick up a tube of Crest .
His pet peeve , on the other hand , is the laundry .
Left to my own devices , every article of clothing I own would have to be dirty before I ’d do the wash .
My husband likes it done every day , so he gets stuck with that little chore .
Our marriage is not a 50/50 split like I first envisioned it .
But there is definitely less bitching , nagging , and fighting .
No one is a victim and no one is a martyr .
Somewhere along the line , it occurred to us that life was too short to argue about who cleaned the toilet more .
This is not to say that we never suffer small relapses .
Just the other night , I was reading in bed when my husband said to me , “ I can not believe that you threw your pants on the floor two feet away from the laundry basket . ”
I replied , “ I can not believe you just stuck a piece of bubblegum to our headboard . ”
He looked at me and I looked at him .
After a brief moment of silence , he picked up my pants .
Before I went to sleep that night , I removed his gum from our headboard .
Ah , peace .
Peaceful Marriage is Not Always 50/50 :)

PALO ALTO , Calif .
Now that scientists have spotted the pain and pleasure centers in the brain , they ’ve moved on to more expensive real estate : the brain ’s shopping center .
They have been asking the big questions :
What is the difference between a tightwad ’s brain and a spendthrift ’s brain ?
What neurological circuits stop you from buying a George Foreman grill but not a Discovery Channel color - changing mood clock ?
Why is there a $ 2,178.23 balance on my January Visa bill ?
This last question is n’t yet fully answered , even after I stared at said Visa bill while lying inside a functional M.R.I. machine at Stanford University .
But scientists are closer to solving the mystery .
By scanning shoppers ’ brains , they think they ’ve identified a little voice telling you not to spend your money .
Or , in my case , a voice saying , “ At this price , you ca n’t afford not to buy the mood clock ! ”
For convenience ’ sake , economists have traditionally assumed that buyers make rational choices : I think , therefore I shop .
You pass up the George Foreman grill because you sagely calculate that the money would be better spent on , say , your child ’s college fund .
Or at least the mood clock .
You choose to forgo one good in exchange for something better .
Even the most rational economists , though , realize that the shopper ’s mind is more complicated .
The brain ’s “ impartial spectator , ” as Adam Smith warned , has to duel with “ the passions . ”
Last year , after surveying shoppers ’ passions , behavioral economists at Carnegie Mellon University developed what they call the Tightwad - Spendthrift scale .
George Bush 's public approval ratings hit a new low yesterday as Democratic opposition to his planned US troop increase for Iraq rapidly gained momentum .
Even before Mr Bush formally announces a fresh Iraq strategy tonight , Democrats in the new Congress discussed a range of options that include withholding funding for what they call an escalation of the war .
A poll in USA Today showed that approval for Mr Bush 's handling of the war has dropped to 26 % , a record low .
About 61 % opposed Mr Bush 's proposed 20,000 increase in the number of troops .
As part of a push to sell the new plan , Mr Bush met Democratic congressmen at the White House yesterday .
But the mood within the Democratic party , which only a few months ago was tentative in expressing opposition to the war , was hardening against the plan .
The White House sought to portray any block on funding as unpatriotic .
Tony Snow , the White House spokesman , questioned whether the Democrats wanted to see Iraq succeed and whether they supported US troops .
" We will have to see how it plays out , " Mr Snow said .
Senator Edward Kennedy , one of the leading anti-war Democrats , promised yesterday to introduce a bill requiring Mr Bush to seek congressional approval for the billions he needs to send more troops .
Mr Kennedy said : " Congress has the power of the purse and what we are saying is before the president sends additional American troops into the civil war , the president has to come back to the Congress and get the authority for that deployment . "
He added : " We ought to take this step and stop the surge . "
Senior Democrats from the House of Representatives and the Senate held a joint meeting yesterday to discuss tactics .
Democrats are almost unanimous in opposition to the plan but divided on which steps to take .
Harry Reid , the Senate majority leader , said blocking funding was an option being discussed .
The Democrats would " look at everything " , short of cutting funds for troops already in the field , he said .
But Democrats are fearful of being labelled unpatriotic , even though such tactics were used in the latter stages of the Vietnam war and other conflicts over the past 50 years .
Other options ranged from a resolution capping troop numbers to one simply describing the planned increase in numbers as a mistake .
The USA Today poll , which interviewed 1,004 people , found that almost half said the US could not achieve its goals in Iraq regardless of how many troops it sent .
Eight in 10 said the war had gone worse than the Bush administration had anticipated and 72 % said Mr Bush did not have a clear plan for Iraq .
Worryingly for the Democrats , however , the poll showed that 66 % had no confidence that the party had a clear plan for Iraq either .
Powerful committees in Congress will have their first chance tomorrow to question Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state , and Robert Gates , Donald Rumsfeld 's replacement as defence secretary , about the new plan .

The “ Larry King Live ” talk show on CNN often tries to enliven political commentary with gossip and celebrity guests .
But when a postelection session last Wednesday strayed into speculation about some politicians ’ sex lives , CNN first put the gossip on the air — and then tried to erase the evidence .
During the comedian Bill Maher ’s appearance on the show Wednesday , he and Mr. King discussed several of the factors contributing to the Democrats ’ election victory the day before , among them scandals involving several Republicans , including Representative Mark Foley .
Mr. Maher then began to speculate on the sexual orientation of some high - ranking Republican officials , and Mr. King , seeming to forget that he was on the air , asked for names .
The comments were broadcast live , but CNN ’s rebroadcast of the show later that evening cut a portion of Mr. Maher ’s remarks .
In addition , the transcript presented on CNN ’s Web site , as well as the one provided to the LexisNexis archiving database , also omits the comments , noting that “ a portion of this transcript has been removed . ”
( A spokeswoman for Nexis said that CNN was responsible for any editing of the transcript . )
A video clip from the show available on cnn.com ends right before Mr. King asked Mr. Maher for his opinion about the Mark Foley scandal .
But in the blogosphere , where CNN was widely accused of censorship , the unedited version of Mr. Maher ’s remarks was available : a video clip from the show ’s original broadcast was quickly posted on youtube.com by John Aravosis , the writer of Americablog ( americablog.blogspot.com ) .
A day later , CNN complained of copyright infringement and YouTube removed the clip ( YouTube declined to comment ) .
Peanut butter contains levels of carbon
Edinburgh University experts say the feat is made possible by squeezing the paste between the tips of two diamonds creating a " stiletto heel effect " .
The scientists also revealed they can turn oxygen into red crystals using the same method .
Demonstrations take place at Royal Society exhibition shows from 2 July .
Many carbon containing materials can be converted into diamonds - including peanut butter
Prof Malcolm McMahon
Edinburgh University
Professor Malcolm McMahon , based at the Centre for Science and Extreme Conditions at Edinburgh University , is one of the scientists involved .
He said : " Pressure can cause extraordinary changes in all kinds of materials and can create completely novel materials .
" We are currently developing techniques that will create pressures of up to five million atmospheres , much higher than the pressure at the centre of the earth , to find the holy grail of high - pressure physics , the metallic phase of hydrogen .
" If we manage to make metallic hydrogen , the next step will be to make enough to study it in real detail , which would mean using much larger diamond anvils , about the size of your thumb , to squeeze it . "
He added : " Obviously large gem-quality diamonds would be extremely expensive , so we are looking at ways to make them artificially .
" Many carbon containing materials can be converted into diamond including peanut butter . "
Dr Colin Pulham , who is also based at the Edinburgh University , said : " Submitting substances to extremely high pressure is a valuable means for understanding their stability .
" High pressure testing of pharmaceuticals is becoming a useful technique to screen new and existing drugs .
" Understanding what happens to a drug 's structure and its properties under pressure could lead to the development of medication which is better suited to hotter climates , or to the development of new forms of medication . "
The free exhibition runs from Monday 2 to 5 July 2007 .
Unlike what George Bush and the Republicans have already turned Iraq into - utter chaos and the number one training ground for Al Qaeda terrorists in the world , per the CIA .
Hours before vetoing a war spending bill , President Bush said Tuesday that Democrats who made the legislation a showdown over withdrawing U.S. troops could turn Iraq into a terror - spreading " cauldron of chaos " with their approach .
The guy is simply a liar .
A dumb as a post , messianic liar .
And actually , it 's worse than that .
The White House knows Iraq is lost .
They 're simply trying to run out the clock so that when the next president takes over they can say " Iraq was going great until YOU took it over . "
The abstract of a recent review paper nicely sums up the very high level view of what is known of the practice of calorie restriction in humans .
No biochemistry here - just results and conclusions presently backed by science :
CONTEXT : Excessive calorie intake and subsequent obesity increases the risk of developing chronic disease and decreases life expectancy .
In rodent models , calorie restriction with adequate nutrient intake decreases the risk of developing chronic disease and extends maximum life span .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the physiological and clinical implications of calorie restriction with adequate nutrient intake .
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION : Search of PubMed ( 1966 - December 2006 ) using terms encompassing various aspects of calorie restriction , dietary restriction , aging , longevity , life span , adiposity , and obesity ; hand search of journals that focus on obesity , geriatrics , or aging ; and search of reference lists of pertinent research and review articles and books .
Reviewed reports ( both basic science and clinical ) included epidemiologic studies , case - control studies , and randomized controlled trials , with quality of data assessed by taking into account publication in a peer - reviewed journal , number of animals or individuals studied , objectivity of measurements , and techniques used to minimize bias .
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS :
It is not known whether calorie restriction extends maximum life span or life expectancy in lean humans .
However , calorie restriction in adult men and women causes many of the same metabolic adaptations that occur in calorie - restricted rodents and monkeys , including decreased metabolic , hormonal , and inflammatory risk factors for diabetes , cardiovascular disease , and possibly cancer .
Excessive calorie restriction causes malnutrition and has adverse clinical effects .
CONCLUSIONS : Calorie restriction in adult men and women causes beneficial metabolic , hormonal , and functional changes , but the precise amount of calorie intake or body fat mass associated with optimal health and maximum longevity in humans is not known .
In addition , it is possible that even moderate calorie restriction may be harmful in specific patient populations , such as lean persons who have minimal amounts of body fat .
All of this should be just as much common sense on diet and health as avoiding the accumulation of excess fat and exercising regularly .
Eat less , but obtain adequate nutrition - calorie restriction is not starvation
No - one knows the absolute , optimal , best level of calorie restriction for you - and no - one is likely to find out any time soon
But an 80/20 , unoptimized practice of calorie restriction that costs little in time and effort and provides additional years of health appears to be a very practical goal
Experiment !
Find a point that makes you feel healthier and your physician approve of your vital statistics
Involve your doctor in any sort of diet change for health reasons ; everyone is different , and your doctor is there to help you understand whether you suffer from any medical condition that might put you at risk
The effects on general health in human trials are quite eye - opening , and the effects in long - running primate trials are even more so .
If you can practice calorie restriction safely , then you owe it to your future self to look into it .
Take a little time to read through the following resources , set out there on the internet to help you : calorie restriction is n't anywhere near as hard as some folk make it out to be , and the benefits can be great .

Six years and several billion shared songs later , the original Napster fiasco is finally about come to an end .
EMI and Bertelsmann have reached a settlement that will close the book on the original Napster 's biggest legal woes — legal woes so old and so confounding that it 's amazing that these guys do n't have better things to do .
Bertelsmann angered its colleagues in the music business when it started financing Napster in 2000 , back at a time when Napster was still a P2P music service very much blamed for all of the industry 's ills .
Napster was shuttered in 2001 and was later reborn as a legal commercial service .
Napster 's demise did nothing to stop file sharing online , however , and recent estimates from Big Champagne say that more than 1 billion songs are shared each month via P2P .
Despite the early demise of the first iteration of Napster , EMI and Universal joined with a number of smaller music publishers in 2003 to sue Bertelsmann in US district court .
Napster had received nearly $ 100 million in support from Bertelsmann starting in 2000 , which both EMI and also Universal music argued amounted to copyright infringement .
This argument was taken to the courts despite the fact that Bertelsmann was also a lead company in the lawsuit that eventually killed Napster the Elder .
As part of the settlement with EMI , Bertelsmann admits no wrongdoing , but they 've had to pay EMI an undisclosed sum to steer clear of the tarnish of Napster .
Universal stepped out of its suit after Bertelsmann paid them $ 60 million for a similar clean slate deal , so we suspect that the settlement with EMI is a stone 's throw from that amount .
Bertelsmann may yet again have to open its pockets in the future , however , as a number of smaller suits are still out there .
EMI 's CEO Eric Nicoli seemed happy with the end results , saying in a statement that EMI looks forward to putting this matter behind them so that they can " continue to pursue the development of new legitimate digital music business models . "

2.0 Game designers test the limits of artificial intelligence Growing up in Gardner in the 1980s , Michael Zarozinski used to stop by the bowling alley after school to play Pac - Man , Q*bert , and Donkey Kong .
Once he'd fed a few hundred quarters into the machines , though , he started noticing a central limitation .
" As soon as you learned the pattern the computer characters moved in , the game was beatable , " he says .
" The experience did n't grow with you . "
More than two decades later , videogame developers are still hacking away at that same problem : how to create more intelligent , more realistic characters , whether they 're foes to fight or allies who'll assist a player .
And Zarozinski has joined their ranks , working for a Shrewsbury company called All inPlay as the company 's " head geek . "
" A lot of the most interesting work in artificial intelligence is being done by game developers , " says Bruce Blumberg , senior scientist at Blue Fang Games in Waltham , and formerly a professor at MIT 's Media Lab .
" You have really bright kids who are dealing with problems they do n't realize are insoluble .
They 're very motivated . "
But those bright people writing software that better mimics human intelligence are running smack into an interesting new trend : online virtual worlds like Second Life , and " massively multiplayer online games " such as World of Warcraft , in which characters are inherently pretty intelligent because they 're being controlled by other humans .
Players in those games design their own characters and then enter the game realm to interact with one another .
Their strategies and dialogue seem authentic -- because they are .
" In some ways , all of these massively multiplayer games have shone a light on the deficiencies of artificially intelligent characters in games to this point , " says Hank Howie , chief executive of Blue Fang .
Howie 's company makes Zoo Tycoon , distributed by Microsoft , in which players build and operate a virtual zoo .
Now the company 's focus is on using artificial intelligence to create more believable animals for future products .
In Empire Earth III , a strategy game designed by Mad Doc Software in Lawrence , the objective is to guide a young civilization to greatness .
Of course , that involves a lot of vanquishing , and artificial intelligence ( AI ) software helps shape the strategy of the opposing army .
" It looks at how the player is playing , what he is doing , and it comes up with a counter strategy , " says Mad Doc CEO Ian Lane Davis .
" Instead of just reacting to the units it sees on the ground , it thinks , ' What is the human trying to do ? " '
But Davis says the limitations of today 's AI can put creative shackles on game designers .
One major barrier is using language to interact with a character .
" You can't talk to characters and expect a response that feels real , " Davis says .
" So there are no games that are like detective stories , or romances , which are popular genres in the movies , because you can't interview suspects or talk to other people . "
The challenge game designers are grappling with today is the same one that the British mathematician Alan Turing posed in 1950 : writing software that could easily be mistaken for a human .
" You 're always aiming to create something where the players wo n't be aware that they 're dealing with an AI character , " says Michael Gesner , founder of Dragonfly Game Design in Westborough .
One way to get there is by having humans " train " the AI software .
That 's the approach that game designer Jeff Orkin , now a grad student at the Media Lab , is taking .
With a project called The Restaurant Game , Orkin invites players to assume the role of a restaurant 's wait staff .
His plan is to capture their behavior and dialogue , and use it to build more realistic software - driven characters , in the same way that designers sometimes use motion capture cameras to record and replicate human movement .
" Ideally , AI systems in the future will observe as designers directly control characters , and learn to play roles and even converse , " Orkin writes via e-mail .
Of course , it 's hard to ignore the success of massively multiplayer games .
World of Warcraft , one of the oldest , said in March that it has 8.5 million paladins , priests , and druids pursuing quests and casting spells .
Market research firm Screen Digest estimated that the global market for massively multiplayer games hit $ 1 billion last year .
Fueling that growth is the fact that massively multiplayer games demand an ongoing monthly subscription fee rather than a one - time software purchase .
" It 's like the gym subscription model , " says Brett Close , CEO of 38 Studios in Maynard .
Once players have built a character and " leveled it up , " acquiring skills and weapons , they 're unlikely to cancel a subscription -- and sometimes they even forget about it .
But even though most game developers may be eager to shift to that kind of business model , there is n't a sense in the industry that massively multiplayer games , with their hordes of human - guided characters , will necessarily render the pursuit of better AI irrelevant .
Close and others envision a hybrid , in which AI - driven characters help advance a story .
While massively multiplayer games have been successful , he says , " nobody is successfully delivering episodic content , and a compelling story , so that you understand that what you 're doing in the game is affecting the story . "
More realistic AI characters could serve as guides , he suggests , " taking you through certain situations , " or act as wily opponents .
38 Studios , with 40 employees , has as its major investor Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling , an avid gamer .
The company 's first game will be based on the stories of fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore .
" You need AI characters in tandem with yourself and your few human party members , " Davis says .
But those AI characters , he acknowledges , will need to " have a mood , a goal , and something they 're focused on .
We need to give them the right body language and facial expressions so they seem more human . "
In Newburyport , Muzzy Lane Software said recently that it is partnering with Harvard historian Niall Ferguson to create a new game , due out next year , that will allow players to simulate modern - day conflicts like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , or clashes involving Iran or North Korea .
CEO
Dave McCool says the AI software will observe how humans play , and " learn how to beat you . "
Truly evolved AI , of course , would figure out a way to avoid taking up arms in the first place .
But that 'd be better - than - human AI -- still a few years off .

Andrew Walker was the coroner at the Matty Hull inquest
Andrew Walker was speaking at the reopening of an inquest into the fatal helicopter crash in March 2003 .
The eight servicemen died along with four US marines in Kuwait .
American authorities would not give evidence or provide relevant videotape to the court despite all efforts by the MoD , the coroner said .
' Strenuous attempts '
Mr Walker , Oxfordshire 's Assistant Deputy Coroner , criticised US authorities for failing to provide " vital " information during the controversial Matty Hull inquest last month .
It seems to me inexcusable that witnesses could come to assist this inquest but they are not allowed to do so

In this latest case , Mr Walker told the coroner 's court he had been refused permission to use American evidence that would help his inquiry .
Mr Walker said that despite " strenuous attempts by his office and the Ministry of Defence " , the US had again said it would not provide any American witnesses to give evidence at his hearing .
" We are again at the beginning of an inquest without the necessary answers to the questions from the US service personnel , " he said .
He said the evidence included infrared tape taken by the air mission command aircraft which he believed held radio transmissions before and after the crash .
In addition , footage filmed by an embedded Fox News crew from Fox News was also being withheld , he added .
However , BBC correspondent Jon Brain said the coroner had new information that the images may well be released to the court , after the US authorities had previously denied its existence .
' Cover -up '
Paul Spencer , on behalf of the family of Sergeant Les Hehir , 34 , from Poole , Dorset and the 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery , who died in the crash , said widow Sharon Hehir found the US 's attitude " inexplicable " .
Mr Spencer said : " It 's a matter of deep regret and anger on her part that the Americans have refused to cooperate .
" It gives the impression of a cover - up . "
The coroner told him : " It seems to me inexcusable that witnesses could come to assist this inquest but they are not allowed to do so . "
The Special Investigations Branch military policeman in charge of collecting evidence for the coroner , Warrant Officer 2 Philip Jackson , told the hearing that the Americans ' failure to reveal more information was " frustrating to say the least " .
He added : " I would like to see more openness in disclosure of the American material . "
The British victims were all from 3 Commando Brigade based in Plymouth .
The men who died were : Royal Marines Colour Sergeant John Cecil , 35 , from Plymouth ; Captain Philip Guy , 29 , from Bishopdale , North Yorks ; Marine Sholto Hedenskog , 26 , from Cape Town , South Africa ; Warrant Officer 2 Mark Stratford , 39 , from Plymouth ; and Major Jason Ward , 34 , from Torquay .
Also killed were Operator Mechanic ( Communications ) Second Class Ian Seymour , 29 , from Poole in Dorset ; Sgt Les Hehir , 34 , also from Poole ; and Lance Bombardier Llywelyn Evans , 24 , of Llandudno , north Wales .
Lance Bombardier Evans had a younger brother serving in the same unit .
A British board of inquiry report into the tragedy caused controversy when it differed in the findings of the American report .
The UK inquiry by 3 Commando Brigade found that technical failure was to blame .
But British defence chiefs endorsed a US investigation which focused on pilot " disorientation " .
FOR years now , free trade and free movement of capital have been respectable economic tenets , espoused — if sometimes reluctantly — by most politicians .
But no sane politician in the rich world would advocate free movement of labour .
As a result , most people are trapped in their native lands , never likely to have a legal opportunity to see the world outside .
Philippe Legrain , a liberal economist who once worked for The Economist , has already written a book stoutly defending globalisation .
Now he takes on an even more emotive subject .
There is not a shadow of doubt about his own views .
He wants open borders .
He believes that they will , on balance , enrich both sending and receiving countries ; he thinks diversity generally makes life more interesting ; and he detests bureaucratic restrictions on human freedoms .
“ Immigrants are not an invading army , ” he points out .
“ They come in search of a better life .
They are no different to someone who moves from Manchester to London , or Oklahoma to California , because that is where the jobs are .
Except that a border lies in the way . ”
Mr Legrain has assembled powerful evidence to undermine the economic arguments against immigration .
In the case of skilled migrants , that is relatively easy .
But the migrants who arrive in the back of lorries and huddled in small boats are unskilled .
For them , there are hardly any legal tracks across borders .
Yet , argues Mr Legrain , they too bring economic benefits and do “ little or no harm ” to the wages or employment prospects of native workers .
As for the economic impact on sending countries , many now gain more from remittances than from official aid or inward investment .
He quotes approvingly a government minister from the Philippines who says : “ Overseas employment has built more homes , sent more children of the poor to college and established more business enterprises than all the other programmes of the government put together . ”
Mr Legrain makes a robust economic case — though he surely understates the impact of immigrants on holding back the pay of the poorest , often themselves the children of immigrants .
He is more successful at rebutting the argument that taxpayers give willingly only to those with whom they feel some kinship and that immigration , therefore , jeopardises support for the welfare state .
A willingness to pay taxes to support the poor is independent of levels of immigration , he shows .
Less convincing are his proposals for encouraging immigrants to go home after a period of working abroad .
If immigration were temporary , he reasons , people might tolerate it more readily .
So why not get immigrants to post a bond on arrival , say , or have a portion of their wages withheld until they leave ?
The trouble with such ingenious ideas is that immigrants from the world 's poorer countries have many reasons to stay overseas , especially in Europe or America .
The financial gains are huge , but they are by no means the only rewards .
Life is much easier where there is the rule of law , less petty corruption and a better health - care system than exists at home .
But hostility to immigration is not just , or indeed mainly , about economics .
It is based on fear of change and on racism .
It has also , since the World Trade Centre attacks , been based on growing worries about Muslim terrorism .
Such anxieties are not easily assuaged by economic logic .
It is striking , for example , how little serious protest there was in Britain at the absorption of over 500,000 east European immigrants in the two years after Poland and nine other countries acceded to the European Union in May 2004 .
Surely at least one reason was that these white Christian Europeans look and ( seem to ) think extraordinarily like most British people , and their children and grandchildren will be distinguishable only by their unpronounceable names .
By contrast , many Muslim immigrants and their children have become more estranged , not less .
Their ambivalence towards the West and its secular liberalism has appeared to grow , not diminish .
It is , of course , wholly unreasonable to see most Muslims as potential terrorists — but reason may not have much chance here .
So no government in the rich world is likely to open its borders to all comers , as Mr Legrain urges .
For politicians , the tricky question is who to let in .
And how to define a coherent policy ?
The harsh truth is that voters find it easier to accept immigrants who look and behave as they do than those who are different .
That , as a basis for policy , still leaves most of mankind outside the gates .
Here 's a great map from a great blog , Strange Maps .
Each state is represented by a foreign country with the same GDP .
I 'm struck by one obvious thing .
The District of Columbia has the same GDP as New Zealand .
Now imagine if no one in New Zealand were allowed to vote for their own government , and they were governed by the Senate in Australia as a colony .
Yep : that 's how it is in America - the once - colonized now colonize themselves .

I say this in the nicest way possible , as I would absolutely call myself both a geek and a math nerd .
Young , mathematically inclined and often socially awkward kids under the age of 23 are literally taking over the world of both online and live poker .
Go to any major poker event these days and the field will be dominated by kids who look like they just graduated from high school .
The slick - looking , sharply dressed elder statesmen poker players such as Doyle Brunson are a dying breed ; they are quickly being replaced by youngers more likely to sport a pocket calculator than a pair of sunglasses and cigar .
The question is , why are kids with above average math skills flocking to poker in droves ?
The answer to that is an easy one .
While poker does involve some luck , skills and knowledge of odds will eventually come out on top .
People who used to play games such as Magic and Starcraft are now flocking to poker , because they can easily beat the average player due to their strategic thinking and knowledge of odds .
In no time flat , a sharp mind can grasp the basics of poker and easily outplay the " weekend warrior " type of player just by understanding the math behind the game .
Want proof of this phenomenon ?
David Williams , who came in second behind Greg Raymer in the 2004 World Series of Poker , was a well - known Magic player before he ventured into poker .
His appearance at the World Series of Poker was n't a fluke ; he has final tabled numerous major events since then .
Elky , a well - known and very successful online player , was one of the top Starcraft players in the world before he saw the potential in online poker and switched his game of choice .
Actionjeff , one of the most successful players online ( at only 18 years of age , he has already won close to a million dollars online ) was at one time the highest ranked Magic player in the US .
I could list dozens of examples , but you get the idea .
Word of mouth is spreading , and people with strong math and analytical skills are gravitating towards online poker , lured by the prospects of sitting in front of your computer , making huge amounts of money .
Online poker players are the new 21st century rock stars .

sml.net Functional programming on the .NET CLR
SML.NET is a compiler for the functional programming language Standard ML that targets the .NET Common Language Runtime and which supports language interoperability features for easy access to .NET libraries .
This web site was last updated on 02 - June - 06 .
Download SML.NET is available for download in either binary or source form .
The current version is : SML.NET 1.2 build 1613 of 02 - June - 06 .
New in This Release Major improvements to the Visual Studio Integration Package Much more accurate and reliable Intellisense ; hovering over a keyword reports the type of its smallest enclosing expression ; hovering over a pattern reports the types of its bindings .
Major improvements to Debugger Support Bindings in the Locals window now enter and exit scope appropriately .
The values of sub -expressions , not just identifiers , are reported as locals in Locals window .
Most constructed values now have symbolic tags derived from the constructor name .
Values of heap - allocated SML datatypes now support ToString ( ) and ToString ( int depth ) methods that can be invoked in the VS Immediate window to inspect values at runtime .
Improved stepping behaviour .
SML.NET stack frames now typically have meaningful , not mangled , source names .
Preliminary support for Whidbey
The distribution has been updated to support the current 2.0 release of the Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 .
SML.NET remains compatible with the initial 1.0 and 1.1 releases .
NB : Although SML.NET fully supports SML polymorphism , it does not yet produce or consume .NET generics ( we hope to in future ) : this release just allows you to continue working with your existing SML.NET code on the Whidbey platform .
Improved code generation and performance SML.NET now makes much better use of locals and the stack ; pattern matching is compiled as a switch when appropriate .
Various bug fixes Including : the annoying ( but benign ) overflow error when persisting compilation units has been fixed ; SML.NET now exploits some previously missed opportunities for tail - recursion .
Features Support for all of Standard ML SML.NET compiles all of SML ' 97 ( with some very minor discrepancies ) .
Support for the Basis library Almost all of the Standard ML Basis Library is implemented .
Seamless interoperability with other languages SML.NET extends the SML language to support safe , convenient use of the .NET Framework libraries and code written in other languages for the CLR , such as C# or VB .
SML.NET can both consume and produce .NET classes , interfaces , delegates etc. Command - line compilation SML.NET supports traditional compilation from the command - line .
Interactive compilation environment Alternatively , you can control the compiler from an interactive environment .
This lets you set and query options incrementally and to see the signatures of compiled and imported SML.
NET modules .
Automatic dependency analysis
In either mode of compilation , the compiler requires only the names of root modules and a place to look for source code .
It then does dependency analysis to determine which files are required and which need recompilation .
Produces verifiable CLR IL
The output of the compiler is verifiable MSIL ( Microsoft Intermediate Language ) for the CLR .
Whole program optimization SML.NET performs optimizations on a whole program ( or library ) at once .
It usually produces small executables with fairly good performance .
Integration with Visual Studio .NET
A binary distribution includes an experimental package for Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2002 , 2003 and & 2005 that allows you to edit , build and debug SML.NET projects from within the development environment .
Limitations
No interactive evaluation
The interactive environment is for compilation of stand - alone applications or libraries only .
SML expressions can not be evaluated interactively and the use command is not available .
For programs that make no use of the language extensions it is possible to develop and test them using a compiler such as Moscow ML or Standard ML of New Jersey and then to use SML.NET to produce final executables .
Whole program optimization Top - level SML modules are not compiled individually to .NET object code .
Instead , some compilation takes place on separate modules ( type checking , translation to the compiler 's own intermediate form , and some optimizations ) but most is deferred until after the linking together of top - level modules .
This improves performance of the generated code , but significantly increases ( re ) compilation times .
Only CLR types at boundaries of compiled code
The exposed interfaces of applications or DLLs compiled by SML.NET may only refer to CLR types ( classes , interfaces , delegates , etc. ) .
They may not expose SML - specific types ( functions , datatypes , records , etc. ) .
In particular , this restriction means that one cannot compile an arbitrary SML module into a DLL for consumption even by other SML.NET programs : the module must be either linked into the client program at compile - time or use only CLR types at its interface .

The guys who brought you KaZaA and Skype are at it again , and their upcoming Venice Project Peer to Peer streaming will show YouTube how video is really done .
Just like KaZaA was a disruptive force in music sharing , and Skype was a disruptive force for phone calls , the Venice Project will kill current online video sharing and TV streaming sites .

So how can the Venice Project demolish what is essentially the biggest video site on the internet ?
Two reasons : the founder 's track record , and the state of the Venice Project now .

Janus and Niklas know peer to peer .
They know exactly how to make it work to meet a singular need .
And from the quality of both the video and the speed of the streaming , they 've done a superb job with the Venice Project as well .
It 's definitely no contest when you compare this to the blurriness of YouTube and other streaming sites .
Do people care how the data is getting from the host to them ?
No .
That 's exactly why peer to peer will definitely win over a centralized , YouTube approach .
By cutting down on bandwidth costs ( they 're mostly from the users ) , the Venice Project can have much higher quality video .
Just like with Skype , what do people care that their call or video is going through Zimbabwe before getting to them ?
The only thing that 's important is that the quality is there , and the content is there .
All that the Venice Project needs now is content .

Despite predictions of exotic properties , ’ superheavy ’ element 112 behaves like one of the family , say radiochemists in Switzerland .
Robert Eichler , Heinz G?ggeler and colleagues at the Paul Scherrer Institute have confirmed the existence of Ununbium - as element 112 is provisionally known - and shown it behaves like mercury , its closest neighbour on the periodic table .
Superheavy elements like 112 were first postulated in the 1960s to exist on an ’ island of stability ’ .
Scientists soon set out in search of this idyllic - sounding spot , first looking for the element among supernovas .
But the first sightings of 112 were made inside particle accelerators , by physicist Sigurd Hofmann and colleagues at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research ( GSI ) in Darmstadt , Germany , in 1996 .
’ The physicists provided no information on the chemical properties of 112 - only that it exists , ’ said G?ggeler .
Theories predicting the behaviour of these elements were conflicting ; the high positive charge of a nucleus packed with protons meant some of the orbiting electrons would be travelling close to the speed of light , affecting the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus .
Would this make 112 a highly unreactive element , inert like a noble gas ?
Or would 112 behave more like mercury , the element it sits below in the periodic table ?
’ How do you design an experiment to disentangle whether 112 is mercury - like or gas - like ? ’ said G?ggeler .
’ We know mercury makes very strong bonds with other metals , including gold , to form amalgams . ’
So the team built a detector array made completely from gold , with a temperature gradient from +30 degrees to - 180 .
In preliminary tests , mercury stuck to the very first detector , while the noble gas radon travelled almost to the last .
Eichler , G?ggeler and colleagues made 112 and tested its properties by firing a calcium ion beam at plutonium .
On two occasions , this process gave complete fusion of the two nuclei , which decayed to give 112 .
’ The two 112 atoms were detected only slightly below mercury , ’ said G?ggeler .
’ So , surprisingly , 112 is just an ordinary member of the group , ’ he said .
Phantom element
’ People were sceptical [ of 112 ’s discovery ] until recently , as other labs could n’t confirm the results , ’ said Andreas T?rler , who investigates superheavy elements at the Technical University Munich , Germany .
’ Now , Eichler ’s results lend credibility to the discovery , and credibility that the island of stability does exist .
Everybody is very excited , as now we can start to do some chemistry , ’ he said .
Yet officially , element 112 still does not exist .
Since Hofmann ’s fist claims for the discovery of element 112 in 1996 , Iupac ( the International union of pure and applied chemistry ) has been waiting for further results before confirming its discovery .
’ I ’m quite convinced Iupac will now recognize this element , ’ said T?rler .
’ This new chemistry does n’t have an influence on naming 112 , but the team could go on to name 114 .
But having only seen two atoms , you ca n’t really say 112 has been full investigated chemically !’
Paul Karol , who sits on a working group for Iupac considering claims for the discovery of superheavy elements , declined to comment on Eichler ’s results .
’ The competing claims for discovery of 112 are under critique by a joint group of " experts " right now and any revelation of our preliminary position would be most inappropriate , ’ he said .

New Bush nominee found to have race - baiting past Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 9 , 2007 Print This Email This President George W. Bush 's pick for a top position at the State Department may have failed to follow through on a commitment she made to African - American and Latino lawmakers to address diversity issues in America 's diplomatic corps .
Henrietta Holsman Fore , the current Undersecretary of State for Management , was nominated Monday to serve as Deputy Secretary of State and Administrator of the US Agency for International Development .
But one Congressman was concerned that racially insensitive remarks she reportedly made 20 years ago could call her fitness to serve into question .
" I still think that a person that has a background of this nature puts her at a disadvantage , and when you get into something as sensitive as USAID , where you 're dealing with developing countries , and people of color , I 'm not so sure how she will be perceived by the leadership of countries she has to work with , " Rep. Donald Payne ( D - NJ ) , a member of the Congressional Black Caucus , told RAW STORY in a Wednesday interview .
He added , " If you start off on your left foot , it takes time to prove to people that you really did n't mean a stupid statement that you made , and time is lost where people are still suspicious of you . "
Fore 's nomination almost blocked in '05 for race remarks The Congressman , who serves as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs , was referring to a 1987 New York Times article that showed Fore had stepped down from the Wellesley College Board of Trustees after she made racially suspect remarks .
The Times reported that Fore , then known by her maiden name of Henrietta Holsman and owner at the time of a manufacturing facility in Los Angeles , remarked in a lecture that " she had trouble keeping black assembly - line workers from going ' back to the street to earn more money ' selling drugs . "
Furthermore , the Times reported that Fore had also said " she had found Hispanic workers to be lazy , white workers resentful of having to work with machines , and Asians , while very productive , likely to move on to professional or management jobs . "
In 2005 , when Fore left the US Mint to serve as the Undersecretary of State for Management , where she is responsible for human resources decision - making and other issues , Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) threatened to block her nomination .
" I 'm troubled by these statements , " the Chicago Tribune 's Jeff Zeleny reported Obama as saying in a June 10 , 2005 article .
" I 'm troubled by the lack of clarity . "
But the Associated Press reported on July 19 , 2005 that Obama 's concerns had been eased after Fore wrote him a letter promising to make diversity at the State Department a priority .
" Fore , in a letter to Obama dated July 13 , said she would work with the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in identifying the best practices that can be used to strengthen diversity in the State Department , " the AP report noted .
Senator Obama promised to fully scrutinize her record in the Bush administration as the Senate takes up her nomination .
" When Ms. Fore was nominated to a State Department position two years ago , Senator Obama was concerned about racially insensitive comments that she had made as a Wellesley College trustee , " said Ben LaBolt , an Obama spokesman , in a Tuesday e-mail to RAW STORY .
" Ms. Fore expressed her regret about the comments , and Senator Obama agreed to support her nomination for that position .
Given the important role played by the Director of USAID , Senator Obama will carefully scrutinize Ms. Fore 's record over the past two years at the State Department and will withhold judgment about her qualifications for this new position until after her confirmation hearing . "
No meetings with CBC , and diversity at State unchanged Obama may find an ample record to review .
RAW STORY contacted the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to see if they had been granted an opportunity to meet with Fore on diversity issues in the State Department 's workforce .
The Congressional Black Caucus said it had no official comment on Fore , and did not confirm meeting with the State Department official .
Rep .
Payne also was unaware of any meetings between Fore and the CBC .
" I was n't an officer during the past two years , although I attended meetings each week , but I do n't recall anything specific or any report back from her to the CBC , " he said .
A spokesman for Rep. Jesse Jackson , Jr. ( D - IL ) , who sits on the subcommittee that oversees the State Department 's budget , agreed with Payne that no contact occurred between Fore and the CBC .
" We have had no contact , and no meetings with Henrietta Fore , and to our knowledge , she has not met with the CBC either , " said Ken Edmonds in Jackson 's office .
A spokesman for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus told RAW STORY that Fore had met with the group of Latino legislators twice , but could not speak to the content of the meetings .
Additionally , the State Department 's own accountability reports show little change in the make up of the workforce since Fore took over in 2005 .
" Racial and ethnic diversity is only one aspect of a more diverse workforce .
20 percent of Foreign Service Generalists and 22 percent of Foreign Service Specialists hired in 2006 were minorities .
32 percent of student program participants were minorities , " the State Department reported for Fiscal Year 2006 .
In contrast , 19 % and 22 % of Generalists and Specialists were minorities in Fiscal Year 2005 , and the student program 's population had been 35.7 % minorities , suggesting a decline in the subsequent year .
Moreover , the State Department acknowledged that it was having increasing difficulties keeping track of the share of minorities in its workforce .
" New hires are asked to self - identify their minority status .
The number of participants declining to answer has been increasing , " the FY 2006 report noted .
" In FY2003 , 11 percent of student program participants chose not to respond when asked to identify their race / ethnicity , whereas in FY2006 , 22 percent chose not to respond . "
RAW STORY was told by State Department spokesman Curtis Cooper that Fiscal Year 2007 data could not be made available .
At press time , he had not provided a response on whether Fore had met with the CBC or CHC or made any particular efforts to reach out to them during her tenure as Undersecretary of State for Management .
Rep .
Payne said he remained concerned about the ability of African - Americans to succeed within the ranks of America 's foreign service .
" I do n't think there 's been much progress in diversity ... this has always been a problem historically , " he explained .
" There 's something that happens on way to top , and larger numbers of blacks tend not to get favorable evaluations , and they never get out of the lower or lower - middle tier , they get washed out of the service . "
Fore has already been appointed acting Director for Foreign Assistance .
She is set to replace Randall Tobias , the Deputy Secretary of State who resigned April 27 after it was revealed that he had been a client of " DC Madam " Deborah Jean Palfrey .
RAW STORY showed on Tuesday that Fore had donated thousands of dollars to a pro-choice Republican group that opposes the Bush administration 's anti-abortion " Mexico City Policy , " also known as the " Global Gag Rule , " which she will be responsible for enforcing at USAID .

Pidgin 2.0 , the latest version of the popular open - source instant messaging client formerly known as Gaim , is now available for download .
After months of development and numerous beta releases , Pidgin 2.0 is finally ready .
A significant improvement over the current 1.5.x series , Pidgin 2.0 includes several compelling features and usability enhancements .
Last year , we looked at the second beta release and concluded that much work still needed to be done .
Many of the problems we discovered in the early Gaim 2.0 betas have since been resolved .
The official Pidgin 2.0 release , available for download from the Pidgin web site , provides an impressive level of quality and reliability .
Pidgin 2.0 is a highly extensible and cohesive platform for multiprotocol Internet communication that includes broad support for essential instant messaging features and common protocols .
Rigged with a versatile plug - in system and an assortment of advanced features , Pidgin 2.0 is capable of competing with commercial instant messaging applications like Trillian Pro. Although Pidgin 2.0 has evolved into a robust and powerful program , the absence of voice and video chat features and a few minor weaknesses in the user interface detract from its usefulness and illuminate the need for additional work as development on the 2.x series progresses .
For this review , I compiled Pidgin 2.0 beta 7 using a tarball from SourceForge ( Beta 7 is identical to 2.0 except for some very minor bug fixes ) .
Out of the box , my Pidgin 2.0 build includes support for AIM , Gadu - Gadu , Groupwise , ICQ , IRC , Jabber , MSN , QQ , SIMPLE , Yahoo , and Zephyr .
I also compiled in support for spellcheck , D - Bus , and Perl scripting .
I tried to enable the compile - time Mono option , but lacked the proper dependencies .
A bird by any other name
We talked to Pidgin project leader Sean Egan about Gaim 's unexpected name change .
After AOL repeatedly targeted individual Gaim developers with legal threats , major Gaim contributors created the Instant Messaging Freedom Corporation to manage the legal issues and open settlement negotiations with AOL .
In order to accommodate the negotiations , Gaim developers had to keep the ongoing legal discussions private and refrain from creating any non -beta Gaim 2.0 releases .
A settlement was finally reached , but one of the conditions necessitated renaming Gaim .
After much discussion , the Gaim developers decided to call the program Pidgin .
" We like the name , " Egan told me .
" It was the second choice we all really liked .
We were thinking up linguistic terms , and someone mentioned Pidgin .
Another developer commented that ' corrupted language ' may not be the best thing to associate yourself with , to which another pointed out something along the lines of ' have you ever SEEN people talk on IM ? ' "
" We all felt that was a pretty valid point , so the name stuck , " continued Egan .
" It 's a corrupted language , much like that used by IM users , it 's caused by people talking different languages ( or protocols ) with each other , and it sounds like a bird known for carrying messages across long distances . "
The underlying messaging infrastructure developed for Gaim , originally called libgaim , has been renamed to libpurple , and Gaim 's text - based instant messaging interface has been renamed Finch .
Egan comments , " With Adium being represented as a duck , Pidgin as a pigeon , and Finch as a finch , we 've set a pattern that libpurple clients are all birds . "
Chevron , the second - largest American oil company , is preparing to acknowledge that it should have known kickbacks were being paid to Saddam Hussein on oil it bought from Iraq as part of a defunct United Nations program , according to investigators .
The admission is part of a settlement being negotiated with United States prosecutors and includes fines totaling $ 25 million to $ 30 million , according to the investigators , who declined to be identified because the settlement was not yet public .
The penalty , which is still being negotiated , would be the largest so far in the United States in connection with investigations of companies involved in the oil - for - food scandal .
The $ 64 billion program was set up in 1996 by the Security Council to help ease the effects of United Nations sanctions on Iraqi civilians after the first gulf war .
Until the American invasion in 2003 , the program allowed Saddam ’s government to export oil to pay for food , medicine and humanitarian goods .
The picture was taken by the NASA robot " Spirit " over the course of 5 months .
The " McMurdo panorama " is a combination of more than 1400 individual pictures which were taken when the lack of sunlight did n't allow the rover to move during the Marsian winter .
For improved immersion , the interactive panoramic image has been contrast enhanced and the sky is an extrapolation from the narrow band of sky in the original pictures ( so there is no sun , for example . )

A Frankensteinesque contraption of glass bulbs and crackling electrodes has produced yet another revelation about the origin of life .
The results suggest that Earth 's early atmosphere could have produced chemicals necessary for life — contradicting the view that life 's building blocks had to come from comets and meteors .
" Maybe we 're over - optimistic , but I think this is a paradigm shift , " says chemist Jeffrey Bada , whose team performed the experiment at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif .
Bada was revisiting the famous experiment first done by his mentor , chemist Stanley Miller , at the University of Chicago in 1953 .
Miller , along with his colleague Harold Urey , used a sparking device to mimic a lightning storm on early Earth .
Their experiment produced a brown broth rich in amino acids , the building blocks of proteins .
The disclosure made the pages of national magazines and showed that theories about the origin of life could actually be tested in the laboratory .
But the Miller - Urey results were later questioned :
It turns out that the gases he used ( a reactive mixture of methane and ammonia ) did not exist in large amounts on early Earth .
Scientists now believe the primeval atmosphere contained an inert mix of carbon dioxide and nitrogen — a change that made a world of difference .
When Miller repeated the experiment using the correct combo in 1983 , the brown broth failed to materialize .
Instead , the mix created a colorless brew , containing few amino acids .
It seemed to refute a long - cherished icon of evolution — and creationists quickly seized on it as supposed evidence of evolution 's wobbly foundations .
But Bada 's repeat of the experiment — armed with a new insight — seems likely to turn the tables once again .
Bada discovered that the reactions were producing chemicals called nitrites , which destroy amino acids as quickly as they form .
They were also turning the water acidic — which prevents amino acids from forming .
Yet primitive Earth would have contained iron and carbonate minerals that neutralized nitrites and acids .
So Bada added chemicals to the experiment to duplicate these functions .
When he reran it , he still got the same watery liquid as Miller did in 1983 , but this time it was chock - full of amino acids .
Bada presented his results this week at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in Chicago .
" It 's important work , " says Christopher McKay , a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , Calif .
" This is a move toward more realism in terms of what the conditions were on early Earth . "
Most researchers believe that the origin of life depended heavily on chemicals delivered to Earth by comets and meteorites .
But if the new work holds up , it could tilt that equation , says Christopher Chyba , an astrobiologist at Princeton University .
" That would be a terrific result for understanding the origin of life , " he says , " and for understanding the prospects for life elsewhere . "
But James Ferris , a prebiotic chemist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y. , doubts that atmospheric electricity could have been the only source of organic molecules .
" You get a fair amount of amino acids , " he says .
" What you do n't get are things like building blocks of nucleic acids . "
Meteors , comets or primordial ponds of hydrogen cyanide would still need to provide those molecules .
Bada 's experiment could also have implications for life on Mars , because the Red Planet may have been swaddled in nitrogen and carbon dioxide early in its life .
Bada intends to test this extrapolation by doing experiments with lower - pressure mixes of those gases .
Chyba is cautious : " We do n't know , " he says , " whether Mars really ever had that atmosphere . "
That 's because Mars today has carbon dioxide , but hardly any nitrogen — which is also needed for making amino acids .
Some scientists suspect that nitrogen gas existed on Mars , but was blasted away by asteroid impacts billions of years ago .
ince I wrote a DevX article on the first beta release of Java Standard Edition ( SE ) version 6 in February of this year , two new early - access versions have been released .
This article discusses the first Java SE 6 release candidate , a feature - complete , almost fully tested implementation of the newest version of desktop Java .
While the article in February focused on many GUI features ( and declared Java SE 6 a desktop winner ) , this one focuses on some other new features and improvements , namely scripting and the compiler API .
Java Supplants Scripting
In the early days of the enterprise Java standard ( what was called J2EE and is now called Java EE ) , many Web site designers employed server - side scripting to implement functionality .
Available tools and software made it easy to develop and deploy this type of business logic , but they had two huge drawbacks : poor performance and little debugging assistance .
Server - side scripts , such as those implemented as JavaScript , are not compiled ; they 're interpreted as they execute .
This leads to poor performance and little to no scalability .
The emergence of the Java Servlet specification and , subsequently , JavaServer Pages ( JSP ) put an end to all of that .
Because these server - side technologies were based on pure Java , tools emerged to help you debug the code .
Additionally , since the Java code could be compiled ( thanks to the HotSpot compiler ) , performance and scalability were excellent .
This marked the end of mainstream server - side scripting .
The Return of Scripting Languages
With the advent of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML ( AJAX ) - based rich Web applications , scripting languages have made a comeback .
This time , the script is meant to run at the client , where scalability generally is n't an issue ( each client runs its own browser and hence its own scripts ) .
The result is a very dynamic
Web page that includes rich application features with acceptable performance .
Further reasons to use scripting languages in a Web application include dynamic type conversion ( automatic conversions from values to strings ) , access to the operating system environment ( as with shell scripts ) , and the use of specialized Web frameworks for scripting languages .
For these reasons , dynamic scripting languages have reemerged on the server as well .
However , this reintroduction of scripting languages has left programmers wanting the following :
Access to the rich resources of the Java platform , as well as custom JAR files , from scripting languages
Access to scripting languages from the Java platform itself
Java SE 6 satisfies both of these requests with JSR 223 ( Scripting for the Java Platform ) .
When you join the features of both the Java language and available scripting languages , you can pick and choose the strengths of both environments to use at the same time .
For instance , Java developers can access
Perl scripts to perform string operations that are best done with Perl .
Additionally , AJAX developers can invoke Java objects directly from script embedded within a Web page to perform complex operations .
For example , since database access is far less robust ( if not impractical ) from JavaScript as compared with Java , you can perform this and other complex operations in Java code and simply invoke the Java code from your page 's script .
Java SE 6 ships with the Mozilla Rhino scripting engine , but you 're free to substitute any available scripting engine that complies with JSR 223 .
( For a list of JSR 223 - compliant script engines , click here . )
This includes implementations of Python and Ruby .
The new javax .
script APIs provide access to the scripting environments from Java .
For instance , the following code iterates through the list of available scripting engines and outputs the language types and the associated engines :
import java.util .* ; import javax.script .* ; public class Main { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { try { ScriptEngineManager mgr = new ScriptEngineManager ( ) ; List < ScriptEngineFactory > factories = mgr.getEngineFactories ( ) ; System.out.println ( " Available script engines : " ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < factories.size ( ) ; i++ ) { ScriptEngineFactory factory = factories.get ( i ) ; String engine = factory.getEngineName( ) ; String language = factory.getLanguageName( ) ; System.out.println ("-------------------------------------------" ) ; System.out.println ( " Language : " + language ) ; System.out.println ( " Engine : " + engine ) ; System.out.println ("-------------------------------------------" ) ; } } catch ( Exception e ) { e.printStackTrace ( ) ; } } }
JSR 223 - compliant scripting engines must implement the javax .script .
ScriptEngine interface and be packaged in JAR files with a META -INF / services / javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory text resource .
Once you deploy a compliant scripting engine JAR file into your Java environment or with your application , you can access this engine from your Java code .
To do this , simply include the engine 's JAR file within your application 's classpath .
Let 's examine the Rhino JavaScript engine 's Java scripting features with some simple examples .
Most visitors to the Louvre want to see the Mona Lisa
Access to the museum was made free for visitors after strikers blocked access to ticket desks , reports say .
The Musee d'Orsay was also shut after attendants there stopped work .
Attendants are demanding a bonus they say other categories of staff have been offered , and because they suffer more stress being on the floor .
" The stress is clearly linked to the number of visitors " , one Louvre attendant , who did not want to be named , told the AFP news agency .
" What 's unbearable is the constant hubbub of the crowd , especially in the really popular rooms like the one with the Mona Lisa or the Venus de Milo .
" On Sundays , when the museum is free , it is even worse .
There can be 65,000 visitors on one day .
It 's unbearable and even sometimes dangerous . "
' Managing the flow '
Staff in the hall leading to the Mona Lisa - which most of the visitors to the museum want to see - said they spent much of their time reminding the public that flash photography was banned in the room where the painting was displayed .
" Sometimes you just blow your top , " one staff member said .
Christelle Guyader , of the union staging the strike , said : " When the number of visitors gets so large - we had more than 7.5 m in 2005 and 8.3 m last year - with no increase in the number of attendants , and when more and more rooms are opened , then our work is reduced to simply managing the flow . "
Management at the Louvre said that only a small percentage of the museum 's attendants were on strike and that it was " having little effect " , AFP reported .
Two African - American coaches , Doc Rivers of the Boston Celtics and Maurice Cheeks of the Philadelphia 76ers , declined to comment on the paper ’s claims .
Rod Thorn , the president of the New Jersey Nets and formerly the N.B.A. ’s executive vice president for basketball operations , said : “ I do n’t believe it .
I think officials get the vast majority of calls right .
They do n’t get them all right .
The vast majority of our players are black . ”

Mr. Wolfers and Mr. Price spend 41 pages accounting for such population disparities and more than a dozen other complicating factors .
For the 1991 - 92 through 2003 - 4 seasons , the authors analyzed every player ’s box - score performance — minutes played , rebounds , shots made and missed , fouls and the like — in the context of the racial composition of the three - person crew refereeing that game .
( The N.B.A. did not release its record of calls by specific officials to either Mr. Wolfers , Mr. Price or The Times , claiming it is kept for referee training purposes only . )
Mr. Wolfers said that he and Mr. Price classified each N.B.A. player and referee as either black or not black by assessing photographs and speaking with an anonymous former referee , and then using that information to predict how an official would view the player .
About a dozen players could reasonably be placed in either category , but Mr. Wolfers said the classification of those players did not materially change the study ’s findings .
During the 13 - season period studied , black players played 83 percent of the minutes on the floor .
With 68 percent of officials being white , three - person crews were either entirely white ( 30 percent of the time ) , had two white officials ( 47 percent ) , had two black officials ( 20 percent ) or were entirely black ( 3 percent ) .
Mr. Stern said that the race of referees had never been considered when assembling crews for games .
With their database of almost 600,000 foul calls , Mr. Wolfers and Mr. Price used a common statistical technique called multivariable regression analysis , which can identify correlations between different variables .
The economists accounted for a wide range of factors : that centers , who tend to draw more fouls , were disproportionately white ; that veteran players and All - Stars tended to draw foul calls at different rates than rookies and non-stars ; whether the players were at home or on the road , as officials can be influenced by crowd noise ; particular coaches on the sidelines ; the players ’ assertiveness on the court , as defined by their established rates of assists , steals , turnovers and other statistics ; and more subtle factors like how some substitute players enter games specifically to commit fouls .

Taking a step back to the Magic Prime Type , we find that the pattern that we used to generate the prime type may be useful to encapsulate in some manner .
The pattern goes as follows :
If you have a base class like number , and you have a derived class such as prime , then you can create these " prime like " classes as long as you have a function that returns true for the basic and derived type .
Simply put , if we could just swap different lexical elements into our prime datatype constructor , we could have a useful piece of code for creating exotic types such as the “ even ” type or perhaps the “ catalan ” type .
Obviously , when we talk about placing lexical elements inside of code , we are talking macros !
So what would the Lisp - like macro look like for our “ subtype - with - test ” function ?
Something like the following , only better .
However , if you try to input that into Qi , you ’ll find it will not make a compiling as something seems to happen to the ; .
We need to use the " macroexpand " function mentioned in Appendix B of FPIQ language book .
Fortunately for us , the syntax makes our final Qi macro a bit easier to read than the lisp version .
We first create a pattern that looks like a function call that matches our macro .
We ’ll name it the same as above and it will take the same arguments .
And that ’s all there is to it !
Just remember to make sure to include the X-> X pattern at the bottom .
Every single token receives a macroexpand so we need to ensure that it works as intended for all but our special " subtype - with - test " macro .
Note that the pattern match serves as our macro definition .
We define it in no other place .
Now doing the following creates a brand new type !
We should note that the macroexpanded " subtype - with - test " prevents the evaluation of the 4 inputs .
So we find the typical problem with variable capture .
We do n’t have the ability to name our classes X , A , or B !!!
* laugh *
Not a big loss , but we can modify the code and learn to deal with variable capture .
We do this in the same way we deal with it in Lisp , namely gensyms .
One important point to note is that the " Temp " ( or whatevever you want to name your gensym ) must start in UPPER CASE !
Otherwise , Qi wo n’t be able to tell it is a variable !
Qi does warn about these sorts of issues however , if you see the free variable warning in a macro , capture them with gensyms to turn this sort of output … into this much nicer output …
Note the lack of compiler warnings about free variables .
However it will always warn you about redefining macroexpand .
Of course , since we are defining VARIABLES in the datatype , no real variable capture can happen .
Our macro requires lower case symbols to even operate .
But this example shows how to avoid the issue in the odd case where you want to make a macro that you can define different variable names inside it .
( Can anyone think of a good reason to do this ?
)
So let us try this new macro out !
We ’ll create an even test and create a new type called " even " that can only type to actual even numbers .
I ’d say that is an impressive job for one line of code !
Let me know what you think !

Was Muhammad Ali's " rope - a - dope ' strategy the only dope involved in the " Rumble in the Jungle ? "
George Foreman is n't so sure .
In his recently published memoirs ,
" God in My Corner , " Foreman says he was drugged just before the Oct. 30 , 1974 title fight in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- then known as Zaire .
Foreman , then the world heavyweight champion , was a heavy favorite to beat Ali , the former champion .
But Ali deflected or absorbed Foreman 's punches as he leaned against the ropes , allowing Foreman to tire himself out in the tropical heat .
He knocked Foreman out in the eighth round for the title .
But Foreman , now 58 , says something else tired him .
In his memoirs he says before the fight , his trainer gave him something to drink that tasted like medicine .
" I almost spit it out ... [ I told my trainer ] ' Man , I know this water has medicine in it , ' " Foreman wrote .
" I climbed into the ring with that medicinal taste still lingering in my mouth . "
" After the third round , I was as tired as if I had fought 15 rounds .
What 's going on here ?
Did someone slip a drug in my water ? " he wrote .
The Washington Post reports yet another blatant falsehood put forward by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales :
The Justice Department considered dismissing many more U.S. attorneys than officials have previously acknowledged , with at least 26 prosecutors suggested for termination between February 2005 and December 2006 , according to sources familiar with documents withheld from the public .
Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales testified last week that the effort was limited to eight U.S. attorneys fired since last June , and other administration officials have said that only a few others were suggested for removal .
In fact , D. Kyle Sampson , then Gonzales ’s chief of staff , considered more than two dozen U.S. attorneys for termination , according to lists compiled by him and his colleagues , the sources said .
They amounted to more than a quarter of the nation ’s 93 U.S. attorneys .
Thirteen of those known to have been targeted are still in their posts .

There are precious few things that unite adults today , topics that can serve as table talk for us all .
But a particularly joyful one concerns the advertising campaigns of our youth .
We remember soap ads , candy ads , toothpaste ads , toy ads , and , of course , breakfast food ads .
The breakfast ads were particularly delightful because they were directed at us kids , and they spoke to us in ways our teachers and pastors did not .
These ads came on during kid - show time .
They took us and our tastes seriously .
It was part of growing up , and I ’ve never known anyone to remember those days in any way but fondly .
But thanks to a conspiracy of health Nazis ( this is a particularly apt phrase since the Nazis were pioneers in the art of badgering people over health issues ) , public interest law firms , and government officials , the days of kid- directed advertising for many products is coming to an end .
To those who see conspiracy in every commercial , ads directed toward kids are seen as exploitative and evil , child abuse at the hands of the merchant class .
And you thought they were only trying to sell you a delicious breakfast !
Kellogg ’s has announced that it is caving in to pressure and that the company will end its kid ads for all products that do n’t meet special nutrition guidelines .
Even more egregiously , it will stop branding toys and licensing characters for spinoffs .
No more creating cult figures out of Snap , Crackle , ‘n Pop and the like !
So instead of Tony the Tiger , kids can now look forward to ads for muesli and dried bananas , touted by some tree hugger in a bike helmet .
Let me tell you : kids are n’t stupid .
These days , they are particularly sophisticated about recognizing ads for bogus health food as versus what they really want .
Such changes are invariably described as voluntary , even by the company that wants to be seen as health conscious .
And if they truly were voluntary , who could object ?
If the market has changed , companies must change with it .
That ’s the specialty of business enterprise .
But the fact is that most of these shifts are not voluntary .
They are forced by the government , albeit through the intermediary of the courts and special interest groups who use the courts to shape society to their liking .
What happened was that Kellogg and Viacom were threatened with lawsuits by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a ghastly outfit called the Campaign for Commercial - Free Childhood .
Essentially , the company did n’t want to face a continued PR - meltdown , massive attorney fees , and a possible court loss in light of ridiculous statutes and precedents , so it caved .
This is only the latest sell - out to government .
McDonald ’s , General Mills , and Kraft have all agreed to adhere to some sort of federally approved health standard in their advertising .
So what else does this Childhood Campaign group want ?
According to their website , they " support the rights of children to grow up — and the rights of parents to raise them — without being undermined by rampant consumerism . "
But what is that ?
Well , it turns out to mean essentially any capitalist act .
For example , the group is now railing against Coca - Cola because of a special promotion that will put codes for free ring tones and other neat things inside Sprite bottle tops .
So you buy a Sprite and text the code from your cell phone and get something fun .
Sounds great ?
No , no , no : this is thoroughly evil !
You see , this is only one of a million evil acts by " egregious corporate offenders , " according to their amazing new moral code , which says that anything marketed to children is an offense against all decency .
And children , in this case , are not 3 — 5 - year - olds , but teens and even college kids .
When are you old enough to handle a marketing campaign ?
When and where is it truly okay to say to someone : you will like my product ?
We ca n’t but have a deep suspicion that it is not the corporate world that is using kids , but rather these groups that are putting children up front as archetypes in an overall anti-capitalist campaign against any and all of commercial society .
In other words , precisely who is exploiting kids here ?
After all , the only true way to protect kids against ads is to ban them altogether .
Our grocery stores should look like they did in the old Soviet Union , with brown boxes called names like " soap " and " cereal . "
And as every good socialist knows , the best way to get rid of advertising is to get rid of competition and the need to market anything in the first place .
What a drab and dreary world it would be , not only for kids but for adults too !
Who would conjure up such a vision and imagine it to be a good society ?
Well , the group credits its founding to a conference of academics and policy officials held at Harvard — the would - be central planners of our age .

Six ways to write more comprehensible code
How to keep your code from destroying you
I learned to write , clear , maintainable code the hard way .
For the last twelve years , I 've made my living writing computer games and selling them over the Net using the marketing technique that was once charmingly known as shareware .
What this means is that I start with a blank screen , start coding , and , a few tens of thousands of lines of code later , I have something to sell .
This means that , if I make a stinky mess , I 'm doing it in my own nest .
When I 'm chasing down a bug at 3 a.m. , staring at a nightmare cloud of spaghetti code , and I say , " Dear God , what idiot child of married cousins wrote this garbage ? " , the answer to that question is " Me . "
So I have been well rewarded by learning about good , sane programming techniques .
Some of these practices are described in this article .
Many skilled , experienced , morally upright coders will always know some of this stuff by heart .
All these people will get from this article is a chance to bathe in my delightful prose style and remember how horrible life was before they got the clean code religion .
But there are many who , like me , stumbled into programming in an unexpected or unusual way and never had anyone drill this stuff into them .
These things are basic to many but , to others , they are invaluable techniques that nobody has told them .
So , to those who do n't want to make a mess , this is for you .
The example case
For illustration purposes , our example program throughout this article is a hypothetical computer game called Kill Bad Aliens .
In it , you will control a spaceship .
It will move horizontally back and forth at the bottom of the screen , shooting bullets upwards .
Your ship will be controlled by , say , the keyboard .
Figure 1 .
Our hypothetical game
The game will take place in periods of time called Waves .
During each wave , aliens will appear , one after another , at the top of the screen .
They 'll fly around and drop bombs .
Aliens will appear a fixed period of time apart .
After you kill a certain number of aliens , the Wave ends .
Killing an alien gives you some points .
When you finish a wave , you get a bonus number of points depending on how quickly you finished .
When a bomb hits you , your ship blows up and another appears .
When you are blown up three times , the game is over .
If you got a high score , you are valuable as a person .
If your score is low , you are not .
So you sit down and start to write Kill Bad Aliens in C ++.
You define objects to represent the ship , your bullets , the enemies , and the enemy 's bullets .
You write the code to draw all the objects .
You write the code to move them around as time passes .
You write the game logic , the alien AI , the code to read the user 's will from the keyboard and so on .
Now how do we do this so that , when the game is ready , the code is comprehensible , easily maintained , and , in general , not a mess ?

If you write a procedure , fail to comment it , and return to it a few months later to rework it ( and you will ) , not having comments will cost you time .
And time is your most valuable resource .
Lost time can't ever be replaced .
But commenting , like anything else , is a skill .
You get better with practice .
There is good commenting , and there is bad commenting .
You do n't want to write too much .
Suppose you write comments for a function that , in the future , saves you ten minutes of time understanding your code .
Great .
But suppose your comments are so verbose that it takes five minutes to write them and then , later , five minutes to read them .
Then you 've saved yourself zero time .
Not so good .
You do n't want to write too little , either .
If code goes on for a page or two without something breaking down what 's going on , well , I hope that code is clear as crystal , because otherwise you 're wasting future time .
And you do n't want to comment in stupid ways .
When people first start writing comments , they often get hyper and write things like :
// Now we increase Number_aliens_on_screen by one .
Number_aliens_on_screen = Number_aliens_on_screen + 1 ;
Uhmmm , duh .
If something is so obvious , it does n't need a comment .
And if your code is such a tangle that you need a comment for every single line of it , you 'd probably profit from making it simpler in other ways first .
Comments do n't just save time , they cost it .
They take time to read , and they spread out the actual code on the screen , so you can have less of it on your monitor to inspect at one time .
And , while we 're at it , do n't ever do this :
Short get_current_score ( ) { [ insert a whole bunch of code here . ] return [ some value ] ; //
Now we 're done .
}
Oh ?
We 're done ?
Thanks for letting me know .
That big right bracket and the infinite expanse of empty space beyond really did n't tip me off to that .
And you do n't need a comment before the return statement saying , " Now we return a value , " either .
So , if you are writing code , in the absence of a boss or a company policy telling you what to do , how do you comment it ?
Well , what I do for code I am stuck with maintaining myself is write an introduction .
When I return to a procedure I forgot that I wrote , I want to see an explanation for what is going on .
Once I understand what the machinery is doing , it becomes infinitely easier to understand the actual coding .
This generally involves :
A few sentences before the procedure / function saying what it does .
A description of the values being passed into it .
If a function , a description of what it returns .
Inside the procedure / function , comments that split the code up into shorter tasks .
For chunks of code that seem thorny , a quick explanation of what is happening .
So we need a description at the beginning and a few signposts inside explaining the road taken .
Doing this is very quick , and it saves a ton of time in the long run .
Here is an example from the theoretical Kill Bad Aliens .
Consider the object representing the bullet the player fires .
You will frequently have to call a function to move it upwards and see if it hits anything .
I would probably code it something like this :
// This procedure moves the bullet upwards .
It 's called // NUM_BULLET_MOVES_PER_SECOND
times per second .
It returns TRUE if the // bullet is to be erased ( because it hit a target or the top of the screen ) and FALSE // otherwise .
Boolean player_bullet::move_it( ) { Boolean is_destroyed = FALSE ; // Calculate the bullet 's new position .
[ Small chunk of code . ] //
See if an enemy is in the new position .
If so , call enemy destruction call and // set is_destroyed to TRUE [ small chunk of code ] //
See if bullet hits top of screen .
If so , set is_destroyed to TRUE [ Small chunk of code . ] //
Change bullet 's position .
[ Small chunk of code . ]
Return is_destroyed ; }
If the code is clean enough , this sort of commenting should be sufficient .
And it will save plenty of time the dozen times I return to this function to fix a dumb mistake I made .
Tip 2 : Use #define a lot .
No , a LOT .
Suppose that , in our hypothetical game , we want the player to get ten points when he shoots an alien .
There are two ways to do this .
This is the bad way :
// We shot an alien . Give_player_some_points ( 10 ) ;
This is the good way :
In some global file , do this :
#define POINT_VALUE_FOR_ALIEN
10
Then , when we give up some sweet points , naturally , we 'd write ,
// We shot an alien .
Give_player_some_points ( POINT_VALUE_FOR_ALIEN ) ;
Most programmers know , on some level , to do things like this .
But it requires discipline to do it enough .
Just about every time you define a constant number , you should strongly consider defining it in one central place .
For example , suppose you want the play area to be 800 by 600 pixels .
Be sure to do this :
#define PIXEL_WIDTH_OF_PLAY_AREA
800 #define PIXEL_HEIGHT_OF_PLAY_AREA
600
If , at a later date , you decide to change the size of your game window ( and you very well might ) , being able to change the value in this one spot will save you time twice .
First , you do n't need to search through all of your code for all of the times you said the play area was 800 pixels wide .
( 800 !
What was I thinking ? )
Second , you do n't have to fix the bugs that will invariably be caused by the references you will invariably miss .
When I 'm working on Kill Bad Aliens , I need to decide how many aliens need to be killed to complete a wave , how many aliens will be on screen at once , and how fast they appear .
For example , if I wanted every wave to have the same number of aliens all appearing at the same rate , I might be inclined to write something like this :
#define NUM_ALIENS_TO_KILL_TO_END_WAVE 20 #define MAX_ALIENS_ON_SCREEN_AT_ONCE
5 #define SECONDS_BETWEEN_NEW_ALIENS_APPEARING
3
Pretty clear .
And later , if I think the waves are too short or the time between aliens is too fast , I can tweak these values and instantly rebalance the game .
One nice advantage of setting up the game values like this , by the way , is that the ability to make changes so quickly can be a lot of fun and make you feel like a god .
For example , if you change the above to this :
#define NUM_ALIENS_TO_KILL_TO_END_WAVE 20 #define MAX_ALIENS_ON_SCREEN_AT_ONCE
100 #define SECONDS_BETWEEN_NEW_ALIENS_APPEARING
1
Then you are one recompile away from seeing everything be funny and crazy .
Figure 2 . Kill Bad Aliens before we crank up all of the constants
Figure 3 . Kill Bad Aliens after we crank up all of the constants ( it may not be a good game now , but it 's fun to see )
By the way , you will note that I did not write any comments for the above values .
That is because their meaning is obvious from the variable name .
Which brings us to the next point .
Tip 3 : Do n't use variable names that will mock you .
The overall objective is simple : write code so that , if someone who has no idea what it 's doing reads it , he or she can understand what 's going on as quickly as possible .
One key strategy for achieving this goal is to give your variables , procedures , etc. good , descriptive names .
If someone looks a variable name and goes , " Yeah , I see what that is , " that saves five minutes of searching through the program looking for clues to what the heck incremeter_side_blerfm is supposed to mean .
Look for a good middle balance here .
Give things names that are long and clear enough that you understand what they are , but not so long and awkward that they make the code less readable .
For example , in real life , I probably would n't give constants names as long as I did in the previous section .
I just did that so that you , the reader , would totally understand what they meant without any context .
In the context of the program itself , instead of :
#define MAX_ALIENS_ON_SCREEN_AT_ONCE
5
I would almost undoubtedly write :
# define MAX_NUM_ALIENS
5
Any confusion caused by the shorter name would be cleared up very quickly , and the shorter name would lead to much more readable code .
Now consider the snippet of code I would call very frequently to move all the aliens around the screen .
I would almost undoubtedly write it like this :
// move all the aliens for ( short i = 0 ; I < MAX_NUM_ALIENS ; i++) if ( aliens[i].exists ( ) ) // this alien currently exist ?
aliens[i].move_it( ) ;
Note that the array of all of the aliens is just called aliens .
This is perfect .
It 's exactly descriptive of what I want , but it 's short enough that I can type it a thousand times without going mad .
This is probably an array you 'll be using a LOT .
If you call it something like all_aliens_currently_on_screen , your code will be ten miles longer and less clear because of it .
As well , I simply called the loop variable , without any extra comment , i .
When first getting into the whole descriptive variable name thing , it can be tempting to call it " counter " or something like that .
Not necessary .
The point of naming a variable is to enable the reader to instantly go , " Oh . I know what that does . "
If it 's called " i " , " j " , or so on , everyone knows that 's used for the loop .
No explanation necessary .
Of course , it 's possible to be much more careful about variable naming than this .
For example , there is something called Hungarian Notation .
There are lots of flavors of this , but the basic idea is that you put a tag at the beginning of a variable name saying what type it is .
( So all unsigned long variables begin with ul , etc . )
This is a bit fussier than I like to get , but it 's something you should know about .
It 's possible to spend too much time making things clear , but it takes some effort .
Tip 4 : Do error checking .
You make errors .
Yes , you .
If it 's a decently sized program , it 's going to have a lot of functions and procedures .
As excruciating as it is , every one of them should have a bit of error checking .
When you create your procedure / function , you should always think , " Suppose some malevolent , insane person passed this all sorts of backwards , weird values .
How can this poor , fluffy bit of code defend itself and keep the computer from exploding ? "
Then write your code to check for and protect itself from that weird data .
Here 's an example .
The main goal of our groovy space game is to kill aliens and accumulate points , so we 'll need a procedure to alter the score .
Furthermore , when we add points , we want to call a routine that draws pretty sparkles on the score .
So here 's a first pass :
Void change_score ( short num_points ) { score += num_points ; make_sparkles_on_score ( ) ; }
So far , so good .
Now ask yourself :
What could go wrong here ?
First , an obvious one .
What if num_points is negative ?
Do we want to allow the player 's score to go down ?
Well , we might .
But there is nothing in the description of the game I gave earlier that mentions losing points .
Plus , games should be fun , and losing points is never fun .
So we will say a negative number of points is an error and must be caught .
That one was easy .
But here is a more subtle problem ( and one I deal with in my games all the time ) .
What if num_points is 0 ?
This is a very plausible situation .
Remember , we are giving a bonus at the end of every wave , based on how quickly the player completes it .
What if the player is super slow ?
And we decide to give a bonus of 0 in that situation ?
Then it 's entirely possible , at 3 a.m. , to call change_score and pass a 0 .
The problem here is that we probably do n't want the scoreboard to flash with pretty colors when the number displayed does n't change .
So we want to catch that .
Let 's try this code :
Void change_score ( short num_points ) { if ( num_points < 0 ) { // maybe some error message return ; } score += num_points ; if ( num_points > 0 ) make_sparkles_on_score ( ) ; }
There .
Much nicer .
And note that this was a very simple function .
None of the fancy , newfangled pointers you crazy kids like to use .
If you are passing arrays or pointers , then you REALLY better be watching for errors or bad data .
And the advantages of doing this do n't end at keeping your program from exploding .
Good error checking makes it faster to debug too .
Suppose you know that you are writing data outside the bounds of some array , and you 're going through your code looking for where that might happen .
When you look at a procedure where all of your error checking is in order , you do n't have to spend time picking through it to find the mistake .
This saves tons of time , and it bears repeating .
Time is the most valuable resource we have .
Tip 5 : " Premature optimization is the root of all evil . "
- Donald Knuth
I did n't make up the above sentence .
But you can find it on Wikipedia , so it must be really smart .
Unless you are trying to make people suffer , your first goal , when writing code , should be clarity .
Simple code is faster to write , faster to understand when you return to it later , and faster to debug .
Optimization is the enemy of clarity .
Sometimes , though , you have to optimize .
This is especially true in games .
However , and this is the vital point , you almost never know what you need to optimize until you actually take your functioning code and test it with a profiler .
( A profiler is a program that watches your program and figures out how much time it spends using different calls .
These are awesome programs .
Find one . )
Every time I 've optimized one of my games , I 've invariably been blown away .
The code I was most worried about was always fine .
The code I 'd never thought about was slow .
Because I had no idea what was fast and what was slow , all optimization time I had spent before getting actual data was wasted .
Worse than wasted , in fact , because it tangled up the code .
This is a hard rule to follow .
Heck , if it were easy , it would n't have to be a rule .
Good programmers tend to be offended by clumsy code that could be faster .
But rejoice !
After preaching about how you should spend more time doing this and more time doing that , this is one rare , precious moment when I 'm saying that it 's okay to be lazy !
Write something that is clean and works .
You have all the time in the world to ugly it up with optimization later .
But do n't do it until you 're sure that you 're doing the right thing .
And , speaking of doing things that hurt , here 's one final bit of advice :
Tip 6 : Do n't be too clever by half .
There is something called the IOCCC .
That is , the " International Obfuscated C Code Contest . "
You see , C and C++ , whatever their considerable advantages , lend themselves to writing nightmarishly complicated code .
This contest displays the value of clear code by celebrating the insane .
It 's pretty awesome .
It 's worth a visit to see just how much damage you can do with an encyclopedic knowledge of a programming language , combined with a lack of shame .
If you know enough , you can cram ten lines of code into one line .
All it costs you is a complete inability to quickly fix the bug you put in it .
The lesson here is that if the code you are writing requires detailed knowledge of intricate rules of precedence or inspires you to look in the back chapters of some book to figure out what you 're doing , you are being too clever by half .
Everyone has his or her own tolerance for complexity in code .
I , personally , write my programs like stereotypical old grannies drive .
As far as I 'm concerned , if your C code requires you to know the difference between i++ and ++i , it is too complicated .
You can think I 'm a wimp if you want .
You 're right .
But I spend a lot less time trying to comprehend my code than I would otherwise .
Conclusion
At this point , you may be thinking , " Wow .
That was a big waste of time .
All of this stuff is obvious and everyone knows it .
Why did anyone write all of this ? "
I hope this is what you 're thinking .
Then you 're already smart .
Good for you .
But do n't think that all of this is obvious to everyone .
It 's really not .
Bad code gets written all the time .
But it does n't have to be that way .
If you are trying to wrangle tons of code and keep it from destroying you , I hope that some of this helps .
Keep it simple , keep it clear , and you will save lots of time and screaming .

DRM 's biggest problem is the name , according to HBO chief technology officer Bob Zitter .
The solution , he believes , is simple : change the name to something that sounds a bit more friendly .
" I do n't want to use the term DRM any longer , " Zitter told a panel at the National Cable Television Show in Las Vegas earlier this week , according to Broadcasting & Cable .
Zitter 's suggestion ?
Digital Consumer Enablement , which he believes would more accurately communicate the concept that DRM helps consumers enjoy content in ways previously not possible .
Why stop there ?
How about Happy Fun Content Surprise with a smiling , large - eyed bunny ( think Thumper with an iPod ) as the mascot ?
Think what you want of Zitter 's idea , but it does illustrate the fact that the content creation industry is aware that consumers by and large find DRM distasteful .
Unfortunately , it also reveals the extent to which some elements of the entertainment industry are willing to fool themselves into believing that if it can just sell the concept of DRM in the proper manner , most of the opposition will evaporate .
Zitter 's assertion that DRM enables us " to use content in ways [ we ] have n't before , " is also debatable at best .
While it does enable new business models for the content - creation industry — like selling a DRM - crippled movie download via Wal - Mart that costs the same as a DVD but that can only be watched on a single PC — it really does n't benefit consumers in any meaningful way .
All of the applications Zitter names , like watching TV shows and movies on an iPod , we can do just fine without the " help " of DRM .
In fact , we could do a lot more if it were n't for DRM and the DMCA , which constantly get in the way of both technological innovation and the abilities of consumers to exercise their rights .
The music industry appears to be slowly waking up to the idea that consumers really do n't like DRM : witness EMI 's decision to sell DRM - free music on the iTunes Store and the Barenaked Ladies ' desire for a compulsory music license .
The movie and television industries , however , are still fully behind the concept .
Speaking at a conference in Beverly Hills , MPAA head Dan Glickman swore allegiance to what is apparently the MPAA 's new holy trinity of fair use , interoperability , and DRM .
He wants DRM to work without constricting consumers , to be sure , but its presence is still a requirement .
And no name change will be able to disguise the true intent of DRM : limiting our ability to consume content at the time , place , and on the device of our choosing .
Change the name if you like , but the rotten smell wo n't go anywhere .
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki said Sunday he has ordered a halt to the U.S. construction of a wall that would separate a Sunni enclave from surrounding Shia areas in Baghdad , declaring thereare other ways to protect the neighbourhood .
The announcement came amid criticism at home over the project , and while the beleaguered Shia leader was in Egypt to drum up support from mostly Sunni Arab nations for his efforts to stop the sectarian violence in his country .
The U.S. military announced last week it was building a large concrete wall in the northern Azamiyah section of Baghdad to protect the minority Sunnis from attacks by Shias living nearby .
Residents and Sunni leaders complained the barrier would isolate their community and a large protest was scheduled Monday in the area .
In his first public comments on the issue , al - Maliki said he had ordered the construction to stop .
" I oppose the building of the wall and its construction will stop , " al - Maliki said during a joint news conference with Amr Moussa , the secretary general of the Arab League , in Cairo , Egypt .
" There are other methods to protect neighbourhoods . "
He did not elaborate but added " this wall reminds us of other walls , " in an apparent reference to the one that divided the German city of Berlin during the Cold War .
The U.S. military offered no comment , saying only that the issue would be addressed Monday .
In October , U.S. forces pulled down roadblocks around Baghdad 's eastern slum of Sadr City hours after an order from al - Maliki , who draws key support from the fiery anti-American cleric Muqtada al - Sadr who has made the neighbourhood a stronghold .
Earlier Sunday , the Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party denounced the wall 's construction .
" Dividing the capital of Iraq in this way will be the starting point for dividing Iraq at the pretext of imposing law and security , " it said .
Last week , the military said in a statementthat U.S. soldiers had begun building afive - kilometre wall to protect the minority community on the eastern side of the Tigris River .
Gated community
The wall would turn Azamiyah into a gated community withtraffic control points manned by Iraqi soldiers , it said , stressing that the decision had been made in co-ordination with the Iraqis .
It said the concrete wall , including barriers as tall as 3.6 metres " is one of the centrepieces of a new strategy by coalition and Iraqi forces to break the cycle of sectarian violence " in Baghdad .
U.S. and Iraqi forces have long erected cement barriers around marketplaces and coalition bases and outposts in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities , such as Ramadi in an effort to prevent attacks , including suicide car bombs .
American forces also have constructed huge sand barriers around towns such as Tal Afar , an insurgent stronghold near the Syrian border .
But many residents were alarmed by the plan , and said they had not been consulted .
" This will make the whole district a prison .
This is collective punishment on the residents of Azamiyah , " said Ahmed al - Dulaimi , a 41 - year - old engineer who lives in the area .
Scientists have named a prime suspect in the mysterious case of the missing mammals .
The reason history is littered with suspiciously regular extinctions is all down to the Earth 's wobbly orbit , according to research published today .
Apart from mass extinctions caused by asteroids thumping into the planet and other cataclysmic natural events , records reveal that mammal species die out anyway , usually 2.5 m years after they first emerge .
Palaeontologists have struggled to explain it , with some blaming competition with neighbouring creatures and others suspecting dramatic swings in climate .
After examining the remains of 80,000 fossilised teeth from 132 different rodents that span a 22 million - year period , Jan van Dam at Utrecht University in the Netherlands believes he has the answer .
He conducted detailed analyses of the fossil fragments , which were excavated from four pristine sites throughout Spain , to work out when each species emerged and when they became extinct .
The study , which focused on rodents because they are easily identified from their dental remains , included fossils of squirrels , mice , beavers , voles and hamster - like rodents , dating to between 24.5 m and 2.5 m years ago and only a few of which survive today .
Dr van Dam correlated the results with natural cycles in the Earth 's orbit and found that every 2.4 m years there was a flurry of both mammal extinctions and new species .
The extinctions coincided with a cycle that sees the Earth 's orbit vary from almost perfectly circular to elliptical .
Another cycle of extinctions and emerging species overlapped with changes in the tilt of the Earth 's axis , which occur every 1 m years .
The axis today stands at 23 degrees to the vertical .
Writing in the journal Nature today , Dr van Dam says that when the Earth is in a very circular orbit the climate is less changeable , and summer heat will be less extreme .
The more mild weather encourages glaciers to grow down from the poles , and causes a drop in ocean levels and changes to rainfall .
" The ice expansion affects the global climate via atmospheric and oceanic currents , " Dr van Dam said .
The climatic upheaval put pressure on mammals by wiping out food sources and fragmenting their habitats .
For some species , the change in climate is enough to wipe them out , while others , by being forced to live in smaller , isolated communities , are likely to become new species , Dr van Dam claims .
The evidence that the planet 's wobbly orbit is to blame for mammals ' 2.5 m - year lifespan is " a crucial missing piece in the puzzle " , said Dr van Dam .

A school has admitted handing out 345 morning - after pills to teenage girls without telling their parents .
The figure for contraceptives distributed at Lutterworth Grammar School and Community College over four years is believed to be the highest in England and Wales .
Parents and family groups were outraged at the " disgusting " and " wicked " scheme which they say encourages promiscuity and could put children at risk of contracting sexually - transmitted diseases .
A female GP attends the school , in Leicesterfar - shire , two lunchtimes a week , while the school nurse is present on a further two days a week .
Both are able to prescribe the morning - after pill .
A source at the school said the service was brought in at the suggestion of a local doctors ' surgery four years ago .
It is " strictly confidential " - so parents are not told if contraceptives are given out unless their daughters confide in them .
The policy of dishing out free contraceptives to schoolchildren without telling their parents is a key plank of Labour 's teenage pregnancy strategy .
Ministers launched it with great fanfare in 2000 following concerns over Britain 's teenage pregnancy rate - the highest in Europe .
The strategy aims to cut the number of under - 18 conceptions by 50 per cent by 2010 .
Currently , around one in three pupils has access to condoms and emergency contraception without their parents ' knowledge at sexual health clinics in secondary schools .
But pregnancy rates are still going up .
Official figures show pregnancies among under - 18s rose in 2005 to 39,683 - up from 39,593 in 2004 and much higher than the 35,400 recorded in 1995 .
Despite its name , the Lutterworth school is a Church of England voluntary - controlled comprehensive .
Its 1960s campus dominates the affluent market town .
The school has 1,900 pupils aged 14 - 19 .
More than a third - 686 - are in the sixth form , which may go some way to explaining the high number of morning - after pills given out .
One 16 - year - old pupil , who would not be identified , said : " You can go and see the nurse at lunch or break .
You can get bags of condoms or the morning - after pill if you need it .
As far as the students are concerned , it 's no big deal .
People can go on a daily basis .
Quite a few of my friends go - it 's pretty popular . "
Her 42 - year - old father said : " A lot of parents will be shocked , not knowing if their children have had these pills .
To be honest , to hear about this is disgusting .
I did n't know this sort of thing was going on . "
The girl 's mother , also 42 , said : " This service says to the children that they can go and have sex - and that concerns me .
The morning - after pill means unprotected sex .
" If you have unprotected sex then you are putting yourself at risk not just of getting pregnant but of catching sexually - transmitted diseases . "
Family campaigners joined the attack on the school and the Government 's teenage pregnancy strategy .
Stephen Green , national director of Christian Voice , called the school 's actions " thoroughly irresponsible , arrogant and wicked " , claiming they will expose girls to the risk of infertility brought on by sexually - transmitted diseases .
" It will simply encourage schoolchildren into promiscuity , " he said .
" When are people going to learn that throwing contraceptives at children only increases the rate of teenage pregnancy ? "
Norman Wells , of the pressure group Family and Youth Concern , pointed to 23 studies from ten countries which found that increased access to the morning - after pill had made no difference to unintended pregnancy and abortion rates .
He said schools should start teaching abstinence rather than handing out contraceptives .
" In divorcing sex from marriage in our thinking and teaching , we have cheapened it and reduced it to a casual recreational activity , " he said .
Head Edwin de Middelaer said : " Our sixth form is the size of most schools so that may explain these figures to some degree .
" Although they are surprising , we think this healthcare provision is the right thing for the school to do .
We have had no complaints from parents . "

It lurks in your cupboards , your cereal , bread , pasta and chips .
It 's in your refrigerator , in your cheese , condiments , yogurt , sausages , ice cream .
It 's in those M&M 's by the desk , probably in the latte you 're drinking right now .
It 's soy , and it's now in almost every single processed food we buy at supermarkets and health food stores .
As America 's favorite " health food , " it promises to make us skinny and lower our cholesterol , prevent cancer and reduce menopausal symptoms , put us in a better mood , give us energy .
It 's the cheap and guilt - free source of protein for millions of vegetarians , the " heart smart " option for carnivores , the infant formula du jour for eco-minded moms .
Soy has become one of the America 's biggest industries .
And it may be making us sicker than we 've ever been .
Or so alleges Kaayla Daniel , author of " The Whole Soy Story : The Dark Side of America 's Favorite Health Food , " an anti-soy treatise released in 2005 by New Trends Publishing .
" People are just starting to wake up to this , to just how serious this all is , " says Daniel , who earned her doctorate at the Union Institute and works as a certified nutritionist .
" So far , if you look at the studies , you 'll start to see that there are only possible benefits of this food , and proven dangers . "
For Daniel , the problem exists in the soybean itself , a legume that by nature is chock full of antinutrients and toxins to ward off predators .
If eaten in small amounts ( say , a few tablespoons every couple of days ) these toxins pose no real harm .
The trouble occurs when we consume more than 35 grams of soy a day -- a quantity Daniel argues is easily reachable in our modern diet so crammed with soy meats , soy extenders , soy protein and soy emulsifiers , substances so full of estrogens , metals , sugars and additives , so " toxic , " that they are posing considerable risks to our collective physical and mental health .
It 's an extreme accusation , one that fits easily in the sidebars of alternative medicine weeklies or alarmist blogs of health nuts .
( You can just see them wagging an " I told you so " finger as they smugly eat homegrown wheat bulgur from a worn wooden bowl . )
But lately it 's not just Daniel and off - the - grid hippies spouting the rues of soy -- governments have piped in .
The French Center for Cancer Research has stated that soy products in no amount should be eaten by children under 3 years of age or women with or at risk of breast cancer .
The Israeli Health Ministry issued a public warning on soy , claiming that consumption of soy be limited in young children and avoided , if possible , in infants .
The American Heart Association has backtracked on its endorsement of soy .
Is this the beginning of the end of the " soy revolution ? "
History of the " Wonder Bean "
The Chinese have prized the soybean for thousands of years as a fertilizer , a " green manure , " but it was n't until they learned to ferment it around 500 B.C. that they considered it suitable for human consumption .
Fermenting the bean into foods like miso , tempeh and natto removed toxins and phytic acid ( which can interfere with the absorption of minerals ) and made soy more easily digestible -- all benefits that ordinary cooking could not accomplish .
These " traditional " fermented soy foods , along with ( unfermented ) tofu , spread throughout Asia and still constitute about 90 percent of the soybeans consumed in Asia today .
Soy 's first major U.S. advocate was John Harvey Kellogg , the cereal tycoon , who saw the bean as a path to health , and incorporated it into cereals and meat substitutes .
Soon , Henry Ford , the auto tycoon , latched on , believing soy would be the industrial material of the future , molded into everything from car bodies to window frames , steering wheels to refrigerators .
By 1933 , Ford had spent $ 1.2 million on soy research , built a car trunk of soy and was sporting stylish ( though itchy ) soybean fiber suits .
Though his enthusiasm for the bean made good fodder for the press and furthered his public image as a complete kook , it did little to ignite the public 's interest .
It was n't until after the 1940s that soy would truly define itself in the U.S. diet and economy .
As soybean oil production ramped up after World War II , so did the mounds of soy " waste " left over from the oil extraction process .
Though most of this waste soy meal was used for animal feed , some of it made inroads into the human food chain in the form of cheap soy protein isolate , textured vegetable protein and soy flour , which commercial food producers started using as a cheap " extender " in everything from canned tuna to ravioli .
For American industry , the age - old Asian method of using the whole soybean and fermenting it to remove its toxins took too long and the end product was often dull and tasteless .
To speedily process soy " waste " into soy protein products , U.S. soy producers washed beans with alkaline , heated and pressure - cooked them , combatting their naturally bitter taste with sugar and infusing them with additives to prevent spoiling .
This process greatly improved flavor but removed many of the beneficial nutrients .
Daniel argues that it also left in , and introduced , many harmful toxins .
Soy products exploded in popularity after the FDA approved the health claim in November 1999 that allows food processors to label many soy products with the phrase : " Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 25 grams of soy protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease . "
No longer the cheap filler , the dirty word buried in the fine print of ingredients , soy soon became a cover star , a selling point for the health - minded and cost - minded alike .
Soon , markets were flooded with a gaggle of new - fangled soy - based products : soy pastas , soy energy bars , soy breads , soy pretzels and on and on .
While upscale consumers were now buying soy products at a premium , the general population was consuming even more cheap hydrogenated soy oil in the form of processed foods without even knowing it .
By 2004 , 80 percent of all vegetable oils would come from soybeans , and almost every single processed food would contain soy .
In that year also , U.S. soy farmers produced their biggest soy crop to date -- 85 million metric tons grown on more than 46,000 square miles of farmland ( imagine an area the size of West Virginia -- then double it ) .
Soy is now one of the fastest growing sectors in the food industry , with retail sales growing from $ 853 million in 1992 to more than $ 4 billion in 2004 .
Health : Can Soy Help or Hurt ?
With the glut of soy products hitting the shelves of supermarkets , a glut of soy diet books took over the shelves of the bookstore .
The most famous , " The Soy Zone , " published in 2000 by Zone Diet author Barry Sears , boasts his soy - based diet is the " healthiest diet in the world ! " and suggests eating from 50 to 100 grams of soy products a day -- four times the FDA recommended amount .
But recently , a number of articles and reports have suggested that the soy health claim may not only be misdirected , it may be completely false .
Daniel claims research proves that eating 45 grams a day ( about three - quarters of a cup of tofu , for instance ) in a month causes changes in the menstrual cycle of women .
Eating as little as 35 grams a day ( just 10 grams over the FDA recommended amount ) has been proven to cause thyroid function suppression within three months in healthy adult men and women .
The problem lies in the isoflavones , a " phytoestrogen , " and goitrogen ( a substance that may cause thyroid enlargement and formation of a goiter ) that occur naturally in the soybean .
In most soy foods , eating 35 grams of soy means you 're also eating 35 milligrams of isoflavones .
Some soy foods contain higher isoflavones - per - soy - gram ratios , such as soy milk , which includes only 7 grams of soy protein but a whopping 33 milligrams of isoflavones per 8 - ounce serving .
With a sip more over this amount , Daniel alleges , you risk proven negative effects on the thyroid .
She quotes a controversial letter written by Daniel Doerge and Daniel Sheehan .
Doerge and Sheehan , both senior FDA food scientists , wrote to Health and Human Services denouncing the FDA 's soy health claim and arguing that many of the thyroid - related problems with isoflavones were being ignored .
An extract from the letter reads : " We oppose this health claim because there is abundant evidence that some of the isoflavones found in soy , including genistein and equol , a metabolite of daidzen , demonstrate toxicity in estrogen sensitive tissues and in the thyroid .
This is true for a number of species , including humans ... .
Thus , during pregnancy in humans , isoflavones per se could be a risk factor for abnormal brain and reproductive tract development .
" Additionally , isoflavones are inhibitors of the thyroid peroxidase which makes T3 [ triiodothyronine ] and T4 [ thyroxine ] .
Inhibition can be expected to generate thyroid abnormalities , including goiter and autoimmune thyroiditis .
There exists a significant body of animal data that demonstrates goitrogenic and even carcinogenic effects of soy products .
Moreover , there are significant reports of goitrogenic effects from soy consumption in human infants and adults . "
Daniel makes the connection that as the consumption of soy foods has steadily increased , so have overall thyroid cancer problems -- more than 42 percent more thyroid cancer incidences have been identified between 1975 and 1996 .
She cites , among other research , a Japanese study by a leading thyroid clinic in 1991 claiming that isoflavones adversely affect the thyroid 's function , and after a long duration have caused thyroid suppression and sometimes thyroid enlargement .
In the May - June 2000 issue of FDA Consumer , a publication released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , author John Henkel states that animal studies , some of which date back to 1959 , link soy isoflavones to possible thyroid disorders such as goiter .
A 1997 study in Biochemical Pharmacology identified that genistein and daidzein ( isoflavones in soy ) may prompt goiter and autoimmune disorders of the thyroid .
( Critics suggest that the cause may be due instead to iodine deficiency . )
Even bullish soy enthusiast Barry Sears steers clear of isoflavones , claiming that one - third of his soy - heavy diet program should include soy - based meat substitutes , which he claims can be free of isoflavones .
He states on his Web site : " I personally feel that once you consume more than 50 mg per day of isoflavones , potential problems may occur in some individuals . "
Though other environmental harms such as radiation , mercury , chlorine , plastics and pesticides have been implicated in causing thyroid disorders , Daniel argues the research shows that the overconsumption of isoflavones in soy products has significantly contributed to thyroid disorders that , according to Dr. Ridha Arem , clinical professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , and author of " The Thyroid Solution , " are now shared by more than 20 million Americans .
" Shame on you for even talking to her ! " says Dr. Mark Messina , adjunct professor of nutrition at Loma Linda University in Southern California , and author of the pro-soy book " The Vegetarian Way : Total Health for You and Your Family . "
" Here is a person with a mail - order Ph.D. , without one paper in a peer review publication , trying to promote a book of quasi- science . "
( Daniel fervently defends her Ph.D. , which she received at the University of Cincinnati , Ohio , and Union Institute .
Though both are accredited universities , the latter is a distance learning - based institution . )
" If you want some real perspective , " Messina snaps , " look at 70 years of studies , clinical trials , talk to real scientists , look at the thousands of real research trials done on this stuff .
It 's the thousands of positive trials that never get attention -- only the ones that are different from everything else that the media clings on to . "
Messina , who also consults for the soy industry , co-authored a recent report on the effect of isoflavones on thyroid function in the 2006 issue of the medical journal , Thyroid .
In it , he reviewed 14 trials in which the effects of soy foods or isoflavones on at least one measure of thyroid function was assessed in various presumably healthy subjects .
With only one exception , either no effects or only very modest changes were noted in these trials .
His conclusion : Neither healthy adults nor those with hypothyroid conditions need avoid soy foods .
" The points Kaayla is making are based on semi- science , " Messina says .
" This is a person who mixes citations from patients with scientific data in her book . . . that 's just , it 's , reprehensible ! "
But the mounting apprehension about soy within world health organizations is hard to shake .
In the January 2006 issue of the journal Circulation , the American Heart Association announced that soy has little effect on cholesterol and is unlikely to prevent heart disease .
Before that , in October of 2005 , the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported that most of the research carried out on soy and menopause to date is " inconclusive , " of " poor quality " and " too short duration . "
In October 2005 , the Journal of the American Dietetic Association reported that the studies on soy and cancer are inconsistent and that high soy consumption might actually increase breast cancer risk .
" You have to understand , we 've never said ( soy ) is some magic bullet , " says Nancy Chapman , executive director of the Soyfoods Association of North America , a lobbying leg of the soy industry .
" The terminology turnaround is a media description .
The advice still at the end of the day is that nobody is saying stop eating soy , nobody is saying soy is unsafe . "
But that 's exactly what the Israeli Health Ministry decreed in July 2005 when they issued a public warning about eating large amounts of soy , notifying day care centers and schools , demanding that they limit soy to no more than one serving per day and no more than three times per week .
In March 2005 , the French Center for Cancer Research stated that soy products in no amount should be eaten by children under 3 years of age , children treated for hypothyroiditis , women with a history of breast cancer and / or history of familial breast cancer .
Soy products in France must now carry warning labels .
" Did you talk to the people in Israel ?
Did you talk to the French ? " asks Chapman .
" The French had no nutritionist on the panel , they had no panel review , there were no soy experts , it was based on research doing injections of genisteine into the backs of rats . . . studies have shown you can't make conclusions ( from animal research ) on human subjects -- this is extraordinarily important for people to understand ! "
Messina also voiced concerns over warnings by Israel and France .
" When world health organizations get involved , I admit , that lends an air of legitimacy to this argument , but I still think they 've jumped the gun , " he says .
" The ( American ) National Institute of Health concluded that isoflavones ... they were of negligible concern , because exposure was so low , they said there was no evidence it was harmful .
Consider , too , we 're a bigger country here , and the NIH has more scientists than these other countries . "
The NIH has no official stance on the benefits or risks of soy , saying , " The NIH does n't make statements , we fund and make research available , then allow that research to speak for itself . "
What the research says is listed in the August 2005 report , " Effects of Soy on Health Outcomes , an Evidence Report / Technology Assessment by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , " an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services .
The report looked at the effects of soy on cholesterol , menopause , endocrine function , cancer and tumors and bone health .
Three - quarters of the trials used soy supplements ; soy foods were used in the remaining trials .
Among the soy supplement trials , 57 percent used soy protein with isoflavones , 36 percent used isoflavones alone , and 6 percent soy protein without isoflavones .
Total isoflavones ranged from 0 mg to 185 mg per day , and the total protein intake from soy ranged from 0 g to 154 g per day .
The outcome of all trials was , according to the report , " no conclusive evidence of a dose - response effect for either soy protein or isoflavone .
However , for LDL reduction , there is a suggestion of a possible dose - response effect for soy protein . "
So , the news ?
There was no news , but there were some interesting side effects .
More than 3,000 subjects in 49 studies reported adverse events that were " gastrointestinal in nature . "
Fifteen studies reported " menstrual complaints . "
Other " adverse events " including complaints of headache , dizziness and rashes .
The report concludes with the generic ( though creepy ) quasi - disclaimer : " There were a limited number of studies with duration of 1 year or longer ; thus the long - term adverse effect of soy in a large population is uncertain . "
The Soy Infant Formula Dilemma
Soy infant formula is currently given to up to 25 percent of bottle - fed infants in the United States , a higher percentage than anywhere in the world .
Of the laundry list of dangers pointed out by Daniel based on studies at the University of Irvine and other universities , the manganese levels of soy infant formula are perhaps the most alarming .
Soy is naturally high in manganese , which does not pose a problem for children and adults , but raises serious concerns for infants who , with immature livers , cannot process it safely .
Per liter , breast milk contains 3 to 10 ug ( parts per million ) of manganese to soy formula 's 200 to 300 ug .
Daniel claims newborns exposed to such high level of manganese are vulnerable to " brain damage associated with learning disabilities , attention deficit and other behavioral disorders , and violent tendencies . "
Soy formula also contains levels of aluminum -- a result of washing the beans in huge aluminum caldrons -- 10 times greater than milk - based formula and 100 times greater than breast milk .
High levels of aluminum have been linked to dementia , memory loss , confusion , disorientation , loss of coordination and digestive problems .
But worst of all , according to Daniel , soy formulas contain extremely high levels of isoflavones -- the same agent supposedly contributing to thyroid malfunction .
As a result , babies fed soy - based formula have 13,000 to 22,000 times more estrogen compounds in their blood than babies fed milk - based formula -- the estrogenic equivalent of at least five birth control pills per day .
It 's the extremely high levels of estrogen that Daniel claims could at least be partly responsible for the recent and rampant premature sexual development of girls .
Almost 15 percent of white girls and 50 percent of African American girls show signs of puberty such as breast development and pubic hair before age 8 .
Some girls are showing sexual development before age 3 .
( Daniel claims that soy formula is heavily targeted to blacks , Asians and American Indians because many infants of these races are presumed lactose intolerant , and thus many of them start on soy formula outright .
Most Caucasians start out with a dairy formula but switch to soy if there are any problems . )
" The chances that the amount of estrogen in soy formula is going to affect a child later in life , I find that hard to swallow , " says Dr. Michelle Barratt , associate professor of pediatrics at University of Texas Medical School .
" I like what Kenneth Setchell ( professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio ) said about it in the June 2002 issue of Environmental Health Perspectives ( a peer - reviewed journal of the United States ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ) . "
Barratt reads from the article , " When we 've had so many infants raised on soy formula and we have n't really seen these horrendous effects that people keep saying these compounds cause , then there 's probably no reason for concern .
However , I accept that the lack of evidence is not evidence for the lack of effect . "
Along with the American Academy of Pediatrics , where she serves on the committee on adolescence , Barratt supports soy formula as a safe and effective alternative for infants -- but not in excess .
" I think the bottom line is to use moderation , and whenever possible , I always suggest breast milk as the best formula .
But , as far as soy formula causing premature puberty in girls , or delaying puberty in boys , I just do n't think that 's correct . "
Spurred by ongoing concerns over soy infant formula , an independent panel of 14 scientists met in March to decide whether soy formula was hazardous to human development .
This panel looked at two reports ( one on soy infant formula , the other on genistein ) , which consisted of data from hundreds of studies .
Except for one doctor , the panel concluded that soy formula was safe .
Dr. Ruth Etzel remained apprehensive , saying soy formula might possibly affect brain and reproductive system development .
" I 'm not an expert in infant nutrition , " says Messina .
" But I 'm impressed by the fact that over a 40 - year period , 20 million infants fed soy formula without case reports in medical literature -- I personally would n't have a problem with an infant consuming soy formula . "
Daniel counters : " Given the facts , and the risk , and there are proven risks , I do n't know who would want to take the chance . "
Whatever Happened to Moderation ?
How did we ingrain into our collective ethos that if a little of something is good for you , then a lot must be really good for you ?
The road of excess may lead to the palace of wisdom but there 's wisdom in the saying , Everything in moderation .
And now we 're at nutritional extremes :
One - half of us tries to cheat ourselves by doing too much for too long , the other half lazes idly by doing not enough for too little .
Critics pick sides to sell books and make headlines .
Those in the middle might try to filter the results , but through the constant white noise of bickering the only voices that come through are distorted .
What happened to the voices of ( unsponsored , un - self - promoting , unaffiliated ) reason , of temperance , of moderation ?
Marion Nestle is the noted author of " Food Politics and What to Eat , " a decidedly moderate voice in the nutrition wars , neither a soy lobbyist nor a detractor .
Her unbiased , no - nonsense nutritional advice is trusted by hundreds of thousands of Americans .
Can she clear this up ?
" I think overall the research on soy is really uncompelling , " Nestle says .
" What the data shows is that if there is harm from soy , it is very small ; and if there are benefits , they are also very small .
That means the data revolves around zero .
And the FDA health claim was on soy ... I think it was way out of line .
Foods are n't medicines ! "
" People do n't have to eat soy if they do n't want to ! "
Nestle says .
" To figure you have to eat it for any reason makes no sense to me at all -- nobody needs to eat this stuff to be healthy . "
London bomb suspect arrested Three women arrested suspected of ' harboring offenders '
Police on Wednesday released this photo of a man wanted in connection with the bombing attempts .

Acts of terror London or or Create Your Own LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Police on Wednesday arrested one of the four men they believe responsible for last week 's attempted bombings of London 's mass transit system , the head of Britain 's anti-terror police branch said .
Yasin Hassan Omar , a 24 - year - old Somali with British residency , was arrested early Wednesday morning in Birmingham , England 's second largest city about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) north of London .
Police allege that Omar , 24 , was the would - be bomber of the city 's Warren Street Underground station .
Omar , who was alone , resisted arrest and was subdued after police used a Taser " stun gun , " said Peter Clarke , head of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch .
No gunshots were fired , police said .
Three other men were arrested elsewhere in Birmingham around the same time at 4:30 a.m. ( 11:30 p.m. ET Tuesday ) , police said .
" This , of course , is an important development in the investigation , " Clarke said .
" However , I must stress how important it is for the public to remain watchful and alert .
We are still looking for the other three men whose pictures we released , " Clarke said , referring to the other suspected bombers .
Wednesday night , police released a new picture of another of the suspected bombers .
He is believed to have tried to set off a device at Shepherd 's Bush Underground station .
He and the would - be bomber of the city 's Oval Station have not yet been identified by police .
Clarke said a previously released picture of the Shepherd 's Bush suspect was taken at Westbourne Park Underground station .
In it , he is wearing a dark blue short - sleeve England soccer shirt and dark trousers .
Police said they believe that after running from that station , he threw the shirt away on McFarlane Road near Wood Lane about 12:30 p.m .
The latest picture shows him on a No. 220 bus wearing a white tank top with dark trousers .
Police believe he got on the bus on Wood Lane about 1:20 p.m. and stayed until the end of the route at Mapleton Road - Wandsworth , Clarke said .
He got off the bus at 2:07 p.m. near Garratt Lane , close to the Arndale Centre .
" We need to know where he went when he got off the bus , " Clarke said .
" Until these men are arrested , they remain a threat , " he said .
When shown the image on a laptop computer , several neighbors of an apartment in Stockwell raided by police Wednesday night said they recognized the man in the tank top .
" I 'm 100 percent sure , 110 percent , " one man told CNN .
During the search of the ground - floor apartment in the Stockwell neighborhood , police arrested three woman on suspicion of " harboring offenders " in connection with the July 21 attempted bombings .
They were taken to a police station in central London , where they remained in custody , Scotland Yard said .
The raid in South London was near the Stockwell Underground station where three of the four bombers boarded their trains .
Omar a resident since 1992 A nationwide manhunt has been under way since the July 21 partial detonations of backpack bombs in London .
The attacks were similar to those on July 7 that killed 52 commuters and the four bombers .
Both attacks targeted three underground trains and a double - decker bus .
In closed - circuit television images from July 21 that were released by police , Omar is wearing a blue shirt as he jumps the turnstile to flee the Warren Street station , minutes after the backpack bomb failed to fully detonate .
Omar came from Somalia in 1992 and is a legal permanent resident of Britain , the Home Office said .
Although intelligence suggested that no explosives were in the house where Omar was arrested , about 100 nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution , Clarke said .
Andy Wilkinson , a neighborhood resident , told the UK's Press Association he saw a dark - skinned man with curly hair being led away from a nearby residence in a white forensic suit and plastic handcuffs .
" It was about 10 past five and all we could hear was a right racket -- people trying to break a door down , " Wilkinson said .
" I looked out of the window and the road was full of armed police and they had got the road closed off . "
Omar was taken to the high - security Paddington Green police station in London .
The three other men were arrested more than three kilometers ( two miles ) away .
They were held in a local police station .
Police said Wednesday that one of five men previously arrested in London since July 21 -- none of them identified as key suspects -- had been released from Paddington Green .
He was picked up Friday in a raid in Stockwell .
The other four men were also detained after a series of raids across London in the days after Thursday 's incidents .
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was " greatly heartened " by the arrests in Birmingham , which he called " an important development . "
Eritrean suspect identified
In addition to Omar , police have identified one other suspected bomber , Muktar Said Ibrahim .
Ibrahim 's family in London provided police with information that led to his identification and called on fellow citizens to do the same .
Ibrahim , 27 , arrived from Eritrea in 1990 , and became a British citizen in 2003 , according to the Home Office .
He is suspected of targeting a double - decker bus in the city 's East End .
Residents of a north London building apartment raided Monday by Metropolitan Police said Omar and Ibrahim lived together .
The raided apartment has been registered for the past six years to Omar , who until recently received a $ 550 monthly housing subsidy from the government .
Anti-terrorist officers also searched and conducted forensic examinations at two other residences in north London Wednesday , according to a police statement .
There were no arrests .
One of the residences is in the same neighborhood where police Tuesday impounded a white Volkswagen as part of the July 21 probe .
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair said Tuesday the July 21 bombs , which failed to explode , were just as powerful as the July 7 ones , but there was " no direct link at the moment " between the two groups of attackers .
The July 7 bombings were carried out by three British - born Muslims of Pakistani heritage who hailed from the city of Leeds , about a three - hour drive north of London , and a fourth British citizen , a Muslim convert of Jamaican birth who lived closer to London .
Three of the July 7 bombers traveled to the city from Luton in north London , and five days later police found more than a dozen unexploded bombs in a car at the Luton train station , two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN .
