Children have long been caught up in Sri Lanka 's conflict
A senior UN official said there was " credible evidence " that troops had rounded up children to fight with the renegade rebel group led by Col Karuna .
His faction split from the Tamil Tigers , long accused of using children .
Sri Lankan security forces say they are " perturbed " by the " completely misleading " allegations .
A Karuna spokesman also denied the allegations , saying his group merely offered protection to children fleeing fighting with the rival Tamil Tigers .
Complicity
But Allan Rock , a special adviser to the UN representative for children and armed conflict , said government forces had forcibly rounded up young Tamil children to fight with Col Karuna 's group .
" We encountered both direct and indirect evidence of ... complicity and participation , " he said of the government security services .
Sri Lankan security forces rounded up children to be recruited by the Karuna faction
Allan Rock , UN official
Child soldiers : Your views Death and discipline Analysis : Child soldiers
The BBC's Dumeetha Luthra , in Colombo , says the allegation , the first of its kind made by the UN against the Sri Lankan military , follows a 10 - day fact - finding mission .
The army has long denied allegations that it actively supports the efforts of the rebel faction led by Col Karuna , following his split from the Tamil Tigers in 2004 .
' Corroding law '
Mr Rock spoke of 13 and 14 - year - old children being kidnapped from villages , and no arrests or investigation being carried out by the security forces .
He said there was both eyewitness and anecdotal evidence to back up his claims .
In a statement the Sri Lankan Armed forces said Mr Rock 's claims that government troops were actively involved in the recruitment of child soldiers were " regrettable " .
" Security forces ... vehemently deny having any involvement whatsoever with the LTTE breakaway group for abductions in Batticaloa . "
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse has promised a full investigation into the allegations .
Mr Rock said the fact that Sri Lankan troops were complicit in the recruitment of child soldiers meant that Tamil Tiger rebels would continue to do so , as it corroded the rule of law .
At least 2,000 people have been killed in violence this year in Sri Lanka , the military and ceasefire monitors say .
The Tamil Tigers are fighting for an independent homeland in the north and east of the country , and claim that ethnic Tamils have suffered decades of discrimination at the hands of Sri Lanka 's Sinhalese majority .
Study : Chemotherapy can alter brain by killing cells Doctors once dismissed complaints of " chemobrain , " a common side effect of cancer therapy in which patients experience memory problems or mental fuzziness .
Research now shows that chemotherapy can cause real changes in the brain , ranging from forgetfulness to seizures , vision loss and even dementia .
More than 80 % of cancer patients develop memory and concentration problems , according to a study in June from the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York .
In a paper in today 's Journal of Biology , scientists found that even low levels of chemotherapy can kill brain cells .
The study showed that cancer drugs were even more toxic to healthy cells than to malignant ones , says Mark Noble , a professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center .
Noble tested three common chemo drugs — cisplatin , cytarabine and carmustine — on rats and in human cells in lab dishes .
Chemo killed 40 % to 80 % of cancer cells , but 70 % to 100 % of healthy brain cells .
Some of the normal cells continued to die for several weeks after treatment , according to the study , funded by the National Institutes of Health and the James P. Wilmot Foundation .
Significantly , chemo killed not just rapidly dividing cells — the typical target of cancer therapy — but brain cells that were n't reproducing , including those responsible for creating the insulation around nerve cells , Noble says .
This insulation is important because it helps nerve signals travel quickly .
Other recent studies also document chemo's effects on the brain .
In a study to be published in January in Cancer , researchers studying breast cancer patients found that chemo may temporarily shrink certain brain areas .
And in a small study published last month in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment , Daniel Silverman of the University of California - Los Angeles found that women with chemobrain symptoms had changes in the functioning of their brain 's frontal cortex .
Silverman , head of UCLA 's neuronuclear imaging section , says Noble 's paper does n't definitively prove that killing brain cells causes cognitive problems .
He says something else may actually cause chemobrain .
To really prove the connection between chemobrain and cell death , Silverman says , researchers should repeat the experiments , but also test the lab rats to see if those who lost brain cells have more trouble than others on intelligence tests .
But Patricia Duffner , a professor at the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute at the University of Buffalo , says Noble 's study is " likely to act as a wake - up call . "
Doctors have long recognized that radiation can damage the brain , says Duffner , who wrote a review accompanying Noble 's article .
She says researchers should look more closely at ways to protect the brain from chemotherapy .
" It was imperative to define the problem , " Noble says .
" Now it is imperative to find ways to treat it . "
On his CNN TV program , Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post interviewed Thomas Ricks , the Post 's Pentagon reporter and author of the book Fiasco : The American Military Adventure in Iraq .
Ricks told Kurtz , " One of the things that is going on , according to some U.S. military analysts , is that Israel purposely has left pockets of Hezbollah rockets in Lebanon , because as long as they 're being rocketed , they can continue to have a sort of moral equivalency in their operations in Lebanon . "
Kurtz responded , " Hold on , you 're suggesting that Israel has deliberately allowed Hezbollah to retain some of its fire power , essentially for PR purposes , because having Israeli civilians killed helps them in the public relations war here ? "
Ricks replied , " Yes , that 's what military analysts have told me . "
Kurtz remarked " that 's an extraordinary testament to the notion that having people on your own side killed actually works to your benefit in that nobody wants to see your own citizens killed but it works to your benefit in terms of the battle of perceptions here . "
Ricks replied " It helps you with the moral high ground problem , because you know your operations in Lebanon are going to be killing civilians as well . "
I really am naive .
I did not expect this degree of unpreparedness and incompetence .
I did not expect this even though I knew that the Bush administration is worse than you can imagine , even after having taken account of the fact that it is worse than you can imagine .
Paul Krugman more than half expected this .
Another sign that he 's wiser and more reality - based than I am :
Paul Krugman A Can't - Do Government - New York Times : Before 9/11 the Federal Emergency Management Agency listed the three most likely catastrophic disasters facing America : a terrorist attack on New York , a major earthquake in San Francisco and a hurricane strike on New Orleans ....
So why were New Orleans and the nation so unprepared ?
After 9/11 , hard questions were deferred in the name of national unity , then buried under a thick coat of whitewash ....
Why have aid and security taken so long to arrive ?
Katrina hit five days ago - and it was already clear by last Friday that Katrina could do immense damage along the Gulf Coast ....
[ T ]he evidence points , above all , to a stunning lack of both preparation and urgency in the federal government 's response .
Even military resources in the right place were n't ordered into action .
" On Wednesday , " said an editorial in The Sun Herald in Biloxi , Miss. , " reporters listening to horrific stories of death and survival at the Biloxi Junior High School shelter looked north across Irish Hill Road and saw Air Force personnel playing basketball and performing calisthenics . " ...
Why was n't more preventive action taken ?...
[ T ]he Army Corps of Engineers ...
" never tried to hide the fact that the spending pressures of the war in Iraq , as well as homeland security - coming at the same time as federal tax cuts - was the reason for the strain . "
In 2002 the corps ' chief resigned , reportedly under threat of being fired , after he criticized the administration 's proposed cuts in the corps ' budget , including flood - control spending ....
Did the Bush administration destroy FEMA 's effectiveness ?
The administration has , by all accounts , treated the emergency management agency like an unwanted stepchild ....
Last year James Lee Witt , who won bipartisan praise for his leadership of the agency during the Clinton years , said at a Congressional hearing : " I am extremely concerned that the ability of our nation to prepare for and respond to disasters has been sharply eroded .
I hear from emergency managers , local and state leaders , and first responders nearly every day that the FEMA they knew and worked well with has now disappeared . "
I do n't think this is a simple tale of incompetence .
The reason the military was n't rushed in to help along the Gulf Coast is , I believe , the same reason nothing was done to stop looting after the fall of Baghdad .
Flood control was neglected for the same reason our troops in Iraq did n't get adequate armor ....
[ O ] ur current leaders just are n't serious about ... the essential functions of government ....
Yesterday Mr. Bush made an utterly fantastic claim : that nobody expected the breach of the levees .
In fact , there had been repeated warnings about exactly that risk ....
America ... has a can't - do government that makes excuses instead of doing its job ...
Nor did I expect blame - the - victim to start so early , especially not from federal officials who did nothing to roll a single busload of refugees out of New Orleans before the hurricane hit .
Tim Burke writes :
Tim Burke : Michael Brown , director of FEMA , may or may not be incompetent in technical terms .
But blaming people for not evacuating , and that 's exactly what he 's doing ....
It 's a kind of whining , an anti-leadership .
What , he thinks it is not appropriate to talk now about why megamillions in contingency planning failed so grotesquely but it is appropriate right now to scapegoat people who mostly lacked the means to evacuate and were provisioned with no meaningful assistance in evacuating ?
Yes , some people just decided to stay , for a variety of reasons .
However , look at the people we 've been seeing on television : it 's plain that many of them could not get out unless someone expressly helped them get out .
There was no consistent provision of such assistance ....
There 's ... the ability of political and bureaucratic leaders as well as pundits and ordinary folk to show a kind of common - sense decency in grappling with the situation , in understanding its meaning to us as human beings ....
There are many leaders and observers and ordinary folk who are making me proud to be American .
Michael Brown makes me feel the opposite .
Jonah Goldberg , cracking cheap jokes about Waterworld and then making a non-apology apology that 's almost worse , makes me feel the opposite .
Whomever the deranged assholes are who are shooting at helicopters and threatening to loot hospitals make me feel the opposite .
There are two tests here : can we do better as a society in understanding and solving major problems , and can we be decent , can we demonstrate character ...
And here we have FEMA head Michael Brown :
WSJ.com - Katrina News Tracker : FEMA 's Michael Brown tells Ted Koppel : " We were not prepared " for the thousands of people who did not evacuate the city despite calls to do so .
" We move in when its safe to move in , we worked with the state . "
Jim Henley is polite in response :
Unqualified Offerings : The Hurricane Pam exercise ( discussed downblog ) leaves no doubt that federal , state and local agencies recognized in advance that hundreds of thousands of people would remain behind because they were too poor to get out .
The White House itself was briefed .
So it 's beyond unforgiveable for people like Brown and Chertoff to pepper their comments with " people who chose to stay behind "s .
Kevin Drum is a little less polite :
The Washington Monthly : EVACUATING THE POOR ....
Why did so many people who lacked the means to evacuate New Orleans get left behind ?
Brian Wolshon , an engineering professor at Louisiana State University who served as a consultant on the state 's evacuation plan , said little attention was paid to moving out New Orleans 's " low - mobility " population -- the elderly , the infirm and the poor without cars or other means of fleeing the city , about 100,000 people .
At disaster planning meetings , he said , " the answer was often silence . "
It 's not that no one had thought of this problem .
They just did n't consider it important enough to spend any time on .
Patrick Nielsen
Hayden cannot be polite any longer :
Making Light : Another term for it would be " lying sack of shit " :
The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Thursday those New Orleans residents who chose not to heed warnings to evacuate before Hurricane Katrina bear some responsibility for their fates .
Michael Brown also agreed with other public officials that the death toll in the city could reach into the thousands .
" Unfortunately , that 's going to be attributable a lot to people who did not heed the advance warnings , " Brown told CNN .
" I do n't make judgments about why people chose not to leave but , you know , there was a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans , " he said ....
Asked later on CNN how he could blame the victims , many of whom could not flee the storm because they had no transportation or were too frail to evacuate on their own , Brown said he was not blaming anyone .
" Now is not the time to be blaming , " Brown said .
Summing up :
If you did n't leave New Orleans before the storm , your problems are your own fault .
Not that we " make judgements " , of course .
And remember , " now is not the time to be blaming . "
And the thought briefly , briefly penetrates Jonah Goldberg 's lizard brain that he's on the side of the bad guys :
Rising Hegemon :
No longer such a joke is it ? : Jonah Goldberg has something rare in today 's Republican enablers ... an attack of guilt .
So the question is , would the money have been better spent if the Republicans had n't gotten their way ?
And , though it sickens me to say so , that is at best an open question .
I have the utmost faith in the kleptocratic and dysfunctional governments of New Orleans and Louisiana to waste and steal money .
But , we were supposed to be preparing -- at the national level -- for a major terrorist attack for the last four years .
I just do n't see much evidence of that preparation .
Congress re-assembled lickity - split to deal with Terri Schiavo -- a decision that did n't and does not bother me the way it bothers some .
But however you define the issues involved in that case , in terms of real human suffering they are very hard to stack - up against what 's happened in New Orleans .
Congress should have convened yesterday and rescinded the highway bill .
It should have broken - open the farm bill like a piñata and reallocated the monies therein .
But the moment is brief .
In the next paragraph all sign of intelligent thought vanishes :
For supporters of the war , this spectacle is going to be particularly hard to accomodate because it is in the interests of the political classes to keep their pork and it is in the interests of the antiwar left to frame this as a choice between Baghdad and New Orleans ...
Impeach George W. Bush .
Impeach him now .
We 've seen it before : an embattled president so swathed in his inner circle that he completely loses touch with the public and wanders around among small knots of people who agree with him .
There was Lyndon Johnson in the 1960's , Richard Nixon in the 1970's , and George H. W. Bush in the 1990's .
Now it 's his son 's turn .
It has been obvious for months that Americans do n't believe the war is going just fine , and they needed to hear that President Bush gets that .
They wanted to see that he had learned from his mistakes and adjusted his course , and that he had a measurable and realistic plan for making Iraq safe enough to withdraw United States troops .
Americans did n't need to be convinced of Mr. Bush 's commitment to his idealized version of the war .
They needed to be reassured that he recognized the reality of the war .
Instead , Mr. Bush traveled 32 miles from the White House to the Naval Academy and spoke to yet another of the well - behaved , uniformed audiences that have screened him from the rest of America lately .
If you do not happen to be a midshipman , you 'd have to have been watching cable news at midmorning on a weekday to catch him .
The address was accompanied by a voluminous handout entitled " National Strategy for Victory in Iraq , " which the White House grandly calls the newly declassified version of the plan that has been driving the war .
If there was something secret about that plan , we can't figure out what it was .
The document , and Mr. Bush 's speech , were almost entirely a rehash of the same tired argument that everything 's going just fine .
Mr. Bush also offered the usual false choice between sticking to his policy and beating a hasty and cowardly retreat .
Mr Masri is seeking damages from the CIA
Munich prosecutors confirmed that the warrants were linked to the case of Khaled al - Masri , a German national of Lebanese descent .
Mr Masri says he was seized in Macedonia , flown to a secret prison in Afghanistan and mistreated there .
He says he was released in Albania five months later when the Americans realised they had the wrong man .
Mr Masri says his case is an example of the US policy of " extraordinary rendition " - a practice whereby the US government flies foreign terror suspects to third countries without judicial process for interrogation or detention .
Code names
Prosecutors in Munich said in a statement that the city 's court had issued the warrants on suspicion of abduction and grievous bodily harm .
The suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so - called code names of CIA agents
Munich prosecutors ' statement
EU states knew of flights
The information on which the warrants were based came from Mr Masri 's lawyers and a journalist and officials in Spain , where the flight carrying Mr Masri is thought to have originated .
The names and nationalities concerned were not released but prosecutors said the names identified were thought to be the code names of CIA agents .
" The investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects , " they said .
Speaking at a news conference , Mr Masri 's lawyer , Manfred Gnjidic , said the arrest warrants were " a very important step in the rehabilitation of Masri " .
" It shows us that we were right in putting our trust in the German authorities and the German prosecutors , " he said .
German arrest warrants are not valid in the US but if the suspects were to travel to the European Union they could be arrested .
Italian case
Mr Masri says he was abducted by US agents in the Macedonian capital , Skopje , on 31 December 2003 .
He is seeking to sue the US government over his detention , but in May a judge dismissed a lawsuit he filed against the CIA , citing national security considerations .
The US government is not assisting the German authorities with the case .
Meanwhile in the Italian city of Milan , court hearings to decide whether to indict 25 alleged CIA agents and several Italians accused of kidnapping a Muslim cleric in 2003 are under way .
Osama Mustafa Hassan , or Abu Omar , says he was abducted from the streets of Milan and then tortured in Egypt .
If the case proceeds to trial , it would be the first criminal prosecution over America 's rendition policy .
The practice has drawn widespread criticism from human rights groups , legal experts and the international community .
But last week a European Parliament committee approved a report saying EU states knew about secret CIA flights over Europe , the abduction of terror suspects by US agents and the existence of clandestine detention camps .
Meine Familie und ich nicht
Die Qualitätsprobleme des „ Spiegels “ und die neue Titelgeschichte zum Kindermangel der Deutschen
Kinder , Kinder , war das ein Spiegel - Titel !
Verfasser Matthias Matussek hat den Untergang der deutschen Familie mit der Präzision einer Dampfwalze nachgezeichnet .
Kein Mutterglück nirgends , „ nicht einmal in Zeiten der Pest “ gab es weniger Gebärfreude .
Und die seltenen Kids , die noch zur Welt kommen , sind entweder adipös und motorikgestört , oder die Eltern lassen sie verhungern .
Oder marodierende türkisch - arabische Jugendbanden „ im Dschungel Neuköllns “ machen sie nieder .
Der Rest sind lauter kleine ETs .
O - Ton Matussek : „ Kinder , die heute zur Welt kommen , werden von den Eltern beäugt wie Außerirdische . “
Matussek , ganz Vulgärapokalyptiker , zeigt das Bild einer untergehenden Gesellschaft im Gebärstreik .
Gleichzeitig betet er die Konkursmasse der bürgerlichen Familie mit religiöser Inbrunst an .
Die Familie als „ Kernzelle unseres Lebens , unserer Menschwerdung “ sei von den 68er Kommunarden „ zertrümmert “ worden , weint er , und mit ihr „ das Urvertrauen “ .
Ideologischen Input für sein krudes Familienepos erhielt der Spiegel - Mann von FAZ - Herausgeber Frank Schirrmacher , dessen Buch „ Minimum “ über den „ biologischen GAU “ im deutschen Kinderzimmer er mit dem Eifer eines katholischen Ministranten nacherzählt .
Schirrmacher darf dann auch noch im Spiegel - Gespräch seine verquasten Thesen zur „ Überlebensfabrik Familie “ ausbreiten .
Interviewer Matussek gibt den kritiklosen Claqueur und findet , dass die kinderlosen Deutschen eine „ kulturelle Lücke “ reißen , in die der „ familienstarke Islam hineinstößt “ .
Gleitgel dabei ist „ die Identitätsschwäche der atomisierten westlichen Gesellschaft “ .
So viel intellektueller Magerquark war den Spiegel - Kollegen , die von dem Kulturchef mit den extrabreiten Hosenträgern einiges gewohnt sind , dann doch zu viel .
Empörung , Fassungslosigkeit und schlichte Scham kennzeichneten die montägliche Blattkritik , bei der Matussek fehlte .
Die Titelgeschichte wurde von allen Seiten als „ rein ideologisch “ , „ weitgehend faktenfrei “ oder als „ gedruckte Jesuitenpredigt “ abgekanzelt .
Auch Redakteure des Berliner Büros hatten ihr Entsetzen formuliert .
Der Geist der 50er - Jahre und „ biologistische Weltsichten “ machten sich breit .
Chefredakteur Stefan Aust ertrug die Blattkritik wie ein Dackel den Gewitterregen .
Er selbst hatte den Titel bei Matussek bestellt – eine Neuauflage der Kumpanei zwischen Schirrmacher und dem Spiegel - Chefredakteur , bei der die Bücher der jeweils anderen Seite hochgejazzt werden .
Für die Kritiker im eigenen Haus sind die Qualitätsprobleme des Spiegels mit diesem Titel dramatisch bestätigt worden .
Auch sonst wimmelt es vor Fehlern .
Der neue Bundespräsident ist plötzlich erst „ seit einem Dreivierteljahr “ im Amt ( Seite 30 ) , für Arbeit ist neuerdings Wirtschaftsminister Glos zuständig ( S. 22 ) und der Fraktionsgeschäftsführer der Union heißt jetzt Rüttgers statt Röttgen .
Und dies noch : Matussek und Schirrmacher , die beiden Granden des Spiegel - Titels , bringen es zusammen auf gerade zwei Kinderchen und ziemlich bunte familiäre Verhältnisse .
Obacht , dass da nicht der Islamist hineinstößt .

HOWTO : using gprof with multithreaded applications
What is gprof ?
gprof is the GNU Profiler , a tool used when tracking which functions are eating CPU in your program .
Anyway , you should already be familiar with it if you got interested in this page .
One problem with gprof under certain kernels ( such as Linux ) is that it does n’t behave correctly with multithreaded applications .
It actually only profiles the main thread , which is quite useless .
Workaround
There is an easy , but surprisingly not very widespread fix for this annoying gprof behaviour .
Basically , gprof uses the internal ITIMER_PROF timer which makes the kernel deliver a signal to the application whenever it expires .
So we just need to pass this timer data to all spawned threads .
Example
It would n’t be too hard to put a call to setitimer in each function spawned by a thread , but I thought it would be more elegant to implement a wrapper for pthread_create .
Daniel Jönsson enhanced my code so that it could be used in a preload library without having to modify the program .
It can also be very useful for libraries that spawn threads without warning , such as libSDL .
The result code is shown below and can be downloaded ( gprof - helper . c ) :
Jokes , observations , how the world should run ... you get the idea .
Kind of like Howard Stern with shorter hair or David Letterman with , well , hair .
Not really for kids .
On a good day , I 'd like to think it 's funny like Jon Stewart or Lewis Black .
On a bad day it 's funny like old mayonnaise .
Enjoy ... please .
Last month , we reported on yet another election botched by defective Diebold voting machines .
Maryland primaries were plagued by machine crashes and human error , leading Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. to insist that the state shelve the $ 100 million voting machines and return to paper ballots until the problems could be resolved .
The state Board of Elections administrator vowed to " work around the clock " and put pressure on Diebold to ensure that the machines worked for the upcoming election .
During a mock election yesterday intended to test Diebold 's latest fixes , the problems continued but with much less severity .
How did Diebold fix the most serious problems that affected the digital poll books and voting machines ?
The company provided a mouse for each of the touchscreen devices , and insisted that users refrain from touching the screen .
That 's right , the Diebold touchscreens do n't like to be touched .
When a user neglected to heed Diebold 's warning and operated the electronic poll book by touching the screen during the mock election , the device lost synchronization with other poll books and had to be rebooted .
The company claims that it can develop a software fix for the problem , and they have offered to either provide the state with 5,500 mice or install the software update so that the touchscreen can be used .
Although many of the other problems with the machines seem to have been resolved , and crashes are no longer frequent occurrences , Governor Ehrlich remains unimpressed .
The Republican Governor , who attended the mock election test run , continues to encourage voters to use absentee ballots in order to avoid the flawed machines .
Diebold has been hit with a steady stream of bad press for the past two years .
Already banned in some states , the voting machine company 's products are a frequent target of criticism as security experts continue to find egregious flaws in the technology , including vulnerability to self - propagating viruses .
The voting machines recently disrupted elections in Alaska , where the state Democratic Party now considers voting machine accountability a high political priority .
With considerable criticism from both sides of the political aisle in multiple states , it is hard to believe that anybody is willing to buy these machines at all .
The Maryland election will be a major test .
If it runs smoothly , it will be an indication that the technical problems with the machines can be resolved .
Even if that is the case , security experts believe that the machines will have to be completely replaced in order to eliminate the most serious security defects .
Without a paper - trail and the ability to perform election audits , voters will never be certain that the machines properly functioned .
When John Buettner of Chestertown , Md. , wants to buy books , he heads to a used bookstore .
The price is right , he says , and " there is a certain ' hunting ' appeal to the whole process . "
George Simpson of New York takes a different approach :
He goes to his computer and shops for used books online .
A few clicks of the mouse , a few taps of the keys , and his order is complete .
Both men represent enthusiastic customers in one of the fastest - growing segments of the book industry : used books .
Last year , US consumers spent more than $ 2.2 billion to buy 111 million used books .
That 's up 11 percent from 2003 , according to a landmark study by the Book Industry Study Group .
Most significantly , the growth is happening on the Internet .
Online sales of used trade books - those aimed at a general audience - jumped 33 percent last year .
By contrast , trade - book sales at traditional bookstores rose 4.6 percent .
" Used trade books have been growing 25 percent a year , " says Jeff Hayes , group director of InfoTrends / CAP Ventures , a research firm in Weymouth , Mass .
" New trade books are growing only a couple percent a year . "
As these " pre-owned " volumes become an increasingly popular choice for millions of readers , they are shaking off their once - dusty image .
They are also beginning to shake up an industry that until now has paid little attention to them .
Publishers and authors worry that they will siphon off sales from new books .
Others see their rising allure as part of an emerging shift in how Americans view ownership .
" The used - book market is just beginning to burgeon , " says Dan Nissanoff , author of the forthcoming book " Futureshop . "
" Culturally , buying used books as a way to acquire a book is becoming mainstream and acceptable . "
He traces the shift to an " auction culture " that " promotes temporary ownership as an efficient way to live a better life .
" We 've historically been a society that accumulates , that views acquisition as permanent , " Mr. Nissanoff continues .
" Now channels such as Amazon.com , eBay , and Barnes & Noble have made it easy for us not only to buy books but sell our books as well .
They 're accelerating the auction culture and pushing this behavior to the mainstream .
It 's beginning to have a big impact on the book industry . "
Buyers of used books span all ages and demographic groups .
Less than 3 percent of consumers buy only used books , Mr. Hayes says .
About 30 percent purchase new books exclusively .
The majority buy both .
" The more avid readers are much more likely to buy both new and used , " Hayes says .
" Those who buy only a few titles a year buy new . "
Adding to the appeal of used books is the increasing availability of " gently used " books in excellent condition , often for sale soon after publication .
Referring to the books he purchases online , Mr. Simpson says , " I have never gotten one that was n't nearly new in condition . "
Stephen Andrews , book review editor of the Journal of American History , explains the appeal that secondhand titles hold for him .
" A used book has more value than a new one because it has passed through someone 's hands , acquired notation and comments , and become a living thing .
I 'm less interested in books that are in pristine condition . "
Mr. Andrews 's wife , Elizabeth , describes him as an " avid buyer of used books , with packages arriving almost every day from Amazon . "
Hardcovers account for the majority of sales of used books , Hayes says .
Yet Rich Fitzpatrick , owner of the Braintree ( Mass . )
Book Rack , finds the market for used hardcovers " very weak . "
He sells most used hardcovers for a dollar , but used paperbacks are priced at $ 3 or $ 4 .
Customers like the portability of paperbacks , he says .
For customers , the widespread availability of used books offers many advantages .
" The Internet creates a whole new market and almost a whole new pricing , " says Richard Davies , a spokesman for online bookseller Abebooks.com .
" You have a series of prices lined up side by side , " which gives buyers choices .
One issue the study does not answer is the impact that used book sales are having on new book sales .
" That remains an open question , " says Jeff Abraham , executive director of the Book Industry Study Group .
" Some people might argue that it cannibalizes new book sales .
Some argue that it spurs new book sales by making more books available and by bringing them to new locations . "
Whatever the answer to that question , not every customer is lured by the siren call of Internet bookselling .
" To me , roaming along the shelves of a used book store is like searching for seashells along the beach , " says Michael Robertson of Charleston , S.C. " Sometimes I leave the store with a full pail , other times I do not . "
Booksellers like Mr. Fitzpatrick also remain optimistic that there will always be bricks - and - mortar stores , and room for a variety of ways of marketing the printed word .
" We 're doing great , " he says , although he notes that two used - book exchanges in nearby suburbs have closed within the past month .
" There are a lot of doomsayers .
But my attitude is , for the last 400 years a lot of people have been making a good living selling books , and I think that will continue . "
High resolution 4 Pi microscopy vs. traditional confocal microscopy .
3 - dimensional 4 Pi microscopy visualization of Hela H2AX ( green ) and gamma - H2AX ( red ) chromatin clusters at 100 nm resolution ( center image ) is shown in front of a traditional overview z - projected data stack of HeLa cells stained for H2AX , gamma -H2AX and DAPI taken with a confocal microscope .
Confocal light microscopy has been an important tool for biomedical scientists as they work to unravel molecular events occurring within human cells .
Less than two decades ago , an important advance in microscopy technology was achieved with Dr. Stefan Hell ’s invention of “ 4 Pi microscopy . ”
Recently developed and commercialized by Leica Microsystems , 4 Pi technology offers a significant increase in resolution ; however , fundamental optical limitations prevented scientists from visualizing molecules in the cell ’s nucleus using this new method .
Now , through the work of Brian Bennett , PhD , of the University of Massachusetts Medical School ( UMMS ) Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Pharmacology and Leica Microsystems , UMMS Associate Professor of Biochemistry & Molecular Pharmacology Kendall Knight , PhD , and collaborator Jörg Bewersdorf , PhD , of the Institute for Molecular Biophysics at The Jackson Laboratory , this limitation has been overcome — for the first time high resolution 4 Pi microscope images of endogenous nuclear proteins in human cells have been realized .
In “ H2AX chromatin structures and their response to DNA damage revealed by 4 Pi microscopy , ” published online this week by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Drs. Bewersdorf , Bennett and Knight used the Leica TCS 4 Pi microscope to examine histones , nuclear proteins that are involved in packaging and protecting DNA as well as in processes that repair damaged DNA .
Exposure to environmental carcinogens can lead to a particularly devastating form of DNA damage , DNA double - strand breaks .
The occurrence of such DNA breaks invokes a rapid and highly coordinated series of molecular events within the nucleus , and defects in this process correlate with increased risks for cancer , as well as developmental and immunological abnormalities .
Bewersdorf , Bennett and Knight examined a specific histone protein , H2AX .
Within seconds after DNA damage has occurred , H2AX undergoes a subtle but functionally significant molecular modification , which in turn plays an important role in coordinating the recruitment of proteins that will repair the break .
Prior to these results , researchers had been unable to visualize how H2AX is distributed throughout the nucleus .
However , this study provides never - before - seen high resolution 3D images of H2AX , demonstrating that it exists in distinct clusters that are themselves evenly distributed throughout the entire nuclear volume .
This finding suggests that H2AX clusters provide a platform from which signaling and repair events can be coordinated .
Additionally , high resolution 4 Pi images of modified H2AX reveal for the first time the complex three - dimensional character and dynamics of molecular associations that occur at the site of a DNA break .
“ We are very excited to have finally overcome the obstacle that had prevented visualization of nuclear proteins , ” said Bennett , who devised the solution enabling the use of 4 Pi microscopy during his PhD thesis work in the Knight lab .
“ The collaborations between myself , Drs. Knight and Bewersdorf , and those at Leica Microsystems were critical in achieving this first step .
We look forward to continuing our investigations with the analysis of other nuclear proteins involved in cancer prevention and the repair of DNA damage . ”

When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad writers .
What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction , so I assumed that was the highest form of writing .
Mistake number one .
The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which people suffered in complicated ways .
Anything funny or gripping was ipso facto suspect , unless it was old enough to be hard to understand , like Shakespeare or Chaucer .
Mistake number two .
The ideal medium seemed the short story , which I 've since learned had quite a brief life , roughly coincident with the peak of magazine publishing .
But since their size made them perfect for use in high school classes , we read a lot of them , which gave us the impression the short story was flourishing .
Mistake number three .
And because they were so short , nothing really had to happen ; you could just show a randomly truncated slice of life , and that was considered advanced .
Mistake number four .
The result was that I wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone was unhappy in a way that seemed deep .
For most of college I was a philosophy major .
I was very impressed by the papers published in philosophy journals .
They were so beautifully typeset , and their tone was just captivating — alternately casual and buffer - overflowingly technical .
A fellow would be walking along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him .
I did n't ever quite understand these papers , but I figured I 'd get around to that later , when I had time to reread them more closely .
In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them .
This was , I can now see , a doomed undertaking , because they were n't really saying anything .
No philosopher ever refuted another , for example , because no one said anything definite enough to refute .
Needless to say , my imitations did n't say anything either .
In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things .
There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system , at the core of which was something called an inference engine .
I looked at what these things did and thought " I could write that in a thousand lines of code . "
And yet eminent professors were writing books about them , and startups were selling them for a year 's salary a copy .
What an opportunity , I thought ; these impressive things seem easy to me ; I must be pretty sharp .
Wrong .
It was simply a fad .
The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now ignored .
They were not even on a path to anything interesting .
And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet seats .
How do you avoid copying the wrong things ?
Copy only what you genuinely like .
That would have saved me in all three cases .
I did n't enjoy the short stories we had to read in English classes ; I did n't learn anything from philosophy papers ; I did n't use expert systems myself .
I believed these things were good because they were admired .
It can be hard to separate the things you like from the things you 're impressed with .
One trick is to ignore presentation .
Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum , I ask myself : how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale , dirty and frameless , and with no idea who painted it ?
If you walk around a museum trying this experiment , you 'll find you get some truly startling results .
Do n't ignore this data point just because it 's an outlier .
Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures .
Many things people like , especially if they 're young and ambitious , they like largely for the feeling of virtue in liking them .
99 % of people reading Ulysses are thinking " I'm reading Ulysses " as they do it .
A guilty pleasure is at least a pure one .
What do you read when you do n't feel up to being virtuous ?
What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there 's only half of it left , instead of being impressed that you 're half way through ?
That 's what you really like .
Even when you find genuinely good things to copy , there 's another pitfall to be avoided .
Be careful to copy what makes them good , rather than their flaws .
It 's easy to be drawn into imitating flaws , because they 're easier to see , and of course easier to copy too .
For example , most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used brownish colors .
They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance , whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt .
Those paintings have since been cleaned , revealing brilliant colors ; their imitators are of course still brown .
It was painting , incidentally , that cured me of copying the wrong things .
Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try being a painter , and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that it snapped the leash of credulity .
These people made philosophy professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians .
It was so clearly a choice of doing good work xor being an insider that I was forced to see the distinction .
It 's there to some degree in almost every field , but I had till then managed to avoid facing it .
That was one of the most valuable things I learned from painting : you have to figure out for yourself what 's good .
You can't trust authorities .
They 'll lie to you on this one .

Why Apple Failed promised to reveal an accidental discovery that was key to Apple 's recovery .
The great minds of Slashdot took various guesses over the weekend , but here 's the real reason Apple was able to create new growth in the Mac platform .
Why Apple Bounced Back : Software
As noted in The Rise and Fall of Platforms : Planting Software Seeds , Apple had observed how Adobe 's PostScript technology had driven the development of desktop publishing as a killer application for the Mac , and hoped to similarly deliver the basis of a new wave of multimedia applications using its own QuickTime software .
QuickTime not only drove adoption of Macs , but it preserved the Mac platform through the 90s by helping to establish it in the field of content creation .
Why Apple Failed described how Apple was at the mercy of its developers , and particularly the four majors : Microsoft , Adobe , Macromedia , and Quark .
All four had originally established their graphic applications on the Mac , but were moving toward Windows .
Windows itself was the result of Microsoft seeking to broaden its sales of Word and Excel from the Mac onto DOS PCs .
As Windows gained adoption , it created a huge potential market for graphic applications that had only ever been available on the Mac .
Developers naturally followed Microsoft to reach that huge new market .
The Cross Platform Threat
Adobe , Quark , Macromedia and other Mac developers built their own in - house cross-platform development systems to allow them to deploy versions of their software on both Windows and the Mac .
This new style of " lowest common denominator " cross platform development resulted in Apple 's customers having fewer reasons to stick with the Mac platform .
Apple could invent all sorts of new software technologies , but if these features complicated developer 's cross - platform efforts , they simply would n't ever get adopted .
This helped to kill any value remaining in developments like PowerTalk and QuickDraw GX .
Adoption of new Apple features would add value to Macs , but did n't do anything for developers apart from making their work harder .
Third party developers were n't anti-Mac ; they were simply acting in their own best interests .
The same situation has also threatened Microsoft and other platform vendors ; both Sun 's Java and Netscape 's web platform threatened to create software that worked anywhere , which would erase any differentiation or value from Windows as a platform .
Microsoft worked hard to stop them .
DIY Software
Apple needed to differentiate the Mac platform with innovative software applications , but it increasingly had less and less power to do so , as big developers ignored its unique features and toolkits .
If Apple wanted unique applications for its Mac platform , it would have learn how to deliver them itself .
There was a huge risk involved : it seemed impossibly difficult to create software without angering third party developers .
Prior to the Mac , Apple had shipped its 1983 Lisa computer with a full suite of Apple designed office software .
The Lisa 's commercial failure was partly attributed to the perceived lack of opportunity for third party developers .
Realizing the importance of a healthy third party development ecosystem , Apple determined not to repeat the same mistake with the Macintosh .
When Apple released the Mac , it only shipped it with the simple MacWrite and MacPaint applications , which were supposed to serve as placeholder demonstrations .
However , third party developers were still annoyed that these Apple titles limited the potential market for retail software .
To placate these developers , Apple spun off its internally developed Mac software into a new Claris subsidiary in 1987 .
Claris later acquired the developer of the FileMaker and rebranded its various software titles with a common Claris look .
It eventually became Apple policy that all application software would be handled by Claris .
By the time NeXT arrived to reinvent Apple a decade later , the once innovative Claris software portfolio was largely dead , apart from its basic ClarisWorks suite and the popular FileMaker Pro .
The new Apple renamed Claris to FileMaker , Inc. and scraped the remains , apart from ClarisWorks , which Apple itself began to sell under the name AppleWorks .
After a decade of pointedly avoiding application software , Apple was now back in the development business , even if it did n't yet realize how important that would be to the Mac ’s recovery .
Apple Strikes Gold with KeyGrip
In the same late 90s timeframe , Macromedia hired the development team of Adobe 's Premier , lead by Randy Ubillos , in order to develop a rival new professional level video editing application based on QuickTime .
The product was tentatively called KeyGrip and then Final Cut .
Shortly after starting work on its " Premier killer , " Macromedia decided to stop competing directly with Adobe .
Instead , it would target the market for web development tools , and leave the video and print markets to Adobe .
Macromedia put the unfinished project up for sale , but could n't find a buyer .
Apple bought the product from Macromedia in 1998 to prevent it from simply being abandoned .
After being unable to find a developer interested in continuing work on it , Apple completed the project itself , releasing it the next year as Final Cut Pro .
What began as a fortunate accident would become Apple 's new killer app for the Mac .
Final Cut Pro Cleans Up
Final Cut Pro quickly destroyed Adobe 's Premier .
Apple 's new product was essentially an entirely reworked new version of Premier , while Adobe had let its Premier languish as it focused on graphic design and print production .
The desktop market for video editing was still small , so the challenge hardly mattered .
It was an easy victory .
Apple really broke ground with Final Cut Pro when it took on industry leader Avid .
Avid started out on the original Macintosh II in the late 80s , and had since become the leading vendor in delivering video editing workstations .
Initially , Final Cut Pro was n't seen as much of a threat .
The film industry was strongly entrenched behind Avid solutions , and Final Cut Pro only offered a limited subset of its features .
What Final Cut Pro did offer was easy access to the power of QuickTime .
It allowed both large and small studios to set up a relatively inexpensive Mac to do their simple post production tasks at much lower cost than if they were to tie up their own Avid , or have to rent access to an expensive Avid studio .
After allowing Apple an entry into professional post production and broadcast graphics , Final Cut Pro has been able to grow into a serious competitor .
The Turnaround Discovery
Final Cut Pro was a great demonstration of the flexibility of Quicktime , and importantly for Apple , distinguished the Mac platform .
Apple had canned the development of Final Cut for Windows , making Mac hardware the only way to run Final Cut Pro .
The new Apple suddenly discovered that the way to sell more Macs was to offer compelling new software that was only available on the Mac .
This might seem obvious in retrospect , but the company had been cautiously avoiding the application software market for over a decade .
Claris had even ported FileMaker to Windows .
The initial worry that bundled software would chill third party development had been overwhelmed by the much greater fear that the Mac would cease to matter unless Apple differentiated its platform with unique software , something that the big third party software developers saw no need to do .
Apple 's Software Explosion
Hot off the heels of Final Cut Pro 's emerging success as a new Mac application , the new Apple went on a buying frenzy to acquire other strategic software projects and their development teams .
In 2000 , Apple bought DVDirector and the DVD technology portfolio from Astarte GmBH , and hired its entire development team .
It released the product the next year as DVD Studio Pro .
Combined with Final Cut Pro , it supported an emerging new market of pro , freelance , and small corporate film studios producing their own DVDs .
In addition to professional level applications , Apple released iMovie in 2000 as a simple consumer version of its video editor , followed by iTunes and iDVD in 2001 , and iPhoto in 2002 .
Apple bundled all these applications with new Macs for free .
Suddenly users had compelling new reason to buy a Mac over a PC :
Macs came bundled with a lot of unique software that just worked .
It would cost a couple hundred bucks to assemble a similar suite from third party Windows developers .
That effectively erased the price advantage held by cheaper , low - end PC makers .
In 2002 , Apple acquired the high end video compositing software Shake in its purchase of Nothing Real , and then bought Emagic , a German software developer of professional level music studio tools .
Apple shocked analysts by dumping the Windows version of both Shake and Logic , and releasing new versions as Mac OS X only .
In 2003 , Apple bundled its consumer applications into a package called iLife , and began selling the new product for $ 49 , or about $ 15 per application .
It also launched Keynote , a new presentation application , as well as a new prosumer version of Final Cut Pro branded as Express .
The following year , Apple included a new consumer version of its music software as GarageBand , and a prosumer version called Logic Express .
Apple also released Motion as a new motion graphics application .
In 2005 , Apple launched Pages , which it bundled with Keynote to create a new business suite called iWork .
Apple refers to iWork as the ' in progress successor ' to AppleWorks .
Later in the year it introduced Aperture as a new pro photography post production tool ; earlier this year Apple added the iWeb to the iLife 06 suite .
Low Profit , High Value Software
From avoiding any software development at all under the Apple name , to becoming a significant developer of professional studio software , prosumer tools and two consumer suites , Apple clearly landed at the conclusion that it needed to deliver its own software or watch its Mac platform shrink into obscurity .
Apple did n't convert from a hardware company into a software developer however .
It continued to bundle iLife for free , and priced its retail versions of iWork and iLife at $ 79 .
At $ 15 - 40 per application , that leaves Apple 's consumer offerings in the price range of shareware .
Clearly , Apple is n't making huge revenues from developing consumer software .
It 's also not hard to understand why there is little competition in the market for personal content creation tools : there 's little profit .
Charging for annual updates allows Apple to follow the Notable Platform Lesson of incrementally advancing applications with regular , significant updates , creating real value for users and adding real value and differentiation to the Mac .
Selling Hardware with Software
Apple also released new hardware designed to exploit these software applications .
Apple added Firewire to all Macs especially for digital video work , and has updated its latest machines to all use optical digital audio ports ; few PCs offer either , particularly not in consumer models .
By building its own hardware , operating system , and application software , Apple can release new technologies and implement them at the same time , rather than simply wish that third party developers would adopt them , as the company did in the early 90's .
For example , Apple added Audio Units to Mac OS X as standardized plugins for audio processing , and later added support for them in Logic and GarageBand .
Apple also created Image Units for Mac OS X’s CoreImage , and used the technology to deliver Aperture .
If Apple had left Aperture for Adobe to develop , it is unlikely Apple 's Mac specific technologies would have been incorporated , because Adobe would have to replicate Apple 's technology to make it also run on Windows .
By shipping its own product , Apple can tune the best performance from its hardware offerings and deliver a better product for its customers .
The Suite Deal
Just as Microsoft compiled an office suite , and integrated it into its email server , server software , other back - end server tools , and development tools , Apple is pursuing similar integration , although Apple can also include specialized hardware into the mix .
For example , while some analysts seem to think Apple 's Xserve RAID is a blindly speculative entry into the Enterprise market , the most obvious application is by Final Cut Studio users who are dealing with enormous amounts of HD video content .
Similarly , Apple 's 30 " displays are n't a dance with Dell into the market for crazy high end gamers , but a product carefully targeted toward pro and prosumer users of Aperture and Final Cut Studio applications .
Apple has tightly integrated its product lines together in many ways , creating new applications and simplifying things for users .
For example , Apple 's iPod gains much of its simplicity through its tight integration with iTunes .
Apple later integrated iTunes with its wireless products to introduce AirTunes streaming .
Next year 's iTV promises to do the same for video .
It ’s also tightly integrated with Apple 's WebObjects based online store , and serves as a central catalog for music , podcasts and video clips which can then be used in iLife applications and shared wirelessly with other users .
NeXT 's resuscitation saved Apple , but its the software that has given new potential users a reason to buy Macs .
Still , there 's other key reasons behind Apple 's recovery .

The Encyclopedia Britannica has stepped up its attacks on the journal Nature by taking out large ads in both the New York Times and the London Times this past week .
The unusually public dispute began last year when Nature published a study showing that Britannica and Wikipedia had almost the same level of accuracy .
Britannica was obviously not pleased with this conclusion , but made no objections until March , when it at last published a set of objections to the study .
Not pleased with Nature 's response , Britannica is now taking the controversy to the masses .
The ads call on Nature to issue a " full and public retraction of the article , " and the Britannica editors give five major reasons why they believe the methodology of the study was deeply flawed .
You reviewed text that was not even from the Encyclopedia Britannica
You accused Britannica of " omissions , " on the basis of reviews of arbitrarily chosen excerpts of Britannica articles , not the articles themselves
You rearranged and re-edited Britannica articles
You failed to distinguish minor inaccuracies from major errors
Your headline contradicted the body of your article
At the end , the editors of Britannica call on Nature to " renew its long - standing commitment to good scholarship and send us the complete , unabridged reviewer reports on which the study was based . "
They also suggest that a " complete retraction of the article is in order .
Nature should make the retraction promptly , if not for Britannica 's sake , then for the sake of Nature 's reputation and in the interest of good science . "
Britannica is certainly not holding anything back in this battle , which is understandable , as it goes to the very heart of their corporate mission ( and profit margins ) .
Their criticisms certainly do make the Nature study sound flawed .
Britannica claims , for instance , that " several of the articles you sent to reviewers were not from the Britannica at all .
In one case a reviewer criticized us for text that we simply cannot identify .
We do know , however , that it was not ours . "
How could Nature make such egregious mistakes as these ?
Nature 's response is simple and direct — they are standing by their original results .
In their view , it is Britannica that is simply mistaken .
" Another Britannica criticism concerns the fact that we provided material from other Britannica publications , such as the Britannica Book of the Year .
This was deliberate : the aim of our story , as we made clear , was to compare the online material available from Britannica and Wikipedia .
When users search Britannica online , they get results from several Britannica publications .
They have no reason to think that any one is less reliable than the others .
In the case of some year - book entries , Britannica itself asks readers to reference the articles as coming from ' Encyclopaedia Britannica Online ' ?- exactly the source we set out to compare .
" Other objections are simply incorrect .
The company has , for example , claimed that in one case we sent a reviewer material that did not come from any Britannica publication .
When the company made this point to us in private we asked for details , but it provided none .
Now Britannica has identified the review in question as being on ethanol .
We have checked the original e-mail that we sent to the reviewer who looked at the Britannica article on ethanol , and it is clear to us that all the reviewer 's comments refer to specific paragraphs from Britannica . "
Nature 's larger point is that , in the end , specific mistakes do not matter much anyway , since the study was conducted blind .
Errors made by the reviewers would have tended to affect both Britannica and Wikipedia equally .
" Our reviewers may have made some mistakes -- we have been open about our methodology and never claimed otherwise -- but the entries they reviewed were blinded : they did not know which entry came from Wikipedia and which from Britannica .
We see no reason to believe that any misidentifications of errors would adversely affect one publication more than the other .
And of the 123 purported errors in question , Britannica takes issue with fewer than half . "
Britannica 's biggest gripe , though , has still not been addressed .
They mention several times in their advertisements that Nature has been unwilling to turn over all of the documentation behind the study , and Nature 's response does not indicate that they will do so .
The battle underscores the way in which projects such as Wikipedia can undermine established authorities and business models .
Whether this is wholly a good thing remains to be seen , as Wikipedia 's own founder has told users not to cite his online encyclopedia as a source due to concerns over its accuracy .
Hopefully , the competition between the two models will serve to improve both .
The archaeological site of Çatalhöyük , in present - day Turkey , is one of the most significant early Neolithic villages to have been excavated .
It was occupied ...
Excerpts of this report will be in Wednesday 's New York Times , Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal .
The study was conducted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health by sending teams of Iraqi doctors across Iraq from May through July .
Other tabulations using different methodologies put the range of total civilian fatalities so far from about 50,000 to more than 150,000 .
President Bush in December said " 30,000 , more or less " had died in Iraq during the invasion and in the violence since .
The Johns Hopkins team conducted its study using a methodology known as " cluster sampling . "
That involved randomly picking 47 clusters of households for a total 1,849 households , scattered across Iraq .
Team members interviewed each household about any deaths in the family during the 40 months since the invasion , as well as in the year before the invasion .
The team says it reviewed death certificates for 92 percent of all deaths reported .
Based on those figures , it tabulated national mortality rates for various periods before and after the start of the war .
The mortality rate last year was nearly four times the preinvasion rate , the study found .
" Since March 2003 , an additional 2.5 percent of Iraq 's population has died above what would have occurred without conflict , " the report said .
The country`s population is roughly 24 million people .

This is a handy toolkit to do phoneme segmentation ( aka phoneme alignments ) for speech audio file using Julius .
Given pairs of speech audio file and its transcription , this toolkit perform Viterbi alignment to get the beginning and ending time of each phoneme .
This toolkit is available at its GitHub page .
Prompter is a perl / Tkx based tiny program that displays recognition results of Julius in a scrolling caption style .
About Models
Since Julius itself is a language - independent decoding program , you can make a recognizer of a language if given an appropriate language model and acoustic model for the target language .
The recognition accuracy largely depends on the models .
Julius adopts acoustic models in HTK ascii format , pronunciation dictionary in almost HTK format , and word 3 - gram language models in ARPA standard format ( forward 2 - gram and reverse N - gram trained from same corpus ) .
We had already examined English dictations with Julius , and another researcher has reported that Julius has also worked well in English , Slovenian ( see pp.681--684 of Proc. ICSLP2002 ) , French , Thai language , and many other Languages .
Here you can get Japanese and English language / acoustic models .
Japanese
Japanese language model ( 60 k - word trained by balanced corpus ) and acoustic models ( triphone GMM / DNN ) are included in the Japanese dictation kit .
More various types of Japanese N - gram LM and acoustic models are available at CSRC .
For more detail , please contact csrc@astem.or.jp .
English
There are some user - contributed English models for Julius available on the Web .
JuliusModels hosts English and Polish models for Julius .
All of the models are based on HTK modelling software and data sets available freely on the Internet .
They can be downloaded from a project website which I created for this purpose .
Please note that DNN version of these models require minor changes which the author included in a modified version of Julius on Github at https://github.com/palles77/julius .
The VoxForge - project is working on the creation of an open - source acoustic model for the English language .
If you have any language or acoustic model that can be distributed as a freeware , would you please contact us ?
We want to run dictation kit on various languages other than Japanese , and share them freely to provide a free speech recognition system available for various languages .

ブックマーク記述言 語 「 XBEL 」
XBEL 用途 ブックマーク交換 実行 - 日本語 ○ 対応環境 XML 入手 仕様書は無 償
どんなソフトにも対応可能
XBEL の名は 、 「 XML Bookmark Exchange Language ( XML による ブックマーク交換のための言語 ) 」の略です。XBEL はブックマークの保存形式の ひとつですが、オープンな規格である XML を使っているのが 強みです 。XML も XBEL もシンプルなので、対応したソフトを作成するのは 比較的簡単です。しかも、拡張性を考えて設計されています。 ちなみに 、Python.org で Python 言語 用の XML 処理ライブラリを開発した歳に生まれたものだそうです。
しかし、そんなにいいモノだとしても、なんの役に立つのでしょう?
ブックマークの形式なんて、ソフトを使う人には関係ないのでは?
……という疑問もわいたかもしれません。
XBEL の最大の目的は、ブックマークを保存することではありません。 あるブラウザの形式で保存されたブックマークを他の形式に変換したいときに、
XBEL を 「 中間言語 」として使うのです。つまり、 例えば Internet Explorer の形式を Navigator の形式に変換する場合、 直接変換するのではなく 、Internet Explorer の形式から一度 XBEL に変換し、 それから改めて Navigator の形式に変換するのです 。
「 1 対 1」の変換だと手間が増えて損な気がしますが、これが「多対多」だと
話が違います。ブラウザにはいくつも種類がありますし、同じブラウザでも
バージョンが違うと形式が変わったりします。仮に 10 種類の形式しかないとしても、 「 1 対 1」の方法で変換すると、すべての形式で互いに変換できるように するには 90 通りのプログラムが必要になってしまいます。一度
XBEL に 変換する場合は、各形式と XBEL が互いに変換できればいいので、 たった 20 通りですんでしまいます 。
一般には、変換を行なうと情報が減ってしまいます 。Navigator 形式の ブックマークを Internet Explorer に変換すると Navigator 形式独自の 情報は抜け落ちてしまうため、再び Navigator 形式に変換し直しても その情報は元に戻らないのです 。XBEL ではこのような特定のブラウザ専用の情報も 保存できるように工夫されています 。
さらに、XBEL はウェブブラウザだけでなく巡回エージェントと呼ばれる種類の
ソフトにも対応できます。つまり、Navigator 形式を WWWC 形式に変化したりすることも 考えられるわけです 。XBEL 形式でそのまま保存して、人に渡すこともできます。 受け取った方では 、XBEL を自分のブラウザや巡回エージェントの形式に変換する ソフトを見つけるだけですみます。 「
おすすめのリンク集」をプリクラみたいに 交換することもできるわけです。
XBEL 文書の構 成
さて、ここからは XBEL の実際の形式について紹介します。 XML に関する知識が必要ですので、知らんという方はこの機会に XML についても 学んでみるといいかもしれません 。
仕様書が公開されている XBEL 1.0 に登場する要素は 9 種類あります。 文書ルートの xbel 要素の他、 ブックマーク ( bookmark ) 、 フォルダ ( folder ) 、 エイリアス ( alias ) 、 セパレータ ( separator ) を表す 要素 ( 以下、この 4 つをまとめてブックマークノードと呼びます ) と、 それらについての情報を記述するための 要素 ( title 、 info 、 metadata 、 desc ) があります。各ブックマークを登録した 日時などはブックマークの要素に属性として保存されます。
以下の内容は 、XBEL 1.0 の文書型定義と仕様書を元に作成したものです。

Families who lost everything lived in filth and fear for days
Tired , hungry and traumatised by days spent under the damaged roof of a once - gleaming football stadium , the refugees of New Orleans have spoken of a nightmarish week living among the crazed and the desperate .
Stories of rape , murder and suicide have emerged .
Medical teams delivered babies in filthy conditions , with human faeces never far away and fresh water in short supply .
At least three were reported to have died .
Amid the filth and the crime , some snapped .
" One guy jumped off a balcony , " said Charles Womack , a 30 - year - old roofer who was beaten and injured during his time at the Superdome .
" I saw him do it .
He was talking to a lady about it .
He said it reminded him of the war and he could n't leave . "
Deadly night - time
Fear ratcheted up the tension , with disturbing reports of mistaken identity emerging from the chaos .
Police and national guardsmen were accused of killing innocent people .
" They killed a man here last night , " Steve Banka , 28 , told the Reuters news agency before he left on Sunday .
Death was everywhere , both inside and outside the Superdome
" And the sounds of her screaming got to this man and so he ran out into the street to get help from troops , to try to flag down a passing truck of them .
" He jumped up on the truck 's windscreen and they shot him dead , " Mr Banka said .
Another man died in mysterious circumstances on Friday as a police car passed the New Orleans Convention Center , where equally squalid conditions forced many to sleep outside among streets full of rubbish .
More than 24 hours later , his body , like so many others , had not been moved .
" Right where he fell , " Larry Martin told the Los Angeles Times .
" Like roadkill . "
On Saturday morning Africa Brumfield , 32 , sat with relatives near the corpse of a young man in streets around the convention centre .
He had died on Friday night as he walked in the street .
" There is rapes going on here .
Women can not go to the bathroom without men .
They are raping them and slitting their throats , " she told Reuters .
Rotting
Inside the Superdome , a National Guard soldier charged with keeping order confirmed the brutal reality of life after Katrina .
" We found a young girl raped and killed in the bathroom .
Then the crowd got the man and they beat him to death . "
National Guardsmen arrested those suspected of causing trouble
" It 's been a long time coming , " Derek Dabon , 29 , said as he queued for a security check .
Hillary Snowton , 40 , sat with a white sheet wrapped around his face to shield himself from the smell of a dead body that lay , untouched , just metres away .
He had watched the body lie there for the past four days , decomposing in the sultry Louisiana climate .
He did n't see the point in moving away from the corpse , he told the Associated Press .
" It stinks everywhere . "
A 70 - year - old blew herself up in a Hamas attack .
She may be just the first of many elderly recruits
In the centre of Beit Hanoun , there is nothing left of the 800 - year - old mosque but the minaret .
It looks like a lighthouse stranded in a sea of rubble .
People whose homes were demolished during the latest Israeli army incursion sit on plastic chairs around bonfires .
At night they bunk down with the neighbours .
One of them is Watfa Kafarna .
' I saw the Israeli soldiers eye - to - eye , ' she said .
' They took my four - year - old grandson , Mahadi , who has Down 's syndrome .
They shook him and yelled : " Where are the guns ? "
Now he is traumatised and wets the bed every night . '
Not his own bed - the Kafarna family is homeless , living off the charity of friends .
Tears run from Watfa 's eyes as she looks at her son , daughter - in - law and grandchild huddled around a brazier .
Her husband , Diab , shuffles across the ruins towards his wife .
' Bossa ! ' he says , ' A kiss ! '
In a highly unconventional move , Diab kisses his wife on the mouth .
' She is my heart , my eyes , my light .
We have lost our house but not each other . '
During the incursion , Israeli soldiers detained all men aged 16 - 40 , including Watfa and Diab 's sons and grandsons .
The army targeted the mosque , attempting to arrest militants hiding there .
The women put up their own resistance , gathering as human shields around the mosque to help the militants escape .
' I am 72 , says Watfa , ' but by doing this I felt 20 , young and useful and ready to act . '
She pulls off her long veil and holds it high in her right hand .
' I waved my hijab as a white flag and prayed with the other women in front of the holy mosque .
But the Israelis continued to destroy it .'
Two women were killed by the Israeli Defence Force that day .
Watfa was bruised , as was 70 - year - old Fatma Najar , hit by a bulldozer .
Three weeks later , Najar blew herself up near Israeli soldiers , wounding two .
In Gaza she is seen as a heroine .
' If the Israelis came to my house to gun down my children and I had a belt , I would do the same , ' says Watfa .
' The woman is the biggest loser here , ' says Khola , a neighbour , standing on the remains of a kitchen where flour is mixed with pulverised masonry .
Two hundred homes were destroyed in Beit Hanoun .
' Fatma Najar , an old woman , did what many people do n't have the guts to do .
If you go back and research Fatma , ' says Khola , ' you will see her home was destroyed on top of her head , her sons jailed , her grandson killed . '
' We want to believe in peace , but how can we when the warplanes still fly over our heads every night , ' asks Watfa , ' making our grandchildren cry and wet themselves ?
When there are still tank movements on the border ?
I can't believe there will be peace . '
Najar 's family heard of her attack on the radio .
' We thought it must be another Fatma Najar , ' said her son , Jihad , 35 .
' It never occurred to us it could have been my mother .
Then the crowds started to arrive and we knew it was true .
We had mixed feelings , sadness at her irreplaceable loss .
But pride too . '
There is a huge shaheed - ' martyr ' - poster of Najar on her house .
It is shocking to see an old woman carrying an M16 .
Some of her 70 grandchildren and great - grandchildren play beneath the picture .
Israa , six , wears a pink top with ' Happy Childhood ' embroidered on it .
' My grandmother 's gone to heaven .
Because she shot the Israelis , ' she says .
The funeral tent is empty now , the three days of official mourning over .
On the first evening , men from the Qassam Brigades , the military wing of Hamas , arrived .
Her son Inam said : ' They told us : " Your mother has been asking to do this for two years .
We said no .
Finally she said , if you do n't give me a belt I will go anyway and get killed and my blood will be on your hands .
We gave in " .'
Other old women now want to become suicide bombers .
The family talks of why she did it .
Perhaps it was her grandson 's death .
' My son , Adil , was 18 when he was killed , ' says Fathiya , 52 , Najar 's eldest daughter .
' He was throwing stones at the Israelis . '
Then there was Fathiya 's other son , Sha'aban .
He attacked an Israeli soldier with a knife .
He was shot 72 times , lost a leg and is paralysed .
The family show a photo of Fatma , a sweet - faced woman in a white cotton scarf .
Neighbours crowd in with stories of her generosity , how she gave sweets to local children , told stories , played .
Najar was a religious woman , involved with mosque committees and close to memorising the Koran .
It was only after her death , her family discovered she had been working for Hamas : ' They told us she had carried food , water , ammunition to the resistance at the front line .
We had no idea . '
The night before her suicide operation , Najar went to visit all of her children and grandchildren .
She brought clothes and sweets .
' But she was always so good to us , ' says Inam .
' As she left me for the last time , she looked back in a way that made me wonder , but then she was gone . '
' On the day she acted like it was a normal day .
She baked the bread in the clay oven .
She took a shower , put on a new dress and went out , ' said Jihad .
' I think the final straw was the Beit Hanoun massacre [ a family of 17 killed at dawn when Israeli shells hit their house ] .
Mother went to the family 's home and asked the women : " Why leave it to your sons to die ?
If Allah allows , I will become a martyr . "
They said : " You think they will take an old lady like you ? " '
A fortnight later she was a suicide bomber , injuring two Israelis , decapitating herself .
This weekend Hamas held a ceremony in Beit Hanoun , in memory of the 140 Palestinians killed in November .
Thousands attended , waving Hamas flags .
The mayor , Dr Nazek el - Kafarna , made a speech in honour of Najar : ' This old lady looked at the houses destroyed and the trees uprooted .
She looked at how our people had been humiliated .
She took her soul in her hand and rushed to her martyrdom . '
Huda Haim , a Hamas PLC member , believes Najar 's act begins a new culture .
' We know behind the Israeli leaders there are decision - makers studying the behaviour of the Palestinians .
Fatma told them they can't end the Palestinian issue with violence .'
The audience was thronged with women , many elderly , many clinging to photographs of their dead .
' We all want to be like Fatma , ' they shouted .
' I am happy about the ceasefire , ' says Zaifa .
' But if the Israelis come back , they will see what we will do , we will be like Fatma Najar . '
' I know at least 20 of us who want to put on the belt , ' said Fatma Naouk , 65 .
' Now is the time of the women .
Now the old women have found a use for themselves . '
CONCORD , Mass. , Oct. 27 — Rainbow looks like any other Labrador retriever , but she is not a pet .
Trained by a prison inmate , her mission is to help Roland Paquette , an injured veteran of the conflict in Afghanistan , stay on his new feet , the ones he got after an explosion destroyed his legs .
While veterans who lose their sight or hearing or must use a wheelchair have long had “ service ” dogs as companions , Rainbow is one of the first dogs in the country trained to work with someone who uses both a wheelchair and prosthetics to get around .
Mr. Paquette ’s hope is that eventually Rainbow will allow him to abandon his canes altogether and rely only on the metal handle attached to the harness she wears around her torso .
“ I ’d much rather be able to walk with her at my side than with the canes , ” said Mr. Paquette , who is 28 .
“ It makes me less obvious . ”
Frida Berrigan on “ Democracy Now ” radio :
“ Israel ’s relationship with the United States is unique in a number of ways .
And one of those ways is that essentially the United States provides 20 % of the Israeli military budget on an annual basis , and then about 70 % of that money that is given from the United States , from U.S. taxpayers , to Israel is then spent on weapons from Lockheed Martin and Boeing and Raytheon .
Most other countries do n’t have that sort of cash relationship , where they go straight to U.S. corporations with U.S. money to buy weapons that are then used in the Occupied Territories and against Lebanon . ”
In short , Â the U.S. is paying forÂ Israel ’s brutal invasion of Lebanon — and Â American war profiteers are making piles of money .
It isÂ militarism as an economic system , what one might call “ war capitalism ” — which is , in reality , totally state - controlled and politically determined , Â as farÂ fromÂ the system of free enterprises as a nation could possibly get , short of Lenin ’s “ war communism . ”
Â
The ruling comes with no penalty , but under federal law the department is supposed to report the violations to the White House and Congress .
In the course of its work , the accountability office discovered a previously undisclosed instance in which the Education Department had commissioned a newspaper article .
The article , on the " declining science literacy of students , " was distributed by the North American Precis Syndicate and appeared in numerous small newspapers around the country .
Readers were not informed of the government 's role in the writing of the article , which praised the department 's role in promoting science education .
The auditors denounced a prepackaged television story disseminated by the Education Department .
The segment , a " video news release " narrated by a woman named Karen Ryan , said that President Bush 's program for providing remedial instruction and tutoring to children " gets an A - plus . "
Ms. Ryan also narrated two videos praising the new Medicare drug benefit last year .
In those segments , as in the education video , the narrator ended by saying , " In Washington , I'm Karen Ryan reporting . "
The television news segments on education and on Medicare did not state that they had been prepared and distributed by the government .
The G.A.O. did not say how many stations carried the reports .
The public relations efforts came to light weeks before Margaret Spellings became education secretary in January .
Susan Aspey , a spokeswoman for the secretary , said on Friday that Ms. Spellings regarded the efforts as " stupid , wrong and ill - advised . "
She said Ms. Spellings had taken steps " to ensure these types of missteps do n't happen again . "
The investigation by the accountability office was requested by Senators Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , both Democrats .
Mr. Lautenberg expressed concern about a section of the report in which investigators said they could not find records to confirm that Mr. Williams had performed all the activities for which he billed the government .

Rilke writes that " the external shrinks into less and less " :
Where once an enduring house was ,
now a cerebral structure crosses our path , completely
belonging to the realm of concepts , as though it still stood in the brain .
Our age has built itself vast reservoirs of power ,
formless as the straining energy that it wrests from the earth .
Temples are no longer known .
In this context , it seems almost like an act of religious sarcasm that the MareNostrum computer – pictured at the top of this post – has been housed in a chapel .
( Of course , a consecrated supercomputer is certainly a stunning intellectual possibility – perhaps setting up the plot of Da Vinci Code 2 , wherein future archaeologists discover that the Vatican is not a complex of buildings at all but a fully functioning Jesuit supercomputer ) .
In any case , because all harddrives are actually geological objects – careful rearrangements of minerals under the influence of manmade magnetic fields – then these are mathematical terrains in the most exciting sense : the surface of the earth dreaming of spherical velocities inside otherwise undetectable stellar detonations .
[ Images : Two close - ups of cerebral machines .
Simon Norfolk ] .
Finally ,
So if I were forced to take issue with the existence of these machines , it would not be because of their use in modeling new nuclear warheads – as Norfolk makes clear they do – but in something far more secondary , even faintly absurd : what I 'd call the lack of a supercomputer poetics , or a more imaginative role for these machines to play in our literary and even religious lives .
Oracular , Delphic , radically non-secular : they are either all or none of the above .
( With sincere thanks to " The supercomputers I 'm showing here are powerful almost beyond human understanding , " photographer Simon Norfolk explains , describing his extraordinary new images of supercomputers and their architectural settings .
" They can map every molecule of the billions on a human DNA string ; scrutinise at the atomic level the collision between two pieces of plutonium in an exploding bomb ; or sketch the gravitational pull of every star in the galaxy upon every other star in the galaxy .
These are not questions that humans could grapple with given plenty of time , a notebook and a sharp pencil .
" Norfolk has also photographed computers used for " mapping and predicting global virus outbreaks " and for " simulating automotive crash tests .
" These computers , Norfolk continues , " are omniscient and omnipresent and these are not qualities in which we find a simulacrum of ourselves – these are qualities that describe the Divine .

In almost supernaturally sterile rooms , these angelic landscapes of silicon quietly hum their way through introspective worlds of calculation : derivatives , logorithms , advanced topologies .
One could , in fact , imagine a whole new series of Duino Elegies , written by a posthumous Rainer Maria Rilke , in terrified praise of these cloistered machines – machines Rilke seems to describe preemptively in his " Seventh Elegy , " where the " annihilator " meets the " Angel .

In any case , because all harddrives are actually – careful rearrangements of minerals under the influence of manmade magnetic fields – then these are mathematical terrains in the most exciting sense : the surface of the earth dreaming of spherical velocities inside otherwise undetectable stellar detonations .
Finally , Giordano Bruno , following Giulio Camillo , wrote extensively about the idea of a Memory Palace , or Memory Theater .
As Victoria Nelson tells us , the basic idea was that an " esoterically trained memory was a godlike vessel for encapsulating the entire universe within a single human mind . "
This was part of what Nelson calls a Neoplatonic " quasi- religion " that " venerated memory as an organ possessing magical and world - ordering powers . "
Neoplatonists believed that " the whole cosmos could be ' memorized ' in a much more overt imitatio dei and by this act magically incorporated into the human organism " – or , of course , into the air - cooled circuits of a supercomputer .
So if I were forced to take issue with the existence of these machines , it would not be because of their use in modeling new nuclear warheads – as Norfolk makes clear they do – but in something far more secondary , even faintly absurd : what I 'd call the lack of a , or a more imaginative role for these machines to play in our literary and even religious lives .
Oracular , Delphic , radically non-secular : they are either all or none of the above .

Pierce Brosnan has starred in four James Bond films
Paul Haggis , who is working on the script for Casino Royale , said : " It 's going to be good .
" We 're trying to reinvent Bond .
He 's 28 - no Q , no gadgets . "
Producers have still not decided who will play the spy in Casino Royale , which is due out next year .
The most recent star , Pierce Brosnan , is 52 .
A wide array of actors , including Daniel Craig , Clive Owen and Dougray Scott , have been mooted as possible contenders .
Paul Haggis wrote Oscar - winning film Million Dollar Baby
The book was also one of the most violent in the series , with the heroic secret agent taking a beating from his rival Le Chiffre , and gadget - master Q was not present .
Casino Royale was turned into a spoof spy movie in 1967 , with David Niven in the lead role .
The new film , which will be the 21st in the franchise , will be directed by Martin Campbell , who was in charge of GoldenEye .
Paul Haggis has been receiving critical acclaim for his movie Crash , which is set against the backdrop of Los Angeles and deals with racism .
The Canadian - born film - maker also wrote the screenplay for the Oscar - winning Million Dollar Baby .
First of all , the attack against the Pirate Bay was highly unsuccessful – they only stayed down for a couple of days before they were back in full force .
Stronger than ever thanks to the widespread media attention .
Subsequently several sources reported that the MPAA initiated the attack , by directly influencing Swedish authorities on governmental level , in this case the Ministry of Justice , to intervene in this specific case , which is considered illegal in Sweden ( the term is “ minister rule ” ) .
It also turned out that the US had threatened to put Sweden on WTO ’s black list because they did n’t take the Pirate Bay down , something that should ’ve made the Swedish government move even quicker .
What they did was that they hinted to the prosecutor in this case that the government ‘ expected quick results ’ in this matter .
The prosecutor had written a PM a while back that it was impossible to convict the Pirate Bay , but after some letters from the MPAA and this not so subtle hint from , what I think was the Secretary of State , he changed his mind .
When Swedish television published documents that proved this , there was some intense outburst for a while in the media , and this only worked to give the piracy movement more sympathies .
Their anthology , Copy me , sold out and a new edition will be released in a few days .
PiratbyrÃ¥n , which is a Swedish pro-piracy think tank , had their server seized at the same time and it was in police custody until just the other day .
Between the legal efforts to get their equipment back and other other lobbying , PiratbyrÃ¥n managed to gather similar and supporting groups around Scandinavia to launch an international lobby organization , which was given the name Pro Piracy Lobby .
Right now , PPL is in contact with groups in a dozen countries that is interested in joining .
Secondly , the Pirate Party had already existed for about half a year , but all this attention also gave wings in their sails , and they had thousands of new members in a matter of weeks .
Suddenly , they had transformed into the largest party without parliament seats .
In Sweden , you get seats in the parliament if you get four percent of the votes .
As we speak , the Pirate Party has almost as many members as the Green Party , which is a party that supports the current government , and without them , the current government can’t maintain their majority
This leads the Pirate Party to believe that if they get into the parliament they can fill such a vital role , and thereby make a big difference .
Worth noting is that some unofficial gallups from various sources indicate that the Pirate Party is the most likely party for a Swedish first - time voter to choose on election day .
This success has also led to pirate parties forming in a number of other countries : France , Italy , USA , Belgium , Austria , and very recently also Germany , Spain and Russian .
There is also one forming in the UK .
Together , they have founded PP - International , which is an international collaboration forum / group to exchange experiences , ideas and such , and Sweden has a very important role here .
The general elections are being held in the end of September , and the election campaigns are becoming hotter and hotter .
The Pirate Party has decided that what they have now , ideas and ideology , strategy and policies , is what they ’re going to run , no need to do any additions or changes now – all energy is put on the election campaign , and the work will be focused very strongly on this until after the election .
What happens after that will depend completely on how the election turns out , and here are many alternatives :
On one scenario , the Pirate Party gets their 4 % , which few within the party doubt they will .
In that case they will move to become influential in the forming of the government .
In Sweden , the prime minister is elected by the parliament , which means that he or she must have a majority of the MPs behind him / her .
No party ever gets that many seats , and so , a party that will form a government must seek support from another party , who then gets a situation where they can influence the government .
This is a position that the Pirate Party seeks .
Their parliamentary work will depend heavily on whether they succeed or not .
Outside the parliament , there is much to be done .
If a party gets more than 2.5 % of the votes , they will have state subsidiaries that allow them to employ a few people full - time to work for them .
The amount of money rises with , I think , every extra .5 % of the total votes .
These will of course be used to have people working full time on strenghthening the party , and help with the local groups – up to now , all members of the Pirate Party works without pay for this idea that they support .
A few full - timers would be nice to do alot of the foot - work .
Also , more and more local groups will be formed , and these will do the work locally , mostly making the Pirate Party seen in their surroundings , as the Pirate Party wo n’t run in local elections .
There will be a lot of local organizing being done .
Also , they will probably put down alot of work in helping the pirate parties around the world via PP - International .
In the long run , the Pirate Party will aim for the election to the European Parliament in 2009 , where it ’s easier to get in .
A party that receives 1 % of the votes in an election has the right to have their ballots placed at voting locations by the election authorities at that place .
Thus , there is a good possibility the Pirate Party gains even more in the EP elections than in the Swedish general ones .
In any way , there is an exciting few years we have ahead of us .
Google yesterday underscored its ambition to expand beyond its core internet - search business and into traditional media when it announced a deal to acquire a radio - advertising group for up to $ 1.2bn ( £ 680 m ) .
The agreement follows a deal struck last year when Google bought up space in technology magazines to resell to its online advertising clients .
With about $ 6bn in cash on its books , Google is rapidly expanding into new areas of business and new geographies .
The company allows its engineers one day a week to work on their own projects to provide a pipeline of potential money - spinning ideas .
The company said it is buying the privately held dMarc Broadcasting for an initial $ 102 m in cash .
If certain performance targets are hit over the next three years , Google could pay an additional $ 1.14bn , the company said .
" Google is committed to exploring new ways to extend targeted , measurable advertising to other forms of media , " said Tim Armstrong , vice - president of advertising sales at the search engine .
DMarc uses an automated advertising platform designed to simplify the sales , scheduling , delivery and tracking of radio advertising .
Broadcasters are able to use the technology to manage the scheduling and placing of advertising to minimise radio station costs as well .
The company , based in Newport Beach , California , is run by brothers Chad and Ryan Steelberg .
Google aims to integrate the business with its AdWords platform .
AdWords places relevant advertising on Google search results pages as well as on partner sites , such as the New York Times online and Earthlink .
The company said the addition of dMarc would provide AdWords advertisers with an additional outlet to promote their goods or services .
Google confirmed in September that it had dipped its toes into print advertising sales .
The company bought space in specialist titles such as PC Magazine and Maximum PC to resell to its existing advertising base .
The company at the time said the scheme was a test and would not elaborate further .
But it is clearly not satisfied with sitting on the rapidly growing market for search - related advertising .
In November it provided advertisers with another service , trialling " click - to - call " sales , where web users can phone an advertiser using a voice - over - IP connection .
Shares in Google keep marching higher - they are now five times the $ 85 offer price when the company joined the market 18 months ago .
The brokerage firm Bear Stearns earlier this month lifted its price target for the next year from $ 360 to $ 550 .
Piper Jaffray expects the shares to hit $ 600 this year .
One analyst at the brokerage Caris & Company speculated that the shares could reach as much as $ 2,000 apiece .
The market currently values the business at more than $ 130bn .
But doubts could creep in on Wall Street if Google strays too far from the internet search - related advertising business .
Radio in the United States has been in a slump .
The company had investors guessing when it raised an additional $ 4bn in a secondary share offering last August , adding to the $ 3bn of cash it already had in the bank .
At the time , Google said the money was for " general corporate purposes " including potential acquisitions .
Last month it used $ 1bn of that money to take a 5 % stake in the internet service provider America Online .
The deal with dMarc Broadcasting will have analysts widening their lenses to work out what Google might buy next .
" Do n't be surprised , " the firm warned at the IPO " if we place smaller bets in areas that seem very speculative or even strange . "
Google has been throwing off new ideas and products at such a rapid rate that the firm last year launched an internal project called " fusion " aimed at trying to bring some of the technologies together .
One result of that effort has been the launch of a personalised Google home page , including news feeds , local cinema listings , stock prices and ultimately advertising .
The firm has in effect created an internet portal that could eventually rival Yahoo or MSN .
The company 's revenue last year was around $ 4bn .
Among other recent launches from Google , the firm earlier this month announced the Google Video Store , allowing consumers to buy and rent content from the likes of CBS , ITN and Sony BMG .

Causal Relationships of Wishful Thinking
Salaries in games are typically lower than anywhere else in the software industry .
Work weeks in the game industry tend to be very long .
Job security is very , very limited .
I will touch on these in more detail in the next couple of sections .
Meanwhile , remember this : most of us experience constant pressures from publishers or bosses who are worried they 'll go out of business , or that the profits they contribute to the parent company will not be high enough ( or higher than last year 's by a margin that outperforms the competition ) to avoid being the targets of the next layoff .
So , if you care to join us , do n't expect a 24 - hour a day party , because you wo n't get it , and you wo n't last long in the industry .

The Incredible Coolness of Workaholism
Next time you 're at a newsstand , pick up a copy of Fortune , Forbes or any number of other big - business papers and magazines .
( Wear gloves , because that stuff can burn your skin ) .
One thing you 'll notice is that every single article on the software industry uses buzzwords like " fast - paced environment " , " Jolt Cola " and " competitive work ethic " .
What they mean is that everyone there works harder than a Roman galley slave .
And for some reason , the writers seem to think it 's the coolest thing in the world .
Apart from the fact that bosses who are workaholics demand the same from their underlings , the main reason why the press has made 60 - hour work weeks " in " can be summed up in the following :
Most business folk believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that the average joe will consistently achieve more in 60 hours than in 40 , and that if he falls off the pace , he can always be replaced by someone who 'll do better .
Since the average joe is usually not paid extra for these 20 hours , the additional production is free .
Free work makes rich folk get richer faster .
The press is owned by rich folk , who would like nothing more than if their own employees ( in and out of their press holdings ) would just say : " Gee , it seems so manly [ or womanly ] of all these computer geeks to spend all this extra time at work instead of raising families or growing bonsais ; why do n't I do the same ? "

In the Long Term , We'll All be Dead
What makes it worse in our case is that , given the very tight channel - to - market , the low royalties that development houses receive on unit sales and the high cost of producing games , very few titles actually make money .
So , the typical life cycle of a game studio looks a little like this :
When you work at a start - up , money is always short , so salaries have to be low and work weeks long , otherwise the product will never ship .
And when it does ship , in all likelihood , it wo n't break even , and the studio will either shut down or be bought out .
( The dream scenario , of course , is to manage to make enough money to keep the studio independent until the big break .
These things have been known to happen , but they are the exception .
If you are the insecure type who can't bear to change jobs , go look elsewhere . )
Now , the best case is that it will be bought out by a big game publisher .
However , big publishers have big overhead and lots of titles , not all of which will break even , so even if your product makes tons of money , not much ( if any ) of it will trickle down to the production staff .
The worst case is that the studio will NOT be bought out by a game publisher , but rather by some traditional media company thinking it would be just too cool to get into this internet thingy .
Unfortunately , traditional media folk are baffled by the concept of people under 40 making living wages , so the situation actually gets worse , no matter how much money the games earn .
Compared to games , a good programmer with a college degree can make 20 % - 50 % more in any other field of the software industry .
True story : I make more as an AI researcher ( with no responsibility for anything but myself and my own little projects ) than I ever did as head of a game studio .
The bottom line : when you are in an industry where lots of young ( i.e. , cheap ) people want to work , like games , you always have downward pressure on wages and upward pressure on workloads .
That 's the law of capitalism .
I did n't say it was a good law , but it 's the law .

Dilbert and Daikatana
No , I am not going to bash ION Storm .
They have enough problems .
What I will say , though , is that being in the game industry does not shield you from the realities of the corporate world .
I have worked in all kinds of companies , both in and out of the game industry , from a one - person shop to a multi-billion dollar transnational , in both the private and public sectors .
And if there is one thing that I can tell you , it is that you can have a boss who is a control freak , a workaholic and / or a hateful s.o.b. wherever you go .
I have had to live with all of the above , and the fact that we were making award - winning children 's edutainment or PlayStation 3D platformers instead of lunch pails did n't make it one damn bit better .
In fact , I contend ( as did a guy whose name I forget at an online developer 's conference I attended about a year ago ) that this industry is a bozo magnet , because there is the potential for quick riches and no real barriers to entry .
To set up shop as a doctor or an engineer , you must prove a certain level of competency , but anyone can proclaim themselves experts in interactive software .
I have seen big media companies buy successful game studios and replace the guys who used to run them by 42 - year old bowling alley managers , just because the CEO believed that they 'd look " safer " than 27 - year old artists at the next shareholders ' meetings .
Use your imagination to figure out the results .
Even if the boss is cool , the co-workers may not be .
And even if everyone is just dandy , the money may run out , and there may be layoffs .
A game company is a company .
Keep that in mind .
And one more thing : corporate culture rarely changes , so if a company sucks today , do n't bother sticking around hoping it will get better on its own .
I mean , I was head of studio at one of my previous jobs , so I was theoretically in as good a position to influence the work environment as anyone could ever hope for .
Did n't work .
Unless you are in a position to start a new shop and mold it into your ideal , or you somehow stick to a job for 300 years , the company you go into is pretty much going to be the company you leave .
If it works for you , great .
If it does n't , get out now and save yourself the aggravation .

Are you depressed yet ?
The game industry can be a great place to work .
If you ever contribute to a hit game , the emotional highs will be unbelievable , and you may never need to worry about unemployment again .
If you are the ambitious type , you can get more responsibilities at a younger age than anywhere else .
If you are really good at what you do , no one will care where ( or sometimes if ) you went to college .
And , when all is said and done , coding a 3D engine or drawing a snappy cartoon intro still beats about 94.8765 % of all the jobs in the Western World .
However , making fun and games is n't all fun and games .
It 's serious work , harder than most .
Welcome to the unreal world .
So , if you care to join us , do n't expect a 24 - hour a day party , because you wo n't get it , and you wo n't last long in the industry . [ size = " 5 " ]

Apart from the fact that bosses who are workaholics demand the same from their underlings , the main reason why the press has made 60 - hour work weeks " in " can be summed up in the following :
Yeah , we 've all seen 'em .
The bright - eyed , eager kids who , upon learning that we work in the interactive entertainment industry , drop to their hands and knees and beg us for our secret .
How did we do it ?
There are millions of them .
Mostly guys , but the number of girls is getting surprisingly high .
They 're kind of naive , and maybe a little annoying , but in a charming kind of way , since they worship the week - old leftover pizza crusts we reluctantly throw out .
They'd do anything to be like us , up to and including pledging their souls to the denizen of the fuming tar pits of Hades of our choice .
Sure , they feign to listen when we warn them about the crazy hours or the lousy pay .
But nothing registers .
To their untrained eyes , making games seems to be somewhat akin to a mild all - day orgasm .
And then , something terrible happens to them .
They finally get a job in the industry .[ size = " 5 " ]
First things first : let 's get rid of the overwhelming subliminal assumption beneath this fascination for the game industry , i.e. , thatgames andgames are mere variations on the same theme .
Believe me , they have nothing in common .
Thank God for that , too .
Think about it for a minute .
These days , the typical game is considered a success if it provides the player with about 40 hours of enjoyment .
Forty hours .
About a week .
Now , developing that very same game will take , on average , two years .
Please reflect on the staggering implications of what you just read .
Unless you are a tester , or you happen to be designing chess or , you will work on your game one hundred times longer than your customer will play it .
O - N - E H- U - N - D-R-E-D.
Please imagine how much fun it would be to play the same game , and only that game , every single day , eight ( twelve ) hours a day , for two years .
Yep , that 's right , would n't be any fun at all .
After a month , you 'd be hopelessly bored .
Two months , and you 'd grow warts at the mere mention of it .
By the time you'd be ready to ship the sucker , you ...
Well , you would have killed everyone else on the team long before , so you never would ship .
Developing games has its own rewards , of course ; otherwise , no one would bother .
But it is hard work , and nothing , nothing like playing games all the time .
Get that through your thick skulls ![ size = " 5 " ]
Now that we have established that developing games is real work , an interesting question arises : since the final product is so much fun , should n't the process of creating it be just as great ?
Well , it 's possible to have a blast in a game studio , but the final product will only be part of the reason .
And not necessarily a big part , either .
Should we expect , because we are producing entertainment , to have more satisfying jobs than people in other industries ?
Unfortunately , no .
Anyone who has worked a day on a movie set knows it .
We should , too .
The game industry is just that , an industry .
And not a particularly profitable one , either .
The sad truth is that , to break even , a game must outsell the industry average by a ridiculous margin ; most PC games sell between 15,000 and 40,000 , while it is difficult to make money on sales of less than 150,000 units .
The consequences of this are manifold , and include the following :
And here is more of what we can expect from this show :
This is the first Hollywood production I 've seen that honestly depicts how the Clinton administration repeatedly bungled the capture of Osama Bin Laden .
One astonishing sequence in " The Path to 9/11 " shows the CIA and the Northern Alliance surrounding Bin Laden 's house in Afghanistan .
They 're on the verge of capturing Bin Laden , but they need final approval from the Clinton administration in order to go ahead .
They phone Clinton , but he and his senior staff refuse to give authorization for the capture of Bin Laden , for fear of political fall - out if the mission should go wrong and civilians are harmed .
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger in essence tells the team in Afghanistan that if they want to capture Bin Laden , they 'll have to go ahead and do it on their own without any official authorization .
That way , their necks will be on the line - and not his .
The astonished CIA agent on the ground in Afghanistan repeatedly asks Berger if this is really what the administration wants .
Berger refuses to answer , and then finally just hangs up on the agent .
The CIA team and the Northern Alliance , just a few feet from capturing Bin Laden , have to abandon the entire mission .
Bin Laden and Al Qaeda shortly thereafter bomb the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya , killing over 225 men , women , and children , and wounding over 4000 .
The episode is a perfect example of Clinton - era irresponsibility and
The producer of the show , Cyrus Nowrasteh , makes it clear he has a pro-Republican point of view in this interview :
FP : When you refer to the failed effort to stop Bin Laden in the 1990s , this was obviously the time of Bill Clinton .
How much do you think his administration made us vulnerable to 9/11 ?
Nowrasteh :
The 9/11 report details the Clinton 's administration 's response -- or lack of response -- to Al Qaeda and how this emboldened Bin Laden to keep attacking American interests .
The worst example is the response to the October , 2000 attack on the U.S.S.
Cole in Yemen where 17 American sailors were killed .
There simply was no response .
Nothing . "
We know this is simply bullshit .
Yet ABC is airing this propaganda and will undoubtedly promote the hell out of it in the next two weeks .
Is n't it great working against the stacked deck of the corporate media ?
Ahhhhhh .... Democracy !
" The Path to 9/11 , " by honestly depicting the unfolding of events over eight years , makes it clear that most of the conspiracy leading up to 9/11 was hatched during the seven years of the Clinton administration , and that since Bush was in power for only eight months when 9/11 occurred , he can hardly be blamed for the entire disaster .
So who is the greater threat to Democracy ?
Terrorists or media consolidation ?
Our elected president , Al Gore , just said today :
EDINBURGH , Scotland - Former Vice President Al Gore said Sunday ever - tighter political and economic control of the media is a major threat to democracy .
Democracy is under attack , " Gore told an audience at the Edinburgh International Television Festival .
" Democracy as a system for self - governance is facing more serious challenges now than it has faced for a long time .
William Rivers
Pitt has an excellent refutation of all this " blame Clinton for 9/11 " b.s. over at Truthout , and even more truthiness compiled in a " datadump " over at Democratic Underground right now .
It 's something we should all brush up on to face the coming deluge .
Because heads up , folks !
It 's an election year , and the propaganda is gonna come fast and furious !
From all sides , and from all corners of the corporate media universe .
It 's gonna be a bumpy ride .
In 2003 , the Hubble Space Telescope took the image of a millennium , an image that shows exactly how insignificantly small we are .
Anyone who understands what this image represents is forever changed by it .
If you are the kind of person who has an over - exaggerated sense of his own importance , just take a few minutes of your time and watch this video .
I can guarantee that you will be humbled by what you see in it .

A looong time ago I complained that “ Dell does n’t think like their users think .
When you go to their website , the first question they ask is what kind of buyer you are : home , small business , large business , etc. I do n’t know what I am ! ”
They ’ve never stopped trying to segment their customers .
They seem to know that people hate it .
Today on their corporate blog ( where , I daresay , you ’ll never see comments about politics ) , they brag about their new homepage design .
They mention the three things that everyone told them they needed to fix , and number 3 was that whole segmentation business .
Quoting Dell :
We still ask you to identify what ‘ segment ’ you best represent .
Why ?
Just show me all the products you offer and let me decide . . .
Seems like a fairly easy thing to do …
Ca n’t be that hard , right ?
Unfortunately , it is a bit more complicated than just changing links .
When you call Dell on the phone we have specific phone numbers depending on your customer type .
This way we can offer you the right product , the best solutions & accessories , and the proper warranty / services coverage for your system .
We think this creates greater value by providing information that is relevant to your specific needs .
This business about creating “ greater value ” is a bit of a whitewash .
We all know exactly what ’s going on .
They ’re trying to charge business customers more .
That ’s all there is to it .
It ’s Pricing 101 .
Camels and Rubber Duckies .
Please do n’t make up stories about how you ’re offering us the right system .
Somehow Apple and IBM / Lenovo have been happy to sell computers on the Internet to people without needing to know their “ customer type . ”
The reason this pisses people off is that nobody likes to feel like they ’re getting ripped off .
You feel less ripped off buying a way - overpriced Apple MacBook Pro because everyone else is paying the same price , and Apple is hardcore about not letting any dealers sell it for less .
Whenever we buy servers from Dell , even though they eventually offer us a price that beats the competition , we still have to spend a week or two negotiating , gathering competitive bids , etc .
By the time we place our order the price we pay is about 20 % to 30 % less than the price advertised on the web , and we ’re still not sure if we could have paid less .
Bottom line : I ’d love to just order the damn servers from their website , clicking on the links to configure it .
Dell would have my money sooner and would n’t have to pay any sales people to talk to me on the phone .
But you ’ve trained me to negotiate every time if I do n’t want to pay the sucker price , so now I have no choice .
Unfortunately , this is obviously a decision that starts all the way at the top , and the poor designers working on fixing the website clearly do n’t have the authority to change the way Dell does business .
THIS IS QUITE OLD AND REMAINS FOR PURPOSES OF CODE ARCHEOLOGY
How I Did It : RubyStuff.com
Some of the gory details on building rubystuff.com , a Ruby - built site for Ruby stuff .
No claims are made as to whether this is the best , or even right , way to do this .
This is simply how I did it .
James Britt , December 3 2005
Overview
rubystuff.com is a storefront site for a variety of Ruby paraphernalia , such as T - shirts , coffee mugs , and tote bags .
The reality is that the different items are actually sold through a number of CafePress sites ; rubystuff.com makes it easy to find and see all the choices in one place .
CafePress makes it snake - simple to create a free on - line shop .
There is the restriction , though , that each shop offers only one version of each item .
In order to have a full range of Ruby products , then the choices were to pay CafePress for a more sophisticated store site , or have a separate site for each design .
I choose the latter .
The last thing I wanted to do for rubystuff was hand - craft the myriad product pages , so I thought about how best to dynamically construct the site from the CafePress content .
Poking about the HTML source for different CafePress product pages , I saw that the markup was predictable enough to facilitate screen scraping .
Always mindful of the goal of being the laziest person in Rubyville , I cast about for tools to do most of the heavy lifting for me .
I had previously spent some time with Michael Neumann ’s WWW :: Mechanize I thought it would make a good first tool .
I was right , and here are the results
Mechanize
WWW :: Mechanize is available from the Wee project page on RubyForge .
You can also install at as a gem .
It depends on the htmltools lib shipped with the NARF library .
Mechanize simplifies the retrieval , tidying , and access of HTML pages .
You tell a Mechanize agent to get a page from an URL , and it provides a nice OO model into assorted page objects , such as form fields and links .
It does so while parsing the cooked HTML , creating special node sets based on certain element names .
For example , when Mechanize encounters an anchor element , it uses the corresponding REXML node to add a new item to the links set :
@links << Link.new ( node )
Mechanize has such a nice architecture that shortly after I first poked around in it I found I could easily add my own hooks for creating custom node sets .
After a few E- mails with Herr Neumann and some code patches , this became a part Mechanize .
Clearly , I ’m biased , but I think this is one of the features that makes Mechanize so sweet .
I hand it a URL , and I get back a set of custom business objects built from HTML nodes . #
cafepress.rb
The code needs to require the Mechanize lib , of course , and you may want to log stuff when you ’re developing to see what ’s going on if you are n’t getting the results you expect .
( Side note :
These comments have been added after the code was already complete .
The final code was a result of playing around and experimenting and refactoring ; no unit tests were harmed in its creation .
If I thought the code was going to get much larger I would probably start over and use TDD , but do n’t always start out that way , preferring to test the waters , so to speak , with sketch code that often just evolves into Good Enough production code . ) #
require ' mechanize '
require ' logger '
CP_LOGGER = Logger.new ' cp.log '
CP_LOGGER .level = Logger :: INFO
We ’re also going to need some code to encapsulate the business objects generated from the HTML parsing .
More on that later .
require ' product '
This is the main class .
It handles fetching the HTML and outputting XML .
The whole process of creating the rubystuff.com site is split into multiple steps .
Ideally , we should be able just grab a bunch of remote HTML pages , extract the data needed , and spit out a nicely formated set of pages .
The reality is that many things can go wrong , such as network timeouts or goofy typos .
If you are doing any site scrapping you need to be considerate of your actions .
If you write your app to execute every step , end - to - end , all at once , then you may find yourself making countless
Web requests while trying to work out some final - step rendering detail .
This is bad .
It ’s rude to get banging on someone ’s server , and even if you are acting within whatever terms of service apply you run the risk of getting blacklisted for excessive page hits .
To build the rubystuff.com pages , there is a batch script that first grabs the HTML and writes a reformatted version to disk .
A separate step takes those disk files and munges them up to create the final site .
( If I knew of a way to get Mechanize to read from a disk file rather than having to make an actual HTTP request I would first save the raw HTML to disk and then work form those .
Suggestions welcome . )
class CafeFetcher
Some Web sites will reject your scripted HTTP requests with a 403 Forbidden if it does n’t have a clear idea what sort of user agent is calling .
I could n’t decide what user - agent string to pass in the request headers , so I decided to pick one at random from a static list : #
UA = [
' Windows IE 6 ' ,
' Windows Mozilla ' ,
' Mac Safari ' ,
' Mac Mozilla ' ,
' Linux Mozilla ' ,
' Linux Konqueror ' ]
An instance gets created with a few options .
You need to pass in a list of site URLs to hit , and a hash that maps product category keys with a regular expression .
It turns out that the CafePress pages use img elements that contain all the data needed .
The image URL itself has a product code ; the alt attribute has a product description .
Nice .
But to categorize each item , the code needs a regex to identify the content .
The code will loop over the set of URLs .
Rather than hit the site bang !
bang ! bang ! , I have a pause value built in .
There ’s some set - up code here as well , for storing results . #
def initialize opts = {}
@stores = opts [ : stores ]
@product_matches = opts [ : product_matches ]
@pause = opts [ : pause ] || 5
@prods = {}
@product_matches.keys.each { | pt| @prods [ pt ] = {} }
end
The real goal of all our parsing is to produce two types of XML files .
One is a product description .
It ’s short , and simply describes the important features ( e.g. name , price , item ID ) of an item .
This method writes gets that data from each product object and writes it to disk
def write_product_xml data_dir
@product_matches.keys.each do |pt|
@prods [ pt ].values.sort.each do |prod|
File.open ( " #{data_dir}/#{pt}.#{prod.pid}.xml " , " wb " ) do |file |
file.puts prod.to_xml
end
end
end
end
We also want to write out an RSS file that lists all products of the same type across the set of URLs .
Another application will re-use this to build the final Web site . #
def rss1 prod_type
items_list_re = /<\?( channel ) \s +( items ) .\?>/
full_items_re = /<\? ( items ) \s+( full ) .\?>/
rss_template = " < ?xml version = ' 1.0 ' ?>
<rdf:RDF
xmlns:rdf= 'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
xmlns:dc= 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/'
xmlns: image= ' http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/image/'
xmlns= 'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/' >
< channel rdf:about= ' http://rss.rubystuff.com/rss/#{prod_type.to_s}'>
< title > Ruby Stuff Store : #{prod_type.to_s.capitalize}</title >
< link >
http://rss.rubystuff.com/rss/#{prod_type.to_s}</link>
< description>#{prod_type.to_s.capitalize}</description >
< items >
< rdf : Seq >
<? channel items ?>
< /rdf :Seq >
</items >
</ channel >
<? items full ?>
< /rdf:RDF > "
item_list = @prods [ prod_type ].keys.sort.map { |k| " < rdf:li resource = ' # {k} ' /> " }.join "
"
rss_template.gsub !
items_list_re , item_list
item_set = @prods [ prod_type ].values.sort
items = item_set.map{ |item|
item.to_rss1_item
}.join "
"
rss_template.gsub full_items_re , items
end
The action starts when we go fetch each page .
This method loops over the list of site URLs , uses mechanize to extract a set of products and assign assorted details .
def fetch_site_products url
agent = WWW ::Mechanize.new { |a| a.log = Logger.new ( STDERR ) }
agent.user_agent_alias = UA [ rand UA.size ]
This is an important part :
We tell Mechanize that when it comes across an element with the name ‘ img ’ it should use the corresponding parse - tree node to create a Product instance and save it in its watch list .
The code is cleaner because once we ’re done parsing HTML we can focus on ( albeit simple ) business objects , not HTML chunks .
agent.watch_for_set = { 'img ' =>
Product }
page = agent.get url
products = page.watches [ 'img ' ].select { |i| i.src =~ / _store / i }
products .each do |i|
i.set_full_link url
assign_product_category i
end
end
As images are converted into product objects the code needs to track what sort of products we have so it can write it disk later .
def assign_product_category product
@product_matches.each do |key , re|
@prods [ key ] [ product.src ] = product if product .
alt =~ re
end
end
Helper stuff :
def product_types
@product_matches.keys
end
def products
@prods
end
Each URL is fetched and processed .
Because we ’re dealing with network calls , the code will retry the HTTP request a few times if there is an error before it gives up .
Note that this method returns a reference to self so that we can chain method calls later on .
It ’s a neat hack I stole from someplace .
def get
@stores.each do |store|
redo_cnt = 0
max_redo = 1
STDERR.puts " Get #{store} "
begin
fetch_site_products ( ' http://www.cafepress.com/' + store.to_s.strip )
rescue Exception
redo_cnt += 1
CP_LOGGER.warn " Error fetching #{store.to_s.strip} : #{$ !} "
CP_LOGGER .warn " retry #{redo_cnt} ... "
retry unless redo_cnt > max_redo
redo_cnt = 0
end
print ( "
Sleep ...
" )
sleep @pause
end
self
end
end
Setting Up and Executing
That ’s the core code .
The next step is to define our parameters and grab the sites .
An output directory is defined for the resulting XML files , and a list of site URLs is defined .
The list shown here is much shorter then what I actually use ; there are about 10 or so CafePress shops that are bundled into rubystuff.com .
if __FILE__ == $ 0
data_dir = '../ data '
stores = %w {
speedmetalruby
rubyonrailsshop
}
This hash is used to partition product image data into product categories .
CafePress has many more categories than I care to split out on rubystuff.com , so many things get lumped together .
product_matches = {
:mugs => /stein|mug/i ,
: shirts => / Tracksuit|shirt|Camisole|Tank|Tee|Ringer|apron|Raglan|Jersey|bib|creeper/i ,
: hats => / hat |black cap /i ,
:mousepads => / mouse / i ,
: stickers => / sticker /i ,
: assorted => /clock|sticker|teddy bear|pillow|frame|journal|light switch|tile|calendar|cards /i ,
:buttons_and_magnets => /button|magnet /i ,
: bags => / bag/i ,
: stamps => / postage / i ,
: posters => / poster / i ,
:undies => / boxer|thong /i ,
: media => /data cd|book|audio/i
}
An instance of CafeFetcher is created with our spiffy parameters , and set to work grabbing and writing :
f = CafeFetcher.new ( : stores => stores , : product_matches => product_matches )
f.get.write_product_xml data_dir
f.product_types.each do |pt|
File.open ( " #{data_dir}/#{pt}.rss " , " wb " ) do|file|
file.puts ( f.rss1 pt )
end
end
The Web site has a page listing all the underlying CafePress sites , and that gets built here using assorted string - munging calls :
shoplist_tmpl = IO.read ' shoplist.html '
shop_tmpl = "
< div class= 'item '>
< a href= '
http://www.cafepress.com/SHOP'>
< img src='/images/logos/SHOP.png ' alt =' SHOP ' />
</a>
</div >
"
shop_list = " "
stores .each do |store|
shop_list << shop_tmpl.gsub( ' SHOP ' , store )
end
shoplist_tmpl.gsub !
' SHOPS ' , shop_list
File.open ( '../public/shoplist.html' , ' wb ' ) { |f| f.print shoplist_tmpl }
end
Wrapping Up The Main Code
That ’s pretty much it .
I ’ve omitted the next part of the build process , which slurps in the RSS files and uses Ruby to perform XML transformations .
I have an article in the January 2006 issue of Dr. Dobbs that explains one way of doing this if you want to see how it might work .
There is , however , one more detail that must be explained : The Product class .
You can read about that here .

How do you feel about someone else making money off your content ?
Ryan 299 comments Latest by Felix ade
Anil makes an interesting observation regarding Flickr , Yahoo , and your content .
He uses Flickr and Yahoo as examples , but of course this relates to any community - based service build with user - generated content and supported by advertisers .
But interestingness in Flickr does n’t pay .
At least not yet .
Non -pro users are seeing ads around my photos , but Yahoo’s not sharing the wealth with me , even though I ’ve created a draw .
Flickr ’s plenty open , they ’re doing the right thing by any measure of the web as we saw it a year ago , or two years ago .
Today , though , openness around value exchange is as important as openness around data exchange .
The shift that is going on is pretty radical , actually .
The way it used to work was this :
You took a photo , someone used it ( to make whatever they ’re doing better ) , and you got paid for it .
They paid you for your talent .
Now , hundreds of thousands of people are taking photos , uploading them to a site like Flickr , making Flickr better , and Yahoo is reaping the financial rewards , not the photographers .
That ’s a pretty big shift .
Yahoo is making money off the backs of the collective camera .
Maybe this is all OK .
Maybe people do n’t care .
But I have a feeling that will change once the smoke from this new experiment in collective media clears .
I wonder when the public will demand that Yahoo shares a portion of the revenues generated from ads on people ’s photos .
I guess you could say that they are sharing by proving the service for free .
I buy that point , but there will come a time when the scale is going to tip big time in Yahoo ’s favor .
They ’ll be giving you some storage and a place to put your photos ( and discover others ) and in return Yahoo will generate millions and millions of revenue on those ads .

What is hpc ?
Hpc is a tool - kit to record and display Haskell program coverage .
Hpc includes tools that instrument Haskell programs to record program coverage , run instrumented programs , and display the coverage information obtained .
Hpc works by applying a source - to - source transformation ; this transformation also generates as a by - product a program - index file ( . pix ) and module - index files ( . mix ) .
The transformed program is compiled with a library ; in addition to its usual run-time behaviour the program generates a coverage record in a program - ticks file ( .tix ) .
If the program is run more than once , coverage data is accumulated to reflect all runs .
Hpc provides coverage information of two kinds : source coverage and boolean - control coverage .
Source coverage is the extent to which every part of the program was used , measured at three different levels : declarations ( both top - level and local ) , alternatives ( among several equations or case branches ) and expressions ( at every level ) .
Boolean coverage is the extent to which each of the values True and False is obtained in every syntactic boolean context ( ie. guard , condition , qualifier ) .
Hpc displays both kinds of information in two different ways : textual reports with summary statistics ( hpc- report ) and sources with colour mark - up ( hpc- source ) .
Downloading
This version of hpc is available under a BSD - style license for free use by all sectors of the Haskell community .
The hpc-trans tool was based on components from the nhc98 compiler or from the hat tracing system , and we gladly acknowledge the contribution of the original authors .
The latest version is version 0.6.0.2 and can be found at :
Examples

Hpc toolkit
The Hpc Toolkit has three parts
A set of tools for instrumenting Haskell , and interpreting the results on a coverage run .
A set of scripts to make using these tools easier .
An open common file format , uses by all the tools .
There are currently three tools provided by hpc , as well as a new option for GHC 6.7 .
Tools
hpc-trans - translates Haskell into instrumented Haskell
hpc-report - Read the output of a coverage run , report a summary
hpc-markup - Read the output of a coverage run , markup the source
Compiler Options
- fhpc - a new GHC option , that automatically instruments Haskell programs on the fly , using a similar algorithm to hpc-trans .
Hpc scripts
hpc-build
hpc-run
Hpc file formats
There are two file formats used by Hpc externally , and one internally by hpc-trans .
tix - Coverage information generated by the execution of an instrumented program .
mix - Information about each tick - box inside a module , including style of tick box , and location in the source .
pix - used only by hpc-trans , stores a list
Example
Suppose you have run your tests and collected the coverage results in a . tix file ( you do n't have to do anything to collect the results - hpc will keep adding coverage information to the .tix file ) .
Now you want to see how good your testing was :
hpc report GenDesc.exe --hpcdir=..\src\.hpc --srcdir=..\src -- per- module --include=Utils.Substitution
-----< module Utils.Substitution >-----
65 % expressions used ( 59/90 ) 33 % boolean coverage ( 1/3 ) 0 % guards ( 0/1 ) , 1 always True 50 % ' if ' conditions ( 1/2 ) , 1 always True 100 % qualifiers ( 0/0 ) 62 % alternatives used ( 5/8 ) 66 % local declarations used ( 2/3 ) 71 % top - level declarations used ( 5/7 )
But you know that some of the source statements are assertions and should never be executed .
First create a draft overlay that provides 100 % coverage .
hpc draft -- hpcdir=..\src\.hpc --srcdir=..\src GenDesc.exe.tix > myDraft.txt
You can then create a . tix file from the overlay .
hpc overlay -- hpcdir=..\src\.hpc --srcdir=..\src myDraft.txt > myDraft.tix
And combine these two .tix files .
hpc combine GenDesc.exe.tix myDraft2.tix --union > idem.tix
Now you get a report that does n't include assertions e.g. calls to assertM and error ( although I 'm basing this on observation - I could n't find any documentation on this ) .
hpc report idem -- hpcdir=..\src\.hpc --srcdir=..\src -- per- module --include=Utils.Substitution
-----< module Utils.Substitution >-----
91 % expressions used ( 82/90 ) 33 % boolean coverage ( 1/3 ) 0 % guards ( 0/1 ) , 1 always True 50 % ' if ' conditions ( 1/2 ) , 1 always True 100 % qualifiers ( 0/0 ) 87 % alternatives used ( 7/8 ) 66 % local declarations used ( 2/3 ) 71 % top - level declarations used ( 5/7 )
But you still know that some of the functions should not be tested ; they are there just in case you need to make some performance improvements in the future .
Create an overlay file using the draft overlay as a template .
module " Utils.Substitution " { tick function " getFreesShallow " [ future ] ; tick function " getFreesUsingPadrec " [ future ] ; }
Create a . tix file from it .
hpc overlay -- hpcdir=..\src\.hpc --srcdir=..\src myAnnot.txt > myAnnot.tix
And then combine it with the automatically generated exclusions . tix file .
hpc combine idem.tix myAnnot.tix --union > excludeFuture.tix
Now our report gives us ( almost ) what we want : 100 % coverage .
hpc report excludeFuture -- hpcdir=..\src\.hpc --srcdir=..\src -- per- module --include=Utils.Substitution
-----< module Utils.Substitution >-----
100 % expressions used ( 90/90 ) 33 % boolean coverage ( 1/3 ) 0 % guards ( 0/1 ) , 1 always True 50 % ' if ' conditions ( 1/2 ) , 1 always True 100 % qualifiers ( 0/0 ) 100 % alternatives used ( 8/8 ) 100 % local declarations used ( 3/3 ) 100 % top - level declarations used ( 7/7 )
Sadly there is no documentation on how to exclude boolean coverage .
Hpc quirks
Hpc ( at least with 6.10.1 ) is not happy with literate haskell or with cpp .
Even if your file contains no cpp , hpc will give spurious results if you use the cpp option on the command line .
One way round both of these problems is to pre-process the source by hand with something like
ghc - E - optP - P -cpp Foo.hs
and then remove the line
{-# LINE 1 " Foo.hs " #-}
Do n't use strip on your executables .
I 'm guessing hpc stashes information in the executable which strip removes .
Hpc with a Cabal project
After installing HPC , you need to clear out your build with clean so every file can be built and enable coverage with configure :
cabal clean cabal configure -- enable - tests -- enable - coverage cabal test
Hpc with a Stack project
HPC can also be used easily from the Haskell tool stack [ 1 ] .
Similarly to cabal , you should first clear out your build such that every file gets rebuilt with coverage enabled .
After that , you can enable coverage and run the tests :
stack clean stack test -- coverage
We hope you find this tool - kit useful .

The murder of Alexander Litvinenko is an irresistible story , but it should n't have taken the death of one man to alert us to the fact that we have a serious problem with Putin 's Russia .
Whether Litvinenko's poisoning was ordered by the Kremlin or not , it has been obvious for some time that we are dealing with a regime whose contempt for democracy and human rights at home is matched by an increasingly aggressive and unilateralist approach to foreign policy .
Offstage from last week 's spy drama , a storm was brewing with far more profound long - term implications for our relations with Russia .
It was brought to a head by Poland 's decision to veto negotiations over a new cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia .
Poland 's grievances are perfectly valid .
Russia is not only violating an agreement on energy by using gas supplies as a political weapon , but it has banned Polish meat imports in an act of pure diplomatic spite .
Russia has now threatened to extend that ban to the whole of the EU from January .
Trade embargoes imposed for bogus health - and - safety reasons are fast becoming a favourite foreign - policy weapon for Russia .
Georgia and Moldova have been similarly targeted .
But the coercive use of energy policy gives greatest cause for concern .
Europe now depends on Russia for 25 % of its gas , a figure set to rise to 70 % by 2020 , at a time when Russian behaviour is becoming more belligerent .
Optimists point out that even during the Soviet era Russia remained a reliable energy supplier .
But this ignores one crucial difference .
Post - Yalta , the Soviet Union 's main objective was to maintain the status quo and preserve its sprawling empire with subsidies and military force .
For this it needed to trade with the west ; energy for hard currency .
But just as the west is no longer the only potential customer , Russia is no longer a status - quo power .
It is a revisionist power whose president publicly laments the collapse of the Soviet empire and seeks to restore its dominant position by fair means or foul .
Energy is now its instrument of choice .
It is a cardinal principle of Putin's hard nationalist outlook that the countries on Russia 's borders are not entitled to choose their political destinies .
That 's why Russia reacted so furiously to the rose and orange revolutions .
In this respect , Russo - European tensions reflect a fundamental clash of strategic cultures .
While modern Europe has embraced voluntary integration and the rule of international law , Putin 's foreign policy belongs to an older European tradition with its " spheres of influence " and great - power rivalries .
To the extent that the EU provides a pole of attraction for parts of the former Soviet Union that wish to escape this Hobbesian universe , Putin has come to see it as a geopolitical rival .
Russia 's role as an increasingly dominant energy supplier is sometimes said to be an example of " soft power " .
But there is nothing soft about cutting off gas supplies to a country such as Ukraine in the dead of winter .
It is an illegitimate instrument of intimidation .
Beyond Russia's " near abroad " , Putin combines measures to increase Europe 's dependency on Russian supplies with reminders that Asia provides an alternative outlet .
The idea is that Europe should take the hint and avoid disagreement with Moscow - a form of diplomatic self - policing known as " Finlandisation " .
European diplomacy should be aimed at presenting Russian policy makers with a clear choice .
They can have a constructive and profitable energy partnership on fair commercial terms , provided they renounce monopolistic practices and abandon the use of energy supplies for geopolitical advantage .
That means living up to their obligations under the energy charter treaty and ending their pipeline monopoly by signing the transit protocol .
Otherwise Europe will single - mindedly pursue a policy of energy independence by diversifying its energy mix , improving efficiency and building the supply infrastructure needed to access non-Russian sources .
There is no appetite for cold - war revivalism in Europe , but we will not develop an effective policy towards Russia until we get over the post - cold - war cringe of believing there is something shameful about standing up to a leader like Putin .
It is not " Russophobic " to oppose the hegemonic ambitions of the Kremlin any more than it is " anti-American " to object to the unipolar pretensions of neoconservative policy makers in Washington .
Both reflect a mindset that reveres power politics and rejects sovereign equality as the basis for international relations .
That 's not the European way , and it 's time we made that clear .

Opera released a 9.0 public beta version last week .
The new and improved Opera browser now supports . torrent downloads .
The question is :
Do we really need BitTorrent support in a browser ?
First a quick review of Opera ‘s BitTorrent support :
Opening torrents
If you click on a . torrent file , a window pops up asking you where you want to save the file .
The same window tells you that you ’re about to share the file with other people ( see pic ) .
Strange is the fact that you ca n’t specify a default download folder , so you can disable this popup screen and start the download immediately .
memory usage
Opera is generally not using much memory and CPU .
I was a ‘ bit ’ skeptical if this would be the same while downloading a torrent since most torrent clients use about 30.000 K memory .
And I must say I ’m quite impressed .
There was only a slight increase in memory usage , it went from 12.000 to 17.000 k , way below torrent clients like azureus and bitcomet and just slightly higher than uTorrent “ the lightweight client ” .
preferences
There ’s not much to configure , but two of the most vital configuration options are there .
You can adjust the download and upload speed and you can specify the port Opera should use .
However , is you adjust the down / up speeds you will see that the categories are pretty broad ( see pic ) .
transferring
Transferring files goes fine , the downloads sometimes take a while to start , but that could be due to a slow tracker .
There are some basic options to control the downloads ( stop , resume and remove ) that work ok .
shortcomings
It ’s not my intention to diss Opera ’s BitTorrent support , I know that this is just the start , and that they will probably improve it with every new release .
But still …
There are a lot of configuration options and features missing .
No DHT , no individual torrent preferences , no selective downloading , obviously no encryption , no RSS support , etcetera etcetera .
conclusion
Opera ’s BitTorrent support is great for incidental users but useless for heavy users .
pro’s
– People who are unfamiliar with BitTorrent can download torrents .
They do n’t have to install anything and no specific knowledge is required .
– It does n’t take much memory and CPU
con’s
– Configuration options are limited
– Feature support is limited
The con ’s can and probably will be worked on .
My main concern is the fact that when Opera shut ’s down , the torrent stops .
This is not very convenient since BitTorrent is often used for “ large ” files that often take a while to download .
This brings me to the title of this post :
Do we need a BitTorrent browser ?

Parent A is average in every way , without compelling positive or negative features .
Parent B has a mix of strong positive ( very close to the child ) and strong negative ( lots of travel ) features .
Asked to make this choice , the majority of respondents — 64 percent — choose Parent B .
What makes this study really interesting is what happens when another group of respondents is given the same character sketches , but asked a slightly different question : “ To which parent would you deny custody of the child ? ”
Here again , a majority , 55 percent , choose Parent B .
How can it be that a majority both accept and reject the same parent ?
Professor Shafir ’s explanation is that when people are asked whom to accept , they look for positive features in the parents — reasons to accept one over the other — and Parent B has them .
In contrast , when people are asked whom to reject , they look for negative features — and again , Parent B has them .
No matter which question you ask , Parent B stands out .
What does this tell us about modern electoral politics ?
When you go into the voting booth , you ’re trying to decide whom to accept or whom to reject .
Are you judging who the good candidate is or who the less bad candidate is ?
The effort by each side to coat the opposition in slime has made many of us cynical , giving us the sense that our task is to reject the worst , not select the best .
Nobody ’s any good , we think , but some are worse than others .
Let ’s keep those candidates out of office .
Our job becomes one of denying , not awarding , office .
MPs Sadiq Khan and Mohammed Sarwar at a meeting with the PM
The letter , signed by three Muslim MPs , three peers and 38 groups , suggested some policies provoked terrorists acts .
Mr Reid said no competent government would remain in power if policies were " dictated by terrorists " .
Echoing this stance , former Tory leader Michael Howard said the letter had given " ammunition " to extremists .
He said : " It is , I think , completely misconceived to suggest that we should change our foreign policy because it might cause some people to take up arms against us .
" That 's a form of blackmail and I think that letter was completely misconceived . "
The letter pointed to the " debacle " of Iraq and the UK 's stance over the Middle East crisis as examples of policies which fuelled extremism .
Whether we like it or not such a sense of injustice plays into the hands of extremists
Sadiq Khan , MP
Full text : Groups ' letter Send us your views
Downing Street said Tony Blair " stands ready " to meet Muslim representatives when he returns to the UK .
The letter urges the prime minister to redouble his efforts to tackle terror and extremism , and change foreign policy to show that the UK values the lives of civilians .
MP Sadiq Khan , who was among those who signed the letter , said British foreign policy was seen by many as unfair and unjust .
" Whether we like it or not such a sense of injustice plays into the hands of extremists , " he said .
" As moderates we will do all we can to fight extremism .
We hope the government will join us in this , not just by changing the rules on hand luggage , but by showing itself as an advocate for justice in the world . "
Ajmal Masroor , from the Islamic Society of Britain , which represents second - generation Muslims , maintained the war in Iraq was why the UK is facing a terrorist threat .
" The letter itself is very well written and very reflective of the sentiment of Muslims , " said Mr Masroor .
" Muslims are saying Islam and the Muslim communities did not give rise to extremism , and did not radicalise the young people . "
Desire for democracy
The home secretary said he would not question the motives of those who signed the letter , but said it was a " dreadful misjudgement if they believe that the foreign policy of this country should be shaped in part or in whole under the threat of terrorist activity " .
Mr Reid told the BBC : " No government worth its salt would stay in power in my view , and no government worth its salt , would be supported by the British people if our foreign policy or any other aspect of policy was being dictated by terrorists .
" That is not the British way , it is antithetical to our very central values .
We decide things in this country by democracy , not under the threat of terrorism . "
I like reddit .
It 's a news aggregator ; people submit web pages with one - word summaries .
The problem is this : automotoportal .com can't shut the hell up .
Reddit allows anyone , anywhere , to submit anything .
Readers who sign in can rate any link up or down .
I feel like I 'm reading the entire internet , one sentence at a time .
Unfortunately for me and other normal people , automotoportal.com thinks it needs non-zero sentences , and I disagree .
Seriously , automotoportal.com , shut the hell up .
Permanent - 1 , all the time , in Jesus ' name , boot to the head , amen .
Unfortunately , some sites worthless to me , such as automotoportal.com , can't keep their traps shut .
They , or their underground agents , keep submitting worthless links about motorcars that cost 300,000 pounds , or deformed shellfish , or ' news ' of sporting events .
Sadly , I do n't have any of the sweet , sweet crack cocaine that makes this pseudo - news important .
All I can do is send those sites down the memory hole , which I do with all possible speed .
Reddit , I know you 're listening .
Can I declare these sites anathema ?
I see that you have narrowed me down to less than a page of recommendations .
Thank you for recognizing that I hate everything .
Now give me the ability to automate the hate , for as long as I log in , and I 'll be set .
Remember the episode of " Itchy and Scratchy " where Itchy the mouse builds a cloning machine to clone his feline arch - foe Scratchy ?
Itchy gets tired of manually killing the clones of Scratchy , so he builds a killing machine , somewhat like a wood - chipper .
The Scratchy clones then are created , have time for half a scream before the conveyor belt moves them into the chipper .
That 's what I want for automotoportal.com , except with less time for realization of their fate before they hit the Reddit chipper .
You 're smart folks , and I know you can do it .

Landlady Lyn Anderson discovered the 7ft artwork hanging from the chimney stack of the Britannia Inn , in Tewkesbury , Gloucestershire , on Friday .
The picture quickly drew the attention of passers - by and motorists , and fearing it could cause an accident , Mrs Anderson called the fire brigade .
The poster was removed and police say they want to speak to the culprit .
" It was a hand - drawn picture of a man standing full frontal , " explained Mrs Anderson .
" But he had something covering his bits , thankfully .
" I phoned the police because I was worried it might fall down and the officer could n't stop laughing .
The fire brigade came to remove it and they were all in stitches as well .
" A bit of a crowd had gathered .
The locals loved it - it was n't really offensive - and they could n't stop laughing . "
A Gloucestershire Police spokeswoman said the incident was not being investigated as a crime but that officers were keen to catch up with whoever was responsible to warn them about the safety implications of the stunt .
The palimpsest is believed to have been created by Byzantine monks in the 13th century , probably in Constantinople .
As was the practice then , the durable and valuable vellum pages of several older texts were washed and scraped , to remove their writing , and then used for a medieval prayer book .
The pages of the older books became the sheaths of a newer one , thus a palimpsest ( which is pronounced PAL - imp - sest and is Greek for “ rubbed again ” ) .

After the Christie ’s sale the manuscript was left at the museum by the private collector for conservation and study .
This year imagers at Stanford University used powerful X - ray fluorescence imaging to read its final pages , which are being interpreted , transcribed and translated by a group of scholars in the United States and Europe .
The new Hyperides revelations include two previously unknown speeches , effectively increasing this renowned orator ’s body of work by 20 percent , said Judson Herrman , a 36 - year - old professor of classics at Allegheny College in Meadville , Pa .
He is one of a handful of classicists who have written doctoral dissertations on Hyperides .
Hyperides lived from 390 or 389 B.C. until 322 B.C. and was an orator who made speeches at public meetings of the citizen assembly .
A contemporary of Aristotle and Demosthenes , he wrote speeches for himself and for others and spoke at important political trials .
In 322 B.C. Hyperides was executed by the Macedonians for participating in a failed rebellion .
“ It ’s a spotlight shining on an important moment in history , ” said Mr. Herrman , currently a fellow at the National Humanities Center in Research Triangle Park , N.C.
Until the new leaves were found in the palimpsest , most scholars believed only fragments of Hyperides survived beyond the Classical period .
The mystery of Archimedes ’ treatise on combinatorics , the Stomachion , was solved in 2003 by deciphering the palimpsest .
Now W. Robert Connor , the president of the Teagle Foundation , which provides education and financial resources for education , called the discovery of new Hyperides text a “ tour de force of the first order . ”
We may be at a green tipping point - but not everyone 's got the memo yet .

Village Press extra virgin olive oil is not transported by air from New Zealand to Britain , as we implied in the article below .
It is sent by sea , making it less environmentally unfriendly than we suggested .
Air Wick diffuser
Air " freshener " is a stupid idea in the first place , and this one , called " Baby after bath " , smells like a box of perfumed nappy sacks .
Frankly if you do n't have a baby , it would be weird for you to want your house to smell as if you do .
But let 's not worry about the perfume , even though , according to the label , it " may cause long - term adverse effects in the aquatic environment " .
The novel thing about this air freshener is that it plugs into a socket , so you can drain electricity while filling the air with chemicals .
One refill ( please dispose of " according to local regulation " ) is said to last 80 days when you have it on 15 hours a day .
Fairtrade one cup coffee filters
The coffee may " guarantee farmers in developing countries fair terms " , but the design means that you throw away a plastic filter for every single cup you make , plus two lids per box .
If you do n't have a more efficient way to make coffee than this , get one .
Garden furniture wipes
The whole wipes industry is based on the idea that there is a separate disposable cloth for every chore : they make hand wipes , face wipes , tooth wipes , wood wipes , makeup remover wipes , dog wipes , window wipes and houseplant leaf wipes , each impregnated with some mystery compound that makes them particularly suitable for a certain type of wiping .
If I seem to have singled out these garden furniture wipes as being exceedingly unnecessary , it 's because I have never wiped my garden furniture with anything .
If I thought it worthy of any sort of care , I would n't have put it in the garden .
The Village Press extra virgin olive oil
I 've no doubt that it complements " the strong flavours of vine ripened tomatoes , rubbed garlic and fresh torn basil " , as it says on the bottle .
My only problem with this oil is where it comes from : New Zealand .
That 's much too far away , and at £ 5.99 for half a litre my contribution to its air fare amounts to collusion .
In New Zealand a local oil makes perfect sense , but we already have the finest olive oil imaginable available much closer to home .
Why bother ?
I know you could make the same argument for wine , but this is a fresh crime , and there is no material advantage to shipping olive oil halfway round the world that I can see .
I suppose one might argue that the reversal of the seasons in the southern hemisphere makes it possible to get freshly pressed oil at the wrong time of year , to which I would say - do n't even start .
Is there a more needlessly extravagant way to supply people with olive oil ?
Health
Aid olive oil capsules
Yes , it seems there is : olive oil supplied in gelatin capsules , as if it were some kind of medicine .
This bottle cost me £ 5.99 , the same as the bottle above , and it contains 90 500 mg capsules of extra virgin olive oil , on the pretext that " the people of the Mediterranean have a diet rich in olive oil , which may contribute to their all - round health " .
Here 's some arithmetic I can do : that 's 45 grams of oil per bottle .
At room temperature olive oil has a specific density of 918g/l , which means HealthAid are selling olive oil for more than £ 122 per litre , while engaging in a manufacturing process that has no meaning .
Marks & Spencer gastro grill chargrilled Aberdeen Angus beefburger
Ready - meal manufacturers operate on the principle that you have nothing in your kitchen apart from an oven .
This kit consists of cardboard sleeve , sealed plastic tray , cooked beef burger , bun ( separately wrapped ) , oven chips ( separately wrapped ) , tomato sauce ( in separate sachet ) and a foil tray to cook everything in .
There is more here to throw away than there is to eat , and the use - by date gives you 24 hours before the whole thing goes in the bin unopened .
Plastic lawn mower blades
If you have purchased a cheap electric lawnmower in recent years , then you may already be familiar with this nasty development : steel mower blades have been replaced by disposable plastic ones that barely seem to last 15 minutes .
They do n't so much cut the grass as shred it , and only one sort is compatible with your particular mower .
The label is made from 100 % recycled paper , which makes me want to kill someone .
Fairy power dish brush
This is an electric washing - up brush that whirls around thanks to four AA batteries that have already been slightly worn down by people pushing the button through the Try Me hole .
No more moving your arm back and forth !
When the head wears out you can order a replacement by dialling a free phone number , but it 's much easier to buy a whole new appliance for six quid .
Wilkinson Sword Xtreme3 razors
The latest in extreme waste : disposable three - bladed razors with extra-chunky disposable handles , eight to a display pack , at a staggering £ 7.99 .
Do they really want me to use them , or did they just put them in Boots to piss me off ?
Canderel limited edition dispenser
Contains 80 tiny low - calorie sweetener pills that pop out one at a time at the push of a button .
Of course , regular Canderel users will likely already have a dispenser that they can just refill , but this slim - line edition is designed by Matthew Williamson .
They 're telling you to throw out your old dispenser because this one is more fashionable .
Putting artificial sweeteners in your tea just got a whole lot cooler .
Underwood devilled ham
Let 's gloss over the 13g of fat and the 480mg of salt in this bedevilled product .
After all , this famous brand of ground ham and special seasonings is , for many grown Americans , the taste of their childhood .
Let 's focus instead on the tin .
The thing is , it contains only a 64g serving .
That 's enough to fill just one sandwich .
So every time someone satisfies their lust for a culinary trip down memory lane , they leave behind an awful lot of tin .
Optical wallet light
This product is described as an " amazing credit - card size light and magnifier " .
Not to mention : " New ! " " As seen on TV " " Fits in wallet ! " " Ultra bright light at the push of a button ! " " Easy to use ! " " Perfect for restaurant menus " .
Enough !
But then , the reason why the distributor , Telebrands , carries so many inane injunctions to buy this slither of plastic is that there 's so much space to fill on the packaging .
The container is almost four times as tall as the card itself , and about 25 times as wide .
You certainly do n't need a magnifier to see it .
Lettuce
You can admire the quality of this fresh lettuce .
It is 100 % organic , the blurb says .
( It is not possible to be 75 % organic , but we 'll let that go . )
More than that , it is living and hydroponic , a posh way of saying grown in water rather than soil .
Why that means the lettuce has to be individually housed in a box made of plastic so thick you can drum on it is not immediately clear .
Oh , and it comes from Canada .
You might assume most people who pay more for organic food do so partly out of concern for the environment .
Not so , it seems , in New York .
Bic Luminere candle lighter
This unique three - position wand is flexible enough to light all your candles , even those with hard - to - reach wicks .
It 's a breakthrough innovation .
At least , so says Bic , which has clearly got bored of making pens and wants something new .
What it has come up with is an enormous and ungainly lump of mud-brown plastic .
It has a proboscis at the end that you can dangle down inside a candle holder to light the wick .
It would be absolutely inspired , were it not for the gas fuel it uses and John Walker 's invention of 1827 : the match .
Listerine pocket mist
The one word that this product does n't have stamped all over it is halitosis .
But there are plenty of euphemisms .
" Kill germs for a clean mouth feeling . "
" Freshens breath fast ! "
What it does n't explain is why 8 ml of fluid are held in a container three times the volume .
Correction : it does explain .
" Designed to conveniently attach to your keychain for fast and easy use anytime , anywhere ! "

When asked about their recent rapid weight loss , emaciated starlets trip out the same old excuses .
They 're on a low - carb , high - protein detox or a juice fast ; they 're seeing this great new diet guru ; they 're working out ; or they 're really busy .
We 've heard it all before .
But in the past few months the smokescreen shielding the secret world of celebrity slimming has started to lift .
It 's being openly acknowledged that Hollywood is in the grip of a diet drug phenomenon .
" Trainers like me laugh ourselves silly listening to celebrities talk about their diet and exercise routines , " says Jackie Warner , the co-owner of Sky Sport & Spa in Beverly Hills .
" If you want to get your body seriously skinny in three weeks , it 's going to be difficult the natural way . "
But there 's nothing natural about Celeb - land 's latest take on the trend to be uber - tiny that has seen some of the world 's highest profile women shrink to less than six stone .
Poster girls for this scrawny silhouette include Victoria Beck - ham , photographed at the recent fashion shows looking painfully gaunt , while in the U.S. , the pack is led by Nicole Richie , Lindsay Lohan , Mischa Barton and now Kate Bosworth , seen this week looking skeletal at a Dazed & Confused party in New York .
All five share the hallmarks of being seriously underweight — chicken wing arms , deflated , sagging breasts and protruding hip and chest bones .
And three of them are " Zoe- bots " , clients of the super - stylist Rachel Zoe .
Pin thin herself , she has championed the boho blonde , big sunglasses look in Los Angeles and masterminds the wardrobes of the Hollywood hot property she refers to as ' my girls ' .
Many believe it 's
Zoe who is behind the emaciated look .
But it 's an accusation that she 's quick to squash .
" I do n't think it 's fair to say I 'm responsible because I 'm a thin person , or that because I 'm influencing their style I 'm influencing what they eat , " she says .
" There was this crazy rumour I was getting diet pills from Mexico and distributing them .
I was like : ' OK , I 've never even tried cocaine .
I do n't do drugs — I 'm too much of a control freak . ' "
But despite her denials , fellow stylists believe the image Zoe is creating is the catalyst for a dangerous craze that sees many actresses resorting to illegal drugs in a bid to stay svelte .
" Now everyone in Hollywood thinks they look fat , every photo shoot turns into a therapy session , " says one stylist .
Another adds : " If I get 20 samples and 15 are too small for the client , she needs a strong sense of self not to get caught up in it .
Everywhere in LA there 's someone slimmer , tanner , blonder . "
In essence , someone who has been given the Zoe treatment .
Jackie Warner and fellow LA trainer Chad Mouton say more and more women are using the drug clenbuterol , a potentially lifethreatening steroid - like substance , to slim down ridiculously quickly .
Legal only for use in horses - it was developed as an equine asthma treatment - its use in professional sport is banned in Europe and the U.S .
But possession and purchase for private use is n't illegal and ' clen ' , as it's known , is frighteningly easy to buy over the internet .
It was first used by bodybuilders who discovered it can burn fat while increasing muscle mass .
" It 's a long - acting agent that increases the body 's temperature and heart rate , which helps burn fat , even when the user is not exercising , " says John McVeigh , an expert in substance use .
The reason behind its ability to build muscle , though , is n't fully understood .
" It 's not been tested on humans - this is an animal vaccine , " says Harrison Pope , a Harvard psychiatrist who has been researching bodybuilding drugs since the Eighties .
" Most of the data available is veterinary , and it reveals a lot of bad reactions in rats .
After taking the drug , their hearts started to stiffen .
So it seems safe to predict that clenbuterol in high doses when taken by humans increases the risk of strokes and heart arrhythmia . "
But despite the dizziness and palpitations , the ladies who do n't lunch are getting it from their trainers , who sell it as a ' safe ' alternative to steroids .
" In looks - obsessed LA , the appeal of this drug to women is obvious , " says Professor Charles Yesalis , head of sports science at Pensylvannia State University .
" It 's short - sighted , but they see it as a quick fix to get the lean , toned physique popularised by actresses and models . "
Brooke Hailey , of LA 's New Directions Eating Disorder Center , agrees .
" I see more and more patients with bundles of disordered behaviours : overexercising , over - zealous exclusion of certain foods , the use of anti-anxiety medicines to curb the appetite - it's the culture and it's very , very accepted . "
Adderall is a drug that 's finding its way into the cocktail mix of cocaine , smoking , dieting and purging that many actresses rely on to curb their hunger .
Introduced a decade ago as a prescription drug for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , its major side effect is weight loss because it suppresses the appetite for up to nine hours .
" For the jet - setting , hardpartying , over - extended girl , who naturally is concerned with her figure , it 's become the miracle pill - one , however , with potentially dangerous consequences , " reported W magazine recently .
Even when taken as instructed , Adderall can cause psychotic episodes , depression and even serious heart problems .
" Last year , someone gave my cousin this doctor 's number for weight loss , " one woman told a reporter .
" He gave her loads of pills : a mixture of prescription and supplements .
My brother had a party and you would not believe the state she got herself in - she soiled herself and was vomiting because of all those pills .
The doctor never told her not to drink . "
She was recounting this sorry tale in the changing room of her gym when someone overheard and asked : " Have you got his number ? "
Despite the fact that 20 deaths have been associated with the drug , women are willing to overlook the potential health risks in pursuit of a size double zero body .
" It is n't hard to get or illegal .
Plus it 's more chic to discreetly take an Aderall with a cocktail than to snort a line of coke , " says one user .
Greta Angert , a Beverly Hills psychotherapist and eating disorder specialist , says Adderall does n't carry a stigma because it is a prescribed drug .
" But when someone is using it to lose weight , they should be treated for an eating disorder , " she says .
In the U.S. , with women only having to tell their doctor they are having trouble focusing to get a prescription for Aderall , and some physicians prescribing it to students to help them get through their exams , this drug is extending beyond Hollywood .
One New York pyschopharmacologist reported a trend in teenage girls selling their prescriptions to fellow students for e2 a pill .
Victoria Beckham features prominently in the ' Thinspirational ' galleries of proanorexia websites , where girls write in to coo about her ' beautiful protruding bones ' and gaunt face , berating the fact they struggle to slim down to her size .
" Among my patients , Victoria Beckham is one of the top icons .
As far as they can see , she gets invited everywhere , she 's got plenty of money and a handsome husband , " says Dr Dee Dawson of London 's Rhodes Farm Clinic for Eating Disorders .
" It 's not surprising that they associate her body shape with glamour and success . "
A report in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine said body image drugs were being bought by children as young as just 14 .
" We 've heard of steroid - like substances being sold at the school gates , ' says Pat Lenehan , spokesperson for the Drugs and Sport Information Service .
The extent of the damaging effects on still developing bodies is not known .
" If famous women are rumoured to take drugs , such as clenbuterol , ordinary people will be tempted to do the same , " says Linda Wells , editor of beauty bible Allure magazine .
And at less than e30 for 30 tablets bought over the internet , these dangerous diet aids are barely more expensive than supplements and vitamins .
So where will it end , and who 's really to blame ?
At the recent fashion shows , with activists calling for models to at least maintain a healthy BMI , the focus seems to be on designers .
But the lines between the runway and red carpet continue to blur as actresses become clothes horses for leading fashion houses .
At London Fashion week , the godfather of fashion Giorgio Armani went on record .
" I never wanted to use girls who are too skinny .
Unfortunately , though , the stylists and the media have interfered and the trend is for models who are incredibly thin , " he says .
New York designer Michael Kors agrees that the culpability lies with the LA super stylists and says he is sending them more and more size zero samples .
Recently , he 's been getting requests for negative zero and even a negative zero size 2 .
But while women are willing to overlook the potential health risks associated with popping a pill - sized slimming aid , new evidence is coming to light that this trend has a sting in the tail .
While clenbuterol and Adderall create the desired sylph - like effect in the shortterm , long - term users are reporting sudden and uncontrollable weight gain .
Having messed with an user 's natural metabolism , the drugs seem to lose their efficacy almost as quickly as they helped shift excess pounds .
Jackie Warner has seen the body backlash first - hand .
" A friend on clen lost weight , but after a while the drug stopped working , " she says .
" She was just eating tuna and told me : " If I eat anything , I just blow up . ' "
It 's an ironic twist that the threat of weight gain , rather than the risk of serious illness or even death , may hold more sway over young women 's decision to dabble with Hollywood 's most dangerous diet .
Under a program starting next month , several big US companies will give employees going abroad a " world citizen 's guide " featuring 16 etiquette tips on how they can help improve their country 's battered international image .
Business for Diplomatic Action , a non-profit group funded by large US companies , has met State Department officials to discuss issuing the guide with every newly issued American passport .
The guide offers a series of " simple suggestions " under the slogan , " Help your country while you travel for your company " .
The guide advises Americans to not just talk but to listen ; to discuss and argue but not to be didactic , and not to foist a US world view on others .
The head of Business for Diplomatic Action , Keith Reinhard , said : " Surveys consistently show that Americans are viewed as arrogant , insensitive , over - materialistic and ignorant about local values .
That , in short , is the image of the ugly American abroad and we want to change it . "
The guide also offers tips on the dangers of dressing too casually , and the pluses of learning a few words of the local language , using hand gestures and even map reading .
Business for Diplomatic Action has distributed 200,000 passport - sized guides tailored to students .

From the guidelines :
Think as big as you like but talk and act smaller
In many countries , any form of boasting is considered very rude .
Talking about wealth , power or status - corporate or personal - can create resentment .
Listen at least as much as you talk
By all means , talk about America and your life in our country .
But also ask people you 're visiting about themselves and their way of life .
Save the lectures for your kids
Whatever your subject of discussion , let it be a discussion not a lecture .
Justified or not , the US is seen as imposing its will on the world .
Think a little locally
Try to find a few topics that are important in the local popular culture .
Remember , most people in the world have little or no interest in the World Series or the Super Bowl .
What we call " soccer " is football everywhere else .
And it 's the most popular sport on the planet .
Slow down
We talk fast , eat fast , move fast , live fast .
Many cultures do not .
Speak lower and slower A loud voice is often perceived as bragging .
A fast talker can be seen as aggressive .
Your religion is your religion and not necessarily theirs Religion is usually considered deeply personal , not a subject for public discussions .
If you talk politics , talk - do n't argue Steer clear of arguments about American politics , even if someone is attacking US politicians or policies .
Agree to disagree .
Hmm … it seems that the “ Java = SUV of programming languages ” posting has stirred up a bit of controversy over at Slashdot and right here on this server .
Some people read it as a personal endorsement of PHP , VB , and other semi- baked programming languages .
Actually my personal preference is a much darker , uglier , and more shameful secret : Common Lisp , CLOS , plus an ML - like type inferencing compiler / error checker ( with some things done in a sublanguage with Haskell semantics and Lisp syntax ) .
Common Lisp dates from around 1982 and ML from 1984 .
I try to keep this preference concealed from young people who ’ve been raised on a diet of C , Java , C# , Perl , etc .
They just would n’t find it credible that 20 - year - old systems and ideas are actually better than the latest and greatest from Microsoft and Sun .
Imagine my delight in running into a friend yesterday .
She ’s a 23 - year - old graduate student in computer science at Harvard .
Conversation rolled around to programming tools .
Unprompted she said “ What I think would be best is Common Lisp Object System with a modern type system ” .
I was stunned .
I thought it was only dinosaurs like me that clung to Lisp .
I had a second ephiphany for the week …
Believing that Lisp circa 1982 plus some mid-1980s ML tricks thrown in is better than all of the new programming tools ( C# , Java ) that have been built since then is sort of like being a Holocaust denier .

Nodachi / Odachi swords are truly awesome cold weapon .
It is a large , very large two - handed sword which devastate any enemy near the warrior using it .
Just look at its pictures : Nodachi have the same general appearance and design of a tachi though they are significantly longer .
The nodachi was carried by foot soldiers and was designed as a weapon for war versus cavalry and open field engagements .
Nodachi were generally used on open battlefields as their length made their use indoors or close quarters difficult .
They were an effective weapon against cavalry , though they were not commonly used .
Nodachi were infrequently used for several reasons :
The blade was more difficult to forge compared to a normal - sized sword
The nodachi required greater strength to properly wieldWeapons such as the naginata or nagamaki were arguably more effective for the same role on the battlefield .
During times of peace the sword was worn slung across the back as a symbol of status .
This is distinctive because most Japanese swords such as the katana , wakizashi , and tachi were worn at the waist or belt ; however it was not " drawn " from the back .
The nodachi was more difficult to wield due to its abnormal size and weight , but like any weapon , could be extremely deadly if the warrior wielding it was skilled .
The size of the blade made the nodachi a fearsome weapon when wielded by a skilled warrior .
The length of the nodachi's hilt varied between twelve to thirteen inches ( 30 to 33 centimeters ) .
Its cutting capability and range exceeded that of a katana , due to its weight and size .
Legend says that a nodachi could cleave a warrior and his horse in half with a single blow .
In some Chinese martial arts , Pa Kua Chang being perhaps the best known example , oversized weapons are used for training purposes in order to condition the martial artist to handle a normal - sized weapon more efficiently ( as is the case in Japanese martial arts with the suburito , a heavy wooden sword ) .
The Kage - ryu one of the very rare ryuha remaining that trains in the use of the Japanese long - sword ( which they call choken ) .
The direct translation of " Odachi " is big thick sword .
Often mistaken for Nodachi which translates to field sword .
The term Nodachi is generally misused for Odachi .
The character for " O " means big or great .
The characters for " DA " and " CHI " are the same as " TACHI " , the older style of sword / mounts that predate the Katana ( the " CHI " is the same character as Katana and the " TO " in Nihonto ) .
I think that to qualify as a Nodachi the sword in question must have a blade length of 3 shaku ( 90.9 cm ) or more , however , as with most terms in Japanese sword arts , there is no exact definition of the size of a Nodachi .
Generally speaking , swords that are longer than normal * ones are classified as Nodachi .
*The normal length of swords varied slightly depending on the period .
During the Edo era , the average length of a sword was about 66 - 70 cms , however during the Heian and Kamakura era it was around 80 cm.
Lengths varied during different eras because the methods of use varied also .
During the Heian and Kamakura era Samurai rode on horseback which required a longer blade ( about 80 cm ) .
Samurai during the Edo era did n't usually ride horses , so a shorter ( about 66 - 70 cm ) blade was more useful .
It is believed that Odachi first appeared in the 5th Century .
This has been proven by the fact that a 117.0 cm sword from the 5th Century was unearthed from an old mound in Kumamoto .
A 137.9 cm sword was unearthed from a mound in Tochigi and dated to the 5th Century .
It was believed that some such swords were used by the Gods of Japanese mythology , however , most of the swords discovered so far have only dated to the 5th Century .
For example , in Japanese mythology the sword named " Hutsunomi- tamano - tsurugi " ( in Kashima Shrine , Ibaraki ) was believed to have been the sword that was given to the Emperor by a God to end a revolt .
Now , research has show that the sword was made during the Heian era and is not the sword from the myth .
It seems the sword was an imitation piece , based on the sword used in mythology .
This is the reason why some swords are believed to have been used by Gods .
Another one of the reasons why people believed that the sword was used by Gods was due to the appearance of the sword .
If the sword is large and awesome , it looks like the property of a God .
The purpose of Nodachi can be categorized as follows : a) As an offering to a Shrine or Gods .
Some Nodachi were dedicated with prayer to win a war , others were placed in Shrines as legendary swords from mythology .b)
As a weapon .
From explanations in old texts , such as " Heike - monogatari , Taihei - ki " tell us that Odachi were used by soldiers during battles . c )
As a symbol for an army .
Some Nodachi are too long for practical use .
They can not be used in a battle but it is said that they could have been used as a symbol of an army , such as flags and spears .
Further research is needed to confirm this idea .d )
As a trend during a certain period .
Some swords were also used for ceremonies .e)
To show the swordsmith 's skill .
Nodachi are very difficult to produce .
The requirements to make a good Nodachi are as follows : a) A lot of steel is needed to produce a Nodachi and it takes longer to make than a normal sword .
However to make a good Nodachi it is important to hammer the steel quickly .
This requires great skill from the swordsmith .b)
A Nodachi is made with teamwork .
Perfect teamwork is required to make a good one .
c )
More skill is required in quenching and tempering a Nodachi than a normal sword .d )
Special facilities are required .
For example the quenching tank must be bigger than that used for normal swords .e )
The method of polishing is different .
Odachi need to be hung from the ceiling or placed in a stationary position to be polished , unlike normal swords which are moved over the polishing stones .
Nodachi that were used as weapons were too long for Samurai to carry on their waists like normal swords .
There were two methods in which Odachi could be carried .
One method was to carry it on your back .
This was impractical however , as it was impossible for the Samurai carrying the sword to draw it quickly .
The other method was simply to carry the Nodachi by hand .
The trend during the Muromachi era was for the Samurai carrying the Nodachi to have a follower to help him draw it .
Nodachi swordplay styles focused on downward chops and different wields to that of normal swords .
The Nodachi's importance died off after the Osaka - Natsuno - Jin war of 1615 ( battle between Ieyasu Tokugawa and Mitsunari Ishida ) .
Since then it has been used more as a ceremonial piece .
The two main reasons for losing popularity are : 1 . Battles in fields did not occur after 1615.2 .
The Bakuhu government set a law which prohibited holding swords above a set length ( in Genwa 3 [ 1617 ] , Kwanei 3 [ 1626 ] and Shoho2 [ 1645 ] ) .
After the law was put into practice , Nodachi were cut down to the shorter legal size .
This is one of the reasons why Nodachi are so rare .
Nodachi were no longer of practical use , but were still made as offerings to Shinto shrines .
This became their main purpose .
Due to the amount of skill required to make one it was considered that their awesome appearance was suitable for praying to the Gods .
Aside from patrolling the nation ’s borders and guarding against terrorism , the Department of Homeland Security also is battling fraud , theft , bribery , smuggling and other crimes by American citizens -- with some of the most disturbing examples coming from the sprawling agency ’s own employees .
A semiannual report filed to Congress by the department ’s inspector general showed a sharp jump in arrests in the six months ended Sept. 30 , with many stemming from schemes by members of the public to bilk the agency of emergency relief funds in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
But the report , released this week , also highlights a litany of staff misconduct : immigration officials demanding sex in exchange for visas , airport screeners stealing money from tourists ’ luggage , federal air marshals smuggling drugs , and employees from various DHS agencies committing sex crimes -- including indecent exposure and distributing child pornography .
The array of staff transgressions tucked into the report reflects the continued growing pains of an agency that was formed only three years ago , and the pressures created as parts of the department have rapidly expanded , critics say .

Clark Kent Ervin , a former DHS inspector general , said the Transportation Security Administration rushed to hire screeners and air marshals in 2003 without running background checks on the applicants .
“ Knowing DHS dysfunction and disingenuousness , it would n’t surprise me if DHS does n’t fully vet employees for criminal backgrounds before hiring them or periodically recheck them , ” Ervin said .
Russ Knocke , press secretary for DHS , would not comment on the agency ’s policy on background checks but dismissed Ervin ’s criticism as “ pure speculation ” and “ without merit . ”
Knocke said the problems were due mainly to a few individuals .

“ No law enforcement agency of any government in the world is going to be immune to inappropriate behavior on the part of its employees , particularly one that is as large as we are , ” Knocke said . " ...
There ’s no tolerance for unethical behavior at this department and we use every authority to confront it . ”
Investigations by the inspector general ’s office triggered 321 arrests and 243 convictions in the six - month period .
The report filed for the previous six months documented 200 arrests ; six months earlier , there were 54 .
The report did not provide a breakdown of how many cases involved DHS staff , but they came from all parts of the department .
Two TSA screeners were caught pilfering jewelry from luggage , while another was found smuggling more than $ 80,000 in an attempt to avoid reporting income brought into the country .
Another team of four screeners targeted Japanese tourists until one was caught stealing up to $ 1,800 from checked luggage .

Many of the offenses involved getting contraband past barriers .
Two federal air marshals were snared by a DHS and FBI investigation that found the marshals had sought and accepted a bribe to shepherd 15 kilograms of cocaine through airports .
Two guards at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement prison sold alcohol and cigarettes to the illegal immigrants in their custody .
The agency ’s defenders said that in a department of more than 180,000 people , the number getting into trouble is relatively insignificant and that the arrests show the department ’s oversight is improving .
The inspector general ’s reports can be found online at www.dhs.gov/xoig/rpts/semiannl/editorial_0330.shtm.

Disrupting death
NanoLife Sciences generates buzz over its use of antiproton therapy to fight cancer .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Business 2.0 Magazine ) -- The Disruptor : NanoLife Sciences
The Innovation : More precise cancer treatment that 's less destructive to healthy tissue
The Disrupted : Conventional cancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy
For many cancer patients , the treatment feels worse than the disease .
Radiation and chemotherapy can have debilitating side effects and often destroy healthy tissue as well as tumors .
Thus the strong allure of a potentially revolutionary cancer treatment under development by NanoLife , a startup based in Newport Beach , Calif .
NanoLife 's approach builds on the cutting - edge technology of using protons rather than X - rays to attack cancerous masses , but takes it many steps further .
If NanoLife 's science pans out , it could transform what is now a five - week course of radiation therapy into a few afternoons ' work .
Unlike X-rays , protons have weight and mass .
This means that a proton beam generated by a proton accelerator can stop inside a tumor and deliver its lethal force without destroying healthy tissue by exiting the body , as X - ray beams do .
Protons have been gaining importance in cancer treatment for years , and NanoLife currently plans to open proton treatment centers around the world .
The first may open by 2010 .
But the truly disruptive potential of NanoLife lies in its plans to go beyond proton therapy , and instead use antiprotons to treat cancer .
The idea is to create a device that can deliver a stream of antiprotons into a tumor .
The laws of physics decree that the antiprotons will attract the protons within the tumor ; when they collide , they annihilate one another , destroying the tumor in the bargain .
Wild as it may sound , lab and animal tissue testing have shown promise .
Antiproton therapy is at least seven years off and would be expensive -- a single particle accelerator required to produce antiprotons could cost hundreds of millions of dollars .
But the approach already has some cancer fighters buzzing .
" The theory and physics behind it justify wanting to do it , " says David Bush , vice chairman of the radiation medicine department at California 's Loma Linda Medical Center , a top proton therapy center .
" The concept is valid . "
NanoLife president Ray Winn , a veteran of the nuclear and semiconductor industries , envisions someday converting his company 's proton treatment centers into antiproton centers and treating thousands of patients throughout the world .
It 's a big dream , but if anything like it ever comes to pass , think of the implications : antiprotons disrupting death itself .
Now that 's one bit of disruption even William Orton and J.P. Morgan could 've instantly grasped .

Stuart Cauff launched a charter - jet service in Miami Beach back in 2002 .
Being a 21st - century business , JetNetwork advertised on the Internet , especially on search engines .
Anyone who Googled , say , " air charter Miami " would be greeted with the familiar list of search results and , in a separate place , a plain box of text with a blue hyperlink to JetNetwork 's Web site .
Search ads were perfect for Cauff 's business .
His potential customers - a diverse group of celebrities , photojournalists , medical evacuees , and people who just needed to get away from or to Miami in a hurry - were scattered across the country .
To reach this audience with traditional advertising , he would have had to buy time on scores of television and radio stations and space in just as many newspapers and magazines , something that only wealthy , established companies could afford .
Even if Cauff could pay for the ads , the vast majority of people exposed to them would n't care about charter jets , so most of his money would be wasted .
But with search - based ads , JetNetwork 's name would appear , at least in theory , only before people who were actually interested in Miami charter flights .
Still , the ads were expensive .
This kind of advertising is known as pay - per-click , because advertisers shell out money to a search engine every time a surfer clicks on their links .
The price and placement depend mainly on how much the advertiser wants to bid for the search term - also known as the keyword in ad jargon .
As other charter - air companies began PPC advertising , the cost of a click on a top - ranked ad rose to about $ 10 - in some cases as high as $ 30 - and there could be hundreds of clicks a month .
Which is why Cauff was infuriated when he discovered that up to " 40 percent , maybe more " of the clicks on his keyword ads apparently came not from potential customers around the nation but from a single Internet address , one that belonged to a rival based in New York City .
" If we get clicked fraudulently , it uses up our ad budget , " he says .
Advertisers usually set limits on how much they will spend , and search engines drop ads once they hit that limit .
As a result , fraudulent clicking " literally pushes us off the page , " Cauff explains .
" And then our competition buys in at a lower price when we 're not there . "
Cauff was a victim of " click fraud , " the illicit manipulation of keyword - based advertising .
In this case , the scam appeared straightforward - one company clicked on a rival 's search engine ads to drive up its costs .
More complex is a second type of bogus ad click that exploits a second form of PPC advertising : ads fed to Web sites - anything from personal blogs to the sites of major corporations - by search providers like Google , Yahoo ! , LookSmart , and , soon , MSN .
The search engine indexes the content of the Web site and matches it with a group of relevant ads .
( The most familiar form is Google 's AdSense program - the sets of links labeled ads by goooooogle that show up on pages across the Internet .
The advertisements that appear on Google itself are part of a separate but related program called AdWords . )
Thus , bloggers who write about their air - travel experiences and choose to host such ads may find links on their pages for JetNetworks and its brethren .
If a blog visitor clicks on the ad , the search engine splits its fee with the blogger .
Although these " affiliate " ads have been hugely successful for advertisers , search engines , and the host Web sites , the system creates an incentive for affiliates to cheat .
" All you have to do to make some money is find a way to click the ad sent by Google or Yahoo ! to your own Web page , " says search marketing consultant Joseph Holcomb .
" Click ! - there 's 10 bucks .
Click ! - there 's 10 bucks .
It goes on all the time . "
Pay - per-click is the fastest - growing segment of all advertising , reports the Interactive Advertising Bureau .
Last year , Yahoo !
alone ran more than 250 million individual listings , according to Michael Egan , the company 's search - marketing director of content strategy .
Yahoo !
does n't break out PPC earnings separately in its financial statements , but Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto believes that keyword advertising accounted for about half of the company 's estimated $ 3.7 ébillion in revenue for 2005 .
PPC is even more lucrative for Google .
According to Noto , Google will end 2005 with $ 6.1 billion in revenue .
About 99 percent of that revenue comes from keyword ads ( over 56 épercent from AdWords , according to the company 's most recent quarterly financial statement , and 43épercent from AdSense ) , making Google a bigger recipient of ad dollars than any television network or newspaper chain .
All of which is to say that little blue text links , a type of advertising that barely existed five years ago , are poised to become the single most important form of marketing in the US - unless click fraud ruins it .
If that occurs , the consequences will be felt throughout the Net .
By splitting revenue with the sites that host the ads , search engines have become , in effect , the Internet 's venture capitalists , funding the content that attracts people to the computer screen .
Unlike the VCs who backed the boom - era Internet , search engines now provide revenue to thousands of wildly diverse sites at little up - front cost to them -éPPC advertising is one of the few income sources available to bloggers , for instance .
If rampant click fraud overwhelms the system , it will muffle the Internet 's fabulous cacophony of voices .
The amount of click fraud is difficult to quantify ; estimates of the proportion of fake clicks run from as low as 1 in 10 to as high as 1 in 2 .
In a widely cited recent study , MarketingExperiments.com , an online marketing research outfit , reported that " as much as 29.5 épercent " of the clicks in three experimental PPC campaigns on Google were fraudulent .
Whatever the exact figure , click fraud has become pervasive , and Google , Yahoo ! , and the other major PPC firms have found themselves caught in a game of cat and mouse with its perpetrators .
Even as the search engines shore up their defenses , click scammers are becoming more sophisticated , increasingly deploying complex software to disguise the origins of clicks .
For now , the search companies and many of their clients maintain that the problem on their networks is under control .
But some observers , like Holcomb , believe that click fraud is " a billion - dollar mess " that " has the potential of destroying the entire industry . "
Last October , Boris Elpiner noticed something odd about the Web traffic coming to his company from its PPC ads .
As vice president of marketing for RingCentral , an online telecommunications firm in San Mateo , California , Elpiner is in charge of its affiliate - ad program , which hired Yahoo ! to distribute RingCentral 's ads onto Web sites with compatible content .
Poring over his records , he discovered that a keyword term ( " fax software download " ) that had previously generated almost no clicks was suddenly pulling them in .
The total cost to RingCentral for the clicks - $ 2,500 over about four weeks - " was significant , but not immediately noticeable . "
Puzzled by the sudden change , Elpiner investigated further .
When users visit a Web site , the site server notes the URLs from which they came , the visitors ' IP addresses , and other data .
Cauff , the charter - jet executive , had used such information to conclude that a competitor was clicking repeatedly on his ads .
In this case , Elpiner did n't see an obvious pattern .
At the same time , the URLs and IP addresses associated with the suspect clicks " did n't make any sense , " he says .
" Some of the URLs were error 404 messages , and a lot of the addresses did n't exist . "
Elpiner took the matter to Yahoo ! , whose analysts " figured it all out quickly , " he says .
One or more Yahoo !
affiliates may have generated deceptive clicks on ads served to their sites , using special software to disguise the source .
The scammers , he says , " were clever enough not to take a whole lot from [ the ads on ] one site , but must have been trying to siphon off a little from many advertisers . "
Yahoo ! gave Elpiner full credit .
But it did not , as far as he could tell , try to identify the perpetrators .
Instead , Yahoo !
and other PPC companies are responding to click fraud by deploying new antifraud technologies .
For example , Yahoo !
analysts have created click fraud filters - algorithmic screens that sift through the sea of incoming clicks to find patterns suggesting fraud and then discard phony clicks without regard to source or motive .
Although Google and Yahoo ! will not , for security reasons , discuss their methods in detail , the advertisements themselves offer some clues .
When affiliates sign up for a box of , say , Google ads , they are essentially hosting within their own Web page a small , separate page with its own , very long URL .
According to Joseph Tierney , an Internet marketer in central Florida who describes himself as a repentant click frauder , that URL is embedded with a string of information including the time , in milliseconds ; the last time the host Web page was updated , also in milliseconds ; and other data used to track customer behavior .
Analysts could use this material to match the various time stamps against one another , as well as other information provided by server logs .
" If someone from such - and - such IP address clicks on the same ad four times in a second , " says Elias Levy , a security architect at Symantec , " you can know that at least three of those clicks do n't mean anything .
It 's inconceivable that Google would n't be looking at this . "
The company wo n't confirm it , though .
" We do n't discuss our techniques , " says Shuman Ghosemajumder , a Google business product strategy manager .
Nor will Google disclose whether invalid clicks are common or whether it has " a lot " or " just a few " researchers working on click fraud .
" We have recognized invalid clicks as a serious problem from the beginning , " Ghosemajumder says .
" We 've done a good job at being effective with these issues in the past , and we believe we will be effective in the future . "
In his view , PPC companies should be judged not by whether they have succeeded in stamping out click fraud but by whether their advertisers are satisfied .
Not every customer comes away satisfied , though .
Last summer Nathan McKelvey , president of the rent - a- jet firm CharterAuction.com in Quincy , Massachusetts , discovered an old server in his office with records of every visitor to his company 's Web site since 2002 .
Many of the visits came through Google 's and Yahoo ! 's PPC programs .
But a substantial number of those clicks came from Denmark , a country where CharterAuction did " exactly zero " of its business .
When McKelvey asked Google and Yahoo !
precisely which clicks he'd been billed for , neither company would tell him .
All they 'd reveal was how many clicks he'd paid for - not which ones or where they originated .
Feeling stonewalled , he had his lawyer send a letter demanding refunds from both .
" I have the strong suspicion , " he says , " that we spent more than a quarter of a million dollars over a couple years on invalid clicks . "
According to McKelvey , the two companies have refused to refund his money or divulge further information .
Google wo n't comment on specific actions with clients ;
Yahoo !
says it is investigating the charges .
PPC companies may have to become more transparent to retain customer confidence , because click fraud has mutated into new , more complex forms .
Responding to the demand for fake clicks , shady firms in India created click farms , facilities in which marginally employed people click on advertisements round the clock ( these seem to have diminished in number or gone underground since 2004 , when the Times of India revealed their existence ) .
Companies also have begun attacking rivals with " impression fraud " - repeatedly reloading a search engine page where the rival 's ad appears , without clicking on it , in order to eliminate it .
( Google and Yahoo ! routinely take steps to drop nonperforming ads . )
In 2004 , a programmer named Michael Bradley allegedly wrote click fraud software that disguised clicks ' origins .
He was arrested by the Secret Service and charged with attempting to extort $ 100,000 from Google by threatening to release the software on the Internet ; a trial is pending .
The action did not eliminate this kind of software - it is now readily available on the Net .
Other enterprising scammers manipulate the affiliate system by creating phony blogs - spam blogs , or splogs - that automatically generate content by continually copying bits from other Web sites , mixing in popular keywords , then signing up the resulting mélange as a Google or Yahoo ! affiliate .
By using software to link themselves repeatedly to well - known real blogs , splogs trick search engines into listing them high on their results list , thus generating traffic , which in turn generates ad clicks .
When unsuspecting Internet searchers visit splogs , they end up clicking the ad links in a frustrated attempt to find some coherent text .
Thousands of splogs exist , snarling the blogosphere - and the search engines that index it - in spam .
Splogs are too profitable to be readily discouraged .
According to RSS to Blog , a Brooklyn - based firm that sells automatic - blog software , sploggers can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month in PPC income , all without any human effort .
Probably the most worrisome emerging threat is zombie networks - hordes of linked machines controlled by rogue software .
Without their owners ' knowledge , these boxes continuously send spam , transmit worms and viruses , participate in denial - of - service attacks , and execute a host of other antisocial tasks .
These zombie networks can be enormous .
In October , Dutch police charged three young men with controlling an incredible 1.5 million computers .
In recent months , the owners of zombie networks have begun turning to click fraud - éwith " very effective " results , according to Tierney , the former click frauder .
The robot machines create clicks from all around the world at apparently random intervals , making them difficult to identify .
But even if zombie click fraud becomes common , the damage can probably be contained as long as its targets are limited to individual advertisers .
As Symantec 's Levy points out , PPC firms can always give the victims their month 's service free - reducing click fraud to a type of overhead , a cost of doing business .
But the impact would be much larger , he notes , if someone decided to attack not single companies but the PPC system itself .
" It would not be difficult to construct a worm that would go through the Net , clicking on every Google or Yahoo !
affiliate ad that it saw , " Levy says .
" If enough of these were loose , you 'd swamp the entire system in noise - millions or even billions of extra clicks .
It would be very hard to defend against . "
Is this likely to happen ?
" I would like to be able to say that people are n't that stupid or greedy or aggressive or mindless , " says Chase Law's Butler .
" But I can't say any of those things .
That is definitely the threat - a threat to the entire system by somebody who is just doing it for the hell of it . "
Type " click fraud " into a search box and you get links to more than 30 million Web sites and ads for the dozens of companies that have sprung up to help victims track the practice .
Down the right - hand side of the page march the ad links : Click Defense , Clicklab , Clickrisk , ClickAssurance , VeriClix , Authenticlick , WhosClickingWho .
Stoking advertisers ' fears by claiming that the system is drowning in click fraud , these outfits nonetheless solicit clients with … keyword ads on Yahoo ! and Google .
Indeed , a recent Google search for " click fraud " turned up more than 30 companies .
( One outfit , Click Defense , has matched its actions to its words ; it sued Google in June , claiming it was getting click - frauded on its " click fraud " keyword ads . )
Most of these firms simply provide ways for advertisers to outsource the tedious task of examining internal logs for fraud .
Among those trying to do more is Visitlab , in Santa Cruz , California .
According to CEO Vikas Kedia , Visitlab 's clients channel incoming clicks through his company , which screens them with software tailored for each customer .
The software , now in beta , consists of modules that look for telltale behavior - the use of a proxy server , say , or clicks coming from geographic areas that are unlikely to have customers .
By amassing data on click behavior and constantly adjusting the software , Kedia believes , it should eventually be possible to detect even a single fraudulent click .
" Google could do all this , " he says .
" But nobody is sure whether to trust them .
We 're a third party . "
Bill Gross , the man who invented PPC back in the late '90s when he presided over the startup incubator Idealab , has argued that , despite the cleverness of the various methods used to fight it , click fraud will continue to cast a shadow over PPC advertising .
Ultimately , he believes , advertisers will switch to another model , which he calls cost - per-action ( others use terms like cost - per- transaction or cost- per-acquisition ) .
Whatever the name , though , advertisers pay only when a click results in a specified action , such as a sale or a Web site registration .
Gross started a CPA search engine , Snap.com , in late 2004 .
When customers enter the term " airline tickets " on the site , ads for airlines appear .
But those airlines do n't pay Snap a penny until someone who clicks the ad actually buys a ticket .
Even if scammers used zombie networks , the system would ignore them , because it charges only for clicks that lead to an action .
Snap , still in beta , is not exactly roaring ahead : According to its own statistics , the firm has 2,300 CPA advertisers .
That 's roughly 2 percent of Google 's or Yahoo ! 's advertising base .
Yahoo !
is not looking into cost - per-action , Egan says , because such a system requires businesses to share sensitive cost data with their advertising partners .
" We start having to ask how much they 've sold and what their margins are , " he says .
" And if we carry ads for their competitors , we know about them , too .
This is not information that businesses like to share with third parties , and for good reason . "
For the near future , he says , " I do n't believe PPC is going to be supplanted , which is one reason we take click spam " - Yahoo !'s preferred term - " so seriously . "
A possible answer to the privacy worries may be something called Google Wallet .
This new initiative , not yet unveiled as of early December , is believed to be a payment scheme that surfers would use , for example , when they bought something after clicking on a Google ad .
In theory , at least , Google could process the payment to the advertiser without having to know anything about its costs , profit margins , or other sensitive data .
Like Gross 's cost - per-action , Google Wallet would be immune to click fraud - zombie machines could click away , and the system would simply ignore them .
Nobody thinks that these measures will eliminate click fraud .
Keyword advertising - especially on affiliates - will continue to grow , making it an ever more inviting target to the Net 's legion of bad actors .
All the while , PPC will continue to be vulnerable to attacks by blackhats who want to disrupt the system as a whole , rather than defraud the individual companies that use it .
In consequence , PPC providers seem doomed , at least for the near future , to an endless race against the scammers , spammers , and network jammers .
" If you 'd told me five years ago that I would be talking about ' fake clicks , ' I would have told you that you were crazy , " says John Slade , who leads Yahoo ! 's click protection efforts .
" Now it 's all I spend my time on . "

Brad Pitt is fed up with his life in Namibia and is desperate to return to the US , it has been claimed .
The ' Troy ' actor - who moved to the Southern African country before the birth of his first child , Shiloh Nouvel , with Angelina Jolie - is said to " loathe " his life there .
A source told Britain 's Star magazine : " They are cooped up in the hotel , the food is n't great and he does n't like the heat .
He seems thoroughly depressed and I think he misses Malibu . " " Angelina is unhappy because he wo n't go along with her plans .
She is so passionate about Namibia and wants Brad to be too , but you get the feeling he just has a yearning to put down some roots .
Going to Africa was bizarre for him .
" Earlier this week , it was revealed that Brad cut the umbilical cord of his new daughter when she was born .
The actor was in the delivery room while Angelina delivered the baby via Caesarean section in a private hospital on Saturday ( 27.05.06 ) .
The couple 's American obstetrician , Jason Rothbart - who travelled to Namibia for the birth - said : " The baby was a healthy 7lb .
Brad was with Angelina the entire time and cut the umbilical cord .
The surgery and birth went flawlessly . "

The government is already bracing itself for the cooling of relations with Moscow , which it believes will be an inevitable consequence of an extradition request .
The request could be made as early as next month and government officials are convinced the Kremlin will demand , in return , the extradition of Boris Berezovsky , the Russian millionaire oligarch who was granted asylum in the UK .
Mr Lugovoi , 41 , a former bodyguard with the KGB , was one of several people interviewed by detectives from Scotland Yard 's counter - terrorism command in Moscow last month .
The Yard is declining to comment on the case and details of the alleged evidence against Mr Lugovoi remain unclear .
The businessman has repeatedly denied any involvement in the murder , and last night told the Guardian : " I am not guilty .
I have nothing to do with the killing of Litvinenko . "
He added that he was unaware that Scotland Yard was planning to seek his extradition .
Mr Lugovoi met Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square , London , on November 1 .
Mr Litvinenko fell ill shortly afterwards and died in University College Hospital , London , on November 23 .
In the intervening period , Mr Lugovoi appeared to leave a trail of radioactive polonium - 210 at a number of offices and hotels around London , and traces of the substance were also found on board an aircraft in which he travelled .
Several other people have also tested positive for polonium - 210 , however , including eight members of staff and one other guest at the Millennium Hotel .
Dimitri Kovtun , a Russian business associate of Mr Lugovoi who was present at the hotel meeting , was also contaminated .
On his return to Moscow , Mr Lugovoi called a televised press conference to protest his innocence , and pointed out that traces of polonium - 210 had been found on his wife and children .
" To think that I would handle the stuff and put them at risk is ludicrous , " he said .
" Someone is trying to set me up .
But I can't understand who .
Or why . "
Associates of the dead man have repeatedly accused President Vladimir Putin 's government of being behind his murder , a claim the Kremlin rejects .
While it is known that detectives believe they have uncovered evidence pointing to Mr Lugovoi 's involvement , it is not clear whether they have established a motive for the murder .
Any attempt to extradite Mr Lugovoi could founder on the Russian constitution , which offers citizens protection against enforced removal from the country .
However , senior British government officials have told the Guardian that officials in Moscow have already indicated their willingness to strike a deal which would see the suspect being handed over in return for Mr Berezovsky 's extradition .
Mr Berezovsky amassed his estimated £ 800 m fortune during Russia 's rush to privatisation in the 1990s , and fled to the UK after falling out with President Putin six years ago .
Mr Litvinenko followed him , claiming that he had been instructed to murder Mr Berezovsky .
The oligarch has already fought off one extradition attempt , after Moscow accused him of large - scale fraud .
After that charge was dropped , the Kremlin accused him of plotting to overthrow the government by force .
He can not be forced to return to Russia , however , as the UK courts have ruled that the charges against him are politically - motivated and that he could not expect to receive a fair trial .
Government officials say that they have difficulty trying to explain to the Russian authorities that the UK courts are entirely independent , and that Mr Berezovsky cannot be extradited once the courts have ruled against such a move .
As a result , there is growing nervousness in Whitehall over the possibility of a diplomatic rift , and about the economic consequences .
British business is heavily involved in Russia , with direct investment of nearly £ 2bn and exports of close to £ 3bn in 2005 .
The Kremlin has frequently used punitive economic measures as a blunt diplomatic tool .
It cut off the gas supply to Ukraine and Belarus in the midst of political disputes , raising anxiety within the EU over Europe 's dependence on Moscow for energy supplies .
Last month
Shell was forced to sell its controlling share in the world 's biggest oil and gas venture , Sakhalin 2 , to the Russian energy giant Gazprom .
BP has also come under pressure to give up some of its share in a UK - Russian oil company , TNK - BP .
It has been targeted by the state licensing agency , Rosnedra , which is threatening to strip it of its permit for a string of alleged infringements .
Meanwhile , the Health Protection Agency reported yesterday that a total of 129 people appear to have been exposed to polonium - 210 , and that 13 of them were at a small risk of long - term illness .
Traces of radiation have been found at 20 locations in London , and several remain sealed off .
· Main players
Alexander Litvinenko
A former officer of the KGB and its successor , the FSB , Litvinenko fled to Britain in 2001 , claiming he had been ordered to murder the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky .
He then accused his former superiors of organising a bombing campaign to trigger war in Chechnya .
Died of radioactive poisoning , aged 44 , on November 23 .
Andrei Lugovoi
A former bodyguard with the KGB , and now a successful Moscow businessman whose company , Pershin , controls a security consultancy and a soft drinks manufacturer and employs around 500 people .
Mr Lugovoi , 41 , met Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in London on November 1 , hours before the ex-spy fell ill , but denies any role in the murder .
Dimitri Kovtun
An old friend of Mr Lugovoi from their days in the KGB , he is now a Moscow - based businessman and was at the meeting at the Millennium Hotel .
Kovtun , 42 , was contaminated with polonium - 210 and traces have also been found in Hamburg , where he had visited his ex-wife .
He too denies any involvement .
Mario Scaramella
An Italian self - styled security consultant who claims to have met Litvinenko on the day the Russian was poisoned , to warn of a plot against his life .
He too appeared to have been poisoned , but that was later discovered to have been the result of a testing error .
On his return to Rome , Scaramella , 36 , was arrested on suspicion of gun-running and violating state secrets .
Boris Berezovsky
Russian billionaire created his empire during Russia 's privatisation drive and fled to the UK after falling out with Vladimir Putin six years ago .
As is often the case , the most interesting things I learned at last August 's round of conferences came not in the formal conference sessions but in the informal small - group conversations before , around , in the interstices of , and after the conference .
Take the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 's " Greenspan Era " conference .
It was held in Jackson Hole , at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park , in the shadow of the Grand Tetons , which are perhaps the most impressive mountain range in North America .
( " Perhaps " because the Canadian central bankers present pointed out the Canadian Rockies from Lake Louise to Jasper , while Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco president Janet Yellen sang the praises of the mountains of her own Federal Reserve District : the east face of the Sierra Nevada as seen from the Owens Valley , to be specific . )
You spend the mornings in windowless conference rooms , and the afternoons outside -- on the Snake River , hiking , climbing , looking for moose , looking for elk , hoping that bear are not looking for you .
But the afternoons -- and the formal and informal breaks in the mornings when you flee the windowless conference room for the fresh air of the west lawn of the lodge to stare at Mount Moran and company across the lake -- are filled with arguments .
Go with Federal Reserve Governor Don Kohn on an afternoon hike up Cascade Canyon , I am told , and expect to gain 3000 feet in two hours while being quizzed intently about technical details of monetary policy .
Try to keep from grounding yourself on sand bars in the Snake River , and you will hear ex-senior executive branch officials of both political parties give their assessments of why neither of the Bush II Treasury Secretaries has been able to make effective use of the thousand or so people who work directly for him .
This time the most interesting rounds of break - and - afternoon conversations I heard were sparked by Sebastian Edwards 's paper about the U.S. current account deficit .
My conversations quickly exposed a deep fault among the conference attendees .
Those who analyzed or forecast the U.S. domestic macroeconomy agreed that a steep decline in the value of the dollar sometime in the next five years was overwhelmingly likely , but by and large they did not think that such a decline would pose a big problem for the U.S. economy .
( They agreed that it might well pose a very big problem for some of America 's trading partners . )
By contrast , those who analyzed or forecast the international economy as a whole were typically terrified by the prospect of a steep ( 30 % or more , perhaps much more ) decline in the value of the dollar : they thought a severe U.S. recession was a definite possibility , and that the situation would require exceptionally skillful handling to keep from becoming a serious economic problem .
Why this disjunction ?
The domestic macroeconomists would typically argue more or less like this :
Yes , the dollar is likely to decline steeply either when foreign central banks stop buying dollar - denominated assets to keep the values of their currencies down or when international speculators lose confidence or both .
But so what ?
The fall in the value of the dollar will boost foreign demand for U.S. exports .
Workers will be pulled out of other sectors into the export sector .
The effects of the dollar decline are much more likely to be a plus for employment rather than a minus , a boom rather than a recession .
To this , the international economists would respond more - or - less like this :
When foreign central banks stop buying or international speculators lose confidence in the value of the dollar and thus stop buying U.S. long - term bonds , two things happen : the value of the dollar falls , and the rate of interest on dollar - denominated long - term bonds spikes .
The spike in long - term interest rates discourages investment spending directly , and also discourages consumption spending because higher interest rates mean lower housing and stock prices and thus lower consumer wealth .
The fall in domestic spending happens now .
The rise in exports as the falling dollar makes U.S. - made products more attractive to foreigners happens two years from now .
In between , a lot of people are unemployed -- and as they are unemployed , they cut back further on their spending .
Plus there is the risk that the fall in the value of the dollar and the fall in long - term asset prices generated by the interest rate spike will cause enough bankruptcies among financial institutions to cause a flight to quality -- which will further raise non-safe interest rates , and further discourage investment and consumption spending
This then puzzled the domestic economists :
Why should interest rates spike ?
The Federal Reserve controls American interest rates .
If it wants to keep the price of the ten - year Treasury bond high , it can simply start buying bonds until the price of ten - year Treasuries is what the Fed wants it to be .
There 's no reason for employment in construction and other interest rate - sensitive sectors to fall before employment in exports and related sectors rises -- at least not unless the Federal Reserve makes a big mistake and allows rising interest rates to shoot the economy in the head .
And at this point the response of the international economists fragmented :
Some said that the falling dollar would create inflation -- with imports at 1/6 of GDP , a 40 % fall in the dollar would , if fully passed through to import prices , add 6 % to the U.S. price level .
The Federal Reserve would feel honor - bound to maintain its reputation as an inflation - fighter , and so would allow interest rates to go high enough to produce enough unemployment to push nominal wages down far enough to offset this rise in import prices .
Thus the Federal Reserve would welcome the spike in interest rates as appropriate , and take no steps to offset it .
Others said that the adjustment to the fall in the dollar would require that ten million workers shift out of construction , retail , and consumer services occupations and into export and import - competing manufacturing industries .
You cannot move ten million American workers from one sector to another in a matter of a year or two without creating lots of structural unemployment .
Still others said that financial stress would be the key : perhaps some major Wall Street firms would discover big unhedged risks in their derivative books ; perhaps perhaps others would find that the values of their portfolios were more responsive to changes in long term interest rates than they had thought .
In either case , it is financial distress and chaos that really triggers the recession .
And the domestic side had rebuttals to each of these three points :
If the Federal Reserve announces now that it is targeting a measure of inflation that is not grossly affected by import prices -- that it is targeting nominal wage growth , say -- there is no need for the Federal Reserve to defend its credibility by attacking the economy .
Just as the Federal Reserve has trained observers that it is more important to worry about ' core inflation ' than ' headline inflation ' , so the Federal Reserve ought to be preparing observers to recognize that inflation produced by rising import prices is a one - time event , not an inflationary spiral that needs to be fought by triggering a deep recession .
A large structural shift will cause high unemployment only if the transition is quick and brutal , and only if workers are pushed out of job - losing rather than pulled into job - gaining sectors .
Whether it is quick or gradual and whether it is push or pull depends , once again , on the path of interest rates .
Only if the Federal Reserve fails to do its job and allows for a massive interest rate spike is there a problem .
Financial stress is something that can be managed : if the Federal Reserve keeps the path of interest rates smooth , great financial stress is unlikely .
And the domestic side of the argument pointed to the historical experience of the U.S. from 1986 - 1990 :
Between 1985 and 1989 the value of the U.S. dollar declined by 40 % .
Between 1986 and 1990 the U.S. trade deficit declined from 4.0 % of GDP to 0.5 % of GDP -- without a big recession , or significant macroeconomic distress .
Before dinner one evening I was lectured by a prominent Washington - area international finance economist about all the reasons that the 1986-1990 U.S. experience was likely to be a bad guide to the future :
1986 - 90 began with a 50 % decline in world oil prices , a powerful stimulus to the world economy .
This time the process is beginning with a doubling of world oil prices .
1986 -90 saw Europe growing rapidly .
Europe has a high propensity to buy U.S. exports , and the European boom meant that U.S. exports grew much faster in the late 1980s than anyone had expected .
This time it is Asia that is booming , not Europe .
And Asia has a relatively low appetite for U.S. exports .
The Japanese government was willing to buy very large amounts of dollar - denominated assets in the late 1980s to keep the decline in the value of the dollar " orderly . "
In so doing , it inflated its domestic credit base and touched off its own property bubble .
No foreign government is going to risk this again just because the U.S. would rather that the decline in the dollar was slow and orderly .
The problem then was half as big relative to the size of the U.S. economy as is the problem now .
One way I found myself thinking of the argument is that the domestic - side economists look at the goods market and think of a decline in the value of the dollar as a supply shock , and as not that big a supply shock : if half of the adjustment in import prices is taken in reduced margins by producers abroad , and if the shock is spread out over four years , then 40 % / 2 x 16 % / 4 = 0.8 % increase in inflation relative to baseline over three consecutive years .
The Federal Reserve could easily allow that to happen without -- providing it explained its causes well -- running any risk of damaging the credibility of its commitment to effective price stability .
No big deal .
International finance economists , by contrast , look at the asset markets .
A 40 % decline in the dollar over four years is a decline at the rate of 10 % per year .
Once financial markets convince themselves that such a decline is coming and that they need to be compensated for it , that ought to drive a 400 basis point wedge between U.S. and foreign long - bond expected returns .
And that is a very big deal .
Martin Feldstein said something very smart just after we had both taken off our shoes at Jackson Hole airport .
He said that the domestic - side economists were keying off the past experience of the U.S. after 1985 and of Britain after 1982 , and so were saying " no big deal " ; while the international finance economists were keying off of the experiences of developing countries that had run large current - account deficits -- Mexico 1994 , East Asia 1997 , Argentina 2001 .
Each side had its own preferred models that functioned very well at explaining the past historical cases that they focused on .
But there was no way right now of settling , empirically , whether a model built to explain the U.S. in 1985 or Korea in 1998 was more applicable to the U.S. in 2006 -- you had to make a bet , either that continuities in U.S. economic structure were important , or that financial globalization was important , in choosing your model and your terms of analysis .
It was very interesting .
And very disturbing .
Brilliant economists , thinking hard , unable to reach even the beginnings of analytical agreement about how to model the distribution of possible futures .
Agrexco is Israel ’s largest importer of agricultural produce into the European Union , and it is 50 % Israeli state owned .
It imports produce from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank .
JOHANNESBURG
IPS
Katishi Masemola , secretary general of the Food and Allied Workers ’ Union ( FAWU ) , told South Africa ’s supermarket chains earlier this week that Israel produces avocado under “ slave - type conditions ” .
He says the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) forbids the use of child labour which , he claims , Israel is employing on avocado farms .
IPS contacted the Israeli embassy in Pretoria , the capital of South Africa , for comment .
It did not return IPS ’s call .
Masemola told IPS in an interview : “ Israel is occupying parts of Palestine and it ’s frustrating its moving towards statehood .
In those occupied territories , avocados are produced under harsh slave - type conditions .
Israeli farmers hire Palestinian children and pay them peanuts . ”
“ The amount of avocado the South African supermarket chains import from Israel is negligible .
It ’s just two percent of the total avocado they procure from overseas and locally , ” he said .
“ The supermarkets can do without it . ”
Derek Donkin , general manager of the South African Avocado Growers ’ Association ( SAAGA ) , said South Africa produces 100,000 tonnes of avocado a year .
“ Between 40,000 and 45,000 tonnes are exported .
The rest is sold for local consumption , ” he told IPS from his organisation ’s headquarters in Tzaneen , a four - hour drive from South Africa ’s commercial hub of Johannesburg .
“ South Africa imports a small amount of avocado during off season ( November - February ) when we do n’t produce avocado .
Many of the avocados come from Spain , ” he said .
In a Jan. 16 letter to Shaheed Mohamed , the coordinator of the South Africa branch of the Sanctions Against Israel Coalition , Brian Weyers , marketing director for Shoprite Checkers , a leading supermarket chain , said the Shoprite Group imported only 1.12 percent of 6.8 million avocados which it sold in 2006 from Israel .
“ We bought 93.85 percent of the avocados locally and imported 5.03 percent from Spain and Kenya , ” he said .
Weyers said the fruit was out of season and that was why they were forced to resort to alternative sources .
“ In the instance of imported avocados , these were bought from a company in Israel , Carmel Agrexco , whom we are assured also has many Arab growers supplying fruits to them for export , ” Weyers said .
“ We must also point out that Shoprite is not the only company in South Africa that sells Israeli produce .
Today we purchase Israeli minneolas , grapefruit , naartjies , and persimmons in most of our competitors ’ stores in Cape Town , ” he said .
When IPS began making inquiries , it found that the fruit debate was only the tip of the iceberg .
“ It ’s not only avocado .
The main item that concerns us is diamond .
Israel imports diamond from South Africa ; polishes it and cuts it before selling it back to South Africa at almost ten times its original value .
It does the same with gold , ” Mohamed told IPS by phone from Cape Town .
“ Israel imports diamond worth three billion rand ( about 430 million dollars ) from South Africa a year .
Israel does n’t produce a single diamond .
Yet 30 percent of its GDP ( gross domestic product ) comes from diamond .
The diamond could be polished and cut in South Africa to provide jobs for the estimated 40 percent unemployed South Africans , ” he said .
In the past 12 months , De Beers — the leading diamond mining company in South Africa — retrenched 1,200 workers out of its over 10,000 workers , according to Rivonia Mura Khosi , a union leader at the De Beers mine in Kimberly , South Africa .
“ On top of that they want to retrench 400 more workers .
Next week we are going to meet the management over the issue .
If we can save the retrenchment , the better for us , ” he told IPS in an interview .
“ If not , then we ’ll try to negotiate a good package for them .
It will be hard . ”
Slowly , the anti-Israeli coalition is growing in South Africa .
“ We have n’t made the call to impose sanctions against Israel yet .
We know Israel commits atrocities against Palestinians .
But we are moving there .
It ’s just a matter of months , ” Masemola said .
“ We are making a call to mobilise South African workers .
We want to all diamonds from Israel to be treated as conflict diamonds .
We urge people not to buy diamonds from Israel , ” said Mohamed .
An international campaign targeting Israeli crafted diamonds is planned for February in South Africa , Britain , Canada , Australia and Ireland .
For its part , the De Beers Group denies any wrongdoing .
“ 100 percent of De Beers ’ diamonds are certified as conflict - free .
Currently , less than one percent of the world ’s diamonds are conflict diamonds .
While today more than 99 percent of rough diamonds are certified to be from conflict - free sources the diamond industry has a zero tolerance policy towards conflict diamonds and will not rest until conflict diamonds are completely eradicated , ” it said on its website .
“ While Sierra Leone is now at peace , currently Liberia , Republic of Congo ( also known as Congo - Brazzaville ) and the Ivory Coast are under UN sanctions , ” it added .
Under the 2003 Kimberly Process certification scheme , which groups 71 countries , diamonds must be conflict - free .
The process was prompted by bloody conflicts in diamond - rich African countries , which have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives .
In Africa , Mohamed ’s coalition operates in Morocco and Egypt. South Africa hosts the only one , so far known , in sub-Saharan Africa .
Mohamed ’s four colleagues attended the Jan. 20 - 25 World Social Forum ( WSF ) in Nairobi , Kenya , where they organised a demonstration against Israel .
Mohamed said the coalition is also targeting South Africa for selling aircraft and helicopter parts to Israel .
He said Israel uses helicopter gunship against Palestinians .
“ By implication , we are involved in the murder of innocent Palestinian civilians by Israeli soldiers , ” he said .
The South African government , which has not imposed sanctions , nor introduced boycott regulations , on Israeli goods , is perceived to be pro-Palestine , given the history between the ruling African National Congress ( ANC ) and the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .
The former apartheid regime worked closely with the Jewish state .

Author Hal Fulton has updated his modern classic , The Ruby Way .
The publication of the second edition , due the third week of October to coincide with RubyConf 2006 , marks the launch of Addison Wesley 's Professional Ruby Series .
In this InfoQ exclusive excerpt , Hal answers the question which sets the tone for his entire book :
What is “ the Ruby Way ” ?
Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself , and see if we may not eff it after all .
— Douglas Adams , Dirk Gently ’s Holistic Detective Agency
What do we mean by the Ruby Way ?
My belief is that there are two related aspects :
One is the philosophy of the design of Ruby ; the other is the philosophy of its usage .
It is natural that design and use should be interrelated , whether in software or hardware ; why else should there be such a field as ergonomics ?
If I build a device and put a handle on it , it is because I expect someone to grab that handle .

Ruby has a nameless quality that makes it what it is .
We see that quality present in the design of the syntax and semantics of the language , but it is also present in the programs written for that interpreter .
Yet as soon as we make this distinction , we blur it .
Clearly Ruby is not just a tool for creating software , but it is a piece of software in its own right .
Why should the workings of Ruby programs follow laws different from those that guide the workings of the interpreter ?
After all , Ruby is highly dynamic and extensible .
There might be reasons that the two levels should differ here and there , probably for accommodating to the inconvenience of the real world .
But in general , the thought processes can and should be the same .
Ruby could be implemented in Ruby , in true Hofstadter - like fashion , though it is not at the time of this writing .
We do n’t often think of the etymology of the word way ; but there are two important senses in which it is used .
On the one hand , it means a method or technique , but it can also mean a road or path .
Obviously these two meanings are interrelated , and I think when I say “ the Ruby Way , ” I mean both of them .
So what we are talking about is a thought process , but it is also a path that we follow .
Even the greatest software guru cannot claim to have reached perfection but only to follow the path .
And there may be more than one path , but here I can only talk about one .
The conventional wisdom says that form follows function .
And the conventional wisdom is , of course , conventionally correct .
But Frank Lloyd Wright ( speaking in his own field ) once said : “ Form follows function — that has been misunderstood .
Form and function should be one , joined in a spiritual union . ”
What did Wright mean ?
I would say that this truth is not something you learn from a book , but from experience .
However , I would argue that Wright expressed this truth elsewhere in pieces easier to digest .
He was a great proponent of simplicity , saying once , “ An architect ’s most useful tools are an eraser at the drafting board and a wrecking bar at the site . ”
So one of Ruby ’s virtues is simplicity .
Shall I quote other thinkers on the subject ?
According to Antoine de St. Exupery , “ Perfection is achieved , not when there is nothing left to add , but when there is nothing left to take away . ”
But Ruby is a complex language .
How can I say that it is simple ?
If we understood the universe better , we might find a “ law of conservation of complexity ” — a fact of reality that disturbs our lives like entropy so that we cannot avoid it but can only redistribute it .
And that is the key .
We ca n’t avoid complexity , but we can push it around .
We can bury it out of sight .
This is the old “ black box ” principle at work ; a black box performs a complex task , but it possesses simplicity on the outside .
If you have n’t already lost patience with my quotations , a word from Albert Einstein is appropriate here : “ Everything should be as simple as possible , but no simpler . ”
So in Ruby we see simplicity embodied from the programmer ’s view ( if not from the view of those maintaining the interpreter ) .
Yet we also see the capacity for compromise .
In the real world , we must bend a little .
For example , every entity in a Ruby program should be a true object , but certain values such as integers are stored as immediate values .
In a trade - off familiar to computer science students for decades , we have traded elegance of design for practicality of implementation .
In effect , we have traded one kind of simplicity for another .
What Larry Wall said about Perl holds true : “ When you say something in a small language , it comes out big .
When you say something in a big language , it comes out small . ”
The same is true for English .
The reason that biologist Ernst Haeckel could say “ Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny ” in only three words was that he had these powerful words with highly specific meanings at his disposal .
We allow inner complexity of the language because it enables us to shift the complexity away from the individual utterance .
I would state this guideline this way :
Do n’t write 200 lines of code when 10 will do .
I ’m taking it for granted that brevity is generally a good thing .
A short program fragment will take up less space in the programmer ’s brain ; it will be easier to grasp as a single entity .
As a happy side effect , fewer bugs will be injected while the code is being written .
Of course , we must remember Einstein ’s warning about simplicity .
If we put brevity too high on our list of priorities , we will end up with code that is hopelessly obfuscated .
Information theory teaches us that compressed data is statistically similar to random noise ; if you have looked at C or APL or regular expression notation — especially badly written — you have experienced this truth firsthand .
“ Simple , but not too simple ” ; that is the key .
Embrace brevity , but do not sacrifice readability .
It is a truism that both brevity and readability are good .
But there is an underly - ing reason for this , one so fundamental that we sometimes forget it .
The reason is that computers exist for humans , not humans for computers .
In the old days , it was almost the opposite .
Computers cost millions of dollars and ate electricity at the rate of many kilowatts .
People acted as though the computer were a minor deity and the programmers were humble supplicants .
An hour of the computer ’s time was more expensive than an hour of a person ’s time .
When computers became smaller and cheaper , high - level languages also became more popular .
These were inefficient from the computer ’s point of view but efficient from the human perspective .
Ruby is simply a later development in this line of thought .
Some , in fact , have called it a VHLL ( Very High - Level Language ) ; though this term is not well - defined , I think its use is justified here .
The computer is supposed to be the servant , not the master , and , as Matz has said , a smart servant should do a complex task with a few short commands .
This has been true through all the history of computer science .
We started with machine languages and progressed to assembly language and then to high - level languages .
What we are talking about here is a shift from a machine - centered paradigm to a human - centered one .
In my opinion , Ruby is an excellent example of human - centric programming .
I ’ll shift gears a little .
There was a wonderful little book from the 1980s called The Tao of Programming ( by Geoffrey James ) .
Nearly every line is quotable , but I ’ll repeat only this : “ A program should follow the ‘ Law of Least Astonishment . ’
What is this law ?
It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the way that astonishes him least . ”
( Of course , in the case of a language interpreter , the user is the programmer . )
I do n’t know whether James coined this term , but his book was my first introduction to the phrase .
This is a principle that is well known and often cited in the Ruby community , though it is usually called the Principle of Least Surprise or POLS .
( I myself stubbornly prefer the acronym LOLA . )
Whatever you call it , this rule is a valid one , and it has been a guideline through - out the ongoing development of the Ruby language .
It is also a useful guideline for those who develop libraries or user interfaces .
The only problem , of course , is that different people are surprised by different things ; there is no universal agreement on how an object or method “ ought ” to behave .
We can strive for consistency and strive to justify our design decisions , and each person can train his own intuition .
For the record , Matz has said that “ least surprise ” should refer to him as the designer .
The more you think like him , the less Ruby will surprise you .
And I assure you , imitating Matz is not a bad idea for most of us .
No matter how logically constructed a system may be , your intuition needs to be trained .
Each programming language is a world unto itself , with its own set of assumptions , and human languages are the same .
When I took German , I learned that all nouns were capitalized , but the word deutsch was not .
I complained to my professor ; after all , this was the name of the language , was n’t it ?
He smiled and said , “ Do n’t fight it . ”
What he taught me was to let German be German .
By extension , that is good advice for anyone coming to Ruby from some other language .
Let Ruby be Ruby .
Do n’t expect it to be Perl , because it is n’t ; do n’t expect it to be LISP or Smalltalk , either .
On the other hand , Ruby has common elements with all three of these .
Start by following your expectations , but when they are violated , do n’t fight it .
( Unless Matz agrees it ’s a needed change . )
Every programmer today knows the orthogonality principle ( which would better be termed the orthogonal completeness principle ) .
Suppose we have an imaginary pair of axes with a set of comparable language entities on one and a set of attributes or capabilities on the other .
When we talk of “ orthogonality , ” we usually mean that the space defined by these axes is as “ full ” as we can logically make it .
Part of the Ruby Way is to strive for this orthogonality .
An array is in some ways similar to a hash ; so the operations on each of them should be similar .
The limit is reached when we enter the areas where they are different .
Matz has said that “ naturalness ” is to be valued over orthogonality .
But to fully understand what is natural and what is not may take some thinking and some coding .
Ruby strives to be friendly to the programmer .
For example , there are aliases or synonyms for many method names ; size and lenght will both return the number of entries in an array .
The variant spelling indexes and indices both refer to the same method .
Some consider this sort of thing to be an annoyance or anti-feature , but I consider it a good design .
Ruby strives for consistency and regularity .
There is nothing mysterious about this ; in every aspect of life , we yearn for things to be regular and parallel .
What makes it a little more tricky is learning when to violate this principle .
For instance , Ruby has the habit of appending a question mark (? ) to the name of a predicatelike method .
This is well and good ; it clarifies the code and makes the namespace a little more manageable .
But what is more controversial is the similar use of the exclamation point in marking methods that are “ destructive ” or “ dangerous ” in the sense that they modify their receivers .
The controversy arises because not all of the destructive methods are marked in this way .
Should n’t we be consistent ?
No , in fact we should not .
Some of the methods by their very nature change their receiver ( such as the Array methods replace and concat ) .
Some of them are “ writer ” methods allowing assignment to a class attribute ; we should not append an exclamation point to the attribute name or the equal sign .
Some methods arguably change the state of the receiver , such as read ; this occurs too frequently to be marked in this way .
If every destructive method name ended in a ! , our programs soon would look like sales brochures for a multilevel marketing firm .
Do you notice a kind of tension between opposing forces , a tendency for all rules to be violated ?
Let me state this as Fulton ’s Second Law : Every rule has an exception , except Fulton ’s Second Law .
( Yes , there is a joke there , a very small one . )
What we see in Ruby is not a “ foolish consistency ” nor a rigid adherence to a set of simple rules .
In fact , perhaps part of the Ruby Way is that it is not a rigid and inflexible approach .
In language design , as Matz once said , you should “ follow your heart . ”
Yet another aspect of the Ruby philosophy is :
Do not fear change at runtime ; do not fear what is dynamic .
The world is dynamic ; why should a programming language be static ?
Ruby is one of the most dynamic languages in existence .
I would also argue that another aspect is :
Do not be a slave to performance issues .
When performance is unacceptable , the issue must be addressed , but it should normally not be the first thing you think about .
Prefer elegance over efficiency where efficiency is less than critical .
Then again , if you are writing a library that may be used in unforeseen ways , performance may be critical from the start .
When I look at Ruby , I perceive a balance between different design goals , a complex interaction reminiscent of the n-body problem in physics .
I can imagine it might be modeled as an Alexander Calder mobile .
It is perhaps this interaction itself , the harmony , that embodies Ruby ’s philosophy rather than just the individual parts .
Programmers know that their craft is not just science and technology but art .
I hesitate to say that there is a spiritual aspect to computer science , but just between you and me , there certainly is .
( If you have not read Robert Pirsig ’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , I recommend that you do so . )
Ruby arose from the human urge to create things that are useful and beautiful .
Programs written in Ruby should spring from that same God - given source .
That , to me , is the essence of the Ruby Way .

Could we really all be " connected " to each other ?
Not necessarily to the rich and famous , but how well are we all connected to each other ?
One of the most famous claims is that anyone can reach anyone else through a chain of acquaintances no more than six people long .
This idea , known as " six degrees of separation " , is a measure of our social networks .
The phrase was coined by an American academic , Stanley Milgram , after experiments in which he asked people to pass a letter only to others they knew by name .
The aim was to get it , eventually , to a named person they did not know living in another city .
SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION
Mayo Ogunlabi tested the theory .
Read her account
It is a seductive idea .
Films have been made about it , there are parlour games based on it and mathematics has begun to propose theories for why it should be true .
But is it ?
Judith Kleinfeld , a professor psychology at Alaska Fairbanks University , went back to Milgram 's original research notes and found something surprising .
It turned out , she told us , that 95 % of the letters sent out had failed to reach the target .
Not only did they fail to get there in six steps , they failed to get there at all .
Milgram was a giant figure in his world of research , but here was evidence that the claim he was famously associated with was not supported by his experiments .
Six degrees of separation ' may be the academic equivalent of an urban myth
Judith Kleinfeld , Psychologist
And when she looked for other studies , none of those matched up to the claim either .
In the most recent , two years ago , only 3 % of letters reached their target .
" If 95 or 97 letters out of 100 never reached their target , would you say it was proof of six degrees of separation ?
So why do we want to believe this ? "
" The pleasing idea that we live in a ' small world ' where people are connected by ' six degrees of separation ' may be the academic equivalent of an urban myth , " she says .
Now Professor
Kleinfeld argues that what is more important is not the number of links , but the quality .
Even if you were able to say you could get to the Queen in three steps , it would tell you little about how well you are really connected with her .
We like the idea of six degrees of separation , she says , because it makes the world feel more intimate .
But there are barriers - like race and class - she argues , that can sometimes make separation real and deep .
Of course , just because a letter fails to reach its target does not mean that it could not have done it in six steps by some other route .
But that is a reasonable hope , not a fact .
The belief that it has been proved that we live in a world of six degrees of separation does not seem to be true .
Would you like to hear the rest of the BayStar story ?
Then pull up a chair , my friends .
On page 21 in IBM 's Amended Redacted Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment on SCO 's Interference Claims ( SCO 's Seventh , Eighth and Ninth Causes of Action [ PDF ] , IBM reveals that SCO alleged that it was IBM that got BayStar to threaten litigation against SCO and to terminate its business relationship .
BayStar denies it , as does IBM .
If you noticed a Declaration by Larry Goldfarb on the list of exhibits [ PDF ] , this is what it 's about .
He provided a declaration for IBM stating that SCO 's allegations are n't true .
A lot of folks have done so too , and so IBM is now asking the court to toss out these three SCO claims .
BayStar , Goldfarb testifies , dumped SCO because its stock price , financial performance and the viability of its UNIX products all appeared to be in decline , and he " was also very concerned about SCO 's high cash burn rate . "
Pure financial animals get nervous when that happens .
But the kicker was he began to realize that Microsoft , whose senior VP of corporate development and strategy had promised that Microsoft would in some way guarantee the SCO investment , started showing signs it might not do that after all : " Mr. Emerson and I discussed a variety of investment structures wherein Microsoft would ' backstop , ' or guarantee in some way , BayStar 's investment ....
Microsoft assured me that it would in some way guarantee BayStar 's investment in SCO . "
Let me interrupt my narrative to quickly ask ,
Why ever would Microsoft guarantee BayStar 's investment in SCO ?
What would be the business purpose here ?
What would Microsoft 's benefit or payback be ?
What were they hoping for as the return on the investment ?
And why did n't they wish to invest directly ?
Pray do explain .
Joke .
Joke .
Anyhow , after the investment was made , Goldfarb says , " Microsoft stopped returning my phone calls and emails , and to the best of my knowledge , Mr. Emerson was fired from Microsoft . "
Ah !
The well - known Microsoft 180 .
Kiss kiss , let 's do a deal .
Drop dead .
Well , not to try to teach Mr. Goldfarb anything , since he 's the businessman , not I , but is n't life 's highway littered with companies who thought it'd be remunerative to be a Microsoft partner , only to end up as roadkill ?
That 's what I 've been reading , anyway .
In any case , now we know the rest of the story about BayStar .
Good for Mr. Goldfarb , for providing this declaration .
He did n't have to do that .
But that 's not the only crazy SCO allegation .
After SCO filed its Final Disclosures , SCO served on IBM a revised interrogatory response regarding its claims of interference .
It identified , among other things , 6 companies or entities IBM allegedly interfered with by direct contacts , namely BayStar , HP , Computer Associates , Oracle and Intel and an " OpenSource conference in Scottsdale , Arizona . "
Say , what was that last one , again ?
It seems John Terpstra was hosting a conference in the spring of 2004 .
SCO 's story is that Darl had an oral agreement with Terpstra to speak at the conference , but it claims IBM allegedly told Terpstra it did n't want Darl to speak at the conference and would withdraw its support if he did .
How would one quantify the damages due to SCO from that missed opportunity for Darl to speak at an Open Source conference ?
One can't help but wonder .
Did he think he'd rake in some business at an Open Source conference , after going for Linux 's throat with his fangs ?
Apparently so , because IBM is alleged to have interfered with SCO 's ability to " generate potential new business and establish goodwill in the open source community . "
Say , what ?
Goodwill ?
In the Open Source community ?
These SCOfolk have no shame .
In 2004 , do you remember SCO trying to establish goodwill in the community ?
It was actively suing DaimlerChrysler and AutoZone , opposing Red Hat 's request to the judge to reconsider and let the case go forward , threatening legal activity in Spain , Germany , and the UK against Linux users , issuing a subpoena to FSF , all the while FUDing away to such a degree Red Hat brought it to the court 's attention .
None of that was endearing to the Open Source community .
Yet he actually thought he'd get business from speaking at an Open Source conference ?
I do n't really think so .
Darl attended the Novell BrainShare conference that spring , but secretly , under cover , in disguise .
If he wanted goodwill , why would he do that ?
Sometimes I wonder if news can't make it over the Wasatch Mountains .
SCO seems so cut off from reality .
If you do n't remember all that history , just go to our Archives and look by dates at that time period .
I think it would be hard to find conduct more offensive to the Open Source community than what we watched back then .
About the only thing worse would be SCO 's conduct the year before .
This filing is an hilarious account of all IBM went through to try to figure out what SCO 's claims regarding interference really are .
What SCO wrote in its Second Amended Complaint does n't altogether match what SCO later came up with .
BayStar , for example , is n't even mentioned in the complaint .
Here 's the short version of SCO 's claims , the heart of what IBM is responding to , the pertinent causes of action in the complaint .
For the long version you can read the complaint itself , but it hardly seems worth it , since SCO 's claims morph and grow and then contract , and serious study of the original claims probably wo n't help you figure out what SCO is complaining about now , but here 's the essence of the claims as they started : 7th , Interference with Contract -- " IBM , directly and through its Linux distribution partners , has intentionally and without justification induced SCOs customers and licensees to breach their corporate licensing agreements , including but not limited to , inducing the customers to reverse engineer , decompile , translate , create derivative works , modify or otherwise use the UNIX software in ways in violation of the license agreements .
These customers include Sherwin Williams , Auto Zone , among others . "
8th , Interference with Contract -- " Specifically , commencing on or about May 2003 , Novell began falsely claiming that Novell , not SCO , owned the copyrights relating to UNIX System V .
On information and belief , IBM had induced or otherwise caused Novell to take the position that Novell owned the copyrights -- a position that is flatly contradicted by the Asset Purchase Agreement .
Since that time , Novell has improperly registered the same copyrights that it sold to SCO and that SCO had previously registered .
" In addition , IBM intentionally and improperly interfered with the Asset Purchase Agreement by inducing or otherwise causing Novell to violate the Asset Purchase Agreement by claiming Novell could waive and was waiving breaches of license agreements by various licensees , including IBM .
... Again , Novell 's position , improperly encouraged and induced by IBM , is flatly contrary to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement .
9th , Interference with Business Relationships -- " SCO had existing or potential economic relationships with a variety of companies in the computer industry , including but not limited to Hewlett Packard .
IBM has intentionally interfered with plaintiff 's existing or potential economic relations .
For example , at Linux World in January , 2003 IBM representatives contacted various companies with whom SCO had existing or potential economic relations .
These IBM representatives said that IBM was discontinuing doing business with SCO and that these other companies , some of whom are business partners with IBM , also should discontinue doing business with SCO . "
Essentially , then , SCO alleged that IBM somehow induced Novell to get copyrights on Unix , to waive any alleged breach on IBM 's part , all in violation of the APA , and SCO also says that IBM told HP and other companies at Linuxworld in 2003 that IBM was n't going to do any business with SCO and neither should they .
That 's in the complaint .
But IBM goes on to recount how SCO 's claims kept changing , without IBM ever being able to find out exactly what SCO was alleging IBM had done .
In interrogatories and depositions and various communications , the story kept changing , and IBM details for the court how hard it has tried to find out what its " crimes " actually amounted to , and now it asks the court to deep six these three claims .
In IBM 's Preliminary Statement , IBM writes : SCO 's Seventh , Eighth and Ninth Causes of Action allege that IBM has interfered with SCO 's contracts and business relationships with customers , business partners and other entities .
As shown in detail below , SCO 's description of these claims has shifted throughout the pretrial proceedings , expanding , contracting , and again expanding ( at times wildly ) , with the only constant thing being SCO 's failure to provide any clear identification of the specific contracts or business relationships that were supposedly injured or the acts of IBM that allegedly caused such injury .
Although it appeared that SCO was attempting simply to avoid disclosing its evidence ( at least until trial ) , it is now clear that what SCO has been seeking to disguise is the lack of any support for these claims at all .
Yes , it is n't just code that SCO is n't providing specifics about .
It 's the alleged interference too .
Which businesses did IBM interfere with ?
IBM asked SCO to tell it in interrogatories .
SCO kept changing the list , and there were no specifics provided , despite several court orders .
So , having failed to get answers from interrogatories , IBM tried deposing folks that SCO provided to testify about the alleged interference with 14 companies IBM listed in its notice .
IBM deposed Jeff Hunsaker and Ryan Tibbits .
However , IBM found Hunsaker " not prepared " to answer its questions with the kind of detailed and specific information IBM was asking for .
SCO handed over two more documents listing 13 companies , and IBM deposed Darl McBride and asked him if the 13 companies in the documents were the only companies with which IBM was alleged to have interfered .
McBride ended up listing 10 " acts " involving 43 entities , and while the section is heavily redacted , it ends by telling that at the deposition , " Mr. McBride could not identify all of the members of these groups . "
IBM wrote to SCO to object to McBride 's apparent attempt to expand the claims in his testimony , noting he did n't testify from first - hand experience , and SCO seemed to back off and said Mr. Tibbits would testify on those matters and they'd be consistent with the numbers on the IBM interrogatories , the depositions , and the two documents SCO provided the day before McBride 's deposition .
But then , at the Tibbits deposition , SCO produced a spreadsheet , listing interferences SCO was alleging " and currently investigating " and there were some 250 entities in at least 7 countries listed , but again , no meaningful details about exactly how IBM was alleged to have interfered or how SCO was harmed .
Mr. Tibbits essentially just read from the spreadsheet , IBM claims , or speculated in his answers .
So after interrogatories and now three depositions , IBM was still in the dark as to what it had allegedly done , except that they now knew that SCO was alleging that IBM 's sales force was allegedly persuading SCO 's customers that " SCO has no viability " and that there was IBM direct pressure to stop dealing with SCO .
But again , no specifics .
So here 's IBM , wondering how many entities is it ?
It spoke with SCO 's counsel , who said they 'd decided to limit it to maybe ten , possibly five .
SCO would give IBM an updated interrogatory response reflecting this soon .
IBM warned SCO that if it failed to do so , IBM would bring the matter to the judge .
But when SCO next filed its Final Disclosures , it did n't include the updated interrogatory response .
The next day , SCO told IBM the final number would be six , BayStar , HP , Oracle , AutoZone , Intel and Novell .
The next month , after the Final Disclosures , SCO served on IBM the revised interrogatory response , in which it identified 150 entities allegedly interfered with , and the 6 companies or entities IBM allegedly interfered with by direct contacts .
SCO says that it and HP still have a " good business relationship " but HP provides a lot less support than in 2002 , and it blames IBM for that .
The essence of SCO 's interference gripe , though , is that IBM encouraged companies to migrate to Linux rather than use SCO 's Unix products .
High crimes and misdemeanors indeed .
IBM " enabled " them to switch .
Dear SCO : That 's called competing in business .
There 's no law against that that I know of .
SCO provided IBM a list of some 19 customers SCO said it lost because they moved to Linux , including KMart , Safeway , Shaw's Supermarkets , Target , and AutoZone .
IBM next tried to depose Tibbits a second time , as recently as June 30 , 2006 .
Tibbits narrowed SCO 's claims , saying it was dropping its tortious interference claims with respect to five of the 19 " former SCO customers " in its last supplement response to the interrogatory .
The five dropped would be Avnet , Frazee Paints , Save Mart , Snyder Drug Stores and Target -- " because these companies had not switched to a Linux platform at all . "
You know SCO .
Claim first , research later .
So that left 14 vague interference claims entities , the seven identified entities that IBM allegedly directly contacted or SCO alleges specific interfering conduct , BayStar , HP , Computer Associates , Oracle , Intel , Novell , and that conference , and some 156 " other Linux users " who were somehow influenced by the marketplace to switch , or maybe they did .
SCO says they make the claim only on information and belief .
I 'll mention that you can't prevail against a summary judgment motion with " information and belief " materials .
It has to be actual facts .
SCO has to raise a genuine issue of fact to survive this motion , and supposings and maybes and probably wo n't cut it , as IBM carefully shows , with cases to back up the position .
OK , so now IBM knows the list of entities , but where 's the evidence ?
" SCO has not identified any evidence of improper conduct by IBM that interfered with any of its contracts or business relationships and it cannot do so , for at least the reasons explained below , " IBM tells the court .
Aside from the BayStar incident , IBM provides rebuttal declarations on every accusation : Computer Associates , Oracle and Intel : IBM never stated to them at Linuxworld 2003 it was cutting off its ties with SCO or that they should do the same , they all testify .
All of them have provided declarations so stating , and so has Karen Smith , the former IBM respresentative accused of having said it .
Does SCO just make stuff up ?
Or are there paranoid tendencies here ?
There 's more .
It turns out that it was SCO itself that " supported the migration of Computer Associates , Oracle and Intel products to Linux , partnering with each of these companies to provide Linux solutions to their end users . "
A former SCO employee , Gregory Anderson , states that any change in those relationships had to do with SCO 's [ alleged ] decision not to continue to distribute Linux products . "
That word in brackets tells a story .
HP : HP provides a declaration as well , by the way .
And any of us who despised them for continuing to partner with SCO needs to repent in sackcloth and ashes , because as a result of not breaking off the relationship , HP can now provide IBM a strong defense from the charge of interfering with SCO 's relationship with HP .
Terpstra :
As for the Arizona conference , Terpstra rescinded the invitation because of complaints from other participants , not IBM , who was n't involved in that conference in any way .
IBM was invited , Terpstra states in a declaration , but they did n't want to participate , but they never said anything about McBride .
Others surely did though , threatening not to participate if McBride was a speaker , so he called McBride and took back the invitation .
Why it was ever offered in the first place is a mystery .
Novell :
As for Novell , there 's a declaration from Novell 's lawyer , Joseph LaSala , saying that IBM did n't induce anything .
Novell got the copyrights , because Novell owns them .
It waived because it has the right to and it was in Novell 's interest to do so .
IBM did n't ask for that or ever " express a desire that Novell breach , or take any action contrary to , the APA , Amendment X , or any other agreement between Novell and Santa Cruz or Novell and SCO . "
Careful language .
Why IBM supported Linux :
As to why IBM supported Linux , its purpose had nothing to do with ill will to SCO .
It wanted to make money , and it supported Linux for competitive reasons .
As for SCO 's amorphous claims , IBM notes that not one of SCO 's experts " attempts to quantify or even address the alleged damages allegedly caused by IBM . "
There were factors adversely affecting Santa Cruz 's business since 1999 , at least , that had nothing to do with IBM .
SCO could n't get new customers even when Linux was new , did n't have credentials and was relatively unproven .
After the Caldera acquisition , Caldera was basically trying to keep the customers it had as opposed to getting new ones for UnixWare and OpenServer .
As for its Linux products , they were more expensive than the competition's .
The company did that , kept Linux at a comparative price with the Unix products , because otherwise it would " devalue our UNIX business . "
This is a quotation from Exhibit 308 , the sealed transcript of a November 2004 deposition of Philip E. Langer .
IBM says it is entitled to summary judgment for three independent reasons :
1 ) Of the companies SCO mentioned specifically by name , the companies or entities all deny any such interference and there 's absolutely no evidence on SCO 's side to support its allegations .
And as for the alleged interference with the Unix on Intel market , Utah law does n't recognize activities regarding an entire market as a basis for recovery for " intentional " interference ;
2 ) Utah law , which IBM says applies to the interference claims because if there had been any injury , it would have been there that it would have been felt , requires SCO to prove that IBM 's allegedly tortious acts were undertaken with an improper purpose or by improper means , which is not the case , IBM sums up .
In fact , SCO 's own experts have acknowledged that IBM 's support for Linux was motivated by " compelling competitive reasons and undertaken for the purpose of protecting IBM 's legitimate , long - range economic interests " ;
3 ) There 's no causal link shown by SCO between anything IBM has done and any specific injury to SCO .
If SCO is experiencing a deteriorating business , its own witnesses and documents show it 's because of a variety of factors having nothing to do with IBM , including " decisions made by SCO management . "
I 'll say .
You can't sue your own customers and expect business to pick up .
Business 101 .
And when Caldera / SCO decided , allegedly , not to distribute Linux any more , it was simply sure to lose both customers and partners .
It had been first a Linux vendor .
And you are n't likely to win on interference claims for your declining business after you 've shot your own business in the foot .
IBM asks that the court dismiss these three SCO claims with prejudice " and as a matter of law . "
Update :
The story has now hit The Wall Street Journal [ sub req'd ] , as well as Slashdot , and Ars Technica .
The Journal has some interesting details .
I gather they have the Goldfarb declaration already in hand : Mr. Goldfarb testifies that Richard Emerson , a Microsoft senior vice president , approached him " sometime in 2003 " about investing in SCO .
Mr. Emerson , who is no longer with Microsoft , " stated that Microsoft wished to promote SCO and its pending lawsuit against IBM and the Linux operating system .
But Microsoft did not want to be seen as attacking IBM or Linux , " Mr. Goldfarb testified .
Update 2 : It 's now picked up by IDG News Service , as you can see on LinuxWorld and InfoWorld also .

Whistleblower suspended by Pentagon oversight committee RAW STORY
Published : January 24 , 2006 Print This | Email
This A senior fraud investigator for the Pentagon who has crusaded against military contractor overcharges for seven years has been suspended for " insubordination , " according to an article written by Eric Rosenberg for the Hearst News Service , RAW STORY has learned .
Rosenberg 's article , which went out to Hearst member papers , has not appeared in any of them , nor has any story been published by the mainstream press about his suspension , according to Google News .
Kenneth Pedeleose , an industrial engineer for the Defense Contract Management Agency ( DCMA ) , told Hearst that his 30 - day suspension was " absolutely related " to his whistleblowing .
In 2002 , Pedeleose 's 90 - page report " Criminal Vulnerability and Fraud " which accused Lockheed Martin of " willfully " overcharging the Pentagon and defense officials of ignoring his warnings led Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley ( Rep - IA ) to persuade DoD 's Inspector 's General offices to launch investigations .

Pedeleose told Federal Times in 2004 that he believed he " ruined his career and lost any chance for promotion because of his fight . "
The Washington Post reported last November that Pedeleose faced suspension for refusing to cooperate in an internal investigation to determine " the source of a rumor that management had " targeted certain employees " to be fired . "
Excerpts from Rosenberg 's article : # Kenneth Pedeleose , 45 , an industrial engineer and 11 - year veteran of the Defense Contract Management Agency ( DCMA ) , who has uncovered excessive costs on Lockheed Martin Corp.
aircraft , claimed his suspension is reprisal for disclosing overcharges and for disrupting a cozy relationship between the agency and Lockheed Martin -- the country 's largest defense contractor .
.... DCMA previously attempted to suspend Pedeleose in 2003 after officials claimed he had made threats against fellow employees .
The agency later acknowledged that he had made no such threats and reinstated him .
....
Pedeleose 's suspension , which is effective Jan 25 , is " for the offense of refusal to cooperate with an agency investigation , insubordination and failure to follow instructions , " according to a copy of the suspension notice .
" The overall seriousness of your misconduct warrants a heavy disciplinary penalty , " said the letter from Steven Bogusz , deputy director for DCMA 's regional headquarters in Boston , to Pedeleose . #

Laptop thieves descend upon wireless cafes / Grab - and - run robbers find pricey computers easy to resell
A San Francisco finance manager stopped in at a Mission District cafe and was tapping on his laptop as he enjoyed his coffee just before noon on a Thursday .
Suddenly , he was under siege .
" I looked up , and I saw this guy leaning into me as if he was asking a question , " he said .
" I leaned forward , and out of the corner of my eye , I saw someone fiddling with the computer cord .
I tried to stand up , and as I stepped back , he stabbed me in the chest . "
The attack marked a violent turn in a wave of crime that has hit the city -- the " hot spots " frequented by wireless laptop users are becoming hot spots for laptop robberies .
The 40 - year - old San Francisco victim of the March 16 attack suffered a partially collapsed lung and was hospitalized for six days .
The two suspects fled with his Apple PowerBook , worth $ 2,500 .
" This poor guy , who got stabbed , all he did was kind of stand up ... and almost instantaneously the guy stabbed him , " said Inspector Robert Lynch of the San Francisco police robbery detail .
" The whole thing was over in 15 seconds . "
Police say normally quiet cafes are becoming hunting grounds for laptop bandits .
" Now that we have these hot zones , people are bringing laptops out in the street , using them in public cafes , " said police Lt. John Loftus of the robbery detail .
San Francisco police statistics show a disturbing trend .
Just 18 laptop computer robberies were logged in 2004 , but the figure jumped to 48 last year .
There were 18 as of the end of March , a pace that could surpass 70 crimes this year .
" It 's a changing culture , and crime is following it , " Loftus said .
" To the criminal element , this is a valuable piece of equipment that they can quite easily cash in on -- even otherwise law - abiding people are tempted to buy $ 3,000 laptops for $ 200 to $ 300 on the street . "
" Where else do you have a thousand - dollar item sitting on a table in a coffee shop ? "
So far , San Francisco appears to the only major Bay Area city to be hit by the problem .
San Jose has been hit by laptop thefts , but it has yet to experience many of the robberies .
" We have n't seen it yet , " said Sgt. Nick Muyo of the San Jose police .
Palo
Alto has n't had any , and Berkeley , another hot area for Internet cafes , had only one such crime about a year ago , investigators said .
Oakland police investigators had not heard of any such crimes , either .
San Francisco's Western Addition area has been hard hit this year , with 11 robberies so far .
Park Station Capt .
John Ehrlich , who oversees the area , said he has met with the community , giving the message that people need to fasten down their computers and back up their data .
The victim in San Francisco 's Mission Creek Cafe stabbing , who requested that his name not be used , said since he was attacked , his friends from New York have urged him to go back there .
It 's safer , they say .
" I was lucky .
It was the only place he could have stabbed me where it did n't hit a heart or other organ , " he said .
Still , he said , his chest cavity filled with blood .
As for the information on his laptop , he wisely had backed it up on a disk after he heard a friend had lost data .
Lynch said a videotape at the cafe was not much use in the investigation , and police have little to go on .
" One ( suspect ) was roughly 15 , one was roughly 20 , that was it -- it 's really frustrating , " Lynch said .
Lynch said stolen computers are sold on the street and even over the Internet .
" They go to U.N. Plaza , where it 's like a stolen - goods bazaar .
All you have to do is drive by , you see them out there . "
Lynch said people working on the high - priced computers are easy targets .
" You walk by any Starbucks and you see people with a laptop , it 's so tempting for the crooks .
They walk in , right on top of the person , and the person has all their attention on the laptop .
They snatch it right out from underneath their fingertips .
" The word is out with crooks in general , " Lynch said .
Some cafes have taken precautions , installing security leashes for laptops and even posting employees to act as observers at doors .
Lynch said a leash would prevent some thefts .
But posting someone at the door could be risky .
Lynch said that in Europe , video monitors are posted and signs warn patrons that they are being watched .
Lynch said resisting can be risky .
" It 's a tough call -- I would fight to maintain my laptop , but you run the risk of ending up like this guy , getting stabbed . "
" We do n't need to scare people , " Loftus emphasized .
" People just need to be careful with their laptops . "
Police are considering using police decoys in hard - hit areas .
" It 's hard to do a stakeout , " Capt .
Ehrlich said , " because it 's not happening with any regularity in time or place . "
Besides , such operations are costly in resources , he said .
" It 's a lot of lattes . "

In a statement , spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said , " The Lays have a very large family with whom they need to communicate , and out of respect for the family we will release further details at a later time . "
" Apparently , his heart simply gave out , " said Lay 's pastor , Dr. Steve Wende of Houston 's First United Methodist Church .
An autopsy indicated Lay died of coronary artery disease , Mesa County , Colorado coroner Robert Kurtzman said .
There was " no evidence of foul play , " he added .
Toxicology reports are still pending and wo n't be completed for two to three weeks , Kurtzman told reporters late on Wednesday .
A spokeswoman for Aspen Valley Hospital confirmed that Lay arrived at the hospital at 1:41 a.m. MT and was pronounced dead at 3:11 a.m. MT .
( Watch what penalties Lay would have faced -- 1:54 )
On May 25 , Lay was found guilty of 10 counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of Enron , the energy company he founded that eventually grew into the nation 's seventh largest company before it imploded after an accounting scandal .
It was an astounding fall from grace for the Houston businessman who was affectionately called " Kenny Boy " by President Bush .
Lay had raised funds for Bush earlier in his political career .
In the Enron trial , Lay was accused of lying to investors and Wall Street about the health of Enron in late 2001 even as he enriched himself by selling millions of dollars in stock .
But Lay maintained his innocence to the end .
In a May 25 interview , Lay 's lead attorney , Michael Ramsey , who was forced to take a backseat midway through the trial after he underwent vascular surgery , said that " Enron was his creation , he nursed it like a child , and the death of Enron was like the death of a child to him . "
" He lost a fortune , his family lost a fortune , he can certainly feel the pain of the people that lost money in it , he will feel that till the day he dies , " Ramsey said .
Lay was scheduled for sentencing on Oct. 23 along with Enron 's former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling , who was found guilty of 19 counts of conspiracy , fraud , making false statements and insider trading .
Both men faced 25 to 40 years behind bars , legal experts said .
Presiding Judge Sim Lake originally scheduled sentencing for Sept. 11 .
While it 's still unclear whether Lay 's sudden death will have any impact on Skilling 's sentencing , legal experts said it was unlikely that Judge Lake would grant another postponement .
But Lay 's family may still face the music when it comes to the barrage of civil lawsuits filed against him .
Jacob Zamansky , principal at Zamansky & Associates , a law firm that represents shareholders , said Lay 's estate is still liable for damages .
" Lay 's passing is n't going to have any material effect on the civil suits , " Zamansky said .
" His testimony is still out there . "
Legal observers were surprised at Lay 's demeanor during his testimony as the former executive known for his congenial persona , appeared brash , abrasive and unwilling to accept any responsibility for Enron 's demise .
After the guilty verdict was issued , jurors said his performance on the stand worked against him .
Having taken the stand in his own defense - a decision that many legal experts questioned - Lay 's words could still work against his estate in civil litigation .
Still , how much of the pot will be available to claimants is uncertain .
Lay testified that he had lost millions after Enron 's collapse and most of his estate was depleted in order to pay legal costs and living expenses .
And Joel Androphy , partner at Houston - based law firm Berg & Androphy , said that if a defendant is deceased , civil claimants can't seek punitive damages .
Any civil lawsuits would have to be limited to compensatory damages , or those losses that were actually incurred by an individual , he said .
It 's also unclear whether Lay 's estate will be responsible for any forfeiture of assets mandated by the court .
The government filed a motion on June 30 , asking the court to order both Lay and Skilling to hand over almost $ 183 million as a result of their conviction .
According to court papers , that hefty figure includes bonuses received by both Skilling and Lay during their involvement in the conspiracy , proceeds from Enron stock sales and the use of Lay 's Enron line of credit , which Lay used to pay off more than $ 100 million in personal debt .
Of that amount , the government seeks to retrieve $ 43 million from Lay .
Also at risk for seizure is Lay 's posh Houston condominium and $ 6.3 million he had in an an account at Goldman Sachs .
Department of Justice spokesman Brian Sierra said " out of respect for the family , " the government would n't issue any statement on whether it will continue to seek forfeiture of those assets from Lay 's estate .
But the Securities and Exchange Commission , which sought $ 90 million in damages , said that in pursuing civil trials against the deceased , anything considered to be " ill gotten gains , " will still be pursued on behalf of investors .
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after investigators found it had used partnerships to conceal more than $ 1 billion in debt and inflate profits .
Enron 's downfall cost 4,000 employees their jobs and many of them their life savings , and led to billions of dollars of losses for investors .
The collapse was the first of the high - profile corporate scandals that later rocked WorldCom , Global Crossing , Adelphia and Tyco .
The wave of fraud led to the passage of the Sarbanes - Oxley legislation meant to tighten oversight of how American companies were audited .
Lay , the son of a Baptist preacher in Missouri , worked his way up to become a corporate titan .
He earned his Bachelor 's and Master 's degrees at the University of Missouri and went on to earn a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Houston .
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1968 to 1971 , during which he received the Navy Commendation Medal and National Defense Service Medal .
He is survived by his wife Linda Phillips Lay , five children and twelve grandchildren .

In contemporary lore , the good people of the red states walk in Jesus 's sandals while the rest of us are following Satan into the licking flames .
Twenty - plus years of conservative propaganda have convinced millions of Republicans and their pet Beltway pundits that they inherited the legacy of frontier values and dwell in baptismal light , unlike modern Democrats , who crawled out from under rocks and prefer the ambiguous dark , where there 's no right or wrong , only " personal choices . " [ #image : / photos/54cbfbd8932c5f781b3952c4 ]
Newt
Gingrich once spouted that Susan Smith 's murder of her two children in 1994 was a sign of the evil that liberal Democrats had wrought : " I think that the mother killing the two children in South Carolina vividly reminds every American how sick the society is getting and how much we need to change things ....
The only way you get change is to vote Republican . "
According to the gospel of Saint Newt , William J. Bennett , Rush Limbaugh , Ann Coulter , Michael Savage , and similar blowholes , the dying raptures of Sodom and Gomorrah can be found in the cultural duchies of the blue states .
Here sin and moral sloth have set up shop , and venereal outbreaks of trendy ideas go unchecked .
Conservative pundits and politicians regularly jeer that these Jurassic Parks of geriatric do - gooders and brainwashed college students do n't represent the " real " America — the God-fearing , flag - waving , decent - living , high - octane , steeped - in - common - sense , everyday - low - prices heartland .
Yet even as blue states hug the coasts and red states spread like a bloodstain across America 's outstretched body , the influence of these elitist enclaves remains pervasive , corrosive , rotting away the pillars of moral order and foisting abortion , divorce , pornography , gay marriage , snail - darter environmentalism , secular humanism , dovish appeasement , moral relativism , and Rosie O'Donnell 's TV comeback upon a once virile nation .
The very names of the enclaves breeding such bacteria make the nostril hairs quiver .
Hollywood .
Berkeley .
San Francisco .
Madison , Wisconsin .
Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Martha's Vineyard .
Georgetown .
And , worst of all , New York City , especially Manhattan , most especially its Upper West Side , disparaged by its critics as the outpatient clinic for last - gasp liberalism .
It 's so unjust .
As a resident of the Upper West Side and a regular bus rider , I must protest that the truth has been perverted and inverted .
Yes , the Upper West Side is liberal , socially conscious , multi-culti , gay - friendly ( Rosie 's brother Daniel — also gay — is our state assemblyman ) , and occasionally itchy with political correctness .
And , yes , it 's true that we care , perhaps care too much , rattling our Zabar 's bags as we nag the nation 's conscience to no avail .
Really , though , such little harm we do , what unracy lives we lead .
It 's like Jewish - Hispanic - Amish country up here !
The broad sidewalks present a wholesome cavalcade of baby strollers , Columbia University students , diabetics on canes , and tourists posing in front of Tom 's Restaurant , the diner made famous on Seinfeld .
It is n't the cultural bastions of the blue states such as the Upper West Side that are greasing America 's slide into the disco inferno .
It 's the Republican red states that are lowering the country 's moral standards and dragging us through muck and malaise , the red states that are pustulating with horny hypocrites , rampant crime , polygamy , crystal - meth labs , federal handouts ( The Economist recently christened Alaska " America 's welfare state " ) , illegitimate births , blimping waistlines , and future generations of dumb bunnies .
JonBenet Ramsey , dolled up and immortalized in her beauty - pageant footage , is the pre-pubescent red - hot - mama mascot of red-state Babylon .
" Red States cling to double standards like a drunk holds on to the last beer he can afford , " writes Justin Cord Hayes in the semi-humorous survival guide Blue State / Red State .
Hypocrisy is the hallmark of the red - state bull - roarer .
Gingrich , who makes Hayes 's dishonor roll of " conservative scalawags , " has been married three times and has been known to have problems keeping it zipped .
Limbaugh has three marriages in the loss column .
He is also a prancing Tartuffe on the drug issue , condemning addicts and users on his radio show for their weak wills and moral failings ( and wanting to chuck them behind bars ) , only to be revealed as a painkiller anteater himself .
Bennett expended volumes of wind preaching virtue and decrying seamy decadence , only to be exposed as a high - stakes slot - machine love monkey .
But these are minor - league hypocrisies , as much a by - product of male prerogative as of Republican humbug .
It is at the extremes that the red - state double standards are most sharply defined .
For the purposes of lurid illustration , no one is a better , more bitter distillation of red-state double standards than Dennis Rader , the monster who achieved lethal renown in Wichita , Kansas , and across the nation as the " BTK " killer ( BTK : Bind , Torture , Kill ) .
Convicted and sentenced to 10 consecutive life terms after a reign of terror that lasted decades , Rader was a methodical sadist , murdering his victims as if staging his own theater of cruelty , a Black Mass of the sacred and profane .
The Los Angeles Times reported , " After killing neighbor Marine Hedge in 1985 , Rader took her body to his church and photographed it on the altar .
Then he hid her body , changed into his Scouting uniform and went off to chaperon a camping trip . " [ #image : / photos/54cbfbd83c894ccb27c7ee88 ]
It was the Scout - leader uniform and the other trappings of patriarchal authority that enabled him to blend into the community , elude suspicion .
He played the role of respectability to the hilt .
Rader was not only a Scout leader but also an officer at Wichita 's Christ Lutheran Church and a registered Republican — a psychopathic parody of the Upstanding Citizen .
Because he fit so well the stereotype of how a pillar of the community should conduct himself in daylight , his church congregation did n't have a collective clue .
( " Nobody , nobody saw this coming , " said the Reverend Michael G. Clark , the church 's pastor , regarding Rader 's arrest . )
On the outside he could n't have been more conformist ; inside , he was an icebox of finely chiseled rage .
Rader is the nightmare embodiment of the red - state personality at its most self - conflicted : piously Christian ( he quoted the Bible at his sentencing hearing ) , yet torturously punitive ; arrogantly proud , yet sloppily maudlin ( " I 've humbled myself , " he blubbed at the same hearing ) ; dotingly paternal ( Time : " Rader was known as an attentive father who used to take his kids camping and fishing " ) , and a petty despot ( as a compliance officer in his Wichita suburb , Rader was known to measure grass with a ruler and give citations for unkempt lawns ) .

Islamic Law Primary in Iraqi Constitution
Thousands demonstrate against Federalism
Kurdish Masses demand right to Secede
Guerrillas ambushed a group of special police in Baghdad on Saturday , killing two of them .
There was also a bombing of police in Fallujah .
Altogether , al - Sharq al - Awsat says , some 11 Iraqi police and civilians were killed by guerrilla action on Saturday , and four guerrillas were killed by US and Iraqi troops south of the capital .
On Saturday a US soldier was killed by an improvised explosive device .
In Ramadi , 5,000 Sunni Arab demonstrators came out to protest the designation of Iraq as a federal state in the new constitution .
[ Al - Sharq al - Awsat / AFP :]
There was a similar demonstration in Kirkuk by Arabs and Turkmen against federalism .
( A federal Iraq will probably cede Kirkuk to Kurdistan , which will have vast local powers of governance , and the Turkmen and Arabs resident in the city ( probably over half the population if taken together ) oppose this development . )
Many of the demonstrators were Shiite followers of Muqtada al - Sadr .
They denounced federalism as likely to lead to the partition and weakening of Iraq , and thus as an imperialist and Zionist plot .
Al - Jazeera is reporting that the Kurds staged big demonstrations on Sunday morning in Irbil , Sulaymaniyah and other cities demanding that their right to “ determine their fate ” ( i.e. secede ) be enshrined in the constitution .
A Shiite parliamentarian on the drafting committee told al - Hayat that this demand is “ a major obstacle ” to finalizing the constitution .
Al - Sharq al - Awsat suggests that high Kurdish politicians involved in the negotiations on the constitution are signalling that they are willing to give up on this demand .
Sunni Arab delegates on the constitution - writing committee declined to meet with the others on Saturday , leaving the Shiites and the Kurds to negotiate with one another .
Sunni Arab opposition to a federated state as opposed to a central government that rules directly appears to be an insuperable obstacle to agreement .
Borzou Daragahi of the LA Times reports that the Sunni Arab delegates believe Iran is behind the recent calls by Shiites for a confederation of 9 southern Shiite provinces , a plan they vehemently reject .
Al - Hayat :
In one of the major disputes outstanding between the Kurds and the Shiites , on whether Islamic law will be the fundamental source or only one of the sources of Iraqi law , the Shiite religious parties appear to have won out .
AFP reports that the reason for this is that the United States has swung around and begun to support the primacy of Islamic canon law .
Al - Hayat writes , “ Also , an agreement was reached that Islam is the religion of state , and that no law shall be enacted that contradicts the agreed - upon essential verities of Islam .
Likewise , the inviolability of the highest [ Shiite ] religious authorities in the land is safeguarded , without any allusion to a detailed description .
The paragraph governing these matters will specify that Islam is ‘ the fundamental basis ’ for legislation , though there will be an allusion to the protection of democratic values , human rights , and social and national values .
A Higher Council will be formed to review new legislation to ensure it does not contravene the essential verities of the Islamic religion . ”
Personal status law , concerning marriage , divorce , alimony , inheritance , and so forth , will be adjudicated by religious courts in accordance with the religion or sect to which the individual belongs .
Similar law is present in the constitution of the US - installed “ Islamic Republic of Afghanistan “ .
In fact , the text of the Afghanistan constitution is instructive :
In the name of God , the Merciful , the Compassionate Preamble
We the people of Afghanistan :
1 . With firm faith in God Almighty and relying on His lawful mercy , and Believing in the Sacred religion of Islam . . .
3 . While acknowledging the sacrifices and the historic struggles , rightful Jehad and just resistance of all people of Afghanistan , and respecting the high position of the martyrs for the freedom of Afghanistan . . .
Chapter I The State Article 1 [ Islamic Republic ]
Afghanistan is an Islamic Republic , independent , unitary and indivisible state .
Article 2 [ Religions ]
(1) The religion of the state of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is the sacred religion of Islam
(2) Followers of other religions are free to exercise their faith and perform their religious rites within the limits of the provisions of law .
Article 3 [ Law and Religion ]
In Afghanistan , no law can be contrary to the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of Islam . . .
Article 131 [ Shia Law for Shia Followers ]
(1) Courts shall apply Shia school of law in cases dealing with personal matters involving the followers of Shia Sect in accordance with the provisions of law .
(2) In other cases if no clarification by this constitution and other laws exist and both sides of the case are followers of the Shia Sect , courts will resolve the matter according to laws of this Sect . ‘
[ I take it that article 131 implies that ordinarily personal status law is Sunni , but Shiites will be ruled by Shiite law . ]
This Afghan constitution was also enacted with the help of Zalmay Khalilzad , then US ambassador in Afghanistan and now US envoy in Iraq .
I ’m not suggesting that Dr. Khalilzad has a soft spot for Islamic canon law .
More probably he is just a pragmatist who recognizes that these provisions reflect the current mood and convictions of the majority in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Al - Hayat :
One of the outstanding issues in the drafting of the permanent constitution is how the provinces or regions will share petroleum revenue with the center .
Under the old regime , the oil profits from the Kirkuk ( north ) and Rumaila ( south ) fields went straight to the central government , and , indeed , into the coffers of the Baath Party .
The Kurds have been insisting that some proportion of the revenues generated by the Kirkuk fields stay in Kurdistan .
Various percentages have been floated – 24 % , 17 % , 10 % , etc .
The original plan was to specify the percentage in the constitution .
But now it has been decided that the issue will be handled by a subsequent law to be passed by the national assembly , and that the constitution will only say that the sharing of petroleum revenue between province and center will be carried out in accordance with this statute , yet to be enacted .
Al - Hayat : Six armed guerrilla organizations called for greater speed in the registration of voters for the October 15 referendum on the constitution .
They appear to be taking advantage of the provision that any three provinces can reject the constitution by a 2/3s vote in each , and planning for three Sunni- majority provinces to cast “ no ” votes .
They said the voter registration is in order “ to defeat the American plan . ”
These six groups differ in their strategy from other guerrilla organizations , which oppose the voter registration process and Sunni Arab participation in the referendum at all , and which have been killing Sunni Arabs who urge or help with voter registration .
Ed Wong of the NYT does a groundbreaking and very important article on the attacks on Iraqi Sufi orders by Salafi Sunni fundamentalists .
Sunni Islam in Iraq , both Kurdish and Arab , is closely tied to the mystical Sufi heritage .
In this it resembles Sunnism in Turkey , Pakistan and Senegal much more than it does most Arab countries .
Wong helps complicate the story familiar to Western readers , of Shiites , Sunni Arabs , and Kurds , by focusing on the next level down , of actual religious organizations , and so illumines a significant part of Iraqi society for us .
Although Western readers often associate the guerrilla movements with the Sunni Arab areas , in fact guerrillas operate everywhere in Iraq .
It is just that some favor the new status quo and wish to burrow into it , while others reject it .
Anthony Shadid and Steven Fainaru report on the way in which militias and militia - infiltrated police forces have established hegemony in cities such as Basra and Mosul .
The existence of party - based paramilitaries alongside the police , described here , is similar to the situation in Iran after the Khomeini revolution .
Revolutionary Guards and basij volunteers operated parallel to formal government bodies such as the police and army .
The Kurdish and Shiite militias have such power because of a vacuum .
There are only a few hundred US troops in the Kurdish north , apparently .
And only 8,500 British troops are responsible for much of the Shiite south .
Xbox Laptop 360 - " In the Beginning ... "
A friend of mine asked back in May " Can you build an Xbox 360 laptop ? "
And I responded " Sure , can you pay for it ? "
He agreed , and thus I set forth on what was surely to be my most complex and insanely ridiculous videogame project yet .
( I say videogame project as I highly doubt I 'll ever manage anything as complex as Port Washington again , though at times this project sucked my will to live about as much )
With my first batch of " venture capital " in hand I ran off to the nearby store to get myself an Xbox 360 Super Package , or whatever the $ 400 version is called .
While I wo n't mention the game store I stopped at by name , I will recreate the amazing conversation I had with one of their employees ...
Sadly , only my side of this conversation is exaggerated .
Several years passed by , but I finally had the Xbox 360 free and clear .
I hightailed it out of there , vowing never to return .
Now I could get to work !
( I hope the CHIP SMASHERS do n't get me )
Please note , this story was assembled as I worked on the device ( as opposed to afterwards like I usually do ) so sometimes it will branch off in different directions and have the topic shift rapidly .
However , this accurately represents the workflow , more so than other articles I 've written .
Dateline : First Week of June '06 After FINALLY snagging the 360 I brought it home and immediately tore it apart .
I did n't even test it out - I mean why bother ?
I 've played quite a bit of 360 already , I was more interested in the guts of the thing .
( I can always eat rat meat later )
The stock Xbox 360 motherboard .
Using a handy " how - to " on the Internet I had the thing taken apart in under 10 minutes .
Half the time was looking for my lost Torx bits , until I realized there were some in my precious ratcheting screwdriver .
Anyway , I looked over the motherboard to see what could be " flattened " to make the thing thinner ( Heat sinks did n't count as I was planning to replace them with water - cooling )
The obvious choice were the numerous large electrolytic caps .
( black cylinders in above photo )
As with many systems I 've worked on , I de-soldered them all and reattached them laying flat .
In most cases I had to extend their leads to make this work .
Oh well .
Flatten capacitors .
Above you can see the board with the flattened caps .
( That 's the cool , hip , geek slang term for capacitor you know )
There are also several wound torrid coils on the board ( yellowish things to the lower right of the tall heat sink ) that would be a real pain to move so I left those standing as " the highest things on the motherboard " Still it 's not too bad , with the exception of the power port on the back nothing is more than 1/2 " above the motherboard now .
You might also noticed I 've also removed the front USB and memory card slots at this point .
The front side USB connections will go to the keyboard / extra USB ports while the rear port will be used with the Wi-Fi module .
Extended hard drive SATA and power connector .
In my tentative system layout the hard drive is moved a good ways from the original connector .
Since the stubby cord inside the Hard Drive Enclosure is , well , stubby , I had to see if extending the SATA cable was possible .
The least destructive way of doing this was to de-solder the connector from the motherboard and extended between them , as seen above .
The idea of extending the SATA cable with old parallel IDE cable was a bit humorous , to me at least .
Naturally I did n't copy every connection , since +5 and Ground are on there 3 times each .
Why have excessive cabling ?
I did a test boot and watched one of the videos off the drive ( you know a system is quality when it comes pre-loaded with James Cameron ) I then played games for about an hour .
Nothing exploded or melted a hole through my floor so I think we 're good .
I now feel OK to extend the DVD drive 's SATA if required - the existing cable is about 3 " long , but most replacement cables are 2 ' minimum .
I was worried when I read SATA does n't use TTL , but apparently it does n't exactly use magic either , so it 's still hackable .
In the final version I 'll attach the gray ribbon cables directly to the colored wires coming off the hard drive 's connector , skipping the Microsoft plugs altogether .
This ends Phase 1 of the project .
Next step - water cooling !
The parts are on the way , I 'm a bit worried about the pump though .
It 's the smallest we could find , but it 's still big ( for a project like this )
Depending on its size I might have to build a new DVD drive loading system , just to make everything fit .
Also in the experimental realm is the custom radiator I plan to build .
The plan is it 'll fit in the space at the rear of the motherboard where the fans were , then external fans pull air through it .
The idea is to put tubing in all available empty space to increase the volume .
Some of the tubing might even be exposed around the case for decoration and cool backlighting .
But will it run cold ( I mean NOT HOT ) enough ?
One consolation I have for this step is the massive heat given off by the ' sinks in the standard configuration .
Sure they 've got that fan that sort of pulls air past them , but still the GPU especially gets REALLY hot .
Lacking an infrared thermometer I can only compare it to things .
Hm ...
How about when you microwave a bowl of something and the bowl 's so hot you can only carry it for about 1 second before setting it down ?
Yeah , that 's about right .
( Do n't ask me what that is in Celsius )
The worst thing is that 's what it 's like running open air as shown above , I can only imagine how hot it gets in that case .
Maybe Microsoft could sell a coffee warmer attachment or something ...
The next thrilling section continues !
This story is boring !
Take me back to the homepage .
Or at least just skip me ahead to the finished photos !

Updated April 11 2009 to correct issues with DOMgetHTML .
Now there is both a DOMgetTEXT and a DOMgetHTML function .
I know , innerHTML came out first , it �s so easy to use .
Browsers that use it render it faster than the pure DOM method .
There are many reasons to use innerHTML , but one major reason not to :
It �s counter standard .
The DOM standard does not include innerHTML and it probably never will .
Viewing DOM elements as a text string is like viewing DNA as morse code .
If we could all get behind the standards and use them it could force the software engineers ( pronounced � Microsoft� ) to actually care about the standards .
Of course it is not fair to tell you to stop using innerHTML without giving you a replacement .
There is in fact a method for using DOM to accomplish everything that you have been using innerHTML to do .
Using DOM methods will benefit you in the long run as one day innerHTML will be on the dreaded " DEPRECATED " list ( I called this back in 2006 , and it now seems to be a reality ) .
If you were the coding God you think you are , your code would still be current .
So enough ego manipulation .
Lets see how to replace the innerHtml call with pure DOM calls .
There are basically 4 things that we use innerHTML for :
1 � Adding HTML , or Creating Elements .
2 � Getting the text within an Element
3 � Removing content from an Element
4 � Copying Content from one Element to another
So lets look at DOM methods for accomplishing these 4 points and see how to do them with clean pure DOM methods .
Many of these methods you will have used before for other purposes but seeing how to use them to replace innerHTML functions will prove beneficial .
First then we will talk about adding HTML into your document .
This can be used in AJAX and other Web2.0 settings to add content onto existing content .
Here is how it can be done with purely DOM methods .
This is a little more complicated than with innerHTML .
We have to use a little different code for adding text only as opposed to adding HTML .
But then the DOM is an object not a string , so lets deal with it as such .
First then lets add text :
Code : function addText ( el , strText , newID ) {
// create a DIV , called eDiv as Element Div
eDIV = document.createElement (" div " ) ;
//assign an ID to the element because you may need to access it again
eDIV.setAttribute ( " id " , newID ) ;
// add a text node to the element .
eDIV.appendChild(document.createTextNode(strText ) ) ;
// Now that we have created everything let�s add it to our DOM
document.getElementById(el).appendChild( eDIV ) ;
}
In this function el is a string carrying the ID of the element you want to add text to the end of .
strText is the text node you want to add and newID is the ID of the newly added text , which will be placed inside a DIV element with the given ID .
This can be used for any kind of progressive loading of data where we continue to add new data onto the existing data .
You can also use the existing code to figure out how to add other Elements to your DOM .
Now let �s move onto our second purpose .
Getting the text within an element .
We use this many times when using content in one element to create or determine content for another element .
The first step is always going to be to get the content from the first element .
The following is a recursive function that will gather all nodes in a given element
Code : function DOMgetTEXT( el ) {
//
No problem if it�s a text node
if ( el.nodeType == 3 ) return el.nodeValue ;
var txt = new Array ( ) , i=0 ;
//
If there is more to it , then let�s gather it all .
while(el.childNodes[i ] ) {
txt[txt.length ] = DOMgetHTML(el.childNodes [i ] ) ;
i ++;
}
// return the array as a string
return txt.join ( " " ) ;
}
// gather all the content of an Element as a string .
m Text = DOMgetHTML(document.getElementById(" myDIV " ) ) ;
The above function will gather all the text nodes from a section of the DOM .
Page getting too long , the rest of the functions are on the next page ...

Hey , why not just use innerHTML zzzeek 2006 - 09 - 06 # 48 if innerHTML were ever removed from the API , within 2 hours someone will post an innerHTML library that takes an arbitrary text string , parses it for valid HTML , and applies the resulting elements as new DOM elements to the target node .
thats all innerHTML really does .
so whether or not the " innerHTML " attribute is part of the standard or not , the technique itself is orthogonal to DOM " correctness " , and its a lot less tedious and error - prone than manipulating hundreds of nodes directly .
sammy01 2006-09-08 # 51
Well , to answer the first poster , innerHTML adds terrible markup to xml / other code that is found in a div ( for example ) , and renders it a useless function for when you 're trying to do this .
Not only that , but it behaves differently in IE than Firefox .
In most apps , this is n't a problem , but as I found out today after over a year of successful innerHTML usage , it can cause some terrible problems .
DOMgetHTML does n't do the job either , and it's name is a bad misnomer !
innerHTML at least reads HTML , while DOMgetHTML actually just reads the text within tags .
It should be renamed DOMgetText , really !
An example of what neither innerHTML , nor DOMgetHTML can do , and which I would love to know a DOM - based solution that can do it :
< div id =" text " >< value part= " test " ><!
[ CDATA [ < test text ] ] > test text2</value></div>
alert( document.getElementById(' text ' .innerHTML ) ;
--> gives in IE : < value part= " test " > test text2</ value >
--> gives in Firefox : < value part= " test " ><!--[ CDATA [ < test text ] ]--> test text2</value
( note the nasty markup , adding a " - - " just before the CDATA , plus the difference between major browsers )
alert ( DOMgetHTML(document.getElementById(' text ' ) )
--> gives test text2
No HTML at all !!
Does anyone have a REAL DOMgetHTML function lying around ??
P.S the DOMgetHTML function has a bug in it .
line 3 :if ( el.nodeType == 3 ) return obj.nodeValue ;
should be : if ( el.nodeType == 3 ) return el.nodeValue ; sammy01 2006-09-08 # 52
Sorry , here 's the code again without the happy faces :
Code : < div id =" text " >< value part= " test " ><!
[ CDATA [ test text ] ] > test text2</value></div>
alert(document.getElementById('text'.innerHTML ) ;
--> gives in IE : < value part= " test " > test text2</ value >
--> gives in Firefox : < value part= " test " ><!--[ CDATA [ test text ] ]--> test text2</value
( note the nasty markup , adding a " - - " just before the CDATA , plus the difference between major browsers )
alert ( DOMgetHTML(document.getElementById(' text ' ) )
--> gives test text2 BeachBum 2006-09 -08 # 53
Thanks for the Bug Fix Sammy , I Edited the function so it 's correct now .
I see what you mean about the DOMgetHTML function ... it should really be called DOMgetTXT ... it does n't show the HTML tags .
Let me see what I can come up with .
BeachBum 2009 - 04 - 12 # 413
Hey , I finally got the real DOMgetHTML function up .
I know I promised that a long time ago but you know how it is .

The former US secretary of state Colin Powell has accused the White House of pursuing policies in the " war on terror " that have put America out of step with the rest of the world .
In a rare public breach with the administration , Mr Powell told an audience in Norfolk , Virginia , on Tuesday that he opposed White House plans to redefine America 's commitment to sections of the Geneva convention protecting detainees from torture and degrading treatment .
" We know what the president needs , " Mr Powell said .
" We do n't want to dispute the president .
But we are having trouble with the rest of the world . "
He added that the world looked on the US as a law - abiding society - although that had been shaken by events at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay .
Although Mr Powell is known to have had many clashes in private with the vice - president , Dick Cheney , and the defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , he has offered only rare public criticism since he left the administration in January 2005 .
Earlier , Mr Powell used an aide to express his opposition to the choice of UN ambassador , John Bolton , and to admit regret over the use of false intelligence in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
In a letter released last week , he joined Senator John McCain and other prominent Republicans in opposing the White House demand that Congress redefine the convention .
" The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism , " he said .
In response , Mr Bush accused his former secretary of state of " flawed logic " , while the White House press secretary , Tony Snow , said Mr Powell was " confused " .
Playing computer games can be good for your health , according to a British boffin .
Mark Griffiths , professor of gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University , reckons that research into the effects of playing computer games " is often trivialised " .
Yet , he believes it should be taken more seriously especially since it can help aid the recovery of people who are ill .
His article in the British Medical journal ( BMJ ) found that playing games " can distract the player from the sensation of pain , a strategy that has been reported and evaluated among paediatric patients " .
Video games can also be used to supplement physiotherapy or occupational therapy helping increase the strength in players ' hands , for example .
" Such games focus attention away from potential discomfort and , unlike more traditional therapeutic activities , they do not rely on passive movements and sometimes painful manipulation of the limbs , " he wrote .
But he also acknowledged that there is a downside to playing computer games including " auditory hallucinations " wrist pain and repetitive strain injuries , although many of these symptoms disappear once people stop playing games .
But he concludes : " On balance , given that video game playing is highly prevalent among children and adolescents in industrialised countries , there is little evidence that moderate frequency of play has serious acute adverse effects from moderate play . " ®

Are there 10 that are probably worse than these ?
Sure .
( In fact , you could probably find 10 things at The Cheesecake Factory that are worse than all of these . )
But these are the types of foods — high in some combination of calories , saturated fat , sodium , white flour , and added sugar — that are contributing to America ’s obesity , diabetes , and heart disease problems .
1. Pot Belly Pie
Judging by the label , Stouffer ’s Large Size ( 16 oz . )
White Meat Chicken
Pot Pie has 530 calories , 11 grams of saturated fat , and 770 milligrams of sodium .
But those numbers are for only half a pie .
Eat the entire thing , as many people do , and you ’re talking 1,020 calories , 21 grams of sat fat ( a day ’s supply ) , and 1,480 mg of sodium ( two - thirds of a day ’s worth ) .
2. Five Fleshy Guys
Think Five Guys is better than fast food burger joints ?
The Hamburger ( with no toppings ) has 840 calories and a day ’s worth of saturated fat ( 20 grams ) .
It makes a McDonald ’s Big Mac ( 540 calories ) look wimpy .
The Bacon Cheeseburger ( with no extra toppings ) hits 1,060 calories and 30 grams of sat fat .
Add 950 calories for the regular fries .
A large McDonald ’s Fries has “ only ” 510 calories .
3. Liquid Salt
A typical cup of Campbell ’s regular Condensed Soup has 800 milligrams of sodium .
But many people eat the whole can , which contains around 2,000 mg of sodium — nearly an entire day ’s worth !
Look for Campbell ’s Healthy Request soups , with 410 mg of sodium per cup ( still high if you eat the whole can ) .
Better yet , try lower - sodium soups , like " Light in Sodium " soups by Amy ’s , Imagine , and Pacific , and " Lower Sodium " soups from Dr. McDougall’s .
4. Tortilla Terror
Interested in a Chipotle Chicken Burrito ( tortilla , rice , pinto beans , cheese , chicken , sour cream , and salsa ) ?
Think of its 1,090 calories , 16 grams of saturated fat , and 2,240 milligrams of sodium as six Taco Bell Chicken Soft Tacos !
You can slash the calories in half by ditching the tortilla , rice , and sour cream , and getting the chicken , beans , cheese , and salsa as the toppings for a salad .
5. Tower Trouble Cake
No one expects light desserts at The Cheesecake Factory .
But the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake kicks things up a notch .
With its “ layers and layers of fudge cake with chocolate truffle cream and chocolate mousse , ” you ’re staring at 1,770 calories — more than any cheesecake on the menu .
And do n’t forget the bonus 60 grams ( three days ’ worth ) of saturated fat and 34 teaspoons of ( mostly added ) sugar .
6. Pizza Padding
At Uno Pizzeria & Grill , the Chicago Classic Deep Dish Pizza piles crumbled sausage and cheese on a thick white - flour crust .
The “ individual ” size packs 2,240 calories ( enough for the whole day ) , plus 48 grams of saturated fat ( a 2 ½ - day supply ) and 4,400 milligrams of sodium ( nearly two days ’ worth ) .
You might as well eat three Pizza Hut Pepperoni Lover ’s Personal Pan Pizzas .
Urp !
7. Triple Bypass
Ca n’t decide what to pick from a restaurant menu ?
No worries .
You can order not just one entrée , but two…or three …all at once .
Olive Garden ’s Tour of Italy — lasagna , chicken parmigiana , and fettuccine alfredo — comes with 1,520 calories , 48 grams of saturated fat , and 3,250 milligrams of sodium .
Add a breadstick ( 140 calories and 460 mg of sodium ) and a serving of house salad with dressing ( 150 calories and 770 mg of sodium ) , and you ’ll swallow 1,810 calories and 4,480 mg of sodium ( enough for today and tomorrow ) in a single meal !
8. Starbucks on Steroids
A Starbucks venti ( 20 oz . )
White Chocolate Mocha with 2 % milk and whipped cream is more than a mere cup of coffee .
It has as many calories as a McDonald ’s Quarter Pounder with Cheese .
Few people have room in their diets for the 530 calories , 14 grams of saturated fat , and estimated 9 teaspoons of added sugar that this hefty beverage supplies .
Ca n’t say no ?
Drop the calories to 240 and the sat fat to three grams by ordering a tall ( 12 oz . ) made with nonfat milk and no whipped cream .
9. Extreme Ice Cream
A half - cup serving of Ben & Jerry ’s ice cream squeezes roughly 300 calories and an estimated 4 ½ teaspoons of added sugar into your fat cells , and half a day ’s saturated fat into your artery walls .
That ’s if you can stop at a petite half cup !
Häagen - Dazs ice cream is no better .
10 . Shakedown
McDonald ’s Chocolate Shake ( soft serve ice cream , chocolate syrup , and whipped cream ) starts at 530 calories for a small ( 12 oz . ) .
Few people buy an ice cream shake expecting it to shrink their waist , but who would think that a “ small ” delivers the calories of a Big Mac ?
A large reaches 840 calories , 14 grams of saturated fat ( ¾ of a day ’s worth ) , and an estimated 22 teaspoons of added sugar , all blended into a handy 22 oz .
cup .
Claim : Petition addresses environmental issues associated with the Pascua - Lama mining operation in Chile .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 2006 ]
Dear friends who care about our earth , Dear friends who care about our earth , Judge for yourself if you want to take action .
In the Valle de San Felix , the purest water in Chile runs
from 2 rivers , fed by 2 glaciers .
Water is a most precious resource , and wars will be fought for it .
Indigenous farmers use the water , there is no unemployment , and they provide the second largest source of income for the area .
Under the glaciers has been found a huge deposit of gold , silver and other minerals .
To get at these , it would be necessary to break , to destroy the glaciers – something never conceived of in the history of the world – and to make 2 huge holes , each as big as a whole mountain , one for extraction and one for the mine ’s rubbish tip .
The project is called PASCUA LAMA .
The company is called Barrick Gold .
The operation is planned by a
multi-national company , one of whose members is George Bush Senior ( what a surprise eh ? ) .
The Chilean
Government has approved the project to start this year , 2006 .
The only reason it has n’t started yet is because the farmers have got a temporary stay of execution .
If they destroy the glaciers , they will not just destroy the source of specially pure water , but they will permanently contaminate the 2 rivers so they will never again be fit for human or animal consumption because of the use of cyanide and sulfuric acid in the extraction process .
Every last gram of gold will go abroad to the multinational company and not one will be left with the people whose land it is .
They will only be left with the poisoned water and the resulting illnesses .
The farmers have been fighting a long time for their land , but have been forbidden to make a TV appeal by a ban from the Ministry of the Interior .
Their only hope now of putting brakes on this project is to get help
from international justice .
The world must know what is happening in Chile .
The only place to start changing the world is from here .
We ask you to circulate this message amongst your friends in the following way .
Please copy this text ,
paste it into a new email adding your signature and send it to everyone in your address book .
Please will
the 100th person to receive and sign the petition send it to noapascualama@yahoo.ca to be forwarded to the Chilean government .
No to Pascua Lama Open - cast mine in the Andean Cordillera on the Chilean - Argentine frontier .
We ask the Chilean Government not to authorize the Pascua Lama project to protect the whole of 3
glaciers , the purity of the water of the San Felix Valley and El Transito , the quality of the
agricultural land of the region of Atacama , the quality of life of the Diaguita people and of the whole population of the region .
Origins : The Pascua - Lama project is an effort being undertaken by the Barrick Gold Corporation to mine rich gold and silver fields in the mountainous region along the border between Chile and Argentina .
Environmental concerns associated with the project , particularly the potential destruction or relocation of glaciers that sit atop a portion of the gold fields , have led to a number of protests and petitions entreating the Chilean government to intervene and stop or modify the Pascua - Lama mining plan .
So , the above - quoted petition is “ True ” in the broad sense that it addresses a real issue , but , not surprisingly , the two sides ( environmentalists and Barrick ) make substantially different claims about what the environmental and social effects of the Pascua - Lama project will be .
The controversial plan was described thusly by The Santiago Times in March 2005 :
Canadian international mining company Barrick Gold has plans to relocate three glaciers in the mountain range between Argentina and Chile to gain access to 17.6 million oz . of rich gold and silver deposits .
Canadian international mining company Barrick Gold has plans to relocate three glaciers in the mountain range between Argentina and Chile to gain access toof rich gold and silver deposits .
Chilean farmers and residents of the surrounding Huasco Valley are strongly opposed to the proposal of transferring the ice masses .
The glaciers ’ tributaries are used for irrigation by the farmers , and their removal would threaten the ecological balance and agricultural production of the fertile river valley .
Barrick hopes to transfer 300,000 cubic meters of ice with a 20 - hectare surface area from the glaciers that surround the deposits .
To mitigate ecological impact and prevent ice from melting , Barrick hopes to transfer the three glaciers , Toro I , Toro II and Esperanza , to an area with similar surface characteristics and elevation by merging the three into a larger glacier , Guanaco , located several kilometers south with a surface area of over 200 hectares .
The proposal is part of the “ Pascua Lama ” mining treaty , signed by Chile and Argentina in August 2004 after four years of discussion .
Citizens of the Huasco Valley and Region III are taking a stand against the multibillion - dollar foreign company .
Last week an environmental group , Valley Defense , organized a demonstration against the project , where close to 200 farmers , community leaders and neighbors marched in protest .
“ We do n’t want to live in an area contaminated by the fault of foreign economic interests , ” they said .
Raúl Montenegro , Argentine biologist and Alternative Nobel Prize ( formally Right Livelihood Award ) winner agrees with the farmers .
“ The issue is serious in that the project would put pressure on two important river basins which serve as the principle water supply for communities within a semi- arid environment , ” Montenegro said .
In a letter earlier this year to President Ricardo Lagos , agricultural and community associations of the Huasco Valley voiced their concerns about the mining initiative , insisting that it threatens the ecosystem , agriculture and water quality of the valley , which not only sacrifices agricultural exports and trade agreements , but human health as well .
“ If almost 24 hectares of glacier have been exploited solely for the project ‘s experiments , imagine how much could be destroyed in the end , ” said Fransisco Bou , leader for the Huasco Valley agriculturists .
Other environmental concerns involve potential contamination from the chemicals to be used in the mining operation :
“ Pascua Lama will use sodium cyanide , arsenic , and produce toxic byproducts .
The rivers El Estrecho , San Félix and El Tránsito together with Santa Juana dam are liable to be polluted by Pascua Lama .
These dangerous poisons will be handled at the sources of the rivers and could damage water supplies to farms , ” said César Padilla of the Latin American Observatory for Environmental Conflicts .
A December 2005 statement from Barrick downplayed the expressed concerns :
Vincent Borg , vice president of corporate communications at Barrick in Canada , said ‘ glacier experts ’ had defined the icefields in question as ‘ ice reservoirs or icefields ’ .
Vincent Borg , vice president of corporate communications at Barrick in Canada , said ‘ glacier experts ’ had defined the icefields in question as ‘ ice reservoirs or icefields ’ .
“ Regardless of what the experts call them , Barrick is committed to their preservation and conservation .
We will move only 5 acres of ice and it is a straightforward procedure that has been proven in the past to conserve the ice .
The ice in question only affects about 3 - 4 % of the ice in the Valley so it is not an amount that some sensationalists would like to make it appear , ” he said .
On the issue of use of toxic chemicals such as cyanide he said , “ Cyanide is used worldwide and can be safely used in many industrial applications .
Mining comprises only 13 % of cyanide use . ”
Opponents contend that Barrick ’s planned procedures to move ice from the glaciers is not nearly as straightforward and safe as the company asserts they are :
The lack of relevant technical expertise in removing glaciers implies an irreversible environmental impact .
What is certain is that the three affected glaciers would suffer an environmental impact .
Nevertheless , there is no certainty whatsoever of what the impact would be on glaciers or permafrost ( frozen rock or soil ) from the road network and the associated stabilization measures that generally involves the use of salts .

Nevertheless , there is no certainty whatsoever of what the impact would be on glaciers or permafrost ( frozen rock or soil ) from the road network and the associated stabilization measures that generally involves the use of salts .
With respect to the measures and actions that will be implemented for handling glaciers there are the following concerns :
The “ clearing ” of ice or “ pieces of glacier ” will be done by bulldozer and front - end loader until the entire rock bed is uncovered .
In this case , any mechanical action on the glacier will cause heat transfer , which will raise the temperature of the ice , and which in turn would be exacerbated by the high local insolation .
Despite the fact that diurnal temperatures are low , the radiative balance includes more than caloric energy .
There are no measurements of radiative energy but the albedo differences between ice and rock mean that the absorption of energy is greater in rock , which would expose the glacier even more .
This also the case for controlled blasting and pushing the glaciers by the afore - mentioned means until their final disposition .
In the case of blasting , this could elevate the temperature to thresholds of melting and evaporation which would further encourage destruction of the glacier .
Barrick has published a Pascua - Lama Fact Sheet that counters many of the statements made in the circulated e-mail message :
Misleading Assertions and Facts Misleading Assertions and Facts
The chain letter makes some very misleading characterizations and inaccurate statements .
Here are a few examples : Statement : “ water in Chile runs from 2 rivers , fed by 2 glaciers . ”
Fact : The Huasco Valley has more than 50 different glaciers and ice fields .
The three smaller glaciers or ice fields that are adjacent to the orebody comprise only 0.3 % of the potential water resources in the Valley if they were to be destroyed , which was never to be the case .
Statement : “ there is no unemployment … ”
Fact : Contrary to this statement , unemployment levels in Region III are among the highest in Chile — the most recent statistics according to the Chilean Statistics Agency reveal rates in the valley in question to be approximately 18 % .
The mayors representing the four municipalities and most of the community leaders in the Huasco Valley have vocally expressed their support of Pascua - Lama indicating that they believe Barrick will conduct an environmentally responsible project and the generation of economic benefits are needed for the long term sustainable development of the region .
As an illustration of the lack of employment opportunities , Barrick has received over 50,000 applications for jobs .
Chileans in the Region III and Argentineans from San Juan are looking for meaningful employment opportunities and the ability to support their families .
Human beings deserve the opportunity to make a decent livelihood .
Statement : “ Under the glaciers has been found a huge deposit of gold … it would be necessary to break , to destroy the glaciers ”
Fact : Contrary to the fundamental premise of the email chain letter , the orebody is NOT under glaciers .
This is simply not the case : 95 % of the orebody is NOT under glaciers / ice fields .
Protection of the remaining 5 % is a key condition of the Chilean authorities ’ approval of the project .
Statement : “ The operation is planned by a multi-national company , one of whose members is George Bush , Sr. ”
Fact : Mr. Bush served in an honorary capacity as an advisor to Barrick ’s International Advisory Board for two years in the mid 1990 ’s .
Mr. Bush was neither a director nor officer of the Company .
Statement : “ If they destroy the glaciers , they will not just destroy the source of especially pure water , but they will permanently contaminate the 2 rivers ”
Fact :
To underline its confidence in its operations and commitment to responsible mining practices , Barrick has committed that should the water quality change , it would immediately stop the project .
In addition to the multiple barriers of protection built into the design , the Company has a comprehensive water quality monitoring and management program , which will include 30 automated points from which data will be readily available in real time for authorities and the public .
This program will be subject to regular independent verification .
The expanded number of monitoring points is a direct result of community consultation and dialogue with stakeholders .
Statement : “ Every last gram of gold will go abroad … and not one will be left with the people ”
Fact :
There will be substantial economic benefits that include 5,500 direct jobs during construction , 1,660 jobs during the two decades of operation , and the indirect job creation and tax revenues generated that will flow back to the communities .
In addition , there will be substantial investment in infrastructure , the development of hundreds of local suppliers of goods and services and the implementation of sustainable development programs .
Statement : “ The farmers … have been forbidden to make a TV appeal by a ban from the Ministry of the Interior ”
Fact : The Water Users Cooperative , representing 2,000 farmers of the Huasco Valley , is fully supportive of the project .
Chile is a democratic country and the media play an important role in the public discussion of the community concerns and interests .
There has already been an extensive and open discussion of issues including the participation of farmers .

The music industry must change or die , the former manager of bands including Pink Floyd and the Clash has said .
Peter Jenner , who made his name managing artists including Marc Bolan , launched his stinging criticisms in a report exploring the future of the music business for independent research group MusicTank .
Mr Jenner accused the recording industry of failing to embrace new technologies , and said labels must find new approaches to business if they are to survive .
" Rapid , consistent and complex change has enveloped the global music industry over the past seven years , " he said .
" The possibility of the era of mass markets turning into an era of masses of niche markets is very real and exciting , with huge implications for the structures of the industry . "
He said the growth of social networking websites such as MySpace could significantly change the way artists interact with their record labels .
Although they have traditionally exerted a powerful influence on musicians , labels could be forced to give up much of their control .
" The current record company model might well morph into that of venture capitalist licensors , working in partnership with artists to develop their businesses , " he said .
The rise of file sharing and digital distribution has had a significant impact on the music industry .
Last year digital music sales worldwide were worth $ 1.1 bn ( £ 590 m ) , three times the year before and accounting for 6 % of the music industry 's revenue , according to industry body IFPI .
Analysts expect the percentage of digital sales to rise to 25 % by 2010 .
But the internet is also exerting an increasing influence on the promotion and breaking of new acts .
MySpace , owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation , will soon begin allowing any artist - even those without a record deal - to sell their music directly over the internet .
MySpace will take a significant commission from each sale , leading to some artists questioning the interests of such deals , including Billy Bragg , another of Mr Jenner 's proteges .
In 1981 , a supervisor asked him to change course once again .
“ He wanted someone who would not be caught up in daily work and could think about light , ” Mr. Jousse said .
“ I knew a little bit about electricity , and I was an amateur photographer .
So he invented a job for me . ”
At the time , most of the Paris monuments were either unlighted or only crudely illuminated with big spotlights that shone directly onto the facades .
Mr. Jousse sought out urban architects and theatrical lighting experts for ideas and technical training .
He eventually created a research laboratory for the city of Paris , where he and a team began to create fixtures and to experiment with the color and intensity of light .
The city now spends about $ 260,000 a day on its lighting .
But that does not mean everything runs smoothly .
The $ 2.1 million project to redesign the lighting of Notre - Dame — most recently the lighting of the south facade , which was inaugurated last week — has involved heartbreaking compromises .
For half a century , the only hint of light on the south facade came from spotlights on the far side of the Seine River .
The new lighting scheme was intended to allow spectators to discover the cathedral ’s facade slowly , through the power and drama of the details .
But as a national monument , Notre - Dame belongs to the French state , which has the right to veto any design decision .
Stones could not be moved , walls could not be drilled .
All material and equipment had to be moved in and out of Notre - Dame at night to avoid annoying tourists .
A bigger headache came from the Catholic clergy .
The designers had planned to light the facade ’s rose window from within , so that it could be seen in full color by passers - by .
The priests called the idea sacrilegious .

BMI for Athletes
Overweight Gold Medal Olympian Athletes according to the Body Mass Index ( BMI )
Underweight = < 18.5
Normal weight = 18.5-24.9
Overweight = 25-29.9
Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater
Theor BMI is a very basic body measure which can be misleading for .
The BMI is based on height and weight and applies to both adult men and women .
However it does not account for muscle mass and can give questionable results in athletes and sports people .
Here is a selection of Gold medalfrom the Athens 2004 Olympics who would be categorised as overweight based on thecalculation .
One particularly amusing statistic shows all members in the famouswould be considered overweight using this scale .
This highlights the problems with using a simplistic measure , such as the BMI , for athletes .
As an alternative , use our list of body fat calculators based on anatomical measures and skinfold values .

Downloading copyrighted material was made illegal in Sweden in July
Twenty eight - year - old Andreas Bawer was found guilty of breaching copyright by distributing a Swedish movie online and fined 16,000 kronor ( US $ 2,000 ) .
The verdict was welcomed by the entertainment industry as a step toward tougher enforcement of copyright laws .
In the past , Sweden has been criticised for being lax on online piracy and introduced a new law in July .
This case relates to 2004 , before the new law banning the downloading of copyrighted material came into effect .
Prior to the law , an estimated 900,000 Swedes regularly downloaded movies , games and music .
Serious crime
The Vastmanlands district court found that downloading copyrighted material was not illegal at the time .
But it ruled that distributing the film breached Sweden 's copyright law .
Now we have taken the first step toward a functioning copyright law
Henrik Ponten , Swedish Anti-piracy Agency
" Making a film available to the public on the internet has significant consequences for the film industry .
Illegal material can in this way be spread quickly and reach many people , which can lead to heavy economic losses for the copyright owners , " the court said .
File - sharing carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison , but in this case the court chose just a fine as the man was not trying to profit financially from his actions .
Bawer 's lawyer said his client had not yet decided whether to appeal against the verdict .
" It 's a lot for uploading one film on one occasion and without financial gain , " said Torbjorn Persson .
The Swedish Anti-piracy Agency , which represents the entertainment industry , hailed the verdict as a big step forward .
" This sends a very strong signal to file - sharers , " said Henrik Ponten , legal council at the group .
" Now we have taken the first step toward a functioning copyright law . "
The decision to fine rather than send Bawer to jail could have serious implications for the fight against internet piracy .
Swedish police can only request personal details from an internet provider about who own a specific net address if they are suspected of a crime that warrants a prison sentence .

Let ’s suppose your child wants to take a martial arts class .
Being a conscientious parent , you check out the local dojos and find two good places .
Both are suitable and well equipped .
Both practice fighting with contact – but there ’s one major difference .
One dojo insists on a full range of protective padding – hands , feet , chest protectors , shin guards – the whole works .
The other takes a much lighter approach – hands and feet , and sometimes not even those .
To the conscientious parent , the first place is going to look much safer , right ?
But when you look at the injury rates of the two dojos , you notice something odd :
They ’re about the same .
The kids covered in foam padding are getting just as many bruises , scrapes , and sprains as the kids wearing almost none .
What could be going on here ?
What ’s happening is a process known as risk compensation .
It ’s a tendency in humans to increase risky behavior proportionately as safeguards are introduced , and it ’s very common .
So common , in fact , as to render predictions of how well any given piece of safety equipment will work almost useless .
In the instance of the mini-ninjas , those with pads are likely hitting and kicking harder and more wildly than those without , and the adults supervising them are likely to be allowing it .
Why would we do such a strange thing ?
Dr. Gerald Wilde of Queens University in Ontario proposes a hypothesis he calls risk homeostasis .
In a nutshell it proposes that human beings have a target level of risk with which they are most comfortable .
When a given activity exceeds their comfort level , people will modify their behavior to reduce their risk until they are comfortable with their level of danger .
So far , that ’s not exactly a controversial observation .
But risk homeostasis proposes another half to that continuum – according to Dr. Wilde , if a given person ’s level of risk drops too far below their comfort level , they will again modify their behavior .
This time though , they will increase their level of risk until they are once again in their target zone .
It seems an odd proposition , but Dr. Wilde and his colleagues have assembled an impressive array of data to support it .
For instance , a study of Munich taxicab drivers conducted while the taxicab fleet was being changed over to ABS braking systems .
The drivers were tracked by observers unaware of which kind of brakes each cab had .
Against the expectations of safety experts who recommend ABS brakes as a safety advance , the drivers with ABS brakes actually had more accidents per vehicle mile than those without .
The drivers braked more sharply , made tighter turns , drove at higher speeds , and made a number of other adjustments to their driving , all of which more than compensated for their supposedly safer cabs .
Fortunately for us , risk homeostasis does not seem to apply in all cases .
Safety innovations that are invisible tend not to provoke changes in behavior – for example changing windshields to safety glass does not alter most peoples ’ driving behavior .
The difference in the windshield is effectively invisible to the driver , and so does n’t affect the driving .
The taxicab drivers , by contrast , were intimately familiar with their cabs , and the difference in braking was apparent to them .
Risk compensation can also be affected by motivation .
A taxicab driver has every reason to try to get from A to B faster , but someone out for a Sunday drive to see the scenery would be less likely to go quickly in response to better braking .
Unfortunately for those whose job it is to make us all safer , risk homeostasis and risk compensation are not easy to study .
It is difficult to predict how people will alter their behavior in response to a given piece of safety equipment , and thereby equally difficult to figure out what to be looking at in a study .
Seatbelts , for instance , have an modestly positive effect on driver and passenger safety ( though somewhat less than models predicted ) .
It ’s not until you look at pedestrian safety that you really begin to see where risk compensation may be having its way .
An additional complication for the already beleaguered safety engineers is that risk homeostasis is dependent not upon actual danger , but rather the perception of risk .
Much of the gender and age differences in risk - taking behavior appear to stem less from differing desires for risk , and more from the individual ’s different evaluation of risk .
Young people , and particularly young men , tend to evaluate their level of risk as much lower than older people would , even in identical situations .
This implies that promoting safer behavior depends more upon altering the perceptions of the target population , rather than improving the safety of the environment⁠ — a much trickier proposition .
What it all boils down to is that the law of unintended consequences is extraordinarily applicable when talking about safety innovations .
Sometimes things intended to make us safer may not make any improvment at all to our overall safety , and in rare instances they may actually make us less safe .
The human tendency to take risks may trump all the efforts of the safety engineers .
In the end , no one can save us from ourselves .
Sales of existing homes fell for a third straight month in June , as the number of available homes sitting unsold continued to mount .
Statistics released today by the National Association of Realtors said that sales in June fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.6 million homes , down from 6.7 million in May .
The number of homes on the market , meanwhile , grew to a 6.8 - month supply , up from a 6.4 - month supply in May .
The report was seen by many economists as another sign that the overall housing market is slowing down significantly from the torrid pace of 2005 .
“ Last year ’s level of demand and production was unsustainable , ” said Michael Carliner , an economist with the National Association of Home Builders .
“ What we ’re hearing from builders across the country , but not everywhere , is that things are slowing down . ”

Managers , wanna - be managers , and folks who want to understand managers simply need to read the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Green and Joost Elffers .
I ’ve purposely not done any background research on this document because my first reaction to this list was profound and I wanted to stare at that reaction .
There ’s some pretty evil shit documented there as well as some basic truths about what managers are up do on a daily basis .
I ca n’t tell if the guys who wrote this are serious when they write “ Keep Others in Suspended Terror : Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability ” , but after several readings , yeah , I think they ’re serious .
My problem with this list and how it relates to managers is that some many of the “ rules ” involve psychological torture of those you ’re trying to lead and that strikes me as a good way further the intense knee - jerk reaction regarding managers .
“ That guy is a power hungry jerk ’ .
Still …
Part of management is navigating your way through some tricky political jungles …
Part of management is getting folks to comfortably bend in a uncomfortable direction .
A good manager is a person who is playing to a strategy and is n’t merely stumbling around squashing fires all day .
Management is chess .
When you ’re presented with a problem , you sometimes need to sit back and take a look at the board , figure out the consequences of each of move , and , most importantly , pick a move .
In my experience the move and how you pick it does not involve 48 laws , it ’s only three words .
Subtlety , Subterfuge , and Silence .
Subtlety
Worst performance review ever .
I ’ve just delivered a painful performance review to a fictional employee and he does n’t get it .
Two weeks I spent writing this thing , gathering peer feedback , and rewriting and he ’s sitting there like everything ’s dandy .
I ’m not about to fire this guy , but given his current trajectory , he ’s two years from becoming irrelevant and I want to nip this in the bud , but it ’s radio silence .
“ Any questions ? ”
“ Nope . ”
“ Are you clear about the areas I want to work with you on ? ”
“ Yup . ”
Now , the point of a performance review has nothing to do with the review , it ’s the discussion .
It ’s about constructively conveying information about the performance of the co-worker and then chewing on it a bit .
You want to see some form of processing of the information you just dumped even if it ’s just a pile of follow - up questions .
I was getting nothing .
So I moved on .
It was our 1:1 and I had a list .
We started with the first item which , last week , read “ Thoughts on moving forward on Project X . ”
This week it read , “ Lack of progress on Project X , next steps , and goals . ”
The second item had read , “ Hiring status ” and this week it read , “ Weekly goals for resume review , alternative sourcing strategies . ”
Yes , I ’d rewritten my entire 1:1 with the performance review in mind .
The employee in question was n’t comfortable with the strategic broad - strokes I ’d painted in his review , but he certain got it when I carefully reconstructed his 1:1 to support the review .
By the end of the 1:1 , I ’d piled his to - do list so high , we were actually back talking about the performance review because it was that advice that was going to help him get the work done .
To me , using subtlety as a manager is the ability to elegantly handle complex situations .
This elegance , this ability to cleverly handle the complex , only happens when you have time to consider your response .
That ’s the other half of subtlety .
It ’s the ability to look at what ’s happening around you and make a make a distinction between useless noise and emerging relevance .
Subterfuge
Say it with me , “ sub-ter- fyooooooooj ” .
We should make shirts , it ’s that fun to say , but what does it mean ?
Subterfuge means “ intrigue , deviousness , deceit , deception , dishonesty , cheating , duplicity , guile , cunning , craftiness , chicanery , pretense , fraud , fraudulence ” .
Those definitions cover a lot of territory , so let ’s refine it for the sake of this piece .
Relative to management , this does not mean “ deceit , dishonest , cheating , fraud , or fraudulence ” … it ’s everything else .
I ’ll explain .
We were at a crossroads at the start - up .
Too much to do , two vastly different directions in which the team wanted to head .
There were the infrastructure folks who wanted to spend three months replacing the application server and then there were the interaction folks who wanted to improve the usability of the application .
The VP listened to both sides and then he decided , “ Infrastructure !
Long term scalability ! ”
The interaction folks were pissed .
Their response , “ Who cares about long term scalability if no one wants to use the product ? ”
Oh yeah , I was also the manager of the interaction folks and I agreed with them , but I had to throw my engineers on the infrastructure work because we did n’t have the capacity .
I was talking with existing customers and they were n’t pulling their hair out because the application was sluggish , but rather because it was an interaction nightmare .
They were spending most of their time trying to figure the damned thing out .
Grrrrrrrrr .
The lead interaction designer , myself , and an engineer sat in a conference room fuming in silence when it popped in my head .
“ Hey , people are visual creatures , how long to throw together a prototype that shows off what we were thinking ? ”
My engineer , “ A week ! ”
Good time to point out how enthusiasm reduces all engineering estimates by a third .
My engineer continued , “ But I ’ll need Frank . ”
Hmmmmm .
“ Here ’s what we ’re going to do .
I want you and Frank to work on this after 5 pm , after we ’re done with our infrastructure work , and I want you to keep this on the downlow .
If , after a week , we like what we see , we ’re going public . ”
Herein lies the hard part of subterfuge .
Depending on where you are standing , my plan could be viewed in any number of ways .
The other engineering director would have called it , “ Disobeying a direct order ” whereas my boss , who got wind of the effort two days in , called it “ a skunk works project ” and told us to proceed .
Phew .
Our skunk works took us three weeks , not one , but when we showed off our work , the VP of Engineering and VP of Marketing were impressed and wanted to see us finish the work .
Rather than sacrificing the infrastructure effort , they gave me two reqs so I could hire a team to do the job right .
Subterfuge is a risk .
The infrastructure director never quite trusted me after that even though I still went out of my way to keep him in the loop after we went public with our work .
The use of subterfuge for good means keeping the intent honest .
If you ’re going commando to do what you believe is right , it does n’t means someone is n’t going to be pissed , but it should allow you to sleep at night .
Silence
Your most annoying employee sits across the table and he ’s on a roll .
This guy is total and complete personality clash with you and he ’s in his second hour of rambling about something you do n’t understand .
My advice is simple :
Shut up .
I mean it .
Now , if you know what he ’s trying to get at and you ’ve continued to let him blither , ok , you can start talking and directing him elsewhere , but if he ’s valiantly trying to get to the point , you must shut up and listen .
Your silence is giving him a chance to get something out .
I ’m not a fan of public speaking .
I ’m not comfortable with the all hands meeting where I ’m laying out the next six months of work .
My natural state is one of introspection where I ’m soaking in the world and the skill has taken me far because so many folks out there just ca n’t shut up .
While all this talking is going on , I sit quietly and nod … learning what all these yammering people are about and carefully file it away for future reference .
Managers lead and a lot of managers translate that into “ managers lead by talking ” .
Combined with the tendency of employees to not say no to these managers , you can see why a lot of us have turned into professional windbags .
We think we ’re guiding you by filing the air with our thoughts .
There ’s a time and place for that , but in order to fill the air with something relevant , you ’ve got to gather and process data .
In silence , you can assess .
My favorite use of silence is a huge cross-functional meeting with a group I ’ve never worked with before where I have no role other than listener .
It ’s a table full of people I do n’t know and I feel like I ’m sitting at the worst poker table ever because everyone tells you what they got .
Remember this , in most business , everyone ’s basic agenda is visible after they ’ve talked for about ten minutes .
I ’m not talking about who they are as a person , I ’m talking about figuring out what they have and what the need .
In poker , you keep this information hidden as best you can because your money is on the line .
In business , everyone throws their hand on the table , stands up , points at their hand , and says , “ People , I ’m one card away from the nut flush .
Who ’s going to give the queen of hearts ? ”
Asking for what you need is a good strategy in business , it ’s called collaborating .
Each time I hear “ I need ” , I learn another bit about those I work with and , in time , I can construct a better picture of how to interact with my co-workers ..
Still , I ’m also wondering about that guy in the corner who is n’t saying a thing .
His eyes are darting around the room just like mine and I ’m curious … what is he getting out of his silence ?
Business is n’t War
The 48 Laws of Power are the real deal , but they are focused on war , not business .
There ’s a book if you want to know more , but read wisely .
With each successful year on the job , I find myself adjusting to the ever increasing complexity with which my peers play the game of management .
Fifteen years in , I can safely say there is one law which is true ; if you ’re only interested in building power , you ’re going to lose .
My Motorola / Windows XP phone began to die after two years .
Wanting something that would let me keep in touch with friends over AOL Instant Messenger , I got a T - Mobile Sidekick .
I was reluctant to get a non -flip phone , but so far I have only managed to make one unintended phone call per day .
The Web browser is excruciatingly slow .
I ’ve found that most of the Web sites developed in the early 1990s work just fine .
It is possible to log in , fill out forms , get results .
What does n’t work ?
The latest and greatest Web sites .
They are too script - heavy .
Programmers seem to have forgotten that although the average desktop has ever - greater capabilities , the average user is increasingly connecting from a handheld device .
I tried using one of my students ’ sites from last semester .
They lifted some username / password code from a Ruby on Rails toolkit .
It relies on JavaScript .
The site is 100 percent useless from the Sidekick .
Have we proven that “ the better the tools the worse the application ? ”
On November 26 2005 , I travelled to Iran to research and film undercover the documentary Execution of a Teenage Girl .
The programme tells the story of Atefah Sahaaleh , 16 , from northern Iran , hanged in public in August 2004 for having had sex outside marriage , a so - called " crime against chastity " .
A number of Iranian journalists and lawyers had strong evidence that the judiciary had broken Iran 's own law in executing Atefah .
But because of the censorship of the Iranian press , it was extremely difficult for them to get the truth to a wider audience .
My executive producer , Paul Hamann , who is also the chairman of anti-death penalty charity Reprieve , was passionate about the project .
But if we asked the Iranian authorities openly for a visa to investigate such a story , we would have been laughed out of the embassy .
After very careful consideration , we decided we should travel to Iran undercover , posing as tourists .
I 'd filmed in Iran this way once before , in 2003 , but it 's a horrible way of working .
From the moment you arrive in the country , you are breaking the law .
The Foreign Office regards it as reckless and tells you firmly not to do it .
If you get caught , you may be accused by the Iranian authorities not just of being a journalist there without permission but of spying .
But any risks I 'd be taking would be dwarfed by those taken by the Iranian members of the team .
If they were caught working with a British undercover journalist , the consequences would be severe .
On my 2003 trip , I 'd had a wonderful fixer and the trip had gone off without any problems .
But he'd then collaborated with a project that the Iranian authorities did not like and had spent three months in prison .
That was under the so - called reformist President Khatami .
Now new President Ahmadinejad has shocked and depressed my friends and contacts in Tehran .
The rulebook they 'd lived by under Mr Khatami has been torn up , and they do n't know what to expect .
Many sounded scared .
After July 2005 , and Ahmadinejad 's election , even tourist visas became difficult to come by .
Finally , I got in by pretending to be engaged to my half Iranian , half British colleague .
We bought a £ 17 ring from Kentish Town High Street .
My " fiance " and I left for Iran on November 26 , carrying a basic undercover filming kit in our bags .
The deadline for my return was non-negotiable ; my mother 's 60th birthday party on December 21 .
If I did n't turn up , my family would never forgive me .
Day one
The plane to Iran is virtually empty - perhaps 20 passengers .
We have to report our movements to our tour company , which will report our whereabouts to the tourist ministry .
But because P , my colleague and pretend fiance , is half Iranian , we 'll be quite independent .
In the summer of 2003 , just months after my last undercover trip to Iran , Canadian / Iranian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi was arrested for photographing Evin prison in Tehran .
She was raped and badly beaten in custody before the interrogators realised she was a Canadian citizen .
Tragically , she died of her injuries in prison .
As the plane prepares to land , British Airways passes on the message that we are required , from now on , to conform to Iran 's Islamic dress code .
The cosmopolitan women around me , dressed in jeans and trousers , pull scarves out of their bags .
I 'm endlessly fascinated by the individually stylish ways Iranian women find to wear their hijab .
I have the same scarf I wore for my last trip .
It 's huge and soft and doubles as a security blanket - we were very lucky that time .
We land in Tehran airport and reach passport control .
P is asked in detail about me and whether I 'll convert to Islam before we marry .
He assures the guard that I will , and we 're in .
The officials do n't look for or find the camera or microphone in my suitcase .
Day two
We visit the tomb of the medieval Persian poet Hafez in a park at sunset .
It 's a regular evening pilgrimage for young Iranians .
They walk down the avenues of lemon trees and past the shallow reflecting pools to the raised tombstone , where they recite his poems silently , like prayers .
In the shadows , couples hold hands .
We talk to the guys on the neighbouring table to us in a teahouse - they tell us many of the girls in this romantic place are actually prostitutes , students who need money .
Every so often the moral police clamp down on parks and teahouses where girls and boys spend time together .
All these guys can tell stories of being stopped by the police .
But they live a kind of double life , with a highly attuned sense of what they can get away with .
From what I 've seen and heard , young middle - class Iranians break the law daily , if not hourly .
Our wonderful young fixer watches Seinfeld and Friends on illegal satellite and has a very beautiful girlfriend with whom he may well commit crimes against chastity on a regular basis .
That 's probably why Atefah 's story so horrified young Iranians .
In the re-telling , they 've romanticised her story somewhat .
Though Atefah came from what was originally a good family , and had cousins who went to university to read law and botany , her own childhood was tragic .
Her mother died in a traffic accident and her father became a heroin addict .
She lived with her grandparents and , though her grandmother was very fond of her , her grandfather seems to have been a bully .
By the time she was in her early teens , Atefah seems to have been wild , the kind of girl who was asking for trouble , who did n't care about rules , who answered back .
She was also too pretty for her own good , apparently .
I imagine her as a kind of Iranian Emily Lloyd in Wish You Were Here , who cycles round the town showing off her legs , looking for trouble .
Girls are n't allowed to use bicycles in Iran but I 'm sure Atefah found other ways of drawing attention to herself .
A caller from her home town of Neka to Radio Fadr said men used to wolf - whistle at her .
Day five : Tehran
After checking into our hotel , and changing taxis twice , we finally meet our team in the safe flat we 're using .
It feels fantastic to get going and we brainstorm about how we 're going to spend the next few days .
After Atefah 's execution , which seems to have caught people almost entirely by surprise , there was a wave of revulsion at what the authorities had done to her and many people phoned the dissident media .
A few journalists followed up the story and managed to establish the key facts of the case .
The authorities had referred to Atefah as a 22 - year - old but her birth certificate proved she was 16 .
Executing those under 18 is hugely controversial in Iran .
The government promised to stop the practice in 1995 but , according to campaigners , it has continued in secret .
In Atefah 's case , the authorities had been caught red-handed .
But why were they so eager to execute her that they 'd falsify her real age ?
I 'm amazed that we 've got a list of people who are prepared to go on the record to say what they know about the case .
They include formidable lawyer Shirin Ebadi , whose Nobel Peace Prize gives her a protected status .
But interviewing people from Neka and those close to Atefah will be incredibly difficult .
We have some evidence that police corruption played a key part in Atefah 's story .
And , after her death , the police had made the rounds of a number of people close to Atefah and threatened them not to talk to the media .
So we have many sources who we wo n't be able to film on camera and whom the authorities must never know we 're meeting .
We are trying to line up safe houses .
Our top priority among our list of our potential on - camera interviewees is Atefah 's father , Safer Ali .
We do n't know what to expect of him .
His drug problems had meant he'd been a hopeless father , although he apparently adored his daughter and was desolate now .
Since her death , he 'd gone cold turkey and is trying to reform himself .
He 's left Neka .
Finding a former drug addict , who has no telephone , in a strange city six hours from Tehran ... getting him to a safe house ... making a judgment call about whether he is really in a position to give informed consent about giving an interview ... all without alerting the authorities .
It 's a nasty seven - hour drive across the mountains to get to him .
We 're all praying that Safer Ali will be at his last known address and be cogent .
Our fixer , J , sets off and we do n't know when he 'll be back .
Day six : Tehran
According to Iran 's constitution , with sharia law placed over any parliamentary law , reformist legislation can be ignored at any time by any sharia judge .
Under sharia law , the age of criminal responsibility for a girl is nine ( for boys it is 15 ) .
A girl of nine can be tried and sentenced in the same way as a man of 40 .
We have obtained copies of the two court verdicts ; the first , from Neka court , giving Atefah the death penalty for crimes against chastity , and the supreme court of appeal verdict , surveying the case and ratifying the death penalty .
The Neka court verdict does not refer to Atefah 's age .
But there were obviously some additional papers accompanying this verdict that we do n't have .
In the supreme court verdict , Atefah is described as 22 .
An anonymous web article said : " The judge said his eyes were as good as a birth certificate .
She was 22 and an adulteress . "
The judge also said on another occasion that Atefah told him she was 22 .
It 's just conceivable that she lied about her age in the hope it would get her out of trouble .
But it would have taken a moment to check her birth certificate or school records .
Tragically neither she nor her family knew that making a fuss about her real age might have saved her life .
Day seven
I 'm desperate to find out about Atefah 's boyfriend , who seems to have been the one good thing in her life .
We are told that this boyfriend adored Atefah and wanted to marry her .
He was 19 or 20 and worked for a state agency .
The relationship seems to have continued for a number of years and he visited her in prison .
But she was too young to marry and , presumably , his family would have disapproved at his association with this fallen girl .
J returns from his mission to find Atefah 's father .
J looks completely exhausted , having spent 14 hours on the road .
He was found living in a high - rise and is apparently drug free .
He kissed J shoes in gratitude for trying to help his daughter 's case .
Safer
Ali has promised to come down to Tehran in two days .
Sadly he could n't come any sooner .
I 'm worried he 'll get cold feet .
Day nine : Tehran
I 'm getting through my shot list reasonably well , but there are a few things that are proving very difficult , like filming the supreme court , which backed up Judge Haji Rezai 's verdict of execution on Atefah .
Judge Haji Rezai managed to get Atefah 's appeal through the supreme court at many times they normal speed .
Atefah was arrested at home , washing rice , on May 2 2004 .
After three days , they held a trial and she was sentenced to death .
( God knows what happened to her in those three days , as she confessed to her sexual relationship with Ali Daroubi , which she 'd never done before .
Did they beat it out of her ? )
On June 6 , the appeal hearing was scheduled in Tehran and , by August 12 , she was dead .
We 've heard that , in normal circumstances , a serious case like murder would take a minimum of six months to reach the appeal stage .
It is very hard to believe that the speed with which Atefah 's case was concluded merely down to the authorities ' desire to be efficient .
It 's a crucial part of the story but it 's going to be really hard to tell visually , and indeed journalistically , since the truth is locked up in the sealed files of the supreme court .
Only certain vehicles with the right permission are allowed into the central area that houses the supreme court .
During daylight hours at least we take a taxi , but there are " no filming " signs everywhere and it is just too difficult to get decent shots .
We 'll go back at night .
Day 10 : Safer Ali
He finally turns up , overexcited and exhausted after an eight - hour journey .
He 's sunburned , with bright eyes and is wearing an army jacket .
Knowing Atefah 's photos as well as I now do , the family resemblance is very strong .
Safer
Ali takes the strangeness of a foreign , and female , director in his stride .
It 's a very good interview , very impassioned .
He was not there for his daughter when she needed him most .
She was abused by Ali Daroubi , by a man he knew , and he did not spot this or protect her from it .
Though he tried as hard as he could , with no money , to get a lawyer for his daughter , surely there was more he could have done ?
The truth is that his heroin addiction made him a pretty useless human being for years .
But there 's no doubt at all that he 's very sorry now .
He seems clean and determined to stay that way .
The strangest thing is hearing him repeat Atefah 's words .
For example : " Atefah used to say the moon wo n't always stay behind the clouds - and she was right . "
You get the sense she was a very articulate teenager .
Day 11
We pick up J and N and set off north .
As we hit the mountain road just north of Tehran , I finally understand why everyone is so frightened of this drive .
For three hours at least , as we go over the mountains , it 's just a single lane , with a vertical drop into the stony valley on one side and kamikaze lorry drivers overtaking each other at full pelt .
In a bleak apartment block we finally meet with our key sources ( who can not be identified for their own safety ) .
Our interviews last an overwhelming six or seven hours .
There are a lot of tears .
It is clear that Atefah 's death changed them .
One of them was very religious .
She did not believe such a thing could ever be done in the name of Islam .
Another confronted the judge very directly on a number of occasions and has had to flee Neka .
We learn a lot more about Atefah 's dysfunctional family .
After her mother 's death , Atefah 's little brother drowned in the river .
The details of Atefah 's abuse by Ali Daroubi , which Atefah told her aunt about in prison , are horrendous .
Apparently she could only walk on all fours afterwards because of the pain .
Her family at the time seem to have hated and punished her rebellious behaviour but not found out its root cause .
A number of people we 've talked to are convinced Atefah was killed to shut her up .
Their general reading of the situation is that Atefah was taken advantage of by the moral police in Neka , who knew of Ali Daroubi 's abuse and abused her too .
Then , for some reason , they decided to get her out of the way .
Atefah never seemed to follow rules and she did n't seem to know the rules about keeping quiet .
So they used Ali Daroubi as a scapegoat to prosecute Atefah and get her out of the way .
We have heard a similar interpretation of events from many people but it is so hard to substantiate .
However , two months after Atefah 's death , there was a big wave of arrests in Neka and two moral policemen were arrested , accused of organising a child sex ring .
Day 13
As we enter Behshahr , ( site of Atefah 's prison and courthouse ) , we suddenly come across four mullahs in quick succession , out and about Behshahr 's main street .
We 've been in Iran almost two weeks .
Surprisingly , we 've only seen one mullah so far , in Shiraz ( he was very young and friendly , and talked to us before getting onto the back of his friend 's moped and driving off into the night ) .
We drive through Neka .
It 's late morning now , the sun has gone .
Neka is a grim small town .
There are no old buildings at all to make it picturesque .
It was very badly flooded some years ago .
It does n't seem poor , just ugly .
Looking round Neka , Judge Haji Rezai's excuse as to why he felt it necessary to rush Atefah 's trial and execution through so quickly is somewhat ironic .
He felt that " Neka was becoming lax and immoral , and he wanted to clean it up , particularly because it was the summer months , and lots of tourists were stopping off . "
I feel sure that it 's a very long time since any tourist has stopped in Neka , except perhaps to find a toilet .
Around lunchtime we arrive in Sari .
I feel completely unable to shake off the horrible atmosphere of this whole area .
Day 14
It 's too dangerous to film in Neka in broad daylight , so we leave at 7 am .
It 's a tiny town , just a few streets .
There are absolutely no westerners here .
Neka is famous for one reason , and one reason only - Atefah .
I 'm getting very twitchy .
Day 15 - Neka
We got up at 4 am - again .
Goodness knows what the hotel management made of it .
By 5 am we were in Neka to film the square where Atefah was executed .
It 's a piece of scrubland just a couple of streets away from her house .
There 's chicken wire round one edge .
It 's perhaps the size of a football pitch , empty , a wasteland .
Around the edge are houses .
Apparently the female guard who Atefah 's friend accused of persecuting Atefah lives in one of them .
We 've tried to come up with alibis for everywhere we 've filmed .
Our alibi today was that we were driving south , and had stopped to buy bread , and for J to have a nap .
People do drive at night in Iran as it's marginally safer , but it was a lousy alibi .
Any Neka policeman would see through it in an instant , particularly one with a guilty conscience .
We sat in the car with the engine off , as I filmed the sun rising behind the buildings .
Atefah was killed at dawn , six in the morning .
On the day of Atefah 's execution , the Mr N told us , this patch of wasteland was nearly full of people come to watch .
According to sharia law , execution for sex outside marriage should be by stoning , but shortly after the revolution , the Iranian authorities took to hanging people from cranes no matter what the crime .
It 's quick , cheap , and provides a spectacle for the crowd .
We 've seen footage from other recent executions in Iran .
The technique is so perfunctory .
A lorry with a crane is parked up .
A noose is put around the victim 's neck , and the victim is blindfolded .
Some people have told us that a mullah says words from the Qur'an , but in the footage we 've seen the killers have been perfunctory .
The crane arm is then raised to its full height , and with it the noose .
The victim dies of strangulation .
The body swings in the air .
B told us that sometimes they move the crane arm slowly from far left extension to right to display the body to everyone in the crowd .
Atefah 's friend told us that he saw a couple of men in the crowd filming Atefah 's execution on mobile phones .
Someone rushed to her aunt and said - " We 've filmed it , we 'll put it on the internet . "
So far this footage has n't surfaced .
I do n't know if I could bear to watch it .
A sixteen - year - old girl 's execution in accordance to laws written in the early middle ages , filmed on a mobile phone .
Haji Rezai put the noose around Atefah 's neck himself , and left her body hanging for 45 minutes .
Then he drove away in his black Peugeot 406 .
Day 16
We are so relieved to leave the Neka area .
We will come back if any of our remaining leads bear fruit but we think it is just too dangerous to stay in Mazandaran any longer - there is really no plausible reason why a group like us would be hanging around .
My one hope is that Atefah 's boyfriend will come forward and talk to us .
We just do n't know what happened to him .
According to Atefah 's friend , Hussein visited her in prison all three times she was arrested .
That means their romance continued over at least two - and - a - half years .
But after Atefah received her death sentence , she never saw him again , though she was in prison for a further two months .
No one knows where he is at the moment .
Did the relationship become too much for him ?
Did his family forbid him to associate with her , now that her secret was out ?
Did the police chase him off ?
We have a number of people looking for him .
I want to know for Atefah 's sake .
I really want to find out that there was a good reason he did n't ever say goodbye to her .
Day 17 - interview Shadi Sadr , lawyer
Judge Haji Rezai made , from my notes , the following procedural errors in Iranian law :
· He got Atefah 's age wrong - she was 16 , not 22 as he described her .
( This meant that he conveniently sidestepped the freeze in place on executions of those under 18 )
· He convicted Atefah for " adultery " though she was not married .
· He failed to give Atefah a chance of a second appeal
· He failed to give the family notice of Atefah 's execution date
· He executed Atefah himself though the judge is meant merely to preside , with the killing being done by a separate official .
In Britain , the standard of proof needed for conviction is " beyond reasonable doubt " .
In sharia law it is " the knowledge of the judge " .
Day 18 - Khomenei's tomb
We have now heard from five sources that Judge Haji Rezai was involved in the political purges of 1983 .
We sit with A as he tells us what happened to his brothers , fairly typical of the leftwing students who were initially swept up in the revolution then witnessed their friends being killed as the Islamists turned on any opposition .
Mohammad Hoshi's fiancee , aged 17 , was arrested for having a flyer for a political party in her bag .
He never saw her again .
She was executed in prison .
Judge X famously flew from place to place in a helicopter , issuing mass execution orders .
Another one ordered his own son to be executed .
S tells us that Haji Rezai was one of 95 judges hand - picked by the Ayatollah Khomenei to preside over the revolutionary courts in Tehran , and to orchestrate the clean - up .
If Judge Haji Rezai is indeed one of these 1983 judges , a lot falls into place .
They are seen by many as virtually untouchable .
Either because the revolution is grateful to them for its survival , or , more cynically , because they know where the bodies are buried and would bring others down with them .
We go back to J's to continue backing up the rushes .
Brain dead , we watch Seinfeld and Friends on his illegal cable .
Day 19 - the embassy
We have seven tapes of interviews , five tapes of locations and countless transcripts of off - the - record recorded interviews .
I feel I have a very clear , if heartbreaking , idea of the chain of events in the last two years of Atefah 's life .
Though sadly it will be very difficult to substantiate much of what we 've been told on one hand , and on the other hand we cannot reveal the identify of many of our sources , I think we can say enough to get the message through loud and clear .
I am very sad that we have n't heard from Atefah 's boyfriend .
But I do n't blame him .
As far as everything else goes , I do n't know if things have gone well because of all the careful planning , or if we 've been lucky .
There are lots of things I 'd love to do still but the very strong and sensible message from above is - get back safely and soon , nothing else matters .
But all we have achieved so far is meaningless unless we get the tapes out .
P leaves , a couple of days earlier than me as planned , as the days when we try to get the tapes out are high risk .
His girlfriend has apparently lost almost a stone in three weeks from worry about him as it is .
Day 21
The most horrible scramble imaginable .
J and I are stuck for four hours at X as we pass on the tapes .
The passengers have already had their last call by the time I arrive at departures .
I feel sick with nerves but it absolutely must not show in front of the officials .
There 's another last - minute delay while J and I are questioned closely about our relationship - some official saw us hug the other day as we waved Arash off , he was understandably upset as he does n't know when he will see him again .
It is now 10.45 .
The plane was meant to leave at 10.15 .
But bless British Airways ; the plane is either late or , just possibly , waits for me .
As I scramble on board , a steward says : " They did n't want to let you go , did they ! "
Five tense days later , Paul Hamann breathes a huge sigh of relief as he receives the last of the rushes , which all got through safely .
· Monica Garnsey is the producer / director of Execution of a Teenage Girl , which will be shown at 9 pm on Thursday July 27 on BBC2 .
Aye Aye
http://www.arkive.org/...
The bizarre aye - aye is one of the most unusual primates on the planet , so much so that it was originally classified as a rodent .
The thick coat is slate grey to brown with white flecks from the long guard hairs , which are lighter at the tip .
The face is paler than the rest of the body with large , leathery ears and prominent , yellowish - orange eyes .
The hands are the most striking feature of this animal however ; the elongated , thin fingers have curved , claw - like nails and the third digit is extremely thin so that it appears to be little more than skin and bone .
The aye - aye is the largest nocturnal primate and has a long bushy tail .
They live in Madagascar and are one of the weird animals on Earth .
Let 's hear it for primate diversity !
The Giant Otter
http://www.arkive.org/...
The giant otter , known locally as the ' river wolf ' , is one of South America 's top predators and is the largest of the otter species in terms of length .
The long sinuous body is covered with velvety , reddish - brown fur , which is thick and water - repellent .
A patch of cream colouring is present on the throat and chin , the pattern of which is unique to each individual .
The short legs end in large webbed - feet and these , along with the rudder - like tail , allow the otter to move quickly through the water .
Prey movements are detected by the large eyes and sensitive whiskers .
Size Male length : 1.5 - 1.8 m ( 2 ) ( That would be six feet . )
Female length : 1.5 - 1.7 m ( 2 )
They live in the Amazon and are as big you and I .
If we do all come back as animals , I hope to do well enough for the karma wheel to send me back as one of these .
Mediterrranean Monk Seal
http://www.arkive.org/...
The Mediterranean monk seal is one of the most endangered mammals in the world .
The description of this species by Aristotle was the first known written description of a pinniped ( a group that includes seals , sea lions and walrus ) , and the head of a monk seal appeared on one of the first ever coins , around 500 BC .
Adults have a brown or grey coat , which becomes paler on the undersurface and often features a white patch on the belly .
Old males are darker in colour and often become black , but retain the ventral white patch .
Newborn infants are black and woolly with a white or yellow patch on the belly , the shape of which can sometimes be used to determine the sex of an individual .
Sloth Bear
http://www.arkive.org/...
The small sloth bear is unique amongst the bears , as insects are its main food source .
It has a long , shaggy black coat , which on some individuals appears to have a cinnamon tinge , and there is a pale white / cream marking on the chest .
The muzzle is also pale in colour and these bears have a shaggy mane of hair around the shoulders .
The snout is relatively long , the lips are bare , and sloth bears lack upper incisors , all of which are adaptations for their insect - based diet .
The front feet are turned inwards and have large and slightly curved ivory claws for digging .
Early explorers saw these bears lying upside down in trees and gave them their common name of sloth bear .
Sloth bears are unique amongst bears in that the majority of their diet is composed of insects , particularly termites and ants .
They live in Nepal , Bhutan , Bangladesh , India and Sri Lanka .
The Birds
Blyth 's Tragopan
http://www.arkive.org/...
This brilliantly - coloured pheasant is the largest of all tragopans , and is easily recognised by its bright yellow bare facial skin , rusty - red head , neck and breast , and smoky - grey lower breast and belly .
The back and rest of the body is brownish red , densely spotted with small white dots .
A distinctive black band extends from the base of the bill to the crown and another black band extends behind the eye .
Like other tragopans , males have two pale - blue fleshy `horns ' that become erect during courtship , and a brilliantly coloured , inflatable lappet that hangs from the throat .
The lappet is yellow bordered with blue , and like the horns , can be expanded and exposed during courtship display ..
Females are dark brown with a mixture of black , buff and white mottling .
These live in Bhutan , which is always on my short list to visit .
Did you know Bhutan does not have a Gross National Product , but instead uses Gross National Happiness ?
Sri Lankan Frogmouth
http://www.arkive.org/...
Distinctive in both its appearance and its loud laughing song , the Sri Lankan frogmouth is a tropical bird related to the nightjars .
So called because of its large , gaping mouth , the Sri Lankan frogmouth 's head is as wide as its body , and has a broad , flattened , hooked bill .
The female is rusty red with sparse white freckling , whereas the male is grey and more heavily spotted with white .
The tail feathers are long and narrow .
The frogmouth is lucky enough to live in some of the United Nation 's Biosphere Reserves .
Reptiles
The Chinese Crocodile Lizard
http://www.arkive.org/...
The Chinese crocodile lizard is so named for the appearance of its tail , which has an enlarged pair of scales running in two sharply protruding ridges down its length like a crocodile .
Like the distant relative after which it is named , this lizard is semi-aquatic , and its extremely powerful tail helps make it a strong swimmer .
Colouration is highly variable , combining shades of grey and brown on the upper surface and yellowish - tan on the lower with distinctive bright orange markings .
Males are usually more colourful than females , often being strikingly adorned with brilliant orange sides and throat , occasionally extending into the side of the head , with these bright colours intensifying during the breeding season .
Until recently , this species was thought to be restricted to the Dayao Shan mountain range of the east central Guangxi Province of south - eastern China , but in 2003 a population was also discovered in the Quang Ninh Province of north - eastern Vietnam .
Mugger
http://www.arkive.org/...
The broad snout of the mugger makes it look more like an alligator than a crocodile , but the large and visible fourth tooth indicates that it is a true crocodile .
The head is flat with the eyes , ears and nostrils all on the top to allow the mugger to submerge the rest of the body , but still keep these sensory organs above the water .
The eye is protected by a clear third eyelid for underwater vision , and the windpipe can be covered with a flap of skin to allow the crocodile to attack underwater without letting water into the lungs .
The mugger has webbed feet , but these are not used in swimming , as they are tucked against the body whilst the flat tail propels the mugger through the water .
Juveniles are light tan in colour with black cross -banding on the body and tail but this fades with age as the body becomes grey to brown .
Males are larger than females .
If we attack Iran , expect to find these in the waters , which might come as a shock to our troops .
Mountain Horned Agama
http://www.arkive.org/...
This little guy gets no love , all that is know about them is that they are dying out in Sri Lanka .
Amphibians
Axolotl
http://www.arkive.org/...
This astonishing species is part of the family of `mole salamanders ' , but exhibits an unusual and extreme trait known as neoteny , or paedomorphosis .
This is the retention of larval stage characteristics throughout life , so axolotls usually never fully resemble an adult salamander .
Unlike other amphibians , most axolotl fail to metamorphose , living permanently in water .
Although it does develop lungs , the axolotl 's most bizarre feature is its retention of its branch - like gills .
These are external projections from the neck on each side of the head .
Each side has three branches covered with feathery filaments which increase the surface area for gas exchange .
The axolotl has a long , slim and darkly coloured body , and short legs , with four digits on the front feet and five digits on the hind feet .
Albino individuals have been bred in captivity , but are not known to live in the wild .
I am lucky enough to have seen these in the wild , they are as freaky as advertised , like they were just popping in and visiting our planet .
Chinese giant salamander
http://www.arkive.org/...
The Chinese giant salamander is the largest salamander in the world , and is fully aquatic , with many adaptations for this lifestyle .
It grows up to 1.8 meters in length , though most individuals found today are considerably smaller .
The skin is dark brown , black or greenish in colour and irregularly blotched .
It is also rough , wrinkled and porous which facilitates respiration through the skin as this large amphibian lacks gills .
This species has an elongated body , and two pairs of legs which are roughly similar in size .
The snout is less rounded than that of the related Japanese giant salamander and the tail is a little longer and broader .
Both species have tubercles on the head and throat , though their arrangement is different .
The Chinese species has small , paired tubercles arranged in rows parallel with the lower jaw , while the Japanese species ' tubercles are mostly single and irregularly scattered .
The eyes are tiny , with no eyelids , and positioned on top of the broad , flat head , providing the salamander with poor vision .
Size Length : 1.8 metres , Weight 25 kg or Six feet long and 55 pounds .
Yes , that is a big for a salamander .
Hainan Pseudomoustache Toad
http://www.arkive.org/...
This little guy also gets no love .
Who cannot love a toad with a moustache ?
Fish
Bowmouth Guitarfish
http://www.arkive.org/...
Named for its distinctive mouth which undulates like a longbow , this deep - bodied guitarfish is unmistakable .
The species has a broad , rounded snout , a head that is distinctly demarcated from the pectoral fins , and a tail that is much longer than the body .
The dorsal fins are tall and shark - like , earning the species its alternative common name of sharkfin guitarfish , and heavy ridges of spiky , sharp thorns appear on the bony ridges on the head , used in defensive butting .
The most distinctive feature of this species is probably its unusual markings and colouration , although these usually become fainter in larger individuals .
The body is white below and blue - grey above , with white spots on the fins , body and tail , a large blue - edged , black spot above each pectoral fin , and dark bands between the eyes .
Juveniles are brown with partial ocelli ( eye - spots ) over the pectoral fins and black bars between the eyes .
The bowmouth guitarfish uses its heavily ridged teeth in undulating rows to crush crabs and shellfish .
Javanese Cownose Ray
http://www.arkive.org/...
Cownose rays ( Rhinoptera ) have earned their common name for their unusual - looking heads , which feature a double - lobed snout and indented forehead .
As with most rays , the body is flattened , with the pectoral fins broadly expanded and fused with the head and trunk to form a disc .
This smooth - skinned species is characterised by a kite - shaped body - disc , which is brown on the upper surface and white below .
The long , thin , whip - like tails of cownose rays ( Rhinoptera ) are distinctly demarcated from the body and armed with one or more stings .
Weedy Seadragon
http://www.arkive.org/...
Weedy seadragons are one of only two species of seadragons , the second is known as the leafy seadragon ( Phycodurus eques ) due to the greater number of leaf - like appendages along its body .
Seadragons resemble the seahorses to which they are related , having a bony - plated body and elongated snout ; their tails are not prehensile however .
Adult weedy seadragons are a reddish colour , with yellow and purple markings ; they have small leaf - like appendages that provide camouflage and a number of short spines for protection .
Males have narrower bodies and are darker than females .
Seadragons have a long dorsal fin along the back and small pectoral fins on either side of the neck , which provide balance .
Invertebrates
Dlinza Pinwheel
http://www.arkive.org/...
This exceptionally striking snail immediately stands out for the unusual whorl of bristles that radiate out from the edge of its shell , somewhat resembling the pinwheel firework after which it is named .
The fragile , almost translucent pale - brown shell is a spiral shape with up to five whorls , sculptured with widely spaced axial riblets .
Known only from Dlinza Forest , in the province of KwaZulu - Natal , South Africa , which covers an area of just c. 250 hectares .
Dracula ants
http://www.arkive.org/...
The recently discovered Dracula ant is a highly unusual species , so named because of its grisly feeding habits of drinking the blood of its young .
First described in 1994 , these ants did not attract much scientific attention until the discovery of an entire colony in 2001 .
The Dracula ant has since attracted widespread interest not only because of this curious behaviour , but also because of its seemingly ancestral morphology .
Unlike most ants , these orange coloured ants have abdomens that closely resemble those of wasps , from which ants are believed to have descended some 70 to 80 million years ago .
Thus , they have been described as a possible `missing link ' in ant evolution .
Winged males are a darker orange than the workers , the queen is yellow and the larvae are white .
Hungry Dracula ants scratch and chew holes into their larvae and suck out the hemolymph , the ant equivalent of blood .
This practice has been described as a form of `non- destructive cannibalism ' , since the larvae are not killed by it .
Nevertheless , when hungry workers enter the chamber , the larvae have been observed attempting to flee and escape their fate .
Plants
Flame Tree
http://www.arkive.org/...
The flame tree , also known as royal poinciana or flamboyant , is a member of the bean family ( Leguminosae ) and is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful tropical trees in the world .
This aptly named tree produces striking flame - like scarlet and yellow flowers in spring before the leaves emerge .
As the trees mature , they develop broad umbrella - shaped crowns , and are often planted for their shade - giving properties .
The delicate , fern - like leaves are composed of small individual leaflets , which fold up at the onset of dusk .
This tree produces brown , woody seed pods that reach lengths of up to 60 cm ; they turn reddish - brown to almost black when ripe .
Pride of Burma
http://www.arkive.org/...
This stunning tree is the only member of the genus Amherstia .
The extravagant flowers are seen hanging from the long inflorescence , or flower stalk , which is a bright crimson red at the end .
There are 5 petals although 2 of these are minute and the rest are of unequal size .
The petals are also crimson ; the two medium sized petals are yellow at the tip and the largest petal is broad and fan - shaped with a wavy upper margin and a yellow triangle of colour extending from the lip down into the flower .
This large petal may be 7.5 centimetres long and over 4 centimetres wide at the end .
There are either 9 or 10 stamens , 9 of which are partially fused into a pink sheath ; the stamens are of two differing lengths with the longer ones having larger anthers .
The compound leaves bear 6 - 8 large leaflets ; these are broadly oblong in shape and are a whitish colour underneath .
The fruits , or seedpods , are 11 to 20 centimetres long .
They are roughly scimitar - shaped and the woody outer case opens to disperse the seeds .
Fungi and Lichen
Erioderma Pedicellatum
http://www.arkive.org/...
This extremely rare lichen is slate - coloured and is curled and white at the edges .
It is a leafy , petal - shaped lichen that is seen growing on the bark of certain trees .
Lichens consist of two different organisms , a ' mycobiont ' ( a fungus ) and a ' phycobiont ' ( either an alga , which is a simple plant , or a cyanobacterium , a bacteria that can photosynthesise ) , which live together in a symbiotic association .
The phycobiont in boreal felt lichen is a cyanobacteria , and this lichen is likely to be extremely susceptible to atmospheric pollution .
We should try and save all our symbiotes .
Weather earthstar
http://www.arkive.org/...
Unlike other fungi , earthstars can move !
With a strong tendency to absorb and lose water , their outer layers uncurl when it rains .
The fruit body of the weather earthstar is onion - shaped when closed but , when expanded , the outer layers split into 6 - 10 `star - like ' rays that curve outwards .
The rays spread with enough force to push aside leaves , raising the inner spore - filled sac above surrounding debris .
The rays close when they dry and the sac lowers .
This species is pale brown with a whitish inner layer that , once exposed , eventually flakes off in patches .
Did you get that , this is a fungus that can move .
The weather earthstar is found in Britain and Europe , which I guess makes them the hipsters of fungi world .
With this type of diversity on Earth , would n't it be a good idea to check out the rain forests , before we cut them all down ?
Just imagine what we are losing .

Tech people appear hyped about their industry again SAN FRANCISCO 
Woo hoo !
Tech is back !
Kind of like Nixon in ' 68 .
Or an REO Speedwagon reunion tour .
Gives you a bit of an uneasy feeling .
The industry is still tingling from the loud and sweaty Bubble 2.0 — whoops , excuse me , Web 2.0 — conference here late last week .
The event is being heralded in the media as proof of a tech comeback five years after the dot - com collapse .
It 's almost like a return from exile .
Web 2.0 , a Silicon Valley gathering in its second year , certainly felt hot .
It had a couple of thousand attendees packed in like hens on a poultry farm .
It had parties with decibel levels I had n't experienced since a 1981 Ramones concert .
It had all - new buzzwords .
Remember " B2B " and " push technology " ?
Now , it 's " user - generated content " and " AJAX . "
Until last week , I thought AJAX was a cleaning fluid , or a Dutch soccer team .
But no — it 's an acronym for something you use to get money from venture capitalists
People who had been taking cover in bunkers for five years showed up .
Hey , there 's Joe Kraus !
He co-founded Internet search company Excite — since defunct — in the 1990s and is back with a new company called JotSpot .
Hey , there 's onetime analyst Henry Blodgett !
He was banned from Wall Street for hyping Web stocks and now writes a blog .
Everyone half - expected the Pets.com sock puppet to wander through , checking e-mail on its BlackBerry .
Morgan Stanley 's Mary Meeker gave a talk .
Remember her ?
Wall Street analyst to the dot - com stars ?
She powered through slide after slide of random " data points " : VoIP calls in Denmark exceed landline calls .
PayPal is bigger than American Express .
More e-mail in Japan is sent via mobile devices than via PCs .
U.S. Wi-Fi access points will pass 50,000 in 2005 .
What does this add up to ?
" We are in or are entering TWO cycles instead of one — broadband Internet and mobile , " Meeker tells the crowd .
Wow .
Not one bubble , but two at once !
So THAT'S what Web 2.0 means !
What 's not to love ?
This is n't to suggest that Internet stocks are hot again , because they 're not .
Or that Netscape - style IPOs are back , because they 're not .
OK , well , there was Google , but its stock is up because it will soon RULE THE WORLD .
And if a company is from China , which is still in Web 1.0 , it can play by Web 1.0 financial rules and have a huge IPO despite shaky business logic .
But otherwise here in Web 2.0 land , the only " exit strategy " for most entrepreneurs seems to be to get bought by eBay or Yahoo .
It 's either that or — ew ! — actually spend a decade building a viable company .
Still , people in the industry sound excited about technology again .
If only they could explain what they 're excited about .
Yes , it 's the second wave of the Internet .
But this concept of " Web 2.0 " seems to be like Pink Floyd lyrics :
It can mean different things to different people , depending on your state of mind .
Most concise definition at the conference : " What sucks now will suck less , " says Bran Ferren , co-chairman of R&D firm Applied Minds .
That is n't exactly the kind of pitch that jazzes investors .
At the conference , people tossed around all kinds of definitions of Web 2.0 .
It 's a more interactive Web , some say .
It 's the delivery of services over the Web , others chime in .
But from what I gather , the essence of Web 2.0 comes down to one word : WD - 40 .
Web 2.0 is a multipurpose lubricant !
It lets the different pieces of computing , software and the Web slide into one another and even blurs the distinction between users and websites .
So , stuff you once did only on your PC , such as write documents , can be done on the Web .
Stuff you used to do on one website at a time can now be done by mixing data from multiple sites , such as those Google Maps mash - ups .
And users can now become part of websites — adding photos , blogs , videos and knowledge .
That 's the idea behind user - generated content , and it drives sites such as Flickr , Wikipedia , GarageBand and MySpace .
AJAX is a big part of Web 2.0 .
The acronym stands for asynchronous JavaScript and XML .
It 's basically a way to make Web pages look and act as if they are running on your PC instead of coming in over the Internet .
Among venture capitalists , AJAX is hot stuff , like B2B ( aka business - to - business Web commerce ) in 1999 .
Just put it in your business plan , and venture capitalists will consider funding you .
A company called Zimbra generated tons of buzz at the conference , and it's based on AJAX .
Zimbra uses the Web to offer high - end corporate - style e-mail — doing for Microsoft Outlook users what Gmail did for consumer e-mail users .
Zimbra 's service blurs the definitions among individual PCs , corporate servers and the Web .
Which makes Zimbra a Web 2.0 company .
Plus , by offering corporate e-mail , the company is taking on Microsoft in a way no one dared a few years ago .
Which also makes Zimbra a Web 2.0 company .
Five or 10 years ago , these conferences revolved around Microsoft .
Attendees huddled to talk about what Microsoft was doing or might do .
Venture folks refused to even talk to companies that encroached on Microsoft 's space .
Everyone breathlessly watched speeches by Microsoft executives .
Now that happens when Google is on stage , but not Microsoft .
At this conference , a handful of Microsoft execs sat on stage for a panel discussion after dinner .
The vast room of attendees started talking with each other , laughing among themselves and generally behaving like high schoolers when they have a substitute teacher .
Apparently , in Web 2.0 , Microsoft is no longer the law .
Of course , that 's what Netscape thought in Web 1.0 .

Police have released a CCTV image of the suspect
British Transport Police have released CCTV images of the man , who has struck on at least 30 trains since August .
He waits until he is alone before committing the offence , smearing excrement inside carriages .
" This is a serious public health issue as well as being exceptionally anti-social - we need to locate this man , " said Det Con Donna Fox .
She said his offences had resulted in many carriages being taken out of service , causing disruption and cancellations and serious inconvenience to the travelling public .
Different times
There was also £ 60,000 in damage and cleaning costs .
" There is no particular pattern as to when he appears , " said Ms Fox .
" He travels to various areas and at different times of the day and different days of the week .
" We have been trawling through CCTV images to try and track the man and remain hopeful that members of the public may know him and where he lives .
" On at least one occasion CCTV footage shows the man being disturbed by a passenger walking through a train .
" If anyone sees this man travelling on the railway network they should not approach him , but call the police or alert train staff immediately . "

The last Calvin and Hobbes strip
It has been published in the Washington Post on December the 31st 1995 .
It 's sad to say it , but Watterson retired ...
But the last strip is full of optimism and let a possibility to restart the cartoon ...
American homeowners wondering what follows a housing bubble can look to China ’s largest city .
Once one of the hottest markets in the world , sales of homes have virtually halted in some areas of Shanghai , prompting developers to slash prices and real estate brokerages to shutter thousands of offices .
For the first time , homeowners here are learning what it means to have an upside - down mortgage -- when the value of a home falls below the amount of debt on the property .
Recent home buyers are suing to get their money back .
Banks are fretting about a wave of default loans .
“ The entire industry is scaling back , ” said Mu Wijie , a regional manager at Century 21 China , who estimated that 3,000 brokerage offices had closed since spring .
Real estate agents , whose phones would n’t stop ringing a year ago , say their incomes have plunged by two - thirds .
Advertisement
Shanghai ’s housing slump is only going to worsen and imperil a significant part of the Chinese economy , says Andy Xie , Morgan Stanley ’s chief Asia economist in Hong Kong .
Although the city ’s 20 million residents represent less than 2 % of China ’s population of 1.3 billion , Xie says , Shanghai accounts for an astounding 20 % of the country ’s property value .
About 1 million homes in Shanghai alone -- about half the number of housing starts for the entire United States in 2004 -- are under construction .
“ They ’ll remain empty for years , ” Xie said , adding that a jolting comedown also was in store for other Chinese cities with building booms -- including Beijing , Chongqing and Chengdu -- though other analysts say the problem is largely confined to Shanghai .
Shanghai ’s housing bust comes after a doubling of prices in the previous three years , a run-up fueled by massive speculation .
With China ’s economy booming and Shanghai at the center of worldwide attention , investors from Hong Kong , Taiwan and elsewhere were buying as fast as buildings were going up .
At least 30 % to 40 % of homes sold were bought by speculators , says Zhang Zhijie , a real estate analyst at Soufun.com Academy , a research group in Shanghai .
Advertisement
“ Ordinary people had no option but to follow the trend , ” Zhang said .
“ Worrying that prices would be even more unaffordable tomorrow , many of them borrowed from relatives and banks to buy as soon as possible . ”
The Shanghai government only pushed the market higher , he added .
“ Many of the officials said Shanghai ’s property market was healthy and would n’t drop before the World Expo ” in 2010 .
For Wang Suxian , the tale of two lines illustrates how the bubble has burst .
When home prices were at the tail end of the boom in March , Wang hired two migrant workers to stand in line for a chance to buy units in what the developer said was modeled after an apartment community on New York ’s Park Avenue .
Advertisement
The workers waited 72 hours , including cold nights , but the 35 - year - old was thrilled to come away with two apartments , one for $ 110,000 , about the average price for a new home in Shanghai , and another for $ 170,000 .
They were among Wang ’s four investment properties .
And for a short period , Wang believed she was raking in hundreds of dollars a day for doing nothing , as property prices in the city kept soaring .
But today , prices at the complex have fallen by a third , and the lines of frenzied buyers are gone .
Wang is among dozens who are fighting the developer to take the apartments back .
On a recent frosty morning , she stood in a line herself with about 40 other buyers outside the builder ’s headquarters , demanding that it negotiate a deal to return their money .
“ This is ridiculous , ” Wang huffed .
Advertisement
The company , Da Hua Group , invited Wang and other homeowners inside , served them hot tea , then told them to forget it .
“ I think it ’ll take at least three years before the property market becomes healthy again , ” said Zhu Delin , a finance professor at Shanghai University and former head of the Shanghai Banking Assn .
The typical home being built is in a high - rise complex , with two bedrooms and about 850 square feet of living space .
Developers say many of Shanghai ’s homes are valued at about $ 70,000 or less , and price drops have n’t been as steep for those units .
Advertisement
Some still see promise in the Shanghai market .
Incomes are rising and droves of people are relocating from the inner city to outlying areas , said Richard David , managing director at Macquarie Property Investment Banking China in Shanghai .
What ’s more , he says , the Shanghai government -- which owns all the land -- has auctioned off few lots in the last two years , which will limit the number of housing units in the future .
But that ’s little solace for homeowners who have seen inventories rise even as buyers show no hurry to come back into the market .
In Shanghai , people blame the popping of the housing bubble on the central government , which has applied one measure after another in the last year to quash excessive speculation and price increases .
Advertisement
Banks were ordered to raise their best rate on home loans to 5.5 % from 5 % .
Home buyers were required to make down payments of at least 30 % , up from 20 % .
A 5.5 % capital gains tax on home sellers ’ profits was imposed .
Beijing also levied a 5 % tax on the sale price of homes sold before two years of ownership .
“ It ’s killed the speculators , ” said David Pitcher , a Shanghai developer and former head of CB Richard Ellis ’ office here .
Before the market swooned , buses would bring investors from the southeastern coastal city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province on home - buying missions here .
They no longer come .
Wang , the woman battling Da Hua , is one of tens of thousands of Shanghai home buyers from Wenzhou , known for its wealth and business prowess .
Advertisement
But it ’s not just speculators who have bailed out of the market .
A lot of potential Shanghai buyers have been scared off by numerous reports of sinking home prices and desperate action by some owners .
Internet chat rooms recently were abuzz with a story that a Taiwanese man had jumped from the 33rd floor of an apartment tower about 15 miles northeast of downtown .
Many people suspect that he killed himself because he was drowning in debt after his home investments went sour .
Managers at the complex refused to comment , but brokers indicated that the price of some units there have plummeted by more than 50 % since March , when a home fetched as much as $ 250 a square foot , similar to housing prices in some Southern California communities .
Zhang Wei , an editor at Imagine China , a photography agency in Shanghai , was close to buying an apartment in the new Pudong development area last year .
Advertisement
The 25 - year - old planned to use his $ 1,250 in savings , and his parents -- a policeman and a doctor -- agreed to contribute about $ 30,000 .
The family of three currently lives in a 550 - square - foot apartment in an industrial district that was provided by his father ’s employer , the Police Bureau .
Zhang walked away from the deal after the central government stepped up its campaign to cool Shanghai ’s market .
He noticed prices beginning to drop .
“ When two of the four real estate agencies near our home finally closed , I decided not to buy for at least two years , ” he said .
“ Even a 1 % drop in prices is a lot of money for us . ”
For Shanghai , prolonged weakness in the housing market could be very painful .
Like Los Angeles , Shanghai relies heavily on real estate to drive its economy .
Morgan Stanley ’s Xie calculates that property sales directly accounted for about half of $ 31 billion of the growth in Shanghai ’s annual economic output from 2001 to 2004 .
Construction cranes still fill the skyline of Shanghai , an area of about 2,200 square miles -- a little more than half the size of Los Angeles County .
But there ’s sparse development in the center of the city , where strong sales of high - end homes and luxury office suites , in large part by foreigners , belie the losses around it .

Shanghai ’s government is relocating inner-city residents to new suburban areas , where entire towns are going up as part of a plan to build distinct industries that ring the city .
It ’s unclear how many of these new homes are sitting empty .
Sales and inventory figures are n’t provided by the government .
But analysts say they can see the surplus of housing when they drive past housing complexes and there are few lights on at night .
Few analysts are betting on a quick turnaround .
Yin Zhongli , an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing , says a housing crash takes time to clean up .
He worries that the financial sector will be crippled by the real estate fallout .
Last year , he said , 76 % of all bank loans in Shanghai were in real estate .
“ Now is the time to swallow a bitter pill , ” Yin said .

That ’s what Huang Xiaolei is doing .
The 25 - year - old Shanghai native nabbed a 1,700 - square - foot apartment from Da Hua during the heady times last spring .
The unit would n’t be completed until the end of the year , but as is customary in China , Huang had to secure a loan and make the down payment right away .
She and her parents pooled their life savings of about $ 80,000 and put 30 % down on the $ 270,000 home .
In April , they began making monthly mortgage payments of $ 1,100 on a 30 - year loan with a 5.5 % interest rate .
In November , Huang decided to stop the monthly payment , and this month she filed a lawsuit against Da Hua , claiming her contract allowed her to rescind the purchase before the house was completed under special circumstances , with a 3 % fee .
“ We have over 40 cases like this at our firm , ” said Du Yuping , Huang ’s lawyer .

Huang regrets that she got caught up in the frenzied market , and says that even if she wins the lawsuit , she ’ll suffer a hard financial loss .
“ I was cheated , ” she said .
So we have our Xbox 360 HD DVD plugged into our system with the Toshiba HD DVD / UFS 2.5 file system drivers going on , and are able to read the directory contents ( drive G : ) .
We pulled the TRAILER .EVO file down and named it encrypted_TRAILER .EVO .
We then ran BackupHDDVD on the disc ( Full Metal Jacket ) .
We quit after we hit TRAILER .EVO , since that 's what we wanted to compare against .
We then ran a binary compare against the two .
You'd think an unencrypted movie file would have more than just a few hex offsets changed by the unencryption process , but we have n't yet been able to test playing back the files , namely because WinDVD and PowerDVD both totally blow as demos .

Scarborough has made a definite turn - around on Bush over the past year , but it has n't been as evident as it was on Wednesday 's Scarborough Country .
Joe appears to be totally fed up with the non-stop spin and ignorance coming from the White House and Bush 's press conference apparently put the final nail in that coffin .
While discussing Bush 's possible plan of increasing troop levels , regardless of what the generals say , Scarborough even mentioned how there would be impeachment talk if Clinton was President and saying he would ignore our top military commanders .

Mike Barnicle was also on fire during this segment .
He feels that Bush is delusional and going to place more lives in danger .
I must say that I also feel the same way .
SCARBOROUGH : Well , this is uncharted territory .
And Josh Green , I want you , if you will , to imagine , how would Republicans have responded if President Bill Clinton had ignored the advice of all of his Joint Chiefs , his top general in the war zone , his former secretary of state , and 80 percent of Americans ?
Is it not a stretch to say that many Republicans would have considered impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton if this situation were identical ?

OSH GREEN , “ THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY ” : I think they would have launched a coupe .
It probably would have been — probably would have been centered at Fox News .
They ‘d be going crazy , the way , you know , frankly , quite a few of them are beginning to get with Bush .
You know , we heard yesterday for the first time , you know , at least an admission on Bush ‘s part that this line about how we ‘re winning the war in Iraq is no longer operative .
And he admitted to “ The Washington Post ” yesterday that while they ‘re not winning the war , they ‘re not losing .
So at least he ‘s come a small step down the road toward being where everybody else is , you know , most importantly his top generals .
SCARBOROUGH : Well , Mike Barnicle , as you know , I supported this war and I supported this man twice for president , and yet I ‘m growing more disturbed every night by how isolated George W. Bush has become .
All the Joint Chiefs oppose his plan for Iraq .
His lead general opposes his plan in Iraq , and now he ‘s going to quit because Bush has ignored him .
Colin Powell opposes his plan in Iraq .
And an “ L.A. Times ” poll is showing that only 12 percent of Americans support his plan for more troops in Iraq .
Should n‘t more Americans be disturbed at this unprecedented example of a White House that ‘s in — and you can only call it this — a bunker mentality ?
MIKE BARNICLE , MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR :
Well , I think , Joe , that more Americans ought to be truly depressed by what they saw today on TV , the latest press conference .
We have a president of the United States who is isolated .
He ‘s delusional .
He is stubborn .
He has had one intervention that clearly did n‘t work , the Baker - Hamilton report .
He is clearly in need of another intervention .
You do n‘t have to be von Clausewitz to figure out that urban warfare in the city of Baghdad , comparably the size of New York City , a tremendously hostile environment now , will become even more hostile with the introduction of more American troops .
It will do very little , if nothing , to lessen the level of violence in Baghdad .
The only ...
SCARBOROUGH :
And you ‘re just going more — you ‘re only going to get more American kids killed ...
( CROSSTALK )
BARNICLE : You ‘re going to get more Americans both killed and captured .
And the only services that we will have ended up improving in Baghdad are funeral services .
SCARBOROUGH : No doubt .
And Mike , I want you — once again , I want to put this “ L.A. Times ” poll up again just briefly .
Look at these numbers again .
Only 12 percent of Americans support this president ‘s plan to send more troops to Iraq .
His Joint Chiefs all oppose him .
General Abizaid opposes him .
Mike , let me ask you , historically , has a president ever been so alone in his determination to fight a war , even when his generals and the American public oppose it ?
I mean , there ‘s not a more significant decision a president makes than war .
BARNICLE : You know , the last ...
SCARBOROUGH : Have you ever known of any president being this alone ?
BARNICLE : No .
The last great — the most recent epic that this country has been through , a cultural and social epic that shattered the country , Vietnam , the president of the United States , Lyndon Johnson , as obstinate as he was for as long as he was , going down to the White House Situation Room , monitoring bombing runs , both strategic and tactical bombing runs over North Vietnam and South Vietnam , at least finally , at the end , toward the end , he listened to Clark Clifford and withdrew , withdrew himself from the presidency , a noble gesture in retrospect .
This president — this is dangerously close to a delusion that is going to result in death and carnage for years to come in the Middle East , too many Americans and too many people in the Middle East .
SCARBOROUGH :
And you talk about LBJ , but as Pat Buchanan told us last night , at no time was Richard Nixon or LBJ ever so isolated .
You know , Nixon , at least , even to the end , had 30 , 40 percent of the country supporting him on Vietnam , had his generals supporting him , only one or two dissenters there .
Michael Crowley , I want us to do a little exercise here .
I want you to take a look at what President Bush used to say about military advice and what he ‘s telling us now .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BUSH : I will continue to be guided by the advice that matters , the sober judgment of our military leaders .
QUESTION : Would you overrule your military commanders if they felt it was not a good idea ?
BUSH : That ‘s a dangerous hypothetical question .
If they want more troops , they get more troops !
If they want less troops , they get less troops !
They are bright , capable , smart people whose opinion matters to me a lot .
Absolutely , we ‘re winning .
People now understand the stakes .
We ‘re winning , and we will win !
QUESTION : Why did you drop your confident assertion about winning ?
BUSH : We ‘re not succeeding nearly as fast as I wanted .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
SCARBOROUGH : Michael , it ‘s stunning , is n‘t it ?
I mean , talking about the advice that he would follow , and now he ‘s just — just passing it by because they disagree with him .
CROWLEY : Yes .
And Joe , you know , one point I ‘d like to add .
I ‘m glad you reminded me with that flashback .
At the time when he said , I was taking advice from the troops and they set the lead , I think we now see evidence that — he was taking advice from the commanders — that people on the ground in Iraq were saying months ago , Send us more troops , we do n‘t have enough guys .
And in public , he was saying , No , no , no , we do n‘t need it , they ‘re not asking for it .
But I think we ‘re seeing evidence that they were actually asking for it .
And so he ‘s been doing this exactly backwards .
At a time when they did need more troops , he was n‘t giving them .
And now they ‘re saying it ‘s too late , the window is closed , we do n‘t need them , we do n‘t want them , he ‘s going to force them on them .
And there is just something very alarming about this .
I mean ...
SCARBOROUGH : Well , Michael Crowley , that ‘s what ‘s so fascinating about it .
We showed you those clips .
We could have gone back to February of 2003 , before this war began .
Military leaders that claimed we needed more troops over there were mocked and ridiculed .
People that said it was going to cost more , mocked and ridiculed by the president , by Dick Cheney , by Don Rumsfeld .
So you ‘re exactly right .
When our military men and women needed more troops , this administration did n‘t give it to them , and now that they ‘re saying it ‘s too late , do n‘t send the troops , they ‘re ignoring them again .
CROWLEY : Yes .
I mean , you know , it ‘s — now he finally comes around , but it ‘s too late .
And look , unfortunately , it ‘s a tragedy of this administration , but they ‘re just — you get the feeling that the guy lives in a little bit of a bubble .
He ‘s too slow to realize the realities on the ground .
He buys into his own rhetoric , which is just too idealistic and too out of touch with what ‘s happening , and he ‘s just too slow to respond .
So now he ‘s finally coming around , and it ‘s too late .
And it ‘s very sad .
And again , there ‘s just something unnerving .
I did n‘t like his answer to that question about it being a “ dangerous hypothetical , ” that we were treading into dangerous territory .
It ‘s just a very sensitive , scary subject when you start talking about the commander - in - chief and the generals being in conflict .
And I have to say , it kind of gives me the heebee - jeebees .
SCARBOROUGH : And Again , I think you ‘re being — I think you ‘re being very cautious in the language you ‘re using .
I think this is very frightening , again , and I ‘m speaking as a guy who supported this war from the very beginning and supported this president twice .
Josh Green what do you make , though , of the president finally saying we ‘re not winning in Iraq ?
GREEN : Well , you know , I think it ‘s the rare concession to reality .
I mean , you know , Bush has been so out of touch for so long .
You know , and the important thing in the comparison with Lyndon Johnson is that Bush is n‘t accountable to voters anymore .
He ‘s not going to run for reelection in two years from now , so he really does n‘t have to listen to anybody and has n‘t been listening to anybody .
And I think that part of this concession that we ‘re not winning the war in Iraq is simply admitting the obvious and trying to stanch the tide a little bit of criticism that he ‘s getting for being out of touch , for you know , insisting as recently as a month or two ago that we ‘re winning the war .
And I think what he ‘s doing here is trying to tamp down the alarm a little bit and figure out some way to move forward .
SCARBOROUGH : Mike Barnicle , do you take any comfort from the president finally admitting we ‘re not winning in Iraq , or are you disturbed that it took him so long ?
BARNICLE : Joe , I do n‘t think he knows what he ‘s saying .
I do n‘t think he comprehends what he ‘s saying .
I do n‘t think ...
SCARBOROUGH :
You really think he is delusional ?
BARNICLE : I do .
I do n‘t think he could explain to us tonight what he meant by what he said today .
At one point , he said we ‘re not winning , but at another point , he said , you know , we ‘re going to win a victory there .
He can‘t define victory .
The deaths in this war right now , at this stage in our life , our political life , our national life , and especially if there ‘s a surge in troops in Baghdad — the deaths of American soldiers verges now on the criminal .
And I do n‘t think that ‘s too strong a statement .
It verges on the criminal .
There ‘s no plan .
There ‘s only this poppycock that you get from the president of the United States , who says one thing one moment , another thing the next moment , and he can‘t figure out what he is saying .
SCARBOROUGH :
So what ‘s going on there , Mike ?
BARNICLE : What is going on there ?
I think you have a president totally isolated from reality , totally delusional , kind of paranoid , figuring that everyone ‘s against him , including his own Joint Chiefs of Staff , figuring that history 30 , 40 years from now is going to prove him correct .
And he ‘s going to have to weather this storm in the interim .
He ‘s going to have to take the abuse , look at the polls plummeting down to 5 and 4 percent .
He ‘s going to have to live and endure the casualties , which clearly affect him .
Clearly affect him .
That ‘s the humanizing aspect of George Bush today .
But I think he ‘s intent on riding out this storm , thinking that somewhere down the road , Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , 30 or 40 years from now , that that version of Arthur Schlesinger will say he saw it correctly when nobody else did .
SCARBOROUGH : But Mike Barnicle , thought , again , here we are .
This is a critical question for us to ask .
What can the Democrats do ?
What can Republicans do ?
The guy is at 12 percent — listen , this is what scares about the situation .
You ‘ve got a president whose legacy is obviously wrapped around Iraq .
So he has an interest in seeing this — playing this card — playing this hand out until the very bitter end , come hell or high water , while the rest of us are n‘t as invested in it and we can say it ‘s not working .
So what do we do ?
What do Republicans do ?
What do Democrats do ?
BARNICLE : I think one of the things that people in Congress on both sides of the aisle , Republican and Democrat — Michael Crowley alluded to this in terms of troop levels .
This president and this Joint Chiefs of Staff were asked to increase troop levels years ago , months ago , from the inception of the war in Iraq — which is no longer the war on terror , it ‘s just a miserable civil war .
This is not the war on terror in Iraq .
We can have Foreign Relations Committee hearings by Joe Biden , find out exactly who wanted the troops and when they wanted them .
And if any commander who has been in Iraq or is in Iraq right now says that he does not need any more troops , there , I would submit , is a commander who needs to be relieved of command .
How to Create a Strong Password
A strong password should meet all three of these criteria :
Over eight characters
Combines letters , numbers and symbols
Easy for you to remember , but difficult for others to guess
Choose a Long Phrase
Ask not what your country can do for you ...
To be or not to be , that is the question
We have nothing to fear but fear itself
Make all ( or some ) of the following substitutions
For the word " are " , use " r "
For the word " be " , use " b "
For the word " for " , use 4
For the word " nothing " , use 0 ( zero )
For the word " to " , use 2
For the word " you " use " u "
For the word " we " , use " v "
For any numbers , type the number
If permitted , use " & " for and , or " @ " for at .
Make changes and pick the first letter of every word
" Ask not what your country can do for you " becomes : AnWyCcd4U
" To be or not to be , that is the question " becomes : 2bOn2BtItQ
" We have nothing to fear but fear itself " : Vh02FbFi
Tips and Tricks
Choose one long password for all sites :
The best security would be to use a different long password at each site ;
but that 's nearly impossible to do .
This is the second best solution .

Fullmetal Asynchronous
A very small part of this code was " serious work " , for establishing a bridge between a Java server and a Python client ; however , the actual protocol being spoken was not AMP , I merely needed to decode some AMP data in Java .
The rest of it was written over the weekend on a lark , and to see how much Java I remembered from the days of my youth , to see what it 's like to write a Java application these days .
It may seem pretty odd that I 'm doing hacking in Java for fun , especially after being a
AMP , the Asynchronous Messaging Protocol , is a new protocol that will be first released in the upcoming Twisted version 2.5 .
The idea behind AMP is fairly simple .
In some ways , it 's the same idea behind XML - RPC .
The gist of the idea behind XML - RPC is that there are a large variety of applications which have need of a protocol library with some properties : extremely simple - a simple protocol means you need to think about what you expose , which means compact , easy - to - understand interfaces .
language neutral - the protocol should have a reasonable set of data types , but not be tied to any specific programming language , to gather the widest possible adoption ( and thereby provide the greatest value to implementors , as there will be more services they can access )
easy to deploy - you do n't need to allocate a new server , you can just drop new XML - RPC responders in by creating a new file in most cases
These properties , it turns out , are amazingly useful for a huge class of applications , and XML - RPC services have cropped up all over the place .
Twisted 's main audience is often substantially different from the originally target audience of XML - RPC .
Although superficially both are building network services , traditional network services are well - served by ... well , traditional infrastructure , like Apache , MySQL and the plethora of web frameworks available to Python , Perl , PHP , Ruby , Lisp , and so on .
Applications that are quirky , hard to classify , and have a bit of a " twist " need Twisted ( no pun intended -- okay maybe a little ) .
In fact , much as I wish it were not so , " normal " applications will often hit roadblocks in Twisted where they wo n't on other platforms , because so much more effort has been spent on edge cases and behavior in exceptional situations than a smooth transition for " average " usage .
Although , for the reasons given above , Twisted applications defy genre to some extent , they do have a few features in common .
They are network applications , after all .
Many are message - routing or custom control panel applications , which require a two - way monitoring , streaming , or control protocol .
bit - for - bit correct - you can send chunks of data without error - prone encoding or escaping them in a format like base64 .
Typical applications exchange small chunks of text - based data .
Many Twisted applications are exchanging media chunks or encrypted packets , where a botched newline conversion or mismatched codec is a catastrophic failure rather than an intermittent annoyance .
Anyone who has used an XML library in the real world can attest to the difficulty of getting this right .
two - way - in many cases , notifications need to be generated and pushed down an active connection , rather than the request / response model offered by XMLRPC .
In principle , of course , this is possible with an HTTP - based protocol as well as with a connection - oriented one , but in practice the presence of NATs and firewalls will prevent incoming connections in many situations where outgoing connections are easy .
asynchronicity - the ability to send and receive messages while outstanding requests are pending .
The nature of Twisted 's event loop is , of course , suited to this , but not all protocols provide this .
IMAP4 , for example , has several states where the client must implicitly synchronize with the server and halt sending further requests until all of its outstanding requests have been answered , regardless of whether it 's possible to send those messages programmatically or not .
( This is why I had to write a Reactor and a Deferred for Java - it 's very hard to get real two - way communication going when you have to manage large groups of threads . )
For quite a while now , PB , or " Perspective Broker " has been providing Twisted users with the latter triad of properties , and more .
PB has lots of fun features : distributed garbage collection , string table compression , a pluggable object marshalling framework , dynamic proxies , authentication support , and remote error reporting .
In case that buzzword stew did n't clue you in , PB does n't exactly have the " extremely simple " property .
Unfortunately , nor is it language neutral in a practical way .
There are Emacs Lisp , Scheme , and Java implementations of the protocol 's encoding , and it was possible to write cross-language applications , but in practice it is prohibitively difficult to declare or replicate all the implicit nuances of Python objects serialized via PB .
As an example , most Python objects are dictionaries , and the PB protocol reflects this - it is possible to have an object 's state be a dictionary that refers to itself .
That configuration is an impossibility in most languages .
In some ways , this is a strength ; you can simply assemble your objects and ship them over the network , which saves a lot of time during development , especially in protocols which need to communicate about a wide variety of different types .
In short , PB is great for the applications where you need it .
It works especially well for prototyping games , and could probably be optimized into an awesome protocol even in production , and it can serve in the cases where you do n't really need all of its power .
However , over years of working with PB and discussing it with others who use Twisted , I 've discovered that there are many applications that need a protocol with both the first , and the second set of properties .
There 's nothing inherent about wanting to send asynchronous notifications which requires exact , implicit over - the - wire copying of any type of object .
It seems to me that there 's a fairly widespread need - at least widespread among Twisted users - for a protocol that falls somewhere between PB 's incredible power and XML - RPC 's militant simplicity .
AMP is an attempt to build that protocol .
It is a simple protocol that bridges both sets of requirements .
It has some features of PB .
Messages are tagged with request / response headers , so that you can easily encapsulate one into a Deferred .
It has some features of XML - RPC .
Only a few , very simple parameter types are described in the protocol itself , and there 's an extremely simple low - level encoding ( far simpler than XML ) so that you do n't have to implement very much at all to get something useful .
A mediocre programmer like yours truly can implement AMP in an hour or two in a language that they are familiar with .
It was designed to be language neutral - and this brings me back to the Java implementation - I think that the Java implementation is a good proof of concept that an AMP protocol can be equally idiomatic in non-Python languages .
In Python , this is what defining and sending a command to increase the volume on a media player might look like :
class IncreaseVolume :
commandName = ' IncreaseVolume '
arguments = [ ( ' howMuch ' , Integer ( ) ]
response = [ ( ' currentVolume ' , Integer ( ) ) ]
# ...
D = ampInstance.callRemote( IncreaseVolume , howMuch=4 )
def showVol ( result ) :
print ' Current volume : ' , result [ ' currentVolume ' ]
D.addCallback(showVol )
in Java , this is a bit more verbose , but I do n't feel that Java is a second - class citizen in AMPtown , merely that the language itself is more verbose :
class IncreaseVolume {
class Arguments { public int howMuch ; }
class Response { public int currentVolume ; }
}
// ...
IncreaseVolume . Arguments ae = new IncreaseVolume .
Arguments ( ) ;
ae.howMuch = 7 ;
ampInstance.callRemote ( " IncreaseVolume " , ae , new IncreaseVolume .
Response ( ) )
.addCallback(new Deferred.Callback ( Object response ) {
System.out.println ( " Current volume : " +
(( IncreaseVolume . Response ) response).currentVolume ) ;
} ) ;
I hope that in the coming year , AMP will enable a new generation of networked applications .
I know that Divmod will be using it for a few .
It 's dead simple to write a custom chat protocol with it .
For example , a whiteboarding application which wanted to mix user text messages with application control messages .
Other two - way , asynchronous applications include custom GUIs that update when data is changed , lightweight notification of " push " software or RSS - feed updates , and monitoring software that aggregates and reports on the status of large numbers of devices in real time .
It 's as hard to give a complete survey of the list of possible AMP applications as it would be to give a complete list of possible socket applications , and I 'm sure that the really interesting ones are the ones that have n't occurred to me yet .
In the nearer term , the code that spawned this post can be used for a lightweight bridge between Java and Python applications which need to exchange a small set of messages .
The few initial users who are looking at this will probably be using it in a configuration where a Java application needs a feature from Twisted which is not very well supported in Java - land .
Virtualizable IMAP4 server support is one such example , but there are others .
Rather than try to convince an SVN snapshot of Jython to run Twisted 's mainloop , you can run the IMAP4 code in a subprocess from Java and communicate with it over a socket , exchanging only the necessary messages .
Since there 's a reactor in Java as well as one in Python , the code looks fairly similar at both ends of the wire and the impedance mismatch is minimized .
The java reactor can happily run in a thread , and need not interfere with existing Java code .
The same is true if you need to make use of a Java library from a Twisted application .
As more AMP implementations are done , these kinds of integrations can be used for multi-language plugin systems .
Rather than defining a thick API and loading various scripting systems as shared libraries , your application can define a simple AMP protocol and run subprocesses which are expected to speak it .
I believe that would substantially reduce the complexity of most application - scripting systems that want to support multiple languages .
That would also let you turn an existing Python scriptability system into one which could connect to an arbitrary language , by spawning that process from python code .
Finally , AMP in more languages means a way to spread the asynchronous Twisted gospel beyond the confines of the Python implementation itself .
Python is great , but there are a lot of programmers out there writing a lot of code in a lot of other languages .
I think that all of it could be improved by moving away from bundles of threads and back towards a simple , unified , event - driven model .
Last week I checked in a branch which implements the kernel of Twisted in Java , including the core and TCP server portions of the reactor API and an AMP IProtocol implementation .
A very small part of this code was " serious work " , for establishing a bridge between a Java server and a Python client ; however , the actual protocol being spoken was not AMP , I merely needed to decode some AMP data in Java .
The rest of it was written over the weekend on a lark , and to see how much Java I remembered from the days of my youth , to see what it 's like to write a Java application these days .
It may seem pretty odd that I 'm doing hacking in Java for fun , especially after being a semiprofessional java - hater some years ago .
Although I must concede that Java has made some strides in the last few years , my pythonista fans need not worry .
I still find Java far more tedious to write than Python , and the development process more cumbersome .
I 'm not doing this work because I want to switch , but rather , because I want to give AMP some cross-language street cred .
AMP , the Asynchronous Messaging Protocol , is a new protocol that will be first released in the upcoming Twisted version 2.5 .

There are Emacs Lisp , Scheme , and Java implementations of the protocol 's encoding , and it was possible to write cross-language applications , but in practice it is prohibitively difficult to declare or replicate all the implicit nuances of Python objects serialized via PB .
As an example , most Python objects are dictionaries , and the PB protocol reflects this - it is possible to have an object 's state be a dictionary that refers to itself .
That configuration is an impossibility in most languages .
In some ways , this is a strength ; you can simply assemble your objects and ship them over the network , which saves a lot of time during development , especially in protocols which need to communicate about a wide variety of different types .
In short , PB is great for the applications where you need it .
It works especially well for prototyping games , and could probably be optimized into an awesome protocol even in production , and it can serve in the cases where you do n't really need all of its power .
However , over years of working with PB and discussing it with others who use Twisted , I 've discovered that there are many applications that need a protocol with both the first , and the second set of properties .
There 's nothing inherent about wanting to send asynchronous notifications which requires exact , implicit over - the - wire copying of any type of object .
It seems to me that there 's a fairly widespread need - at least widespread among Twisted users - for a protocol that falls somewhere between PB 's incredible power and XML - RPC 's militant simplicity .
AMP is an attempt to build that protocol .
It is a simple protocol that bridges both sets of requirements .
It has some features of PB .
Messages are tagged with request / response headers , so that you can easily encapsulate one into a Deferred .
It has some features of XML - RPC .
Only a few , very simple parameter types are described in the protocol itself , and there 's an extremely simple low - level encoding ( far simpler than XML ) so that you do n't have to implement very much at all to get something useful .
A mediocre programmer like yours truly can implement AMP in an hour or two in a language that they are familiar with .
It was designed to be language neutral - and this brings me back to the Java implementation - I think that the Java implementation is a good proof of concept that an AMP protocol can be equally idiomatic in non-Python languages .
In Python , this is what defining and sending a command to increase the volume on a media player might look like : in Java , this is a bit more verbose , but I do n't feel that Java is a second - class citizen in AMPtown , merely that the language itself is more verbose : I hope that in the coming year , AMP will enable a new generation of networked applications .
I know that Divmod will be using it for a few .
It 's dead simple to write a custom chat protocol with it .
For example , a whiteboarding application which wanted to mix user text messages with application control messages .
Other two - way , asynchronous applications include custom GUIs that update when data is changed , lightweight notification of " push " software or RSS - feed updates , and monitoring software that aggregates and reports on the status of large numbers of devices in real time .
It 's as hard to give a complete survey of the list of possible AMP applications as it would be to give a complete list of possible socket applications , and I 'm sure that the really interesting ones are the ones that have n't occurred to me yet .
In the nearer term , the code that spawned this post can be used for a lightweight bridge between Java and Python applications which need to exchange a small set of messages .
The few initial users who are looking at this will probably be using it in a configuration where a Java application needs a feature from Twisted which is not very well supported in Java - land .
Virtualizable IMAP4 server support is one such example , but there are others .
Rather than try to convince an SVN snapshot of Jython to run Twisted 's mainloop , you can run the IMAP4 code in a subprocess from Java and communicate with it over a socket , exchanging only the necessary messages .
Since there 's a reactor in Java as well as one in Python , the code looks fairly similar at both ends of the wire and the impedance mismatch is minimized .
The java reactor can happily run in a thread , and need not interfere with existing Java code .
The same is true if you need to make use of a Java library from a Twisted application .
As more AMP implementations are done , these kinds of integrations can be used for multi-language plugin systems .
Rather than defining a thick API and loading various scripting systems as shared libraries , your application can define a simple AMP protocol and run subprocesses which are expected to speak it .
I believe that would substantially reduce the complexity of most application - scripting systems that want to support multiple languages .
That would also let you turn an existing Python scriptability system into one which could connect to an arbitrary language , by spawning that process from python code .
Finally , AMP in more languages means a way to spread the asynchronous Twisted gospel beyond the confines of the Python implementation itself .
Python is great , but there are a lot of programmers out there writing a lot of code in a lot of other languages .
I think that all of it could be improved by moving away from bundles of threads and back towards a simple , unified , event - driven model .

Interesting I can definitely see a use for this .
I 've been fishing for something better than XML - RPC but not as er , awkward to use as SOAP for my python <-> . net interop .
Hmm , there 's a thought , I should really look at writing a C# implementation .
Out of curiosity , did you look at BEEP when you were writing this ?
There seem to be a lot of similarities .
From : glyf Date : September 21st , 2006 02:57 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) C# implementation Yes !
The point of this post was really to get other implementors interested and excited about the protocol .
I do n't have the time or inclination to do anything with C# in the forseeable future , so if you have a use - case for it , the contribution of an implementation would be much appreciated !
There have been a few abortive attempts to port Twisted concepts to C# , but nothing useful yet .
I spent a while trying to think of something that was not mean to say about BEEP , because I do not like it very much at all .
So here is the nicest thing I can say about it : BEEP is a protocol for transporting XML .
Part of the point of AMP is that ( while you can certainly shuttle around XML payloads if you want to ) the protocol 's basics are not XML , or anything text - based .
The protocol is binary , and allows transportation of arbitrary data .
You can send PNG or MP3 fragments as easily as you can send XML fragments .
Then there 's the complexity issue .
BEEP 's " core " specification , the very minimal thing you need to implement to get a functioning implementation , is over 50 pages long .
The full - featured Python implementation of AMP , which contains copious documentation internally , both API and protocol documentation , is less than half that long .
So , uh , yeah .
Forget BEEP !
Python/.NET / Java interoperability is only one simple network hack away from reality ... you could be an asynchronous integration hero :) .
There 's no compliance suite yet , although there is someone working on one , so if you have any question about the way things work please feel free to ask me .
From : micktwomey Date : September 22nd , 2006 10:10 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : C# implementation
So , uh , yeah .
Forget BEEP !
That 's what I suspected , I was just curious :)
The small set of working BEEP implementations always struck me a a dead give away that something was amiss .
I can't make any promises , but there is definite interest in good C# <-> python interoperability around here , so I could probably spend some time writing a C# implementation .

You did a great job using 1.5 features to make java code almost as simple as Python - haha , like that will really ever happen ;)
From : glyf Date : September 21st , 2006 09:13 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : Very nice
Well , I 'm glad you appreciated the effort , at least :) .
I do n't really have much time to maintain the java implementation .
Right now it 's a serious struggle to find any time to even get it into a state where I could commit it into Twisted trunk .
If you 're interested in the code , would you be interested in helping out on that front ?
From : djfroofy Date : September 22nd , 2006 02:36 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) Re : Very nice Sure .
I 'd least like to take a crack at it - time permitting .
The Java implementation is something I could possibly use at work if it matures enough ... that is , if my coup does n't go according to plan .

Cartoons - " Offense Level " raised
OIC Demands Unqualified Danish Apology
Effect of Danish Boycott Patchy
Dodging Boycott Call , Norway Voices Regret
Editorial : Irresponsible
whereas the " Saudi Gazette " could only manage
BOYCOTT OF DANISH PRODUCTS GAIN FORCE
BLASPHEMY
I wo n't quote from them , they are just recycling the same old pious claptrap and dodgy theology , repeating themselves and each other ad nauseam , on the basis that sooner or later the Danes will cave in and apologize .
I 've got news for you guys ; the Danes do n't read Saudi newspapers , any more than 1.3 billion Muslims read Danish newspapers and get offended .
But who cares , as long as we do n't talk about stampedes where " several " poor Third - World Muslims died .
However , the most important news is that the Muslim " Offense Level " has been raised .
Just to remind you what the various levels mean :
LOW
Meaning -
We are slightly miffed , although we are not sure why .
We think we are not as popular as we would like to be .
Non-Muslim response - Tread very carefully and do not offend us
Consequence of non-compliance -
We will get very cross and stamp our feet
GUARDED
Meaning -
We are quite offended , because people are generally picking on us .
Non-Muslim response - Stop making jokes about us
Consequence of non-compliance -
We will rant on about " Islamophobia " and " Orientalism " , although we do n't understand what those words really mean
ELEVATED
Meaning -
We are definitely cross , because people keep blaming us for 9/11 , Parisian cars getting torched , Saudi women getting stoned
Non-Muslim response - Pretend that these things have nothing to do with Islam or Muslims , tell everyone how we brought algebra to 9th Century Spain
Consequence of non-compliance -
We will cause even more mayhem .
Did you leave your car out in the street ?
HIGH
Meaning -
We are extremely offended by a particular individual or country
Non-Muslim response -
That individual or country must apologize
Consequence of non-compliance - Individual ; Fatwa , assassination , or both .
Country ; Boycott ( unless you export things the Saudi Royal Family are consumers of ) , and Saudi newspapers write a long string of boring and repetitive articles that you will never read but will drive Saudi readers to distraction .
SEVERE
Meaning -
We have had enough of your rudeness and ridicule and have gone completely ballistic
Non-Muslim response -
We demand that the Pope and President Bush go down on their knees and apologize personally for every rude thing that everyone has ever said about us over the last 1400 years , and promise that it wo n't happen again
Consequence of non-compliance -
We will cease the export of oil , therefore depriving the numerous Saudi Royal Family of all income , we will cease the import of all cars , tanks , airplanes ( military and civil ) , computers , building technology , infrastructure and general professional expertise , and we will stop visiting Western fleshpots like the South of France , the USA , London ..... Honest .
We will .
We really mean it this time .
Just you wait .
We really will .
You better believe it .
We 're not kidding .
We 're telling you .
Honest .
Do n't make us do it .....
Anyway , we are now on ....
.... so watch out The Saudi - government - inspired campaign against Danish Cartoons continues unabated .
I am proud to announce that today , the " Arab News " had no less than four articleswhereas the " Saudi Gazette " could only manageI wo n't quote from them , they are just recycling the same old pious claptrap and dodgy theology , repeating themselves and each other ad nauseam , on the basis that sooner or later the Danes will cave in and apologize .

Interestingly , a writer in the " Comments " section of the previous post has said that all the Friday sermons in Riyadh yesterday were on this very same subject of Danish cartoons , so obviously the Imams have been given the same instructions .
So what 's new ?
Well , two more articles :
( Are n't we all scraping the barrel for headlines already ?
How much longer can we go on with this ? )
Imams Back Call for Danish Boycott in Cartoons Row
I am grateful to " Lehihamra " for pointing out the Quote of the Month in the latter article , a poignant comparison of Saudi and Western freedoms .
Abdullah Al - Othaim , executive president of Al - Othaim Holding Company , has said that his company would boycott of Danish products .
“ As Denmark has freedom of the press , we Muslims have freedom to buy or not to buy their products , ” he said .
So what else can I say ?
It 's really hard work writing a post about this every day , what on earth can I fill it with ?
Oh yes , the Danes also supply NIDO powdered milk that we use a lot of .
Here 's a recipe for some sweets made with NIDO
GAMATTE NIDO - soft round sweets made from NIDO ( powdered milk )
Ingredients :
2 cups of full cream powdered milk
1 Tablespoon of baking powder
2 eggs , beaten about
6 Tablespoons of vegetable oil
1 cup of sugar
1 teaspoon of ground cardamom
saffron thread or powder
Mix the NIDO powdered milk with baking powder .
Then add the eggs and 4 Tablespoons of oil .
Mix well and form into 1 /2 inch balls , by rolling in your hands .
If the mix becomes too dry to roll , add a little more beaten egg .
In a pan combine the sugar with 1 1 / 2 cups of water , the cardamom , and the saffron .
Boil for 3 - 4 minutes .
Remove from heat and allow to cool until warm ( but no longer hot ) .
In a frying pan , heat 1 Tablespoon of oil over medium - low heat .
Add half of the balls .
Cook until the balls are a light brown on all sides .
Do this by constantly tilted and turning the pan , so the balls continually roll around from one side to another .
Place the balls in the warm syrup .
Allow to remain in the syrup for about five minutes or until you have finished frying the second half of the balls .
Remove from the syrup and drain on kleenex tissue or kitchen paper .
Cover with another piece of tissue or kitchen paper and allow to sit for at least three hours before serving .
Enjoy !
Except if we 're boycotting NIDO , we can't make them .
But we can still think about them .
What else ?
Oh yes , a Saudi TV Preacher has been threatening Armageddon .
( not entirely original ) Sorry to keep going on about cartoons again .
You see , it 's a government edict that all newspapers and blogs are to keep on and on , at infinitely tedious length , about Danish cartoons , and under no circumstance mention the you - know - what at you - know - where that killed you - know - how - many .
And being an obedient citizen , I can only comply .

Prams , Toys , Rattles and Dummies
What 's it all about ?
Well , there are no less than four articles about it in the " Saudi Gazette " and " Arab News " , and similar numbers in their Arabic - language equivalents , so it must be something very important .
It 's about cartoons .
Cartoons ?
Yes , cartoons .
Not the
It all started , reportedly , because
In September 2005 , Kare Bluitgen , a Danish author , was set to publish a book on the Prophet Mohammed , but he could not find any illustrations of the Prophet for his books .
Three artists turned down Bluitgen 's request to illustrate the Prophet fearing a backlash from Muslims .
At the time , Frants Gubdelach , president of the Danish Writers ' Union declared this as a threat to free speech .
Then Jyllands - Posten , the most circulated daily newspaper in Denmark , responded by approaching 40 artists asking them for depictions of Prophet Mohammed .
The newspaper then published 12 cartoons of the Prophet on Sept. 30 last year , alongside an article about the freedom of speech , focusing on how artists were afraid to illustrate the Prophet from fear of extremist attacks .
Since then , reportedly a couple of the artists have gone into hiding .
That was last September .
Nobody at the time seemed bothered .
There are actually 180,000 Muslims in Denmark , but they appeared not to have noticed or made a fuss either .
However , there are always some Muslims on the lookout for opportunities to be offended .
They scour the world 's press , in its most obscure languages , seeking something to get into a Hissy Fit about .
And eventually , four months later , they struck paydirt !
Paydirt indeed , for a Saudi government in late January 2006 , anxious to divert attention from its most recent Hajj self - styled " Success " , when it demonstrated once more its ability to corral several hundred Muslim pilgrims , mostly from poor nations , to yet another death by stampede .
A diversion is needed , and what better diversion than Danish cartoons ?
For be in no doubt , when the Saudi newspapers have all these articles on the one day ....
Boycott of Danish Goods Over Blasphemous Cartoons
Danes unmoved , Norway expresses regret over cartoons
Islamophobia .....( ( WAMY ) , a Riyadh - based non-governmental organization , has strongly condemned the publication of cartoons ......)
Rallying up Support against Scandalous Scandanavians
.... do n't be under the illusion that two editors coincidentally thought this would be a Good Idea .
Saudi newspapers may occasionally show little acts of independence , but when it comes to the big things , like sacking editors , or targetting other countries , the government is still very much in control .
And the government ordered a diversion .
So for " We are angry at Danish cartoons " read " Do n't talk about the Hajj stampede " .
Anyway , to explain to Western readers who may be puzzled at all the fuss , what is the basic problem ?
Is it cartoons themselves ?
Well no , all the Saudi papers carry cartoons every day .
They are a tool used to make a political point , against a variety of targets .
So it 's not cartoons .
Let 's get the advice of a cleric .
It is as stated in the Qur ân : And if you ask them , they will surely say we were only conversing and playing .
Say , Is it Allah and His verses and His messengers that you were mocking ?
Make no excuse ; you have disbelieved ... [ Surah al - Tawbah : 65 - 66 ]
Well that does n't really apply .
If you look at these cartoons , no - one is mocking his messengers ; all they are mocking are the extreme latter - day followers , with their bombs , and nonsense about virgins ( or raisins ) , and treatment of women .
It is therefore proven that whoever insults the Prophet ( peace be upon him ) is an unbeliever and an enemy of Allah .
Therefore , it is proven that anyone who blasphemes against Allah , insults an angel , calumniates a prophet or mocks him , or makes fun of the verses of the scripture or the divine legislation is an apostate .
All this says is that the cartoonists are therefore unbelievers or apostates , not true Muslims .
But we already know that !
They are Danes , therefore presumably Christians or Agnostics or something else .
And we can't expect to apply the rules for Muslims to non-Muslims ; that would be like Catholics expecting Muslims to follow their rules , and go around crossing themselves and genuflecting .
So you are excused if you are still puzzled .
The outrage has been caused by the fact that drawing or depicting a physical image of the Prophet is against Islamic law .
Yes , but Islamic law applies only to Muslims , not non-Muslim Danes .
We are not really getting anywhere here .
Let 's try another scholar .
Ridiculing the Prophet is truly the way of evil - minded people , said Khalid Al - Shaya an Islamic scholar who has been very active in condemning the cartoons .
The Western media , through the Zionists aid , support and their extremist Christian helpers had exerted every possible evil effort to distort the religion of Islam and the life of our beloved Prophet , he said .
I wish I 'd not bothered .
We 've picked a Grade A bigot , who sees a Jooo behind everything .
Is there instead anyone sensible out there ?
( The WAMY ) firmly believes that all prophets ( peace be upon them ) should be kept away from derogatory and slanderous attacks , because these were the chosen lot of the Almighty to guide humanity on the right path , ” said Wohaibi .
“ Therefore , mocking at the prophets ( peace be upon them ) is highly degrading and subverts the call for human values and freedom of faith advocated by the United Nations Charter .
Well , that 's the World Association of Muslim Youth for you .
I used to pass its HQ on King Fahd Highway in Riyadh regularly .
I saw lots of elderly men go in , but never any youth .
So it 's " highly degrading " ?
To whom ?
Not to the good souls in Paradise , surely ; are n't they beyond all those petty human feelings , up there ?
Degrading to the people who drew the cartoons ?
Well , if it is , that would be their problem , not yours , you worry about yourself instead .
But now you happen to mention the UN Charter and " freedom of faith " , when is " Father Jim " going to be able to build his Christian church in Riyadh , to demonstrate the " freedom of faith " in Saudi Arabia ?
I 've found him an excellent site , by the way .
On the King Fahd Highway , where the WAMY building is just now .
Still puzzled ?
Time for just one more .
Muslims will never accept this kind of humiliation .
The article insulted every Muslim in the world .
At last .
Someone is being open !
It 's not about the Prophet ( PBUH ) at all .
It 's all about us .
Me , me , me !
We are insulted .
Why ?
Because we choose to be , it 's our right .
The cartoonists are mocking the present - day distortions of true Islam by the bigots and zealots and terrorists , and the bigots and zealots and terrorists do n't like it .
And they are telling the rest of the 1.3 billion that they feel insulted as well , even if they do n't .
So what do they want to happen ?
This is where the toys and rattles and dummies go flying .
We demand a formal apology , said Hlayhel ....
The Saudi government recalled its ambassador for consultations in light of the Danish government 's lack of attention .... Saudi Arabia 's top cleric has called on Denmark to punish a newspaper that ran cartoons portraying Prophet Mohammad ....
The two publications should apologize to Muslims around the world .... WAMY also sought an unconditional apology from the governments of Denmark and Norway .... and punish the culprits who deliberately provoke over one billion Muslims as part of their hostile propaganda against Islam .
Wow !
You get the picture .
We expect punishments and apologies , in whatever order .
And we ourselves are great believers in apologies , of course .
Look how we apologized for all our citizens who flew into the World Trade Centre .
And the great expression of regret to the " so - called " Booze Bombers " for their false imprisonment , torture , and extracted " confessions " .
Not to mention the apologies to the families of fifteen Makkah schoolgirls , killed in a fire by the actions of the Muttawa .
And soon there 'll be an apology to the families killed in .....
Sorry .
I forgot .
We 're not supposed to talk about the Makkah stampede .
There 's a most unholy tantrum being thrown in Saudi Arabia at the moment .
The proverbial toys , rattles and dummies are being thrown out of the pram in all directions .
And the screaming .... you would n't think they had lungs that strong .
What 's it all about ?
Well , there are no less than four articles about it in the " Saudi Gazette " and " Arab News " , and similar numbers in their Arabic - language equivalents , so it must be something very important .
It 's about cartoons .
Cartoons ?
Yes , cartoons .
Not the revoltingly anti-semitic ones that we all so love and appreciate .
No , these are different .
These are those Danish cartoons , again .

The outrage has been caused by the fact that drawing or depicting a physical image of the Prophet is against Islamic law .
Yes , but Islamic law applies only to Muslims , not non-Muslim Danes .
We are not really getting anywhere here .
Let 's try another scholar .
Ridiculing the Prophet is truly the way of evil - minded people , said Khalid Al - Shaya an Islamic scholar who has been very active in condemning the cartoons .
had exerted every possible evil effort to distort the religion of Islam and the life of our beloved Prophet , he said .
I wish I 'd not bothered .
We 've picked a Grade A bigot , who sees a Jooo behind everything .
Is there instead anyone sensible out there ?
( The WAMY ) firmly believes that all prophets ( peace be upon them ) should be kept away from derogatory and slanderous attacks , because these were the chosen lot of the Almighty to guide humanity on the right path , ” said Wohaibi .
“ Therefore , mocking at the prophets ( peace be upon them ) is highly degrading and subverts the call for human values and Well , that 's the World Association of Muslim Youth for you .
I used to pass its HQ on King Fahd Highway in Riyadh regularly .
I saw lots of elderly men go in , but never any youth .
So it 's " highly degrading " ?
To whom ?
Not to the good souls in Paradise , surely ; are n't they beyond all those petty human feelings , up there ?
Degrading to the people who drew the cartoons ?
Well , if it is , that would be their problem , not yours , you worry about yourself instead .
But now you happen to mention the UN Charter and " freedom of faith " , when is " Father Jim " going to be able to build his Christian church in Riyadh , to demonstrate the " freedom of faith " in Saudi Arabia ?
I 've found him an excellent site , by the way .
On the King Fahd Highway , where the WAMY building is just now .
Still puzzled ?
Time for just one more .
Muslims will never accept this kind of humiliation .
The article insulted every Muslim in the world .
At last .
Someone is being open !
It 's not about the Prophet ( PBUH ) at all .
It 's all about us .
Me , me , me !
We are insulted .
Why ?
Because we choose to be , it 's our right .
The cartoonists are mocking the present - day distortions of true Islam by the bigots and zealots and terrorists , and the bigots and zealots and terrorists do n't like it .
And they are telling the rest of the 1.3 billion that they feel insulted as well , even if they do n't .
So what do they want to happen ?
This is where the toys and rattles and dummies go flying .
We demand a formal apology , said Hlayhel ....
The Saudi government recalled its ambassador for consultations in light of the Danish government 's lack of attention .... Saudi Arabia 's top cleric has called on Denmark to punish a newspaper that ran cartoons portraying Prophet Mohammad ....
The two publications should apologize to Muslims around the world .... WAMY also sought an unconditional apology from the governments of Denmark and Norway .... and punish the culprits who deliberately provoke over one billion Muslims as part of their hostile propaganda against Islam .
Wow !
You get the picture .
We expect punishments and apologies , in whatever order .
And we ourselves are great believers in apologies , of course .
Look how we apologized for all our citizens who flew into the World Trade Centre .
And the great expression of regret to the " so - called " Booze Bombers " for their false imprisonment , torture , and extracted " confessions " .
Not to mention the apologies to the families of fifteen Makkah schoolgirls , killed in a fire by the actions of the Muttawa .
And soon there 'll be an apology to the families killed in .....

Camels , Crime , Curry
CAMELS
I 'm sure I 've mentioned before that I 'm fond of camels .
They are good - natured , hard - working , intelligent , and if you want them to do something , they 'll generally help you out as a favor .
I 'm sure that if God had designed them a bit more elegantly , and enabled them to speak , they'd be running the place by now .
In other parts of the world , especially India , camels really have to work hard for a living .
In Saudi Arabia , we keep them as pets .
They are generally treated very well ; indeed , I know some people who treat them better than their own wives and certainly better than their domestic help .
But not so this person .
Abused a Camel , Abused by Camel
A man who committed animal cruelty got his come - uppance when he untied the angry creature , Okaz daily reported .
The man locked his camel in a stable and bound its legs for three days .
When he untied the creature it immediately attacked him , biting him in the head causing a severe fracture .
The man had to be taken to a hospital for treatment .
It is not known what the man did to the camel after being released from the hospital .
If he had any sense , he'd go back and apologize to it , then give it something really special for supper .
You do n't mess around with camels .
They only do what you want out of the goodness of their hearts , and if you abuse and disrespect them , they 'll soon show you which is the superior species .

You do n't mess around with camels .
They only do what you want out of the goodness of their hearts , and if you abuse and disrespect them , they 'll soon show you which is the superior species .
The " Saudi Gazette " has a regular crime column , which I always go and look at , if only out of morbid fascination .
It 's full of the doings of the criminal classes in the Kingdom , which are actually pretty tame by world standards , because we 're not very good at crime .
( I once heard the statistic that Washington DC has more murders in a year than the Kingdom has had since it was formed early in the last century ; I have n't verified that , but I can believe it . )
Anyway , it 's full of things like A pickup truck , parked in front of its owner s home at Al - Jabour District in Madina , was stolen A fight broke out at a food supply store between several female shoppers , when one of the women discovered that her handbag was missing Dhamad Police in collaboration with a Mujahideen team under the command of Sergeant Marwa iy Ja fari arrested a smuggler with 315 bundles of Qat ( a " poor man 's drug " , local to this region , chewed ) in his possession .
Police succeeded in nabbing the individuals who broke into the Commission for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice s headquarters .
I love that last one !
Why break into the Muttawa HQ ?
I would guess , to steal from their cache of confiscated women 's magazines , Valentine cards , Barbie dolls , not to mention , if they are lucky , porn , booze and soft drugs .
There 's always something very quaint about the English used by the reporter on that column .
I suspect he learnt his trade in England about 30 years ago .
Police are always " swooping " , or " pouncing " , before " nabbing " the criminals .
If they ever reported the conversation upon arrest , it would no doubt be something like " Oy Lofty , you 're nicked " , with the reply , " Cor Guv , it 's a fair cop , you 've got me banged up to rights and no mistake " .
Another curiosity is the photographer .
He either takes photos of the criminals , just having been arrested , looking down in the mouth , or alternately , of crime victims in hospitals .
He reminds me of that " Sneaky Pete " photographer who was supposed to operate in honeymoon hotels in Las Vegas and Niagara , commissioned by couples to take surreptitious photos of them in the foam bath and other places , so they could dribble over them together when they eventually got to ninety .
Anyway , this " Sneaky Pete " does n't ask anyone 's permission , he just sneaks into the ward when the victim is sedated up to the eyeballs and has n't a clue what 's happening , and clicks away .
In this case , it 's a policeman who was injured in a shoot - out , thankfully not severely .
So he gets his picture taken , tubes and tissues and all , when he 's fast asleep .
No chance to fix his hair and have a shave .
Anyway , let 's be thankful he was n't having a bed - bath or an enema at the time .
The other curious thing about this column is that they always put the photo at the top , regardless of what the first item is about .
The result can often be eerie or macabre ; look here and you 'll see what I mean .
CURRY I enjoy reading history books .
One of the things I learnt about English history is that royals like Elizabeth I used to enjoy going on " A Progress " .
The basic idea was to keep an eye on the various nobles , but it also served to cut down on her food bill .
She and the Court , who could number dozens , used to travel to castles and stately houses in sequence , eat all the food , wipe out all the game birds and animals , and then move on to the next one .
So Lord Cholmondeley would be out hawking with his pals one day when he spots Elizabeth and retinue heading for Cholmondeley Castle .
Muttering " Oh , bugger it " to himself , he orders the servants to slaughter every farm animal in a ten mile radius and roast them , while he heads over to greet Her Royal Highness thru gritted teeth ; " Your Majesty , my family and I are deeply honored to have you and your Court as guests at our humble abode " .
Then the Court would spend several days eating every bit of food until it was all gone , leaving behind a huge pile of animal bones , and two pregnant serving - wenches .
Thus it is with our own Royal Family .
They are on " A Progress " around Asia .
Any country that 's going to need some oil for its growing economy , they 're going to have to feed ....
The King 's entourage includes his sons and the ministers of Finance , Oil , Foreign Affairs , Trade and Information .
.... which is a lot of mouths , especially when you include " his sons " .
So many , in fact , that they need a whole Boeing 747-400 .
They 've been for a Chinese , and have now left Beijing , the cargo hold of the 747 groaning under the weight of stones from the Great Wall , and assorted Terracotta warriors ( What else would the people " who have everything " want for their rockery ? ) .
And you know what it 's like when you take your family for a Chinese ; even if it 's very good , you do n't really want to go back another night .
The A. family would say " Let 's have curry tonight for a change " .
And that 's just what the Sauds say .
Where is the best curry ?
" Pilot , plot a course for Delhi ! "
Now I can guess that as an endless stream of Saudi princes , some 260 in all , come shuffling out of their 747 , hungry as hell , the reaction of the Indians would be pretty much like that of Lord Cholmondeley .
Still , needs must .
For , in spite of the usual " Saudi Gazette " nonsense about the purpose of the visit ....
The visit , the first by a Saudi monarch in 50 years , is expected to lead to a new and strategic Saudi - Indian bilateral relationship focused on cooperation in energy security , infrastructure building and Information Technology .
.... the real game is that India , as a developing industrial nation , needs more oil .
So the family have come to find out what India can offer in return .
( Apart from some antique temple gods of course ; a Goddess Kali will look great in the rockery , and with all those arms , can give pleasure to six Terracotta warriors at once ) .
My personal guess is IT and other things that will reduce the long - term dependence on US technology ; not that I 'm expert in these matters .
So that 's the latest stage in the Gastronomic Grand Tour .
Where after this ?
What particular aromas and flavors will next tempt the palates of our ruling elite ?
Stay tuned .

Priorities
The Saudi Arabian Council of Ministers and Shoura Council ( " Poodle Parliament " )
Saudi Arabia yesterday denounced European newspapers that published cartoons denigrating the Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) and said such spiteful actions would spread hatred and animosity among people of different faiths .
OK .
Point made .
“ The Council of Ministers expressed the Kingdom ’s condemnation of what is published by certain European newspapers defiling the Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh ) , ” the Saudi Press Agency said .
The Cabinet was referring to the caricatures published by some Danish and Norwegian dailies .
Yes .
We know .
You just told us .
The Cabinet meeting , chaired by the Regent Prince Sultan at Yamamah Palace in Riyadh , expressed anguish and surprise at the inadequate reaction from governments and people in those countries against such vilifications , despite their economic , political and cultural relations with the Islamic world .
I know .
But perhaps they have other priorites .
Diseased chickens .
Russia cutting off gas supplies .
Iran being run by a raving lunatic .
In a similar statement , the Shoura Council also condemned the attacks of Danish and Norwegian newspapers on the Prophet and said such publications would unleash communal hatred .
Maybe so .
But the stuff was actually published months ago , and nobody really took any notice , apart from papers looking to fill the odd column .
“ The acrimonious cartoons on the Prophet hurt the feelings of Muslims across the world and gave false information about a great personality , who was selected by God to become
His last messenger , ” the statement said .
Hell 's teeth , man , they are only cartoons !
Get a grip !
Chill out !
“ Those who publish such cartoons do not know the consequences ; they will spread hatred and division and create animosity between communities and religions , ” the Shoura said .
Yeah yeah yeah , you already said that .
When do we get to talk about the Makkah Hajj tragedy ?
The statement rejected publication of such obnoxious cartoons in the name of freedom of expression .
“ All constitutions and laws in the world call for the respect of Prophets and divine religions , ” it added .
No they do n't .
That 's absolute bollocks .
Only extreme Muslim countries have laws like that .
Are we on to Makkah yet ?
Shoura Council Chairman Dr. Saleh Bin-Humaid urged intellectuals and peace - loving people of the world to stop such vilifications against the Prophet of Islam and punish its perpetrators .
Punish ?
How ?
Smack their bottoms ?
Send them to bed early ?
Come on guys , is this all you can talk about ?
The Shoura urged the Danish and Norwegian parliaments to stand against the anti-Islam campaigns in their countries .
What campaigns ?
Guys , you are losing touch with reality !
Come back to Earth !
The 57 - member Organization of the Islamic Conference , the European Commission and many international Islamic organizations have condemned the printing of the provocative cartoons .
The European Commission ?
Really ?
( Though sadly , that would n't be a complete surprise to many of the ordinary citizens of Europe )
But when do we get to talk about Makkah ?
The Cabinet meeting expressed hope that the current four - nation Asian tour of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah would help strengthen relations with these countries .
Maybe it will , maybe it wo n't .
But at least some other country has to feed the Royal Family for a while .
All 260 of them .
Makkah ?
The Cabinet meeting , which is first after Haj , commended the various government and private organizations for their efforts in the successful organization of the annual event .
It expressed deep sorrow over the deaths of several pilgrims in two accidents : a stampede in Mina and a building collapse in Makkah .
Excuse me .
I just had to go out and vomit .
I 'll be myself in a minute .
There were only supposed to be 2.5 million there , but another 1.5 million managed to slip in when no - one was looking ; a total of 4 million in an area the size of London 's West End or New York 's Midtown .
The security forces themselves admitted that they were helpless and reduced to being onlookers .
Squatters were allowed to wander around with bulky luggage in tow , accidents waiting to happen , and a stampede took place yet again in the location where the stampedes always take place , killing 360 .
Meanwhile a hotel collapsed , killing 60 , and the ministries are still arguing over who should have inspected the building .
And that is a Success ?
God spare us from a failure !
420 died .
That 's what we call " Several " .
420 human beings .
" Several " .
Mostly foreigners , from Africa , the Indian sub - continent , places like that , but only a few Saudis .
Is it because they were mostly " darkies " , that " Hundreds " turn into " Several " ?
The arithmetic of our callous leaders .
Anyway , let 's go on and discuss the issues more .
The Cabinet conveyed its condolences to the Kuwaiti government and people on the death of Emir Sheikh Jaber Al - Ahmad Al - Sabah .
The regent briefed the Cabinet on the outcome of King Abdullah ’s talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Syrian President Bashar Assad and US Vice President Dick Cheney .
No , that was it .
Move onto the next item .
No more Makkah Hajj discussion .
Scratch 420 dead pilgrims .
Sad for them and their families , but they 're history .
What 's done is done .
Draw a line in the sand .
Move on .
After all , foreign pilgrims are not our priority .
Cartoons are far more important .
So here 's another one for them .
The Saudi Arabian Council of Ministers and Shoura Council ( " Poodle Parliament " ) discusses matters of great import .
Obviously the Makkah Hajj Tragedy .
But not yet , there 's something even more important on the agenda .
Cartoons .
Yes , cartoons are a very important State matter .
Saudi Arabia yesterday denounced European newspapers that published cartoons denigrating the Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) and said such spiteful actions would spread hatred and animosity among people of different faiths .
OK .

King Abdullah goes out for a Chinese
But King Abdullah knows how to do things in style .
Mind you , he 's filthy rich .
Every time you fill up with gas , he gets even richer , which is a nice thought to occupy your mind as those numbers whizz round at high speed .
Anyway , yesterday his family said that they " felt like a Chinese " .
So they went down to the airport , turfed a load of homeward - bound Bangladeshis off a Saudi Airlines 747 , and flew to Beijing .
Here they are arriving .
When I said his family , I meant his whole family .
There they are , stretching in a queue 100 yards back to the aircraft , then up the stairs , and there 's about 150 of them still inside waiting to get off .
They are desperate to get at the Crispy Duck , but here 's some guy blocking the way with a bunch of flowers .
Look , Pal , if the King wants flowers , he 'll buy friggin ' Holland .
Now put them down and take our order .
One Chinese Banquet for two hundred and sixty .
With Prawn Crackers to start , and Tiger Beers all round .
Not that it was all relaxation , of course .
Topics on the table for discussion besides energy will be counter - terrorism and military cooperation , a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said .
What do you do when you fancy a Chinese ?
Drive down to the Lucky Dragon ?
Ring up for a home delivery ?
That 's what we mere mortals do , is n't it ?
But King Abdullah knows how to do things in style .
Mind you , he 's filthy rich .
Every time you fill up with gas , he gets even richer , which is a nice thought to occupy your mind as those numbers whizz round at high speed .

But not Democracy or Human Rights , of course .
No point in discussing things that do n't interest either party .
Besides , it would encroach into our valuable eating time .
Next visit , perhaps .
Pass the Soy Sauce .
A Spontaneous Demonstration
Click here
Thanks to " Beachhutman " and MEMRI ( Yes , Jooos , I know , yawn )
The Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah is supposed to be about strengthening ones ' relationship with God .
Not so for these Iranian pilgrims and their " spontaneous demonstration " with preprinted banners which niftily double as fans .
They would like to turn a deeply spiritual event into some sort of Nuremburg Rally .
It starts off with the sort of game you play at childrens ' parties .
Appalling .
Nauseating .

Comments
Those who visit the comments page and attempt to post something will notice that I am now moderating all comments .
That is , I look at them and approve them for publication or otherwise .
This is because yesterday there was a fairly prolonged attack from someone using multiple names and IP addresses , making some very bitter personal attacks on me .
Moderating comments is a pain for you and me both , and I hope to be able to relax it soon when whoever caused it goes away and discovers some true purpose in life .
Just to emphasise the rules I apply to comments , although 98 % of those who visit are perfectly civilized people who do n't need reminding :
What is allowed :
Comments supporting what I 've posted
Comments querying what I 've posted
Comments disagreeing with what I 've posted
Comments disagreeing with my whole approach here
Comments disagreeing with other comments
What is not allowed
Personal attacks on or insults of other commentors ( Common sense applies here .
I 'm not talking about jocular jests and friendly badinage .
Apply the " Big guy in the bar " rule - if you said it to that big guy in the bar , the one with the beard and headband and the tattoos , would you be grateful you had dental insurance ? )
Personal attacks on or insults of me .
On or two have got upset because I 've limited their " Free Speech " .
My response is , if someone came into your house and kept slagging you off , would you respect their right to " Free Speech " , or would you show them the door ?
( And if you 're the guy with the beard etc. , you 'd probably choose the third option . )
One other thing for the rabid minority to bear in mind ; if you disagree with something that is posted , or someone 's comment , there 's nothing that shouts " I CANNOT DISPROVE WHAT YOU SAY " more obviously than trying to attach a label to that person , or making offensive personal comments .
If you want to be taken seriously , address the issue , not the person .
One other point , for the tinyest minority who enjoy directing expletives at people .
Do n't expect me to delete the words , or the entire post , just to spare your blushes .
I 'm not your maiden aunt .
Other people may be interested to see you in your uglier moments , and why should I protect you from yourself ?.
Having got that out of the way , comment away , argue away , but let 's keep it FUN !
Saturday , January 21 , 2006
Give me a child .....
I was reminded of that when reading a speech by our Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al - Faisal recently .
It was at a
Prince Saud pointed out that in 2004 , 53 percent of terrorist incidents around the globe occurred outside the Middle East .
That 's what is called " spin " .
You are meant to think that most of the world 's terrorism takes place somewhere other than the Middle East .
So it does , just .
But the thing about spin is that you can spin in two directions .
Let 's spin the other way .
How about the Middle East , with 2 % of the world 's population , accounts for 47 % of the world 's terrorism ?
Is n't that something to be proud of ?
Funny thing , spin .
The Prince goes on
.... the Kingdom recognized that it had to confront directly intolerance and “ those who would sow the seeds of hatred and violence in our mosques and schools " .
So part of the problem is people in our schools , sowing the seeds of hatred .
Who are these people ?
Evil and manipulative teachers ?
But before we answer that , here 's a little quiz about our schools ' teaching on the Jews .
Here are six passages .
Can you tell which are from our textbooks , and which are from " Mein Kampf " by Adolph Hitler ?
1 . Though persecution still existed , emanicipation spread throughout Europe in the 1800s .
Napoleon invited Jews to leave the Jewish ghettos in Europe and seek refuge in the newly created tolerant political regimes that offered equality under Napoleonic Law .
By 1871 , with Germany ’s emancipation of Jews , every European country except Russia had emancipated its Jews .
2 . In order to carry on his existence as a parasite on other peoples , he is forced to deny his inner nature .
The more intelligent the individual Jew is , the more he will succeed in this deception .
3 . The Jews are wickedness in its very essence .
One of the wicked ways of the Jews is that they whisper to one another among themselves ....
4. Though Jews became increasingly integrated in Europe , fighting for their home countries in World War I and playing important roles in culture and art during the 1920s and 1930s , racial anti-Semitism remained .
It reached its most virulent form in the killing of approximately six million Jews during the Holocaust , almost completely obliterating the two - thousand year history of the Jews in Europe .
In 1948 , the Jewish state of Israel was founded , creating the first Jewish nation since the Roman destruction of Jerusalem , subsequent wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors ....
5 . To what an extent the whole existence of this people is based on a continuous lie is shown incomparably by the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion , so infinitely hated by the Jews .
6 . They were discovered in the nineteenth century .
The Jews tried to deny them , but there was ample evidence proving their authenticity and that they were issued by the elders of Zion .
The Protocols can be summarized in the following points :
1. Upsetting the foundations of the world ’s present society and its systems , in order to enable Zionism to have a monopoly of world government ....
4. Controlling the media of publication , propaganda and the press , using gold for stirring up disturbances , seducing people by means of lust and spreading wantonness .
The cogent proof of the authenticity of these resolutions , as well as of the hellish Jewish schemes included therein , is the actual carrying out of many of those schemes , intrigues and conspiracies that are found in them .
Anyone who reads them .... grasps today to what extent much of what is found there has been realized .
OK , I admit it , that was a bit of a trick question .
Those who thought that 1 and 4 are from our textbooks have obviously gone to the sort of school where history is presented in a reasonably objective way , and allows room for disagreement .
Such is not the way with our schools .
I cheated a little , and took 1 and 4 from
So that leaves four pieces of nastiness .
Which is Nazi nastiness , and which is Saudi school nastiness ?
That 's a tricky one .
I removed the historical and stylistic clues , so they are quite hard to tell apart .
Well , 2 and 5 are from " Mein Kampf " .
So that leaves 3 and 6 .
3 is from the " Quran Commentary " syllabus , taught to Grade 9's .
6 is from " Hadith and Islamic Culture " , Grade 10
So there you go .
The villains are not , in this case , the teachers , but instead the government , the Ministry of Education .
They teach material to our 14 and 15 - year - olds that is inseparable from the rantings of the greatest criminal of the Twentieth Century , a psychotic who applied industrial technology to the attempted elimination of an entire race .
Is n't that something for us to be proud of ?
Imagine that in the West , you had a school system which sat the children down each day and fed them a tumbler of whisky .
They might not like it at first , but they would eventually get used to it .
Later on , they would start to look forward to it .
By the time they left school , a fair proportion of them would be alcoholics .
Perhaps not a problem if they kept it to themselves , but the ones who went out and drove over people or otherwise killed them would start to be a concern .
So you would have to start a program of drying - out clinics , to cure them .
And they might be successful , although there 's no such thing as a cured alcoholic , just one who has n't had a drink for a length of time .
And you might just question the wisdom of spending money and effort creating alcoholics , only to have to spend more money and effort to cure them later .
In Saudi Arabia , we do n't feed our children alcohol .
Instead , we feed them race hate .
It 's a progressive thing , building up layer by layer , using the material you see above .
Thankfully , many forget it , just like we all forget algebra and bits of history .
But there is a proportion for whom it sticks .
They are our " alcoholics " .
And their hatred extends not only to Jews worldwide , but also the countries that are seen to support them - North America , Europe , Australasia .
And a proportion of these decide to do something about it , and sign up with the terrorist groups .
Eventually they might get caught , and repatriated .
And we have our own " drying - out clinics " .
It 's a program where we get people to talk them round , to see the error of their ways , to be rehabilitated .
And unlike a drying - out clinic , we keep them in prison in between times , so you can imagine that the " success rate " is a lot higher .
It 's documented here .
Reeducation of Extremists in Saudi Arabia
In the past six months , the Saudi Interior Ministry released more than 400 security prisoners based on the assessment of the program counselors , after becoming convinced that they had renounced their extremist views .
None of the freed prisoners were planners of terror operations who were under interrogation or standing trial .
According to Interior Minister Prince Na'if bin Abd Al - Aziz , " the heads of the program assess that it has had a positive impact on the prisoners ' tendencies , and that there is evidence that they admit their error and want to repent . "
Are they cured ?
Given a choice between prison food and 24 X 7 fast food on the outside , we can all take a view on that .
And like the alcoholic , is a reformed terrorist just someone who has n't committed an atrocity for a while ?
The Jesuits understood it , and we 've happily misused it since .
We take the children , teach them hate , and when some of them get addicted , we try to flush it out of their system .
Would n't it be better not to teach them hate in the first place ?
I do n't think Saudi Arabia has made that decision yet , and nothing that Prince Saud has said suggests that .
So we 'll keep on spewing them out .
And then they 'll become your problem as well as ours .
..... until he is seven , and I will give you the man " .
Thus goes the Jesuit saying , but of course it is true of all education .
What we sow in childhood , we reap in adulthood .
I was reminded of that when reading a speech by our Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al - Faisal recently .
It was at a conference in London on " Global Terrorism " , sponsored by the Saudi Embassy there .
( Do n't you just love that - we have been the prime exporters of terrorism around the world , then we sponsor a conference on it .
Next week there 's one on " Minority Rights " sponsored by the Sudanese Embassy . )
One of the interesting statistics he quoted was Prince Saud pointed out that in 2004 , 53 percent of terrorist incidents around the globe occurred outside the Middle East .
That 's what is called " spin " .
You are meant to think that most of the world 's terrorism takes place somewhere other than the Middle East .
So it does , just .
But the thing about spin is that you can spin in two directions .
Let 's spin the other way .
How about the Middle East , with 2 % of the world 's population , accounts for 47 % of the world 's terrorism ?
Is n't that something to be proud of ?
Funny thing , spin .
The Prince goes on .... the Kingdom recognized that it had to confront directly intolerance and “ those who would sow the seeds of hatred and violence in our mosques and schools " .
So part of the problem is people in our schools , sowing the seeds of hatred .
Who are these people ?
Evil and manipulative teachers ?
But before we answer that , here 's a little quiz about our schools ' teaching on the Jews .
Here are six passages .
Can you tell which are from our textbooks , and which are from " Mein Kampf " by Adolph Hitler ?
Though persecution still existed , emanicipation spread throughout Europe in the 1800s .
Napoleon invited Jews to leave the Jewish ghettos in Europe and seek refuge in the newly created tolerant political regimes that offered equality under Napoleonic Law .
By 1871 , with Germany ’s emancipation of Jews , every European country except Russia had emancipated its Jews .
In order to carry on his existence as a parasite on other peoples , he is forced to deny his inner nature .
The more intelligent the individual Jew is , the more he will succeed in this deception .
The Jews are wickedness in its very essence .
One of the wicked ways of the Jews is that they whisper to one another among themselves .... Though Jews became increasingly integrated in Europe , fighting for their home countries in World War I and playing important roles in culture and art during the 1920s and 1930s , racial anti-Semitism remained .
It reached its most virulent form in the killing of approximately six million Jews during the Holocaust , almost completely obliterating the two - thousand year history of the Jews in Europe .
In 1948 , the Jewish state of Israel was founded , creating the first Jewish nation since the Roman destruction of Jerusalem , subsequent wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors .... To what an extent the whole existence of this people is based on a continuous lie is shown incomparably by the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion , so infinitely hated by the Jews .
They were discovered in the nineteenth century .
The Jews tried to deny them , but there was ample evidence proving their authenticity and that they were issued by the elders of Zion .
The Protocols can be summarized in the following points : 1 . Upsetting the foundations of the world ’s present society and its systems , in order to enable Zionism to have a monopoly of world government .... 4 . Controlling the media of publication , propaganda and the press , using gold for stirring up disturbances , seducing people by means of lust and spreading wantonness .
The cogent proof of the authenticity of these resolutions , as well as of the hellish Jewish schemes included therein , is the actual carrying out of many of those schemes , intrigues and conspiracies that are found in them .
Anyone who reads them .... grasps today to what extent much of what is found there has been realized .
OK , I admit it , that was a bit of a trick question .
Those who thought that 1 and 4 are from our textbooks have obviously gone to the sort of school where history is presented in a reasonably objective way , and allows room for disagreement .
Such is not the way with our schools .
I cheated a little , and took 1 and 4 from Wikipedia
So that leaves four pieces of nastiness .
Which is Nazi nastiness , and which is Saudi school nastiness ?
That 's a tricky one .
I removed the historical and stylistic clues , so they are quite hard to tell apart .
Well , 2 and 5 are from " Mein Kampf " .
So that leaves 3 and 6.3 is from the " Quran Commentary " syllabus , taught to Grade 9's.6 is from " Hadith and Islamic Culture " , Grade 10 So there you go .
The villains are not , in this case , the teachers , but instead the government , the Ministry of Education .

The Saudi Sense of Humor
This is not funny .
This might appear funny to Westerners because it depicts their notion of Islam - mysogynistic and murderous - and the way in which the slit of the ladies ' veil has been used to conceal Muhammad 's eyes , rather like in one of those crime photos .
While it does n't do much for me personally , some may enjoy it and have a laugh .
Others may not find it funny , and would simply move on to the next item .
However , for many Saudis , and indeed many extreme Muslims worldwide , it is not enough to find it unfunny .
We are also
Saudis and non-Saudis in the Kingdom are urging consumers to boycott Danish products in response to cartoons of Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh ) printed in September in Danish daily Jyllands - Posten .
So no more Lurpak butter on the table .
( We already passed on the Danish Bacon ) .
But what will that achieve ?
The main objective of this message is that we encourage people to boycott goods from Denmark , which is the least thing we can do until Denmark offers an official apology for the drawings that have offended the world ’s Muslims .
I am rather curious exactly how many of " the world 's Muslims " speak fluent Danish , and leaf thru a copy of the " Jyllands - Posten " newspaper while eating their toast and Lurpak ( but no longer ) and marmalade , in order to get so upset .
But no matter .
One Muslim did , was deeply offended , told the other 1.3 billion about it , and now we 're all p*ssed as hell .
And you know what happens when we are offended , do n't you ?
That 's right .
We demand an apology !
And as we expect an " official apology " , it can come from no less a person than from Her Royal Highness Queen Margrethe Alexandrine Þorhildur Ingrid .
In Arabic , naturally ; you do n't think any of us speak Danish , do you ?
And if you do that , we 'll start buying Lurpak again .
But do n't count on the bacon .
So that was n't funny .
But what is ?
Well , this cartoon from Today 's " Saudi Gazette " is .
Why ?
Because it depicts time running out for Ariel Sharon .
You see , he is Jooo No. 1 , and we do n't like Jooos , have hated them for 1400 years in fact , so when Jooo No. 1 has a major stroke , and is in a coma for the best part of a month , it 's fair game for a bit of good - natured fun .
Anyway , cerebral hemorages are inherently funny .
It 's the idea of being completely helpless and being artificially fed and tubes going in and tubes going out that appeals to our cartoonist , who of course never himself risks the possibility of a blood vessel in his own head bursting and messing up his brain ; but if it did happen to him , you can be sure that he'd have a real good laugh about it .
So there you go , the Saudi sense of humor .
We 're extremely religious and pious , so we do n't laugh at Muhammad , just at Jooos with severe brain damage .
P.S. 22 January 2006 .
You can see the full set of the Danish cartoons Saudis are sometimes accused of having no sense of humor .
Indeed , I am sometimes accused of not being a Saudi , because I do have a sense of humor .
The truth is , of course , that we Saudis are natural comedians , and enjoy a good laugh , just like everyone else .
However , some things are not funny .
Let me explain the difference .
This is not funny .
This might appear funny to Westerners because it depicts their notion of Islam - mysogynistic and murderous - and the way in which the slit of the ladies ' veil has been used to conceal Muhammad 's eyes , rather like in one of those crime photos .

Others may not find it funny , and would simply move on to the next item .
However , for many Saudis , and indeed many extreme Muslims worldwide , it is not enough to find it unfunny .
We are also obliged to feel offended , because of the depiction of Muhammad .
And when we discover that this has been published in a Danish newspaper , we feel compelled to take action .
Saudis and non-Saudis in the Kingdom arein response to cartoons of Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh ) printed in September in Danish daily Jyllands - Posten .

You can see the full set of the Danish cartoons here .
Generally , for me , not that funny .
But not reason enough to get spitting mad , either .
And certainly not worth giving up Lurpak for .

Virtually Expert
The " Saudi Gazette " thinks it has found the answer .
Well , they 've had a Good Idea .
But they should realize what more or less everyone else knows .
A Good Idea is not enough .
To be any good , it has to be put into practice well .
Because if it 's cocked up , then it 's just another Bad Idea .
The Saudi Gazette 's Good Idea was to save money on " experts " .
Instead of calling up and getting quotes from " an expert " , and then having to slip them a hundred dollars or whatever for their words of wisdom , they would invent some " virtual experts " , who would talk for nothing !
And of course , they could make their " virtual experts " say whatever they wanted , they could make them the most brilliant , witty and articulate people in the world .
They could invent the best experts in the world !
Sadly , the Gazette invented them as completely and utterly stoopid .
That was their first mistake .
The second mistake was that they gave them silly names , names that do n't come up with real people when you Google them , you 'll see what I mean .
The Gazette first wheeled out its experts when tackling the question of
But Hakeem added any person can practice his faith alone like what is happening in many places around the world such as the Vatican that does not have any mosques as Saudi Arabia has no churches .
.... and my special favorite ....
As a country that follows Islam , starting with its flag that has Allah 's name on it , we are obeying the orders of Qur'an and Sunna by stopping any one from practicing any religion other than Islam in public .
.... for its sheer lack of logic combined with total self - certainty .
For
Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud said that the West was partly responsible for the current standoff with Iran over its nuclear policy because it had helped Israel develop its own nuclear weapon store .
Now it will come as no surprise to you in the West that you are " partly responsible " .
Only partly , you note .
The rest of the responsibility is of course down to the Jooos .
So it 's you and the Jooos .
It 's always you and the Jooos .
No matter that Iran as an independent country takes these decisions purely on its own behalf , with no outside coercion .
No matter that the unhinged leader of a country who says that another country should be wiped off the map , is now developing weapons of mass destruction that could do precisely that .
No matter that Israel has quietly had these weapons for years but has never ever threatened to wipe any country off the map .
It 's still you and the Joos .
Little wonder , then , that the Gazette feels the need to call in its " experts " , to give the Prince a bit of moral support .
So what sort of " expert " are they dishing up for us today ?
Saudi scholars and security experts have echoed comments by Prince Saud Al - Faisal in a BBC radio interview that the West must be held partially responsible for the tension between Western nations and Iran over nuclear proliferation .
Wow !
Scholars and security experts !
What a tasty treat !
I can't wait .
Who is first up ?
Iran specifically and the Muslim Arab countries in general are considered a threat to the USA , said Sheikh Muhammed Ayoub of Riyadh .
They can t stand to see any of these countries doing huge programs , especially when it come to nuclear weapons ; but on the other side its OK if they used it because they have the power to do so .
Now I 've never got the impression that the US feels threatened by Jordan or Bahrain or Abu Dhabi or Dubai or the other Emirates or Oman or Lebanon or even by Saudi Arabia , militarily .
And when I last looked , they were all " Muslim Arab countries " .
So I 'm curious as to whether Sheikh Muhammed Ayoub of Riyadh is a scholar or a military expert .
Ah !
Perhaps he is the
Let 's have another .
Let 's have a military expert .
Ali Muhammed , retired colonel and expert on military affairs , said , The USA is using Iran as a play card to start moving to Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
Their problem is that they think the world is too stupid to notice their moves when everything is so obvious .
Well , being a military man and needing to keep out of the public gaze , he wo n't have a high Google profile .
But I suspect that our journalist 's eyes landed on a photo of the most famous Muslim boxer of all time , one with two very common male Arab names , and all he did then was to reverse them , just to try to fool us .
But he did n't .
Not only that , if you want a military expert , you need a good military title , a General of some description , but not a mere Colonel and a retired one at that .
Particularly when our armies and our Colonels
Leadership may be the greatest weakness of Arab training systems .
A sergeant first class in the U.S. Army has as much authority as a colonel in an Arab army .
Anyway , enough nit-picking .
What does our " expert " Colonel / Sergeant have to say ?
The USA is using Iran as a play card to start moving to Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
Their problem is that they think the world is too stupid to notice their moves when everything is so obvious .
After all that , I 'm sorry I bothered .
Obviously , in retirement time is hanging heavy on his hands , and he enjoys playing those board games like " Diplomacy " .
But why would the US feel compelled to invade their ally Jordan and depose their friend King Abdullah , because while it may be " so obvious " to Col .
Ali , I 'm sure the rest of us are " too stupid " to work that one out .
And is n't Jordan in precisely the opposite direction to Iran ?
Is it because they 'd get Double Points and one Free Go ?
I think I 'll advise the Virtual Colonel to stick to Solitaire .
Time for one more .
Our journalist looks out of the window and sees the Manee Al - Manee ; how puny is that ?
And he has been invented as a " a political analyst from Dammam " .
OK , Manee , analyze away .
When you think about the whole situation , USA wants to put itself in every single detail about the world , said Manee Al - Manee , a political analyst from Dammam .
Israel is using nuclear weapons against children with stones .
Duh !
We 've really hit rock - bottom here !
Perhaps our journo knows he's on a loser , and has lit up the Wacky - Baccy in desperation .
Now he 's telling us about nuclear craters in Gaza and the West Bank , with forlorn pairs of child 's sandals lying by the edge , just because a kid threw stones .
Rule 1 : Do n't smoke stuff .
Rule 2 : If you do smoke stuff , do n't write anything , just stare into the distance with a silly smile and wait for it to wear off .
Like I said , " Virtual Experts " is a Good Idea turned by lousy execution into a Bad Idea .
Poor old Prince Saud , first he comes out with a complete load of bollocks , and then his little gang of imaginary friends manage to out - drivel him , and make the whole thing a bad joke .
But that , for Saudi journalism , is as Good As It Gets .
Perhaps they should listen to the advice of world - famous Psychology expert Tab Qwerty who says , " A period of prolonged silence will not cure innate stupidity , but it can conceal it for a length of time " .
Running a newspaper is a tough business these days .
It always cost money to send out reporters and photographers to collect the stories , but nowadays they are forced to publish on the Internet so that cheap people like me can read for free .
Less revenue minus the same costs equals reducing profits .
What are they to do ?
The " Saudi Gazette " thinks it has found the answer .
Well , they 've had a Good Idea .
But they should realize what more or less everyone else knows .
A Good Idea is not enough .
To be any good , it has to be put into practice well .
Because if it 's cocked up , then it 's just another Bad Idea .

That was their first mistake .
The second mistake was that they gave them silly names , names that do n't come up with real people when you Google them , you 'll see what I mean .
The Gazette first wheeled out its experts when tackling the question of religous intolerance in Saudi Arabia .
Who could forget such gems as .... But Hakeem added any person can practice his faith alone like what is happening in many places around the world such as the Vatican that does not have any mosques as Saudi Arabia has no churches ..... and my special favorite ....
As a country that follows Islam , starting with its flag that has Allah 's name on it , we are obeying the orders of Qur'an and Sunna by stopping any one from practicing any religion other than Islam in public ..... for its sheer lack of logic combined with total self - certainty .
For its latest article , the Gazette is treating us to a completely new set of " experts " .
The article itself concerns Mahmoud " I'm Mad and I'm Bad " Ahmadinejad 's nuclear plans , and the official Saudi viewpoint from our own esteemed Foreign Minister .
Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud said that the West was partly responsible for the current standoff with Iran over its nuclear policy because it had helped Israel develop its own nuclear weapon store .
Now it will come as no surprise to you in the West that you are " partly responsible " .
Only partly , you note .

So it 's you and the Jooos .
It 's always you and the Jooos .

And when I last looked , they were all " Muslim Arab countries " .
So I 'm curious as to whether Sheikh Muhammed Ayoub of Riyadh is a scholar or a military expert .
Let 's Google him Ah!
Perhaps he is the Sheikh Muhammed Ayoub , the Imam from Madinah , who is famous for his 32 - CD recitation of the Holy Quran ?
It 's possible , because reading a 1400 - year - old book aloud for several hours can give you unique insights into 21st - Century Middle East geopolitics .
But it can't be him , because our guy is from Riyadh , not Madinah .
So he does look like another " Fake Sheikh " .
But a virtual one this time , not a real one .
And it 's probable that when our journalist was looking around for the name of an " expert " , his eyes lighted upon the pride of his CD collection , ( and indeed , who could miss 32 of them all in a row ? ) , and his search was over .
Let 's have another .
Let 's have a military expert .
Ali Muhammed , retired colonel and expert on military affairs , said , The USA is using Iran as a play card to start moving to Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia .

Not only that , if you want a military expert , you need a good military title , a General of some description , but not a mere Colonel and a retired one at that .
Particularly when our armies and our Colonels do n't have a great reputation in the wider world .
( thanks David ) .
Leadership may be the greatest weakness of Arab training systems .
A sergeant first class in the U.S. Army has as much authority as a colonel in an Arab army .
Anyway , enough nit-picking .
What does our " expert " Colonel / Sergeant have to say ?
The USA is using Iran as ato start moving to Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia .

I think I 'll advise the Virtual Colonel to stick to Solitaire .
Time for one more .
Our journalist looks out of the window and sees the Al - Manee Furniture Manufacturing showroom .
" That 's a great name " , he thinks , " all I need now is a first name " .
But by this time his brain is hurting and he 's really running out of inspiration .
All he can manage to come up with is Al - Manee ; how puny is that ?
And he has been invented as a " a political analyst from Dammam " .
OK , Manee , analyze away .

Like I said , " Virtual Experts " is a Good Idea turned by lousy execution into a Bad Idea .
Poor old Prince Saud , first he comes out with a complete load of bollocks , and then his little gang of imaginary friends manage to out - drivel him , and make the whole thing a bad joke .
But that , for Saudi journalism , is as Good As It Gets .
Perhaps they should listen to the advice of world - famous Psychology expert Tab Qwerty who says , " A period of prolonged silence will not cure innate stupidity , but it can conceal it for a length of time " .

" Fake Sheikh " strikes again
It 's been rather a tragic week , so let 's finish with something a bit lighter .
And where better to find that in one of the UK tabloids .
I always make a point of looking at these comics for grown - ups , because if you keep reading the serious stuff , then there 's a whole world that just passes you by .
Particularly if you do n't watch " Celebrity Big Brother " either .
For example , who would know that rebel MP George Galloway , the ultra- aggressive son of Glasgow who roared at a US Congressional hearing and seemed to stun it into silence , was
And indeed , who would care ?
But there is one character in today 's tabloids whom we 've come across before .
Remember the " shaky Sheikh " , aka Mazher Mahmood ?
As I pointed out in
However , he 's taken lots of people in .
For some reason , when some people spot this pseudo - Saudi , they get a bad attack of verbal dysentery , it all comes spilling out , they just can't help it .
Perhaps it 's the sight of the thobe and ghutra that causes people to relax and reveal their most intimate thoughts .
Especially Royals , who are supposed to be ultra - discreet and keep well away from politics .
Thus he got Countess Sophie to say of Prime Minister Blair and wife ....
He 's ignorant of the countryside .
His wife is even worse , she hates the countryside .
She hates it !
.... at the time when politicians were discussing the controversial legislation to ban fox - hunting .
He also got Britain's " favorite Royal " , Princess Michael of Kent , to share these private thoughts with the " Fake Sheikh " , his hidden tape - recorder , and five million readers .
DIANA was a " bitter " , " nasty " and " strange " woman by the time she died .
CHARLES was deeply jealous of his first wife 's popularity .
CAMILLA WILL be crowned Queen — despite the Royal Family 's insistence she 'll remain Princess Consort — and Charles will NEVER step aside to let William be King .
SNEERS that Camilla may seem to be nice but adds cattily that " .. nice is very easy " .
CONFIRMS claims that Diana caught Charles on their honeymoon whispering words of love to Camilla .
SPECULATES on the Queen 's mental state as she grows older .
REVEALS that the Queen still finds it difficult to accept Charles ' marriage to Camilla .
So by now , you would expect that any British celeb would run a mile whenever they saw a thobe and ghutra bearing down on them .
But Mazher Mahmood is no fool .
He picked on his latest victim somewhere where he could blend in with the surroundings .
In Dubai .
Having said that , if you 've never been there , you may find it hard to believe but native Arabs are actually quite rare in Dubai .
They have so many expatriates there , including the Police , it looks like a suburb of Bombay .
A friend of mine once spent a wasted hour in the central shopping square , trying to find an Arabic speaker in any of the electrical shops .
Lots of tourists go there expecting it to be wall - to - wall Arabs , and then discover that to meet them they have to go on a specially - packaged air - conditioned " no - dust no - flies camping trip " ten miles out into the desert , ( misleadingly advertised " The Empty Quarter " so they all imagine they are following the footsteps of
However , the latest victim probably did n't realize that .
Go to Dubai , you expect to meet Arabs .
And he did .
The victim was no less than Sven - Goran Eriksson , Manager of the England soccer team .
Sven is actually a very good manager .
However he's not one to jump up and down on the touchline , shouting and waving his arms .
He 's more the quiet " whisper in the ear in the dressing room " sort of motivator .
In public he comes across with all the charisma of a Swedish funeral director .
Mind you , it 's a funny thing about Swedish funeral directors , women go wild for them .
Seriously .
And always stunningly good - looking and sophisticated women .
Sven has probably had more good - looking young women on his arm than Brad Pitt .
Anyway ,
The Swede was quoted as saying he was prepared to leave his current job to work for the Arab businessman , who claimed he could take over the Premiership club .
.... Eriksson was quoted as saying : " Aston Villa is for sale .
The chairman is an old man today .
He 's sick . "
Moral : never make personal comments about other people when talking to a Saudi who has his trousers sticking out at the bottom .
I do n't think the Chairman of Aston Villa is the only one feeling sick today .
Sven also started to boast of his relationship with superstar David Beckham .
It is also claimed Eriksson suggested he could persuade David Beckham to join him at Villa .
Eriksson was quoted as saying : " I 'll phone Beckham .
Beckham and I , we have a relationship like that ( he crossed his fingers ) .
We are friends , but a lot of respect .
" He will come back tomorrow .
And it 's up to me to convince him that this is the right place to be . "
Yes .
Right .
He could persuade Beckham to leave Real Madrid and play for Aston Villa .
That 's like Peyton Manning leaving the Indianapolis Colts to play for the Amsterdam Admirals .
Oh what silly things we say when we try to impress Saudis with prayer beads .
I apologize to those who have zero interest in European soccer , but can't you see why I love this man ?
( Mazher Mahmood , that is , not Sven , I 'm not Sven 's type ) .
In spite of all the loony Imams and oily Ambassadors and lying Princes , he demonstrates that people still completely trust us , if there 's something in it for them .
So it 's on with the thobe and ghutra , get swinging those beads , I 'm off to sell timeshares in Windsor Castle .
" Work is the Curse of the Blogging Classes " .
So it is for me as well .
Pressure of work and family commitments will mean that posting will be spasmodic over the next five weeks or so .
I need to get a better - paying and easier job .
I had this idea for selling time - shares in Windsor Castle to gullible tourists .
It 's been rather a tragic week , so let 's finish with something a bit lighter .
And where better to find that in one of the UK tabloids .

For example , who would know that rebel MP George Galloway , the ultra- aggressive son of Glasgow who roared at a US Congressional hearing and seemed to stun it into silence , was just a pussy - cat at heart ?
Here he is , pretending to lick milk out of Rula Lenska 's ( I know .
Celeb ?
Who ? ) hand .
Or how else would we know that Jennifer is fuming with Brad because he did n't tell her that Angelina is pregnant
And indeed , who would care ?
But there is one character in today 's tabloids whom we 've come across before .
Remember the " shaky Sheikh " , aka Mazher Mahmood ?
As I pointed out in an earlier post , any Saudi will tell you that the " News of the World " undercover reporter is not the real deal .
For a start , his trousers are sticking out from underneath his thobe , which makes him start to look like someone in Pakistani national attire .
Secondly , he 's not whacking his prayer beads back and forth around his wrist , he 's holding them gently like Sister Francesca saying her rosary .
However , he 's taken lots of people in .
For some reason , when some people spot this pseudo - Saudi , they get a bad attack of verbal dysentery , it all comes spilling out , they just can't help it .
Perhaps it 's the sight of the thobe and ghutra that causes people to relax and reveal their most intimate thoughts .

SIR ISAIAH BERLIN , a Latvian - born Oxford philosopher who died in 1997 , may well have ranked among the greatest conversationalists who ever lived .
According to Robert Darnton , a Princeton historian , Berlin 's friends would “ watch him as if he were a trapeze artist , soaring through every imaginable subject , spinning , flipping , hanging by his heels and without a touch of showmanship ” .
Darnton reckoned that Berlin 's only match in relatively modern times might have been Denis Diderot , an 18th - century French Enlightenment philosopher .
By one account Diderot 's conversation was “ enlivened by absolute sincerity , subtle without obscurity , varied in its forms , dazzling in its flights of imagination , fertile in ideas and in its capacity to inspire ideas in others .
One let oneself drift along with it for hours at a time , as if one were gliding down a fresh and limpid river , whose banks were adorned with rich estates and beautiful houses . ”
Churchill was another magnificent talker , perhaps the greatest of the 20th century , but often a poor listener .
Virginia Woolf was given , in the words of one biographer , to “ wonderful performances in conversation , spinning off into fantastic fabrications while everyone sat around and , as it were , applauded ” .
A short list of the greatest living conversationalists in English would probably have to include Christopher Hitchens , Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor , Sir Tom Stoppard , Studs Terkel and Gore Vidal .
Great brilliance , fantastic powers of recall and quick wit are clearly valuable in sustaining conversation at these cosmic levels .
Charm may be helpful too — although Samuel Johnson , one of the most admired conversationalists of 18th - century England , seemed to manage without much of it .
For those of more modest accomplishments , but attached to conversation as one of life 's pleasures and necessary skills , there is a lively market in manuals and tip - sheets going back almost 500 years , and a legacy of wisdom with an even longer history .
One striking thing about the advice is how consistent it remains over time , suggesting that there are real rights and wrongs in conversation , not just local conventions .
The principle that it is rude to interrupt another speaker goes back at least to Cicero , writing in 44BC , who said that good conversation required “ alternation ” among participants .
In his essay “ On Duties ” , Cicero remarked that nobody , to his knowledge , had yet set down the rules for ordinary conversation , though many had done so for public speaking .
He had a shot at it himself , and quickly arrived at the sort of list that self - help authors have been echoing ever since .
The rules we learn from Cicero are these : speak clearly ; speak easily but not too much , especially when others want their turn ; do not interrupt ; be courteous ; deal seriously with serious matters and gracefully with lighter ones ; never criticise people behind their backs ; stick to subjects of general interest ; do not talk about yourself ; and , above all , never lose your temper .
Probably only two cardinal rules were lacking from Cicero 's list : remember people 's names , and be a good listener .
Each of these pieces of advice also has a long pedigree .
At a pinch you might trace the point about names back to Plato .
Both found a persuasive modern advocate in Dale Carnegie , a teacher of public speaking who decided in 1936 that Americans needed educating more broadly in “ the fine art of getting along ” .
His book “ How to Win Friends and Influence People ” is still in print 70 years later and has sold 15 m copies .
To remember names , and to listen well , are two of Carnegie 's “ six ways to make people like you ” .
The others are to become genuinely interested in other people ; smile ; talk in terms of the other person 's interests ; and make the other person feel important .
Cicero's rules of conversation seem to have been fairly common across cultures as well as time , if varying in strictness .
It might reasonably be said that Italians are more tolerant of interruption , Americans of contradiction and the English of formality , for example .
These rules of conversation also intersect with those of politeness more generally , as formulated by two American linguists , Penelope Brown and Steven Levinson , the pioneers of “ politeness theory ” .
Courtesy counts
The Brown and Levinson model says , roughly speaking , that Person A probably does not want to be rude to Person B , but in the way of things , life may sometimes require Person A to contradict or intrude on Person B , and when that happens , Person A has a range of “ politeness strategies ” to draw on .
There are four main possibilities , given in ascending order of politeness .
The first is a “ bald , on - record ” approach : “ I 'm going to shut the window . ”
The second is positive politeness , or a show of respect : “ I 'm going to shut the window , is that OK ? ”
The third is negative politeness , which presumes that the request will be an intrusion or an inconvenience : “ I 'm sorry to disturb you , but I want to shut the window . ”
The fourth is an indirect strategy which does not insist on a course of action at all : “ Gosh , it 's cold in here . ”
The first three of those options are plain instrumental speech , and are the sort of approaches that the conversation manuals warn you against .
The fourth one alone leads into the realm of conversation as such .
Here the purpose of speaking is not so much to get a point across , more to find out what others think about it .
This principle of co-operation is one of the things that sets conversation apart from other superficially similar activities such as lectures , debates , arguments and meetings .
Other qualities which help to define conversation include the equal distribution of speaker rights ; mutual respect among speakers ; spontaneity and informality ; and a non-businesslike ambience .
The last of these was well caught by Johnson when he defined conversation as “ talk beyond that which is necessary to the purposes of actual business ” .
If conversation , and politeness , do have common features across time and culture , it is not all that surprising that newer manuals will find little to add in terms of fundamental principles .
They can , however , offer specific tips which are useful in the right circumstances , and these , too , change little with the years .
“ Never recount your dreams in public , ” wrote the anonymous author of “ Maximes de la Bienséance en la Conversation ” , one of the first manuals of conversation published in France , in 1618 .
Margaret Shepherd , author of “ The Art of Civilized Conversation ” , a manual published in America in 2006 , offers the same prohibition .
Among the ill - judged remarks that she calls “ saboteurs of small talk ” , she includes “ self - absorbed comments like ‘ I had the strangest dream .
You were in it .
Uh , let me try to remember it ' . ”
The more modern the manual of conversation , the more concrete its advice is likely to be .
Ms Shepherd offers seven quick ways to tell if you are boring your listeners , which include : “ Never speak uninterrupted for more than four minutes at a time ” and “ If you are the only person who still has a plate full of food , stop talking . ”
Her checklist of things best not said to the parent of a newborn baby should be memorised for future use .
It comprises : “ What 's wrong with his nose ? ” “ Should he be that colour ? ” “ Is n't he awfully small ? ” “ Should n't you be breast - feeding ? ” “ Did you want a boy ? ” “ Is he a good baby ? ” “ He looks like Churchill ! / She looks like ET ! ” “ It 's really cute ! ”
It is easy enough to see the usefulness of such tips , but they capture none of the joy which comes from the mastery of conversation .
For enthusiasts conversation is an art , one of the great pleasures of life , even the basis of civilised society .
Mme de Staël , a great talker and intellectual of the French ancien régime , called conversation “ a means of reciprocally and rapidly giving one another pleasure ; of speaking just as quickly as one thinks ; of spontaneously enjoying one 's self ; of being applauded without working ... [ A ] sort of electricity that causes sparks to fly , and that relieves some people of the burden of their excess vivacity and awakens others from a state of painful apathy ” .
The Athens of Socrates and Plato , in the 5th and 4th centuries BC , is often seen as home to a first golden age of conversation .
That view has relied mainly on the writings of Plato , whose dialogues , often with Socrates as speaker , constitute “ a search among friends ... for the divine ideas of the true , the beautiful , the good ” , says a modern French scholar , Marc Fumaroli .
Bridgeman
Old French masters
The second golden age of conversation , among the French elites in the late 17th and early 18th centuries , is much better documented .
Historians associate the rise of conversation at this time with the prestige enjoyed by women in French high society , which was perhaps unique in Europe before or since .
Women ran the salons where the culture of the time was created , and their presence civilised the men they invited there .
Another factor was the leisure forced on the French aristocracy by an absolute monarchy .
Their political ambitions thwarted , the upper classes turned their energies towards entertaining themselves .
A man without conversation was liable to find himself devalued , whatever his other qualities : “ In England it was enough that Newton was the greatest mathematician of the century , ” wrote Jean d'Alembert , a French philosopher and mathematician ; “ in France he would have been expected to be agreeable too . ”
The conversation of the French salons and dinner tables became as stylised as a ballet .
The basic skills brought to the table were expected to include politesse ( sincere good manners ) , esprit ( wit ) , galanterie ( gallantry ) , complaisance ( obligingness ) , enjouement ( cheerfulness ) and flatterie .
More specific techniques would be required as the conversation took flight .
A comic mood would require displays of raillerie ( playful teasing ) , plaisanterie ( joking ) , bons mots ( epigrams ) , traits and pointes ( rhetorical figures involving “ subtle , unexpected wit ” , according to Benedetta Craveri , a historian of the period ) , and , later , persiflage ( mocking under the guise of praising ) .
Even silences had to be finely judged .
The Duc de La Rochefoucauld distinguished between an “ eloquent ” silence , a “ mocking ” silence and a “ respectful ” silence .
The mastery of such “ airs and tones ” , he said , was “ granted to few ” .
Conversation was also flourishing across the channel in the early 18th century , but for a different reason .
This was the golden age of the British coffee house .
Whereas the French salon excluded politics from polite conversation , in the British coffee house politics was a main preoccupation .
Foreign visitors remarked both on the free range of speech there and on the mingling of classes and professions .
A modern German sociologist , Jürgen Habermas , linked the coffee houses with what he called the “ rise of a public space ” outside the control of the state , or , as we might say now , civil society .
Bridgeman
But if British liberals were keen on free speech , they were much less preoccupied than their French contemporaries were with its forms and flourishes .
Dr Johnson was considered so great a talker that a contemporary compared his conversation to Titian 's painting .
But he also could sit stonily silent through a dinner that bored him , or contradict and interrupt in defiance of all common etiquette .
Even Boswell , his devoted note - taker , acknowledged his “ dogmatic roughness of manner ” .
Strong and silent
Johnson was far from the only Englishman to have matched a love of conversation with a reputation for occasional difficult silences .
As he himself said : “ A Frenchman must always be talking , whether he knows anything of the matter or not ; an Englishman is content when he has nothing to say . ”
In his book “ Democracy in America ” , Alexis de Tocqueville refers to the “ strange unsociability and reserved and taciturn disposition of the English ” .
But for Charles Dickens , another foreign visitor to America in the 19th century , it was the Americans who seemed taciturn .
He blamed this on a “ love of trade ” , which limited men's interests and made them reluctant to volunteer information for fear of tipping their hand to a competitor .
The idealisation of silence remained strong in American culture into the 20th century : think of the laconic heroes of Western films , or of Hemingway 's novels .
More recently it has been neither trade nor taciturnity , but the distractions of technology , which have seemed to threaten the quality of conversation .
George Orwell complained in 1946 that “ in very many English homes the radio is literally never turned off .
This is done with a definite purpose .
The music prevents the conversation from becoming serious or even coherent . ”
The television attracted similar comment when it became commonplace two decades later .
In 2006 an American essayist , Stephen Miller , published a book called “ Conversation : A History of a Declining Art ” , in which he worried that “ neither digital music players nor computers were invented to help people avoid real conversation , but they have that effect . ”
A reviewer of Mr Miller 's book found it “ striking ” that past generations would “ speak of conversation as a way of taking pleasure , much as a modern American might speak of an evening spent browsing the internet ” .
Bubbles
Still talking
Conversation has survived worse challenges ( Johnson thought it might be killed by a return of religious zealotry ) , and it will doubtless survive more .
For evidence that it thrives still , go into any smart New York restaurant , where the noise level will be deafening .
Or go into a Barnes & Noble or Borders bookshop and look at the shelves of manuals on how to talk better .
Most of them are aimed at people who want to talk more persuasively and engagingly in order to get on in their careers , not at people who want to engage in conversation for the sheer pleasure it affords .
But these motivations are far from exclusive .
Making friends and influencing people , to borrow the language of Dale Carnegie , amount in the end to much the same thing .
Both of them require charm , courtesy and the desire to understand the ideas and opinions of others .
And whatever the strategic objective , those will never be bad tactics .

The warning from Britain 's leading scientific academy comes amid increasing concern over the attempts by religious fundamentalists to challenge the theory of evolution in schools and colleges by teaching the idea that a god created the world , as if that were a scientific theory .
Teachers ' unions yesterday also voted to ban further government funding for faith schools .
However , delegates in Gateshead , attending the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , rejected proposals for new laws to prevent the growing influence of religious organisations in state education , including the teaching of creationism .
Last night , the Royal Society gave a public platform to Steve Jones , the award - winning geneticist and author , to deliver a lecture entitled Why Creationism Is Wrong and Evolution Is Right .
Professor Jones said that suggesting that creationism and evolution be given equal weight in education was " to me , rather like starting genetics lectures by discussing the theory that babies are brought by storks . "
The Royal Society had invited Prof Jones , of University College London , to deliver a lecture at its headquarters in London because of concern that many students now believe that creationism and evolution are equally valid theories .
An increasing number of Christian and Muslim fundamentalist students argue for a literal interpretation of the Bible or Qur'an .
Prof Jones said that a Gallup poll of teenagers in the US last year indicated that 38 % believed that God created humans within the past 10,000 years and President George Bush had said that " on the issue of evolution , the verdict is still out on how God created the Earth . "
In a BBC poll ; 48 % opted for evolution and 39 % for creationism .
" I like the quotation from Darwin , ' ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge ; it is those who know little , and not those who know much , who assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science ' , " said Prof Jones .
" Science has proof without any certainty , creationists - certainty without proof . "
He said he believed that creationists were worried that evolution showed humans to be only " chimps in dinner jackets " .
He added that " evolution is as inevitable as gravity " .
The Royal Society issued a statement aimed at " opposing the misrepresentation of evolution in schools to promote particular religious beliefs . "
It said that " young people are poorly served by deliberate attempts to withhold , distort or misrepresent scientific knowledge ... to promote particular religious beliefs . "
Professor David Read , vice - president of the society , said : " We felt that it would be timely to publish a clear statement on evolution , creationism and intelligent design as there continues to be controversy about them in the UK and other countries .
The Royal Society fully supports questioning and debate in science lessons , as long as it is not designed to undermine young people 's confidence in the value of scientific evidence . "
David Rosevear , of the Portsmouth - based Creation Science Movement , said yesterday that he was not surprised at the Royal Society 's move .
" It is an atheistic faith position , " he said .
" Atheism is as much a religion as the Church of England and they pursue it with real vigour ...
Not all scientists are evolutionists but they have to go along with it . "
In Gateshead , teachers backed a resolution stating that " the government 's policy of increasing numbers of faith schools will hinder integration , foster religious divisions and provide fertile ground for religious and ethnic conflicts . "
But after a heated debate the motion was watered down by rejecting the call for legislation to prevent the teaching of creationism .
Proposing the motion , Hank Roberts from the union 's national executive , questioned the government 's policy of increasing faith schools and doing nothing to curb religious fundamentalists such as the millionaire businessman Sir Peter Vardy and the three schools run by his Emmanuel Schools Foundation .
" No government action has been taken to prevent Sir Peter Vardy from teaching creationism in schools - actually ours , we pay for them , " he said .
" Instead of government action to stop this , which this motion calls for , what 's happening ?
Vardy is putting up a further £ 2 m to gain control of yet another school . "
A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills said : " Neither creationism nor intelligent design are taught as a subject in schools , and are not specified in the science curriculum . "
Backstory
While some creationists believe in a biblical interpretation of the creation - that God created the Earth in six days and that Adam and Eve existed - others suggest that mankind is the result of " intelligent design " by a superior being .
Creationists believe Darwin 's evolution theory should be taught as just one possibility of the development of man .
The movement enjoys widespread currency in the US and is gaining support in the UK through Christian and Muslim fundamentalists .
There is a creationist museum in Portsmouth , run by the Creation Science Movement .
Why Do " They " Hate Us ?
Is It Somehow Connected To The Way We Cut Off Their Limbs With Chainsaws ?
Before the 9/11 attacks came along , I used to work with groups trying to get the U.S. to stop funding Colombia 's right - wing paramilitaries .
The pretense , of course , was we were funding the Colombian military in their heroic struggle in the War on Drugs .
The reality , that the paramilitaries were run by the Colombian government to murder anyone to the left of Elliot Abrams , is finally being acknowledged :
The government of President Âlvaro Uribe is being shaken by its most serious political crisis yet , as details emerge about members of Congress who collaborated with right - wing death squads to spread terror and exert political control across Colombia 's Caribbean coast ...
All are from the state of Sucre , where the attorney general 's office has been exhuming bodies from mass graves ...
It 's difficult to overstate the level of human depravity exhibited by the paramilitaries .
One of their favorite techniques is to kill people with chainsaws :
" The Chainsaw Massacre is not a film in Colombia , " said government ombudsman Eduardo Cifuentes , referring to the April 12 [ 2001 ] paramilitary massacre in Alto Naya , 650 kilometers ( 404 miles ) southeast of [ Bogota ] ...
It left some 128 people dead , including 40 in Alto Naya , according to official reports quoted by Cifuentes in an interview with AFP ...
Around 400 paramilitaries took part in this " caravan of death " against civilians accused of supporting leftist guerrillas , Cifuentes said in his Bogota office .
" The remains of a woman were exhumed .
Her abdomen was cut open with a chainsaw .
A 17 - year - old girl had her throat cut and both hands also amputated , " said the ombudsman ...
" A neighbor pounced upon a paramilitary that was ready to shoot him and took his weapon , but unfortunately he did n't know how to fire a rifle .
They dragged him away , cut him open with a chainsaw and chopped him up , " a witness of the massacre told El Espectador daily .
I once attended a lunch with a Colombian union official .
He said the paramilitaries would generally warn people like him of their intentions , by visiting them and cutting their sleeves or pants where they would later cut off their arms and legs if they did n't flee the area .
Less important people did n't get warnings .
This year we 're giving Colombia approximately 600 million dollars for these appealing activities .
The biggest upswing in aid came during the last years of the Clinton administration .
What 's really neat is the paramilitaries are actually the ones controlling most of the cocaine trade in Colombia .
In other words , as part of the War on Drugs , we 're giving massive aid to some of the world 's biggest drug dealers .
If past experience is any guide , the people mentioned in the above article as investigating this ( e.g. , Colombian Senator Gustavo Petro ) have maybe four weeks to live .
SPECIAL BONUS DEPRAVITY : I once worked for a right - wing corporate lawyer who had ( 1 ) a massive cocaine addiction and ( 2 ) a Colombian maid who'd been a kindergarten teacher until she fled .
I often felt he should have made the connection explicit by telling her , " Look at me !
I can destroy your country and your life using only MY NOSE !!! "
Of course , in the long human tradition of utter indifference to those less powerful than you , he knew neither that she 'd been a kindergarten teacher nor even that she was Colombian .
Barely a day goes by that one can avoid reading or hearing yet another Israeli , American or British warhawk regurgitate the broken record that Iran 's President Ahmadinejad threatened to " wipe Israel off the map , " framed in the ridiculous context that Israelis are being targeted for a second holocaust .
This baseless rallying call for conflict holds about as much credibility as Dick Cheney 's assertion that Saddam Hussein was planning to light up American skies with mushroom clouds .
Today it 's the turn of would - be future British Prime Minister David Cameron , leader of the Conservative Party , who repeated the " wipe Israel off he map " fraud in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos , using it to qualify his refusal to rule out a military strike on Iran under a Tory government .
Did Ahmadinejad really threaten to " wipe Israel off the map " or is this phrase just another jingoistic brand slogan for selling the next war in the Middle East ?
The devil is in the detail , wiping Israel off the map suggests a physical genocidal assault , a literal population relocation or elimination akin to what the Nazis did .
According to numerous different translations , Ahmadinejad never used the word " map , " instead his statement was in the context of time and applied to the Zionist regime occupying Jerusalem .
Ahmadinejad was expressing his future hope that the Zionist regime in Israel would fall , not that Iran was going to physically annex the country and its population .
To claim Ahmadinejad has issued a rallying cry to ethnically cleanse Israel is akin to saying that Churchill wanted to murder all Germans when he stated his desire to crush the Nazis .
This is about the demise of a corrupt occupying power , not the deaths of millions of innocent people .
The Guardian 's Jonathan Steele cites four different translations , from professors to the BBC to the New York Times and even pro-Israel news outlets , in none of those translations is the word " map " used .
The closest translation to what the Iranian President actually said is , " The regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time , " or a narrow relative thereof .
In no version is the word " map " used or a context of mass genocide or hostile military action even hinted at .
The acceptance of the word " map " seemingly originated with the New York Times , who later had to back away from this false translation .
The BBC also wrongly used the word and , in comments to Steele , later accepted their mistake but refused to issue a retraction .
" The fact that he compared his desired option - the elimination of " the regime occupying Jerusalem " - with the fall of the Shah 's regime in Iran makes it crystal clear that he is talking about regime change , not the end of Israel .
As a schoolboy opponent of the Shah in the 1970's he surely did not favor Iran 's removal from the page of time .
He just wanted the Shah out , " writes Steele .
" It 's important to note that the " quote " in question was itself a quote , writes Arash Norouzi , " they are the words of the late Ayatollah Khomeini , the father of the Islamic Revolution .
Although he quoted Khomeini to affirm his own position on Zionism , the actual words belong to Khomeini and not Ahmadinejad .
Thus , Ahmadinejad has essentially been credited ( or blamed ) for a quote that is not only unoriginal , but represents a viewpoint already in place well before he ever took office . "
Professor Juan Cole concurs , arguing , " Now , some might say , " So he did n't say , ' wipe off the map , ' he said ' erase from the page . '
What 's the difference ?
Anyway he 's saying he wants to get rid of Israel .
Ahmadinejad was not making a threat , he was quoting a saying of Khomeini and urging that pro-Palestinian activists in Iran not give up hope -- that the occupation of Jerusalem was no more a continued inevitability than had been the hegemony of the Shah 's government .
Whatever this quotation from a decades - old speech of Khomeini may have meant , Ahmadinejad did not say that ' Israel must be wiped off the map ' with the implication that phrase has of Nazi - style extermination of a people .
He said that the occupation regime over Jerusalem must be erased from the page of time . "
Let 's consider for a moment that Ahmadinejad really does wish to initiate a nuclear war on Israel , is this feasible ?
It would be like Paris Hilton picking a fight with Mike Tyson .
The CIA 's own estimates put Iran five to ten years away from being able to produce one nuclear bomb even if they were in the planning stages now , which is highly unlikely given that international inspectors have found no evidence of such a program and CIA satellite imagery also shows no proof of nuclear arms .
Contrast this to an Israeli arsenal of anything up to 200 launch ready nukes allied to the might of the U.S. which has nearly 6,000 active warheads not to mention so - called " mini- nukes . "
While it can be reasonably argued that Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon at some point in the future , to then claim that this means Ahmadinejad wishes to enact a second holocaust is an unfathomable leap of logic .
The real reason for any nation in that region trying to acquire a nuclear weapon is for self defense , because they are surrounded by other hostile powers that already have the bomb .
Returning to the " wipe Israel off the map hoax , " loathe are we to forget another of the commercial jingles concocted for hoodwinking Americans into attacking a certain other Middle Eastern country - " he used weapons of mass destruction against his own people , " referring of course to Saddam Hussein 's alleged role in the Halabja massacre where Iraqi Kurds were gassed .
In reality , as former CIA analyst Stephen Pelletiere has revealed , Halabja came as a result of a battlefield exchange between the Iranians and the Iraqis after the Kurds had sided with the Iranians and allowed them to enter the city .
According to the DIA 's own report at the time , the type of gas that killed the Kurds was not used by the Iraqis but was used by the Iranians .
The incident was a tragedy of war , not a directed program of genocide at the behest of Saddam Hussein .
Whenever Bush administration officials and others used Halabja as a pretext for war , the mass media routinely failed to mention the DIA report , just as they have failed to provide any balance on the real meaning of Ahmadinejad 's statement , despite the fact that it is completely distorted almost every day and used as a call to arms as well as a propagandistic ploy to convince western populations that dark skinned invaders are hell - bent on their wholesale destruction .

John Hollenhorst reporting A seemingly unbelievable mess discovered last year in an Ogden townhouse has suddenly become an Internet legend .
It 's all TRUE !
You know how some people , after they use something , just can't bear to throw it away .
That might make sense if it 's magazines or clothes .
But what if it 's empty beer cans ?
In astounding numbers ?
When property manager Ryan Froerer got a call from a realtor last year to check on a townhouse , he knew something was up .
Ryan Froerer , Century 21 : " Said it was the sickest thing he 's ever seen .
Just unimaginable that someone could live in that . "
He could n't even open the front door .
It was blocked from inside .
Ryan Froerer , Century 21 : " There was beer cans I would say probably this high up on the door . "
The realtor had forewarned him about the smell .
Ryan Froerer , Century 21 : " He poked his head in , the smell was so awful he could n't go in . "
At the back door , Froerer was astounded by what he saw in the kitchen .
Ryan Froerer , Century 21 : " As we approached the door , there were beer boxes , all the way up to the ceiling . "
Inside , he took just a few snapshots to document the scene .
Beer cans by the tens of thousands .
Mountains of cans burying the furniture .
The water and heat were shut off , apparently on purpose by the tenant , who evidently drank Coors Light beer exclusively for the eight years he lived there .
Ryan Froerer , Century 21 : " It 's just unbelievable that a human being could live like that . "
To all outward appearances , the person who lived in the townhouse was the perfect tenant .
He always paid on time and he never complained .
He kept a low profile in the neighborhood .
Kirk Martin , Letter Carrier : : " Yeah I never delivered any mail there at all .
I thought the apartment was vacant . "
The cans were recycled for 800 dollars , an estimated 70,000 cans : 24 beers a day for 8 years .
Froerer e-mailed his photos to a couple of friends , who sent them to friends .
Now he 's getting calls from faraway places
Ryan Froerer , Century 21 : " It 's amazing how the internet can have the effect and get around .
I 'm sure it 's been around the world . "
The townhouse was cleaned up last year and it 's just fine today .
The man who lived there seems to be back on his feet .
We spoke to him today and he says he 's completely stopped drinking .
He was welcomed back to his old job a few months ago , and his co-workers speak highly of him .
Cyle Young bought a house this spring in Springfield , Ohio , planning to remodel and then flip it for a quick profit .
But the project cost a lot more than the real - estate broker expected because a band of thieves descended on the vacant house .
When Young drove by just two days after buying the property , the aluminum siding was gone .
Soon afterward , the robbers had the nerve to come back once more and rip out all the copper .
Young is just one of dozens of victims in a wave of heists in western Ohio .
The perpetrators pose as construction workers when they remove the metals from houses , apartment buildings , even churches .
Strange cases of metals theft are being reported around the nation : Bandits fled with the copper cables that pulled the vintage trolleys in Yakima , Washington .
The streetlights went out in Tucson , Arizona , when someone ran off with eight miles of copper lines .
A longtime Third World crime has suddenly become widespread here .
What ’s going on ?
In this interconnected global economy , a crime wave in Ohio must be explained by construction booms in China and India .
China is already the world ’s biggest consumer of aluminum , copper , iron , and steel .
Its hunger for materials to erect its big new cities , seemingly overnight , has caused the market rates for metals to skyrocket toward historic highs .
Aluminum , lead , silver , and platinum prices have all doubled in the past three years .
Copper and zinc prices have tripled .
Gold , that ultimate financial refuge , touched $ 730 an ounce , its loftiest price in a quarter - century .
And while commodities prices recently tumbled , the building boom wo n’t end anytime soon :
Over this decade , the world ’s roster of megacities , with populations of 5 million or more , will grow from 41 to 59 , with 48 of them in less - developed countries .
All of this means that oil is n’t the only vital natural resource in fierce demand .
If you ’re already losing sleep about the “ peak oil ” problem , it ’s time to worry about “ peak metals , ” too .
The good news is that private enterprise has a chance to create a market - driven solution to the looming metals crisis .
At IBM ’s recent Global Innovation Outlook conference , which brought together some big thinkers to hatch breakthrough ideas about the environment and other problems , one speaker captivated the audience by suggesting we could treat landfills as though they were mines–and dig up the valuable metals buried in them .
And there ’s plenty to dig for , says Patrick Atkins , the director of energy innovation at Alcoa .
North American landfills contain more aluminum than we can produce by mining ores .
He thinks the same is probably true of gold and copper , which are used in the circuit boards of computers and electronic gadgets .
One ton of scrap from discarded PCs contains more gold than can be produced from 17 tons of gold ore–and humans throw away 20 million tons of electronic waste a year .
Americans dispose of 50 million computers annually ; by the end of this decade , the Japanese alone will have trashed 610 million cell phones .
Landfill mining is a fascinating sleeper of an idea that ’s actually been around for decades .
It attracted serious interest in the early 1990s , when the EPA came out with new regulations that forced small communities to close their local dumps .
Towns such as Newbury , Massachusetts ; Edinburg , New York ; and Naples , Florida , tried mining their junk piles for metals and rubber , and burning the leftovers for energy .
But as market rates for metals fell in the mid-1990s , the whole notion no longer seemed economical .
Now , though , with commodity prices high and a wealthy player like Alcoa sniffing around the dump , landfill mining looks like an idea whose time is finally arriving .
Much of the technology for landfill mining is already proven .
As in the 1990s trials , screens and sieves could separate the soil from the waste .
The standard techniques of the recycling business would come into play : shredding the waste into very small pieces and using magnets to pull out the ferrous metals .
Then comes a new approach , pioneered by recyclers in the past few years , using rotors of magnets that spin very quickly , creating an “ eddy current ” with a strange electrical effect that makes aluminum and other nonferrous metals levitate and eject from the rest of the heap because they are both lightweight and conductive .
If Alcoa gets involved , it could use its highly secretive , proprietary process of “ fractional crystallization ” for separating alloys from each other , such as copper from aluminum .
London : Researchers are testing potentially life - saving techniques for keeping humans in a state of suspended animation while surgeons repair their wounds .
US doctors have developed a method of inducing hypothermia to shut down the body 's functions for up to three hours .
In tests , they reduced the body temperature of injured pigs from 37C to 10C before operating on them and then reviving them .
Our Cell Phones , Ourselves
Christine Rosen
Hell is other people , ” Sartre observed , but you need not be a misanthrope or a diminutive French existentialist to have experienced similar feelings during the course of a day .
No matter where you live or what you do , in all likelihood you will eventually find yourself participating in that most familiar and exasperating of modern rituals : unwillingly listening to someone else ’s cell phone conversation .
Like the switchboard operators of times past , we are now all privy to calls being put through , to the details of loved ones contacted , appointments made , arguments aired , and gossip exchanged .
Today , more people have cell phones than fixed telephone lines , both in the United States and internationally .
There are more than one billion cell phone users worldwide , and as one wireless industry analyst recently told Slate , “ some time between 2010 and 2020 , everyone who wants and can afford a cell phone will have one . ”
Americans spend , on average , about seven hours a month talking on their cell phones .
Wireless phones have become such an important part of our everyday lives that in July , the country ’s major wireless industry organization featured the following “ quick poll ” on its website : “ If you were stranded on a desert island and could have one thing with you , what would it be ? ”
The choices : “ Matches / Lighter , ” “ Food / Water , ” “ Another Person , ” “ Wireless Phone . ”
The World Health Organization has even launched an “ International EMF Project ” to study the possible health effects of the electromagnetic fields created by wireless technologies .
But if this ubiquitous technology is now a normal part of life , our adjustment to it has not been without consequences .
Especially in the United States , where cell phone use still remains low compared to other countries , we are rapidly approaching a tipping point with this technology .
How has it changed our behavior , and how might it continue to do so ?
What new rules ought we to impose on its use ?
Most importantly , how has the wireless telephone encouraged us to connect individually but disconnect socially , ceding , in the process , much that was civil and civilized about the use of public space ?
Untethered
Connection has long served as a potent sign of power .
In the era before cell phones , popular culture served up presidents , tin - pot dictators , and crime bosses who were never far from a prominently placed row of phones , demonstrating their importance at the hub of a vast nexus .
Similarly , superheroes always owned special communications devices : Batman had the Batphone , Dick Tracy his wrist - phone , Maxwell Smart his shoe spy phone .
( In the Flash comics of the 1940s , the hero simply outraces phone calls as they are made , avoiding altogether the need for special communication devices . )
To be able to talk to anyone , at any time , without the mediator of the human messenger and without the messenger ’s attendant delays , is a thoroughly modern triumph of human engineering .
In 1983 , Motorola introduced DynaTAC , now considered the first truly mobile telephone , and by the end of that year , the first commercial cellular phone systems were being used in Chicago and in the Baltimore / Washington , D.C. area .
Nokia launched its own mobile phone , the cumbersome Cityman , in 1987 .
Americans were introduced to the glamour of mobile telephone communication that same year in a scene from the movie Wall Street .
In it , the ruthless Gordon Gekko ( played by Michael Douglas ) self - importantly conducts his business on the beach using a large portable phone .
These first - generation cell phones were hardly elegant — many people called them “ luggables ” rather than “ portables , ” and as one reporter noted in The Guardian , “ mobiles of that era are often compared to bricks , but this is unfair .
Bricks are quite attractive and relatively light . ”
But they made up in symbolic importance what they lacked in style ; only the most powerful and wealthiest people owned them .
Indeed , in the 1980s , the only other people besides the elite and medical professionals who had mobile technologies at all ( such as pagers ) were presumed to be using them for nefarious reasons .
Who else but a roving drug dealer or prostitute would need to be accessible at all times ?
This changed in the 1990s , when cell phones became cheaper , smaller , and more readily available .
The technology spread rapidly , as did the various names given to it : in Japan it is keitai , in China it ’s sho ji , Germans call their cell phones handy , in France it is le portable or le G , and in Arabic , el mobile , telephone makhmul , or telephone gowal .
In countries where cell phone use is still limited to the elite — such as Bulgaria , where only 2.5 percent of the population can afford a cell phone — its power as a symbol of wealth and prestige remains high .
But in the rest of the world , it has become a technology for the masses .
There were approximately 340,000 wireless subscribers in the United States in 1985 , according to the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Associate ( CTIA ) ; by 1995 , that number had increased to more than 33 million , and by 2003 , more than 158 million people in the country had gone wireless .
Why do people use cell phones ?
The most frequently cited reason is convenience , which can cover a rather wide range of behaviors .
Writing in the Wall Street Journal this spring , an executive for a wireless company noted that “ in Slovakia , people are using mobile phones to remotely switch on the heat before they return home , ” and in Norway , “ 1.5 million people can confirm their tax returns ” using cell phone short text messaging services .
Paramedics use camera phones to send ahead to hospitals pictures of the incoming injuries ; “ in Britain , it is now commonplace for wireless technology to allow companies to remotely access meters or gather diagnostic information . ”
Construction workers on - site can use cell phones to send pictures to contractors off - site .
Combined with the individual use of cell phones — to make appointments , locate a friend , check voicemail messages , or simply to check in at work — cell phones offer people a heretofore unknown level of convenience .
More than ninety percent of cell phone users also report that owning a cell phone makes them feel safer .
The CTIA noted that in 2001 , nearly 156,000 wireless emergency service calls were made every day — about 108 calls per minute .
Technological Good Samaritans place calls to emergency personnel when they see traffic accidents or crimes - in - progress ; individuals use their cell phones to call for assistance when a car breaks down or plans go awry .
The safety rationale carries a particular poignancy after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
On that day , many men and women used cell phones to speak their final words to family and loved ones .
Passengers on hijacked airplanes called wives and husbands ; rescue workers on the ground phoned in to report their whereabouts .
As land lines in New York and Washington , D.C. , became clogged , many of us made or received frantic phone calls on cell phones — to reassure others that we were safe or to make sure that our friends and family were accounted for .
Many people who had never considered owning a cell phone bought one after September 11th .
If the cultural image we had of the earliest cell phones was of a technology glamorously deployed by the elite , then the image of cell phones today has to include people using them for this final act of communication , as well as terrorists who used cell phones as detonators in the bombing of trains in Madrid .
Of course , the perceived need for a technological safety device can encourage distinctly irrational behavior and create new anxieties .
Recently , when a professor at Rutgers University asked his students to experiment with turning off their cell phones for 48 hours , one young woman told University Wire , “ I felt like I was going to get raped if I did n’t have my cell phone in my hand .
I carry it in case I need to call someone for help . ”
Popular culture endorses this image of cell - phone - as - life - line .
The trailer for a new suspense movie , Cellular , is currently making the rounds in theaters nationwide .
In it , an attractive young man is shown doing what young men apparently do with their camera - enabled cell phones : taking pictures of women in bikinis and e-mailing the images to himself .
When he receives a random but desperate phone call from a woman who claims to be the victim of a kidnapping , he finds himself drawn into a race to find and save her , all the while trying to maintain that tenuous cell phone connection .
It is indicative of our near - fetishistic attachment to our cell phones that we can relate ( and treat as a serious moment of suspense ) a scene in the movie where the protagonist , desperately trying to locate a cell phone charger before his battery runs out , holds the patrons of an electronics store at gunpoint until the battery is rejuvenated .
After scenes of high - speed car chases and large explosions , the trailer closes with a disembodied voice asking the hero , “ How did you get involved ? ”
His response ?
“ I just answered my phone . ”
Many parents have responded to this perceived need for personal security by purchasing cell phones for their children , but this , too , has had some unintended consequences .
One sociologist has noted that parents who do this are implicitly commenting on their own sense of security or insecurity in society .
“ Claiming to care about their children ’s safety , ” Chantal de Gournay writes , “ parents develop a ‘ paranoiac ’ vision of the community , reflecting a lack of trust in social institutions and in any environment other than the family . ”
As a result , they choose surveillance technologies , such as cell phones , to monitor their children , rather than teaching them ( and trusting them ) to behave appropriately .
James E. Katz , a communications professor at Rutgers who has written extensively about wireless communication , argues that parents who give children cell phones are actually weakening the traditional bonds of authority ; “ parents think they can reach kids any time they want , and thus are more indulgent of their children ’s wanderings , ” Katz notes .
Not surprisingly , “ my cell phone battery died ” has become a popular excuse among teenagers for failure to check in with their parents .
And I suspect nearly everyone , at some point , has suffered hours of panic when a loved one who was supposed to be “ reachable ” failed to answer the cell phone .
Although cell phones are a technology with broad appeal , we do not all use our cell phones in the same way .
In June 2004 , Cingular announced that “ for the fourth year in a row , men prove to be the more talkative sex in the wireless world , ” talking 16 percent more on their phones than women .
Women , however , are more likely to use a cell phone “ to talk to friends and family ” while men use theirs for business — including , evidently , the business of mating .
Researchers found that “ men are using their mobile phones as peacocks use their immobilizing feathers and male bullfrogs use their immoderate croaks :
To advertise to females their worth , status , and desirability , ” reported the New York Times .
The researchers also discovered that many of the men they observed in pubs and nightclubs carried fake cell phones , likely one of the reasons they titled their paper “ Mobile Phones as Lekking Devices Among Human Males , ” a lek being a “ communal mating area where males gather to engage in flamboyant courtship displays . ”
Or , as another observer of cell phone behavior succinctly put it : “ the mobile is widely used for psychosexual purposes of performance and display . ”
The increasingly sophisticated accessories available on cell phones encourage such displays .
One new phone hitting the market boasts video capture and playback , a 1.2 megapixel camera , a 256 color screen , speakerphone , removable memory , mp3 player , Internet access , and a global positioning system .
The Wall Street Journal recently reported on cell phones that will feature radios , calculators , alarm clocks , flashlights , and mirrored compacts .
Phones are “ becoming your Swiss army knife , ” one product developer enthused .
Hyperactive peacocking will also be abetted by the new walkie - talkie function available on many phones , which draws further attention to the user by broadcasting to anyone within hearing distance the conversation of the person on the other end of the phone .
With all these accoutrements , it is not surprising that one contributor to a discussion list about wireless technology recently compared cell phones and BlackBerrys to “ electronic pets . ”
Speaking to a group of business people , he reported , “ you constantly see people taking their little pets out and stroking the scroll wheel , coddling them , basically ‘ petting ’ them . ”
When confined to a basement conference room , he found that participants “ were compelled to ‘ walk ’ their electronic pets on breaks ” to check their messages .
In parts of Asia , young women carry their phones in decorated pouches , worn like necklaces , or in pants with specially designed pockets that keep the phone within easy reach .
We have become thigmophilic with our technology — touch - loving — a trait we share with rats , as it happens .
We are constantly taking them out , fiddling with them , putting them away , taking them out again , reprogramming their directories , text messaging .
And cell phone makers are always searching for new ways to exploit our attachments .
Nokia offers “ expression ” phones that allow customization of faceplates and ring tones .
Many companies , such as Modtones , sell song samples for cell phone ringers .
In Asia , where cell phone use among the young is especially high , companies offer popular anime and manga cartoons as downloadable “ wallpaper ” for cell phones .
Cell phone technology is also creating new forms of social and political networking .
“ Moblogging , ” or mobile web logging , allows cell phone users to publish and update content to the World Wide Web .
An increasing number of companies are offering cell phones with WiFi capability , and as Sadie Plant noted recently in a report she prepared for Motorola , “ On the Mobile , ” “ today , the smallest Motorola phone has as much computing power in it as the largest , most expensive computer did less than a generation ago . ”
In his Forbes “ Wireless Outlook ” newsletter , Andrew Seybold predicted , “ in twenty five years there are n’t going to be any wired phones left and I think it might happen even much sooner than that — ten to fifteen years . ”
As well , “ the phone will be tied much more closely to the person .
Since the phone is the person , the person will be the number . ”
It is n’t surprising that one of Seybold ’s favorite movies is the James Coburn paranoid comedy , The President ’s Analyst ( 1967 ) , whose premise “ centered on attempts by the phone company to capture the president ’s psychoanalyst in order to further a plot to have phone devices implanted in people ’s brains at birth . ”
Ma Bell meets
The Manchurian Candidate .
Dodgeball.com , a new social - networking service , applies the principles of websites such as Friendster to cell phones .
“ Tell us where you are and we ’ll tell you who and what is around you , ” Dodgeball promises .
“ We ’ll ping your friends with your whereabouts , let you know when friends - of - friends are within ten blocks , allow you to broadcast content to anyone within ten blocks of you or blast messages to your groups of friends . ”
The service is now available in fifteen cities in the U.S. , enabling a form of friendly pseudo - stalking .
“ I was at Welcome to the Johnson ’s and a girl came up behind me and gave a tap on the shoulder , ” one recent testimonial noted .
“ ‘ Are you this guy ? ’ she inquired while holding up her cell phone to show my Dodgeball photo .
I was indeed . ”
Political organizers have also found cell phone technology to be a valuable tool .
Throughout 2000 in the Philippines , the country ’s many cell phone users were text - messaging derogatory slogans and commentary about then - President Joseph Estrada .
With pressure on the Estrada administration mounting , activists organized large demonstrations against the president by activating cell phone “ trees ” to summon protesters to particular locations and to outmaneuver riot police .
Estrada was forced from office in January 2001 .
Anti-globalization protesters in Seattle and elsewhere ( using only non-corporate cell phones , surely ) have employed the technology to stage and control movements during demonstrations .
Communication Delinquents
The ease of mobile communication does not guarantee positive results for all those who use it , of course , and the list of unintended negative consequences from cell phone use continues to grow .
The BBC world service reported in 2001 , “ senior Islamic figures in Singapore have ruled that Muslim men cannot divorce their wives by sending text messages over their mobile phones . ”
( Muslims can divorce their wives by saying the word “ talaq , ” which means “ I divorce you , ” three times ) .
Concerns about the dangers of cell phone use while driving have dominated public discussion of cell phone risks .
A 2001 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated that “ 54 percent of drivers ‘ usually ’ have some type of wireless phone in their vehicle with them ” and that this translates into approximately 600,000 drivers “ actively using cell phones at any one time ” on the road .
Women and drivers in the suburbs were found to talk and drive more often , and “ the highest national use rates were observed for drivers of vans and sport utility vehicles . ”
New York , New Jersey , and Washington , D.C. all require drivers to use hands - free technology ( headsets or speakerphones ) when talking on the cell .
Cell phones can also play host to viruses , real and virtual .
A 2003 study presented at the American Society for Microbiology ’s conference on infectious disease found that twelve percent of the cell phones used by medical personnel in an Israeli hospital were contaminated with bacteria .
( Another recent cell phone - related health research result , purporting a link between cell phone use and decreased sperm counts , has been deemed inconclusive . )
The first computer virus specifically targeting cell phones was found in late June .
As The Guardian reported recently , anti-virus manufacturers believe that “ the mobile phone now mirrors how the Net has developed over the past two or three years — blighted with viruses as people got faster connections and downloaded more information . ”
With technology comes addiction , and applicable neologisms have entered the lexicon — such as “ crackberry , ” which describes the dependence exhibited by some BlackBerry wireless users .
In a 2001 article in New York magazine about feuding couples , one dueling duo , Dave and Brooke , traded barbs about her wireless addictions .
“ I use it when I ’m walking down the street , ” Brooke said proudly .
“ She was checking her voice mail in the middle of a Seder ! ” was Dave ’s exasperated response .
“ Under the table ! ” Brooke clarified .
A recent survey conducted by the Hospital of Seoul National University found that “ 3 out of 10 Korean high school students who carry mobile phones are reported to be addicted ” to them .
Many reported feeling anxious without their phones and many displayed symptoms of repetitive stress injury from obsessive text messaging .
The cell phone has also proven effective as a facilitator and alibi for adulterous behavior .
“ I heard someone ( honest ) talking about their ‘ shag phone ’ the other day , ” a visitor to a wireless technology blog recently noted .
“ He was a married man having an affair with a lady who was also married .
It seems that one of the first heady rituals of the affair was to purchase a ‘ his and her ’ pair of pre-pay shag phones . ”
A recent story in the New York Times documented the use of cell phone “ alibi and excuse clubs ” that function as an ethically challenged form of networking — Dodgeball for the delinquent .
“ Cell phone - based alibi clubs , which have sprung up in the United States , Europe , and Asia , allow people to send out mass text messages to thousands of potential collaborators asking for help .
When a willing helper responds , the sender and the helper devise a lie , and the helper then calls the victim with the excuse , ” the report noted .
One woman who started her own alibi club , which has helped spouses cheat on each other and workers mislead their bosses , “ said she was not terribly concerned about lying , ” although she did concede : “ You would n’t really want your friends to know you ’re sparing people ’s feelings with these white lies . ”
Websites such as Kargo offer features like “ Soundster , ” which allows users to “ insert sounds into your call and control your environment . ”
Car horns , sirens , the coughs and sniffles of the sick room — all can be simulated in order to fool the listener on the other end of the call .
Technology , it seems , is allowing people to make instrumental use of anonymous strangers while maintaining the appearance of trustworthiness within their own social group .
Technology has also led to further incursions on personal privacy .
Several websites now offer “ candid pornography , ” peeping - Tom pictures taken in locker rooms , bathrooms , and dressing rooms by unscrupulous owners of cell phone cameras .
Camera phones pose a potentially daunting challenge to privacy and security ; unlike old - fashioned cameras , which could be confiscated and the film destroyed , digital cameras , including those on cell phones , allow users to send images instantaneously to any e-mail address .
The images can be stored indefinitely , and the evidence that a picture was ever taken can be destroyed .
Will You Please Be Quiet , Please ?
Certain public interactions carry with them certain unspoken rules of behavior .
When approaching a grocery store checkout line , you queue behind the last person in line and wait your turn .
On the subway , you make way for passengers entering and exiting the cars .
Riding on the train , you expect the interruptions of the ticket taker and the periodic crackling blare of station announcements .
What you never used to expect , but must now endure , is the auditory abrasion of a stranger arguing about how much he does , indeed , owe to his landlord .
I ’ve heard business deals , lovers ’ quarrels , and the most unsavory gossip .
I ’ve listened to strangers discuss in excruciating detail their own and others ’ embarrassing medical conditions ; I ’ve heard the details of recent real estate purchases , job triumphs , and awful dates .
( The only thing I have n’t heard is phone sex , but perhaps it is only a matter of time . )
We are no longer overhearing , which implies accidentally stumbling upon a situation where two people are talking in presumed privacy .
Now we are all simply hearing .
The result is a world where social space is overtaken by anonymous , unavoidable background noise — a quotidian narration that even in its more interesting moments rarely rises above the tone of a penny dreadful .
It seems almost cruel , in this context , that Motorola ’s trademarked slogan for its wireless products is “ Intelligence Everywhere . ”
Why do these cell phone conversations bother us more than listening to two strangers chatter in person about their evening plans or listening to a parent scold a recalcitrant child ?
Those conversations are quantitatively greater , since we hear both sides of the discussion — so why are they nevertheless experienced as qualitatively different ?
Perhaps it is because cell phone users harbor illusions about being alone or assume a degree of privacy that the circumstances do n’t actually allow .
Because cell phone talkers are not interacting with the world around them , they come to believe that the world around them is n’t really there and surely should n’t intrude .
And when the cell phone user commandeers the space by talking , he or she sends a very clear message to others that they are powerless to insist on their own use of the space .
It is a passive - aggressive but extremely effective tactic .
Such encounters can sometimes escalate into rude intransigence or even violence .
In the past few years alone , men and women have been stabbed , escorted off of airplanes by federal marshals , pepper - sprayed in movie theaters , ejected from concert halls , and deliberately rammed with cars as a result of their bad behavior on their cell phones .
The Zagat restaurant guide reports that cell phone rudeness is now the number one complaint of diners , and USA Today notes that “ fifty - nine percent of people would rather visit the dentist than sit next to someone using a cell phone . ”
The etiquette challenges posed by cell phones are universal , although different countries have responded in slightly different ways .
Writing about the impact of cell phone technology in The Guardian in 2002 , James Meek noted , with moderate horror , that cell phones now encourage British people to do what “ British people are n’t supposed to do : invite strangers , spontaneously , into our personal worlds .
We let everyone know what our accent is , what we do for a living , what kind of stuff we do in our non-working hours . ”
In France , cell phone companies were pressured by the public to censor the last four digits of phone numbers appearing on monthly statements , because so many French men and women were using them to confirm that their significant other was having an affair .
In Israel , where the average person is on a cell phone four times as much as the average American , and where cell phone technology boasts an impressive 76 percent penetration rate ( the United States is n’t projected to reach that level until 2009 ) , the incursion of cell phones into daily life is even more dramatic .
As sociologists Amit Schejter and Akiba Cohen found , there were no less than ten cell phone interruptions during a recent staging of One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest at Israel ’s National Theater , and “ there has even been an anecdote reported of an undertaker ’s phone ringing inside a grave as the deceased was being put to rest . ”
The authors explain this state of affairs with reference to the Israeli personality , which they judge to be more enthusiastic about technology and more forceful in exerting itself in public ; the subtitle of their article is “ chutzpah and chatter in the Holy Land . ”
In the U.S. , mild regional differences in the use of cell phones are evident .
Reporting on a survey by Cingular wireless , CNN noted that cell phone users in the South “ are more likely to silence their phones in church , ” while Westerners “ are most likely to turn a phone off in libraries , theaters , restaurants , and schools . ”
But nationwide , cell phones still frequently interrupt movie screenings , theater performances , and concerts .
Audience members are not the sole offenders , either .
My sister , a professional musician , told me that during one performance , in the midst of a slow and quiet passage of Verdi ’s Requiem , the cell phone of one of the string players in the orchestra began ringing , much to the horror of his fellow musicians .
We cannot simply banish to Tartarus — the section of Hades reserved for punishment of the worst offenders — all those who violate the rules of social space .
And the noise pollution generated by rude cell phone users is hardly the worst violation of social order ; it is not the same as defacing a statue , for example .
Other countries offer some reason for optimism :
In societies that maintain more formality , such as Japan , loud public conversation is considered rude , and Japanese people will often cover their mouths and hide their phones from view when speaking into them .
Not surprisingly , Americans have turned to that most hallowed but least effective solution to social problems : public education .
Cingular Wireless , for example , has launched a public awareness campaign whose slogan is “ Be Sensible . ”
The program includes an advertisement shown in movie theaters about “ Inconsiderate Cell Phone Guy , ” a parody of bad behavior that shows a man talking loudly into his cell phone at inappropriate times : during a date , in a movie , at a wedding , in the middle of a group therapy session .
It is a miniature manners nickelodeon for the wireless age .
July is now officially National Cell Phone Courtesy Month , and etiquette experts such as Jacqueline Whitmore of the Protocol School of Palm Beach advise companies such as Sprint about how to encourage better behavior in their subscribers .
Whitmore is relentlessly positive : “ Wireless technology is booming so quickly and wireless phones have become so popular , the rules on wireless etiquette are still evolving , ” she notes on her website .
She cites hopeful statistics culled from public opinion surveys that say “ 98 percent of Americans say they move away from others when talking on a wireless phone in public ” and “ the vast majority ( 86 percent ) say they ‘ never ’ or ‘ rarely ’ speak on wireless phones while conducting an entire public transaction with someone else such as a sales clerk or bank teller . ”
If you are wondering where these examples of wireless rectitude reside , you might find them in the land of wishful thinking .
There appears to be a rather large disconnect between people ’s actual behavior and their reports of their behavior .
Whitmore is correct to suggest that we are in the midst of a period of adjustment .
We still have the memory of the old social rules , which remind us to be courteous towards others , especially in confined environments such as trains and elevators .
But it is becoming increasingly clear that cell phone technology itself has disrupted our ability to insist on the enforcement of social rules .
Etiquette experts urge us to adjust — be polite , do n’t return boorish behavior with boorish behavior , set a standard of probity in your own use of cell phones .
But in doing so these experts tacitly concede that every conversation is important , and that we need only learn how and when to have them .
This elides an older rule : when a conversation takes place in public , its merit must be judged in part by the standards of the other participants in the social situation .
By relying solely on self - discipline and public education ( or that ubiquitous modern state of “ awareness ” ) , the etiquette experts have given us a doomed manual .
Human nature being what it is , individuals will spend more time rationalizing their own need to make cell phone calls than thinking about how that need might affect others .
Worse , the etiquette experts offer diversions rather than standards , encouraging alternatives to calling that nevertheless still succeed in removing people from the social space .
“ Use text messaging , ” is number 7 on Whitmore ’s Ten Tips for the Cell Phone Savvy .
These attempts at etiquette training also evade another reality : the decline of accepted standards for social behavior .
In each of us lurks the possibility of a Jekyll - and - Hyde - like transformation , its trigger the imposition of some arbitrary rule .
The problem is that , in the twenty - first century , with the breakdown of hierarchies and manners , all social rules are arbitrary .
“ I do n’t think we have to worry about people being rude intentionally , ” Whitmore told Wireless Week .
“ Most of us simply have n’t come to grips with the new responsibilities wireless technologies demand . ”
But this seems foolishly optimistic .
A psychologist quoted in a story by UPI recently noted the “ baffling sense of entitlement ” demonstrated by citizens in the wireless world .
“ They do n’t get sheepish when shushed , ” he marveled .
“ You ’re the rude one . ”
And contra Ms. Whitmore , there is intention at work in this behavior , even if it is not intentional rudeness .
It is the intentional removal of oneself from the social situation in public space .
This removal , as sociologists have long shown , is something more serious than a mere manners lapse .
It amounts to a radical disengagement from the public sphere .
Spectator Sport
We know that the reasons people give for owning cell phones are largely practical — convenience and safety .
But the reason we answer them whenever they ring is a question better left to sociology and psychology .
In works such as Behavior in Public Spaces , Relations in Public , and Interaction Ritual , the great sociologist Erving Goffman mapped the myriad possibilities of human interaction in social space , and his observations take on a new relevance in our cell phone world .
Crucial to Goffman ’s analysis was the notion that in social situations where strangers must interact , “ the individual is obliged to ‘ come into play ’ upon entering the situation and to stay ‘ in play ’ while in the situation . ”
Failure to demonstrate this presence sends a clear message to others of one ’s hostility or disrespect for the social gathering .
It effectively turns them into “ non-persons . ”
Like the piqued lover who rebuffs her partner ’s attempt to caress her , the person who removes himself from the social situation is sending a clear message to those around him : I do n’t need you .
Although Goffman wrote in the era before cell phones , he might have judged their use as a “ subordinate activity , ” a way to pass the time such as reading or doodling that could and should be set aside when the dominant activity resumes .
Within social space , we are allowed to perform a range of these secondary activities , but they must not impose upon the social group as a whole or require so much attention that they remove us from the social situation altogether .
The opposite appears to be true today .
The group is expected never to impinge upon — indeed , it is expected to tacitly endorse by enduring — the individual ’s right to withdraw from social space by whatever means he or she chooses : cell phones , BlackBerrys , iPods , DVDs screened on laptop computers .
These devices are all used as a means to refuse to be “ in ” the social space ; they are technological cold shoulders that are worse than older forms of subordinate activity in that they impose visually and auditorily on others .
Cell phones are not the only culprits here .
A member of my family , traveling recently on the Amtrak train from New York , was shocked to realize that the man sitting in front of her was watching a pornographic movie on his laptop computer — a movie whose raunchy scenes were reflected in the train window and thus clearly visible to her .
We have allowed what should be subordinate activities in social space to become dominant .
One of the groups Goffman studied keenly were mental patients , many of them residents at St. Elizabeth ’s Hospital in Washington , D.C. , and his comparisons often draw on the remarkable disconnect between the behavior of people in normal society and those who had been institutionalized for mental illness .
It is striking in revisiting Goffman ’s work how often people who use cell phones seem to be acting more like the people in the asylum than the ones in respectable society .
Goffman describes “ occult involvements , ” for example , as any activity that undermines others ’ ability to feel engaged in social space .
“ When an individual is perceived in an occult involvement , observers may not only sense that they are not able to claim him at the moment , ” Goffman notes , “ but also feel that the offender ’s complete activity up till then has been falsely taken as a sign of participation with them , that all along he has been alienated from their world . ”
Who has n’t observed someone sitting quietly , apparently observing the rules of social space , only to launch into loud conversation as soon as the cell phone rings ?
This is the pretense of social participation Goffman observed in patients at St. Elizabeth’s .
Goffman called those who declined to respond to social overtures as being “ out of contact , ” and said “ this state is often felt to be full evidence that he is very sick indeed , that he is , in fact , cut off from all contact with the world around him . ”
To be accessible meant to be available in the particular social setting and to act appropriately .
Today , of course , being accessible means answering your cell phone , which brings you in contact with your caller , but “ out of contact ” in the physical social situation , be it a crosstown bus , a train , an airplane , or simply walking down the street .
In terms of the rules of social space , cell phone use is a form of communications panhandling — forcing our conversations on others without first gaining their tacit approval .
“ The force that keeps people in their communication place in our middle - class society , ” Goffman observed , “ seems to be the fear of being thought forward and pushy , or odd , the fear of forcing a relationship where none is desired . ”
But middle class society itself has decided to upend such conventions in the service of greater accessibility and convenience .
This is a dramatic shift that took place in a very short span of time , and it is worth at least considering the long - term implications of this subversion of norms .
The behavioral rules Goffman so effectively mapped exist to protect everyone , even if we do n’t , individually , always need them .
They are the social equivalent of fire extinguishers placed throughout public buildings .
You hope not to have to use them too often , but they can ensure that a mere spark does not become an embarrassing conflagration .
In a world that eschews such norms , we find ourselves plagued by the behavior that Goffman used to witness only among the denizens of the asylum : disembodied talk that renders all of us unwilling listeners .
We also use our cell phones to exert our status in social space , like the remnants of the entourage or train , which “ led a worthy to demonstrate his status by the cluster of dependent supporters that accompanied him through a town or a house of parliament . ”
Modern celebrities still have such escorts ( a new cable television series , Entourage , tracks a fictional celebrity posse ) .
But cell phones give all of us the unusual ability to simulate an entourage .
My mother - in - law recently found herself sharing an elevator ( in the apartment building she ’s lived in for forty years ) with a man who was speaking very loudly into his cell phone .
When she asked him to keep his voice down , he became enraged and began yelling at her ; he was , he said , in the midst of an “ important ” conversation with his secretary .
He acted , in other words , as if she ’d trounced on the hem of his royal train .
She might have had a secretary too , of course — for all he knew she might have a fleet of assistants at her disposal — but because she was n’t communicating with someone at that moment and he , thanks to his cell phone , was , her status in the social space was , in effect , demoted .
The language of wireless technology itself suggests its selfishness as a medium .
One of the latest advances is the “ Personal Area Network , ” a Bluetooth technology used in Palm Pilots and other personal digital assistants .
The network is individualized , closed to unwelcome intruders , and totally dependent on the choices of the user .
We now have our own technological assistants and networks , quite an impressive kingdom for ordinary mortals .
In this kingdom , our cell phones reassure us by providing constant contact , and we become much like a child with a security blanket or Dumbo with his feather .
Like a security blanket , which is also visible to observers , cell phones provide the “ ‘ publicization ’ of emotional fulfillment , ” as French sociologist Chantal de Gournay has argued .
“ At work , in town , while traveling — every call on the mobile phone secretly expresses a message to the public : ‘ Look how much I ’m in demand , how full my life is . ’”
Unlike those transitional objects of childhood , however , few of us are eager to shed our cell phones .
Absent Without Leave
Our daily interactions with cell phone users often prompt heated exchanges and promises of furious retribution .
When New York Times columnist Joe Sharkey asked readers to send in their cell phone horror stories , he was deluged with responses : “ There is not enough time in the day to relay the daily torment I must endure from these cell - yellers , ” one woman said .
“ There ’s always some self - important jerk who must holler his business all the way into Manhattan , ” another commuter wearily noted .
Rarely does one find a positive story about cell phone users who behaved politely , observing the common social space .
Then again , we all apparently have a cell phone alter idem , a second self that we endlessly excuse for making just such annoying cell phone calls .
As a society , we are endlessly forgiving of our own personal “ emergencies ” that require cell phone conversation and easily apoplectic about having to listen to others ’ .
At my local grocery store around 6:30 in the evening , it is not an uncommon sight to see a man in business attire , wandering the frozen food aisle , phone in hand , shouting , “ Bird ’s Eye or Jolly Green Giant ?
What ?
Yes , I got the coffee filters already ! ”
How rude , you think , until you remember that you left your own grocery list on the kitchen counter ; in a split second you are fishing for your phone so that you can call home and get its particulars .
This is the quintessential actor - observer paradox : as actors , we are always politely exercising our right to be connected , but as observers we are perpetually victimized by the boorish bad manners of other cell phone users .
A new generation of sociologists has begun to apply Goffman ’s insights to our use of cell phones in public .
Kenneth J. Gergen , for example , has argued that one reason cell phones allow a peculiar form of diversion in public spaces is that they encourage “ absent presence , ” a state where “ one is physically present but is absorbed by a technologically mediated world of elsewhere . ”
You can witness examples of absent presence everywhere : people in line at the bank or a retail store , phones to ear and deep into their own conversations — so unavailable they do not offer the most basic pleasantries to the salesperson or cashier .
At my local playground , women deep in cell phone conversations are scattered on benches or distractedly pushing a child on a swing — physically present , to be sure , but “ away ” in their conversations , not fully engaged with those around them .
The first time you saw a person walking down the street having a conversation using a hands - free cell phone device you intuitively grasped this state .
Wildly gesticulating , laughing , mumbling — to the person on the other end of the telephone , their street - walking conversation partner is engaged in normal conversation .
To the outside observer , however , he looks like a deranged or slightly addled escapee from a psychiatric ward .
Engaged with the ether , hooked up to an earpiece and dangling microphone , his animated voice and gestures are an anomaly in the social space .
They violate our everyday sense of normal behavior .
The difficulty of harmonizing real and virtual presence is n’t new .
As Mark Caldwell noted in A Short History of Rudeness about the first telephones , “ many early phone stories involved a bumpkin who nods silently in reply to a caller ’s increasingly agitated , ‘ Are you there ? ’ ”
Even young children know Goffman ’s rules .
When a parent is in front of a child but on the telephone ( physically present but mentally “ away ” ) , a child will frequently protest — grabbing for the phone or vocalizing loudly to retrieve the parent ’s attention .
They are expressing a need for recognition that , in a less direct and individualized way , we all require from strangers in public space .
But the challenge is greater given the sheer number of wireless users , a reality that is prompting a new form of social criticism .
As a “ commentary on the potential of the mobile phone for disrupting and disturbing social interactions , ” the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea recently sponsored a project called “ Mass Distraction . ”
The project featured jackets and cell phones that only allowed participants to talk on their phones if the large hood of the jacket was closed completely over their head or if they continued to insert coins into the pocket of the jacket like an old fashioned pay phone .
“ In order to remain connected , ” the project notes , “ the mobile phone user multitasks between the two communication channels .
Whether disguised or not , this practice degrades the quality of the interaction with the people in his immediate presence . ”
Cocooned within our “ Personal Area Networks ” and wirelessly transported to other spaces , we are becoming increasingly immune to the boundaries and realities of physical space .
As one reporter for the Los Angeles Times said , in exasperation , “ Go ahead , floss in the elevator .
You ’re busy ; you ca n’t be expected to wait until you can find a bathroom ....
[ T ] he world out there ?
It ’s just a backdrop , as movable and transient as a fake skyline on a studio lot . ”
No one is an outsider with a cell phone — that is why foreign cab drivers in places like New York and Washington are openly willing to ignore laws against driving - and - talking .
Beyond the psychic benefits cell phone calls provide ( cab driving is a lonely occupation ) , their use signals the cab driver ’s membership in a community apart from the ever - changing society that frequents his taxi .
Our cell phones become our talismans against being perceived as ( or feeling ourselves to be ) outsiders .
Talk and Conversation
Recently , on a trip to China , I found myself standing on the Great Wall .
One of the members of our small group had hiked ahead , and since the rest of us had decided it was time to get back down the mountain , we realized we would need to find him .
Despite being in a remote location at high altitude , and having completely lost sight of him in the hazy late morning air , this proved to be the easiest of logistical tasks .
One man pulled out his cell phone , called his wife back in the United States , and had her send an e-mail to the man who had walked ahead .
Knowing that our lost companion religiously checked his BlackBerry wireless , we reasoned that he would surely notice an incoming message .
Soon enough he reappeared , our wireless plea for his return having successfully traveled from China to Washington and back again to the Wall in mere minutes .
At the time , we were all caught up in the James Bond - like excitement of our mission .
Would the cell phone work ?
( It did . )
Would the wife ’s e-mail get through to our companion ’s BlackBerry ?
( No problem . )
Only later , as we drove back to Beijing , did I experience a pang of doubt about our small communications triumph .
There , at one of the Great Wonders of the World , a centuries - old example of human triumph over nature , we did n’t hesitate to do something as mundane as make a cell phone call .
It is surely true that wireless communication is its own wondrous triumph over nature .
But cell phone conversation somehow inspires less awe than standing atop the Great Wall , perhaps because atop the Great Wall we are still rooted in the natural world that we have conquered .
Or perhaps it is simply because cell phones have become everyday wonders — as unremarkable to us as the Great Wall is to those who see it everyday .
Christian Licoppe and Jean - Philippe Heurtin have argued that cell phone use must be understood in a broader context ; they note that the central feature of the modern experience is the “ deinstitutionalization of personal bonds . ”
Deinstitutionalization spawns anxiety , and as a result we find ourselves working harder to build trust relationships .
Cell phone calls “ create a web of short , content - poor interactions through which bonds can be built and strengthened in an ongoing process . ”
But as trust is being built and bolstered moment by moment between individuals , public trust among strangers in social settings is eroding .
We are strengthening and increasing our interactions with the people we already know at the expense of those who we do not .
The result , according to Kenneth Gergen , is “ the erosion of face - to - face community , a coherent and centered sense of self , moral bearings , depth of relationship , and the uprooting of meaning from material context : such are the dangers of absent presence . ”
No term captures this paradoxical state more ably than the word “ roam , ” which appears on your phone when you leave an area bristling with wireless towers and go into the wilds of the less well connected .
The word appears when your cell phone is looking for a way to connect you , but the real definition of roam is “ to go from place to place without purpose or direction , ” which has more suggestive implications .
It suggests that we have allowed our phones to become the link to our purpose and the symbol of our status — without its signal we lack direction .
Roaming was a word whose previous use was largely confined to describing the activities of herds of cattle .
In her report on the use of mobile phones throughout the world , Sadie Plant noted , “ according to the Oxford English Dictionary , one of the earliest uses of the word ‘ mobile ’ was in association with the Latin phrase mobile vulgus , the excitable crowd , ” whence comes our word “ mob . ”
Convenience and safety — the two reasons people give for why they have ( or “ need ” ) cell phones — are legitimate reasons for using wireless technology ; but they are not neutral .
Convenience is the major justification for fast food , but its overzealous consumption has something to do with our national obesity “ epidemic . ”
Safety spawned a bewildering range of anti-bacterial products and the overzealous prescription of antibiotics — which in turn led to disease - resistant bacteria .
One possible solution would be to treat cell phone use the way we now treat tobacco use .
Public spaces in America were once littered with spittoons and the residue of the chewing tobacco that filled them , despite the disgust the practice fostered .
Social norms eventually rendered public spitting déclassé .
Similarly , it was not so long ago that cigarette smoking was something people did everywhere — in movie theaters , restaurants , trains , and airplanes .
Non-smokers often had a hard time finding refuge from the clouds of nicotine .
Today , we ban smoking in all but designated areas .
Currently , cell phone users enjoy the same privileges smokers once enjoyed , but there is no reason we cannot reverse the trend .
Yale University bans cell phones in some of its libraries , and Amtrak ’s introduction of “ quiet cars ” on some of its routes has been eagerly embraced by commuters .
Perhaps one day we will exchange quiet cars for wireless cars , and the majority of public space will revert to the quietly disconnected .
In doing so , we might partially reclaim something higher even than healthy lungs : civility .
This reclaiming of social space could have considerable consequences .
As sociologist de Gournay has noted , “ the telephone is a device ill suited to listening ... it is more appropriate for exchanging information . ”
Considering Americans ’ obsession with information — we are , after all , the “ information society ” — it is useful to draw the distinction .
Just as there is a distinction between information and knowledge , there is a vast difference between conversation and talk .
Conversation ( as opposed to “ talk ” ) is to genuine sociability what courtship ( as opposed to “ hooking up ” ) is to romance .
And the technologies that mediate these distinctions are important : the cell phone exchange of information is a distant relative of formal conversation , just as the Internet chat room is a far less compelling place to become intimate with another person than a formal date .
In both cases , however , we have convinced ourselves as a culture that these alternatives are just as good as the formalities — that they are , in fact , improvements upon them .
“ A conversation has a life of its own and makes demands on its own behalf , ” Goffman wrote .
“ It is a little social system with its own boundary - making tendencies ; it is a little patch of commitment and loyalty with its own heroes and its own villains . ”
According to census data , the percentage of Americans who live alone is the highest it has ever been in our country ’s history , making a return to genuine sociability and conversation more important than ever .
Cell phones provide us with a new , but not necessarily superior means of communicating with each other .
They encourage talk , not conversation .
They link us to those we know , but remove us from the strangers who surround us in public space .
Our constant accessibility and frequent exchange of information is undeniably useful .
But it would be a terrible irony if “ being connected ” required or encouraged a disconnection from community life — an erosion of the spontaneous encounters and everyday decencies that make society both civilized and tolerable .
Angle Cards - A " business card " for measuring angle
This page has " business cards " , which held at arm 's length , help you measure angle , and thus to estimate distance and size .
Here is a sample .
Example usage :
Hold the card at arm 's length , looking past it at a distant door .
Tall people , and doors , are about 2 meters ( yards ) tall .
If a distant door comes up to the x30 mark on the card , then then it is 2 times 30 meters away , so 60 meters .
If it only comes up to the x50 mark , then it would be 2 x 50 = 100 meters away .
Same with tall people .
A short 1 meter ( 3 ft ) person at x50 would be 1 x 50 = 50 meters away .
A 3 or 4 meter high building floor at x20 would be ( 3 or 4 ) x 20 = ( 60 or 80 ) meters away .
An x30
door
A 2 yard high door ,
which appears to be " x30 " high ,
is 2 x 30 = 60 yards away .
Creating your card :
Hold a piece of paper out at arm 's length .
Measure the distance from your eye to the paper .
Print out the page closest to your distance .
Chop it up into cards .
Mix.pdf ( .ps )
30 cm ( 11.8 in ) ( .ps )
35 cm ( 13.8 in ) ( .ps )
40 cm ( 15.7 in ) ( .ps )
45 cm ( 17.7 in ) ( .ps )

Getting a feel for distance
Go for a walk .
Estimate the distance to houses , using their doors as above .
Or instead of houses , you can use people , or posts , or cars , or anything else you know the size of .
First just look at the house , and guess its distance .
Then check your guess using the angle card .
Then if you know the size of your stride , you can pace the distance to get another check .
First start out by just trying to do " is it more like 1 meter , or 10 meters , or 100 meters ? " .
Then as your accuracy improves with practice , you can try to get within 50 % , 25 % , etc .
A good habit to practice is giving bounds on your estimate - " Well , I am sure it is more than xxx , and I am sure it is less than xxx , ... and , well , my estimate is xxx . " .
Even if all you are sure about to start with is that it is more than nothing , and less than a zillion .
Measuring Angle and Distance with your Thumb has a few more examples .
Misc ...
You can carry the card around in your wallet , backpack , or even pocket .
Printing on card - stock , rather than on paper , helps them last longer .
Or you can just print out more , and treat them as disposable .
A paper chopper helps save time when cutting out the cards .
Or you can fold the paper , and run a scissor edge up inside .
If a door is 2 meters tall , how tall is that house ?
How wide ?

Notes
Example :
On a 45 story , 200 meter building , one might estimate the angle at between 0.007 and 0.01 radians , for a distance of 200 * 2 / 0.007 = 57 km to 40 km .
Now , 2 * pi = 6.28 .
6.28 / 0.007 = 900 , and 6.28 / 0.01 = 628 , suggesting the distance to the horizon is between 1/900th and 1/628th of the Earth 's circumference .
900 * 57 km / 3.14 = 16000 km ( 16 Megameters ) .
And 628 * 40 / 3.14 = 8000 km ( 8 Mm ) .
Which nicely bracket the actual diameter of 13 Megameters ( 13000 km ) . :)

Also known as the laryngeal prominence , the Adam 's apple sits right on top of the thyroid gland , so the area is fittingly called the thyroid cartilage .
So what makes Adam 's apples stick out more in men ?
Because grown men have larger voice boxes , theirs are a lot more prominent .
This is also the reason why dudes speak in deeper tones .
[ Got a question ?
Send us an email and we 'll look for an expert who can crack it . ]
Girls and boys start out with similarly sized thyroid cartilage , but this changes when they hit puberty .
The boys '
Adam 's apples become noticeably bigger and their voices change as their testosterone levels increase .
But does it do anything ?
Not really .
Like the cartilage in your ears or nose , it 's just kind of there .
Some men with especially prominent bumps even have them surgically shaved , with no ill effects .
Unfortunately , the Adam 's apple 's main purpose may be embarrassing men at the office , during presidential debates , or while lying to their wives .
Besides bobbing around when swallowing , the apple can " jump " uncontrollably when you 're nervous .
Gulp !

More information at this blog entry .
Greetings .
A story is making the rounds right now regarding FBI use of cell phones as remote bugs .
I originally wrote about this concept in my PRIVACY Forum in 1999 ( " Cell Phones Become Instant Bugs ! " ) so the issue is real , but we still need to bring the current saga back down to earth .
This discussion does n't only relate to " legal " bugs but also to the use of such techniques by illegal clandestine operations , and applies to physically unmodified cell phone hardware ( not phones that might have had separate , specialized bugs physically installed within them by third parties ) .
There is no magic in cell phones .
From a transmitting standpoint , they are either on or off .
It is true that many phones have an alarm feature that permits them to " wake up " from a seemingly " off " state .
However , this is not a universal functionality , even in advanced phones such as PDA cell phones , which now often have a " totally off " mode available as well .
It is also true that some phones can be remotely programmed by the carrier to mask or otherwise change their display and other behaviors in ways that could be used to fool the unwary user .
However , this level of remote programmability is another feature that is not universal , though most modern cell phones can be easily programmed with the correct tools if you have physical access to the phones , even briefly .
But remember -- no magic !
When cell phones are transmitting -- even as bugs -- certain things are going to happen every time that the alert phone user can often notice .
First , when the phone is operating as a bug , regular calls can't be taking place in almost all cases .
A well designed bug program could try to minimize the obviousness of this by quickly dropping the bug call if the phone owner tried to make an outgoing call , or drop the bug connection if an incoming call tried to ring through .
But if the bug is up and running , that 's the only transmission path that is available on the phone at that time for the vast majority of currently deployed cell phones .
New " 3G " phones have the capability of running very high speed data -- in which additional voice channels could be simultaneously transmitted at full speed along with the primary call ( conventional GSM data channels -- GPRS / EDGE -- typically block calls while actively transmitting or receiving user data ) .
But this is pretty bleeding - edge stuff for now , and not an issue for the vast majority of current phones , especially in the U.S. at this time .
Of course , if a cell phone is being used as a remote bug , the odds are that the routine conversations through that phone are also being monitored , right ?
So this " one call at a time " aspect is n't as much of a limitation to bugging as might otherwise be expected .
Want to make sure that your phone is really off ?
Taking out the battery is a really good bet .
Do n't worry about the stories of hidden batteries that supposedly can be activated remotely or with special codes .
The concept makes no sense in general , and there just is n't room in modern cell phones for additional batteries that could supply more than a tiny bit of added power , if any ( e.g. , enough juice to keep phones ' internal clocks going during main battery replacements , but nowhere near enough to be practical for transmitting purposes ) .
But if your battery seems to be running out of juice far too early ( despite what the phone 's battery status display might claim ) , that might be an indication that your phone is being used to transmit behind your back ( though a worn out battery or inaccurate battery status display could also be the culprits ) .
Another clue that a phone may have been transmitting without your permission is if it seems unexpectedly warm .
You 've probably noticed how most cell phones heat up , especially on longer calls .
This is normal , but if you have n't been on any calls for a while and your cell phone is warm as if long calls were in progress , you have another red flag indication of something odd perhaps going on .
Finally , if you use a GSM phone ( like the vast majority of phones around the world , including Cingular and T - Mobile in the U.S. ) you have a virtually foolproof way to know if you phone is secretly transmitting in voice mode .
You 've probably noticed the " buzzing " interference that these phones tend to make in nearby speakers when calls or data transmissions are in progress .
A certain amount of periodic routine communications between cell phones and the networks will occur while the phones are powered on -- even when calls are not in progress -- so short bursts of buzzing between calls ( and when turning the phones on or off ) are normal .
But if you 're not on a call , and you hear a continuing rapid buzz - buzz - buzz in nearby speakers that lasts more than a few seconds and gets louder as you approach with your phone , well , the odds are that your phone is busily transmitting , and bugging is a definite possibility .
Note that this particular test is much less reliable with non-GSM phones that use CDMA ( e.g. Sprint / Verizon phones ) , since CDMA 's technology is less prone to producing easily audible local interference .
This strongly suggests that CDMA phones may be preferred for such bugging operations .
A variant form of CDMA ( called " WCDMA " ) can be used for the high speed data channel and voice calls on the new 3G GSM backwards - compatible phones .
Since additional voice channels could theoretically be encoded onto that data stream as I mentioned above -- which would be harder to detect via interference than an ordinary GSM voice channel -- this is a technology that will bear watching .
Most of this discussion applies to bugging in real time .
If " delayed " bugging is acceptable , there is another approach available that would be more difficult to detect -- record ambient audio from the phone mic and store it in the phone 's memory in compressed form , then upload it en masse later .
Modern phones have plenty of available memory , especially ones with cameras , mp3 capabilities , and the like .
The processing requirements of a delayed bug would probably be beyond the capabilities of some low - end phones , but even most entry - level phones are relatively powerful these days .
When the recorded audio was uploaded all of the transmission factors mentioned above would come into play , but since the transmission time would be shorter this would be harder to detect .
Probably the biggest giveaway to this type of bugging would be battery drain , which would typically be quite considerable even in a voice - controlled recording ( VOX ) mode .
So , my comments above about unusually poor battery performance would be especially applicable in this case .
The odds of most people being targeted for bugging are quite small .
But it 's always better to know the technical realities .
Do n't be paranoid , but be careful .

Genomes usually must be decoded several times over to get a complete and accurate sequence , but the first three billion bases of Neanderthal should “ hit all the essential differences , ” Dr. Egholm said .
The researchers ’ hope is to recover the entire sequence of the Neanderthal genome , but that will depend on whether they can recover enough DNA .
From sampling so far , no particular gaps in the sequence are apparent .
“ We are hitting all the chromosomes and getting good coverage , ” Dr. Egholm said .
If no single specimen yields a full sequence , the genome might be recovered by combining DNA from several individuals .
One of the most important results that researchers are hoping for is to discover , from a three - way comparison of chimp , human and Neanderthal DNA , which genes have made humans human .
The chimp and human genomes differ at just 1 percent of the sites on their DNA .
At this 1 percent , Neanderthals resemble humans at 96 percent of the sites , to judge from the preliminary work , and chimps at 4 percent .
Analysis of these DNA sites , at which humans differ from the two other species , will help understand the evolution of specifically human traits “ and perhaps even aspects of cognitive function , ” Dr. Paabo said .
The degree of resemblance between humans and Neanderthals is fiercely debated by archaeologists , and even issues like whether Neanderthals had language have not been resolved .
Dr. Paabo believes that genetic analysis is the best hope of doing so .
He has paid particular attention to a gene known as FOXP2 , which from its mutated forms in people seems to be involved in several advanced aspects of language .
A longstanding dispute among archaeologists is whether the modern humans who first entered Europe 45,000 years ago , ultimately from Africa , interbred with the Neanderthals or forced them into extinction .
Interbreeding could have been genetically advantageous to the incoming humans , says Bruce Lahn , a geneticist at the University of Chicago , because the Neanderthals were well adapted to the cold European climate  the last ice age had another 35,000 years to run  and to local diseases .
Evidence from the human genome suggests some interbreeding with an archaic species , Dr. Lahn said , which could have been Neanderthals or other early humans .
So far no specific evidence of human - Neanderthal interbreeding has been found , Dr. Egholm said .
But it may require analysis of almost the full Neanderthal genome to rule out all possibility of genetic interchange .
German dictator wanted the car as a propaganda tool to show off the technological superiority of the Third Reich .
Car , one of the fastest of its time , has 485 horse - power and a maximum speed of 186 mph and is going to be auctioned by Christie 's in February in Paris .
Almost all the D - Types were destroyed during the Second World War but this one was taken to Russia for its technology to be studied .
It was taken apart and the dissembled parts were discovered in the 1990s .
The car has since been reassembled and is expected to reach a record price .
Current world record for a car at auction is held by a 1931 Bugatti Type 41 Royale Sports Coupe - sold for £ 5.5 million by Christie 's in the late 1980s .

A growing number of people will be keeping their work calendars in Microsoft Outlook and their family calendars elsewhere , say on Google .
How can they cross -publish their work and family calendars ?
It ’s possible , but the conceptual hurdles are formidable .
Here ’s what I found when I did the experiment .
I started by subscribing a work calendar in Outlook 2007 to a family calendar on Google .
From one perspective it was easy and just worked .
From another perspective , I marvel at the amount of tacit knowledge required for me to have that experience .
You start here :
The Manage calendars link in Google Calendar leads to the second tab of this four - tab screen :
The Shared : Edit settings link goes to the second tab of a two - tab screen :
This tab is for sharing within the Google realm , but that ’s not the scenario I ’m going for .
It should n’t be necessary to sign into Google to see a family calendar hosted there , it should be possible to subscribe directly from Outlook 2007 .
And you can , but this is the wrong place to do it .
You have to switch over to the first tab :
The private URL is what we ’re looking for .
And in particular , the iCal flavor of the private URL .
That ’s what other calendar programs , including Outlook , can latch onto to subscribe to this calendar .
The URL that Google produces starts with http :// and , when you plug it into Outlook 2007 , bingo , there ’s the family calendar nicely merged in with the work calendar .
Easy , but only if you ’ve mastered a whole bunch of concepts .
Now let ’s go the other way .
How can a family member using Google Calendar subscribe directly to a work - related Outlook calendar ?
Let ’s start by right - clicking a work calendar in Outlook and selecting Publish to Internet :
Hmm . Office Online or WebDAV server ?
Let ’s start with the former .
Now the choices are :
This seems analogous to the Google Calendar situation , but only partly .
The invited users option is indeed analogous to the Google counterpart .
Here those invited users will need to have Windows Live IDs in order to use the sharing URL that ’s produced .
But the other choice does n’t produce a private URL , it produces one that ’s discoverable in Office Online .
( Or , I guess , will be when calendar search is implemented there . )
So while the sharing URL that ’s produced in both these cases looks like a private URL — that is , it includes the kind of random character string that often functions as a password embedded in the URL — in this case you ’d be wrong to use it as though it were a private URL .
What about WebDAV ?
Now we ’re in geek territory .
You have to know what a WebDAV server is , and have one at your disposal .
( I do , but I ’m an outlying data point . )
When you publish your Outlook calendar to WebDAV and then try to subscribe from Google Calendar , you ’ll fail if the calendar is secured with HTTP basic authentication .
( However , Apple iCal will succeed in this case . )
If you instead allow anonymous access to the WebDAV - hosted calendar it ’ll work in Google Calendar , but only if you alter the sharing URL produced by Outlook , changing webcal :// to http ://.
There ’s just a whole lot going on here .
Even though I ’m familiar with all this stuff , it was a real struggle for me to understand what works ( and why ) , as well as what does n’t ( and why not ) .
The other day I heard a phrase I like a lot : concept count .
It refers to the number of distinct concepts people must hold in their heads in order to do things , and it ’s closely related to my recent item on conceptual barriers .
Let ’s step back and inventory some of the concepts involved in this calendar cross-publishing scenario .
Subscription .
There ’s a fundamental distinction between static and dynamic exchange of calendar information .
On the static side , we use words like import and export and snapshot .
On the dynamic side , we use words like subscription and feed .
Most people have direct experience with the former , but few as yet with the latter .
Subscription URL .
If you do have direct experience of subscription , you ’ll know that a subscription URL is a magical thing .
It does n’t point to a thing , it points to a process that always yields new things .
But if you have n’t yet experienced live subscription , there ’s a conceptual barrier .
The difference between one kind of URL and the other is abstract .
As in a related example about click - to - load versus right - click - to - save , the URL itself is an overloaded construct that people have to disambiguate .
Private URL .
Lots of services nowadays use this technique .
Yes , it ’s only security by obscurity .
Anyone who knows the URL has access , so it ’s a weak form of protection , similar to but more convenient than a shared password .
Shared passwords have their uses , and so do private URLs .
But how many people realize that private URLs are analogous to shared passwords , can evaluate the security tradeoffs , and can recognize a private URL when they see one that ’s been produced by Google Calendar or Amazon S3 or another service ?
The URL does not wear its intended purpose on its sleeve .
Google and Amazon and others are beginning to define expectations that private URLs are unguessable but , as we see with the public calendar URLs at Office Online , an URL that looks unguessable may in fact be discoverable through search .
iCal .
For ages we ’ve had Internet calendaring software that uses protocols and formats associated with the word iCal , but the concept mostly has n’t sunk in yet .
Here ’s one reason why :
Various iCal URI schemes including webcal : , webcals : , http : , https : .
In the course of this experiment I encountered examples of all of these .
The concept that https means secure http may be fairly well understood at this point , though I ’m not convinced of that .
But I ’m sure that webcal : is n’t yet , and that ’s hardly surprising .
In principle an alternate URI scheme is just the sort of cue that would help people understand the difference between a generic resource and a calendar resource .
In practice it has n’t worked out that way .
Partly that ’s because there are so few alternate URI schemes in use that people have n’t internalized what they can signify .
And partly it ’s because the webcal : scheme has been very haphazardly implemented .
Some sharing services emit webcal : ( or webcals : ) URIs that must be transposed to http : or https : in order to work , and vice versa .
If SSL is involved , there ’s another conceptual mapping between webcals : and https : .
Authentication .
A calendar - sharing URL may or may not require authentication .
If it does , you may or may not be able to tell , by looking , what kind is needed .
If the calendar URL comes from Google or Office Online , it makes sense that you ’d use a Google account or a Windows Live ID .
But what if it comes from a WebDAV server ?
There may or may not be a straightforward way to know ( or find out ) what kind of credentials that server will require .
Scope of visibility .
I think this is the toughest concept of all .
Blogs and video sites notwithstanding , sharing anything at all on the web will be a new thing for most people .
Thinking through what will be visible to whom is non-trivial .
On the corporate side , Outlook 2007 distinguishes between calendar sharing and Internet publishing .
Each defines the bedrock concepts of user , group , and world in different ways .
On the personal side , there are yet other ways to construe these fundamental scopes of visibility .
All this only scratches the surface .
We could elaborate a whole lot more of these conceptual underpinnings .
Bottom - line : support for standards is necessary but not sufficient .
Even when products comply with standards like iCal , people struggle mightily to use those products interoperably .
It ’s the conceptual barriers that get in their way .
It ’s really hard to figure out how a concept expressed in one system maps to the same ( or a similar ) concept in another system .
To make that easier , technology providers will have to agree on more than just protocols and file formats .
We ’ll also have to work together to minimize conceptual clutter and normalize core concepts .
Former Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) lawyer Adam Candeub claims that the government agency destroyed a 2004 study on the implications of local media ownership .
The study , which revealed that locally owned television stations provide more local news coverage , blatantly contradicts the FCC 's assertion that " commonly owned television stations are more likely to carry local news , " an argument used by the agency to justify a position in favor of a hands - off approach to media ownership restrictions .
A surviving copy of the report ended up in the hands of California Senator Barbara Boxer , who supposedly received it " indirectly from someone within the FCC who believed the information should be made public , " according Boxer spokeswoman Natalie Ravitzto .
Boxer revealed the report to the public during a re-nomination confirmation hearing for FCC chief Kevin Martin .
Both Martin and former FCC chairman Michael Powell have denied knowledge of the report , prompting Boxer to demand a full investigation .
Allegations of malfeasance and misconduct are nothing new for the FCC .
Like many other federal regulatory agencies , the FCC has a long history of dubious conduct .
Disparagingly referred to as the Fascist Censorship Commission by critics , the FCC is responsible for enforcing increasingly draconian " decency " rules that threaten to purge the airwaves of free speech .
The FCC is also responsible for the steady expansion of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ( CALEA ) and has attempted to mandate VoIP back - doors despite the fact that doing so contradicts the language and intent of CALEA as well as the agency 's own standing policies regarding the classification of Internet services .
The FCC is also guilty of frequent attempts to exceed its authority , most notably by attempting to mandate the anti-consumer broadcast flag without congressional authorization .
A former employee of a prominent Washington DC telecommunications lobbying firm , current FCC chairman Kevin Martin is himself a controversial figure , whom critics regularly accuse of shilling for the big bells .
In an article about the controversial report , UCSC professor and radio history expert Matthew Lasar points out that , although the study shows that locally owned stations air an average of 5.5 additional minutes of local knows per half hour , it also reveals that the local news coverage provided by such stations can be politically motivated .
According to Lasar , the study cites the following example :
" For example , " the study suggests on page two , " if the local [ television station ] owner also develops real estate locally , they may cover the local zoning board in a way that favors the owner 's real estate interests . "
The paper makes it clear that localism is advantageous in some ways , but not others .
Taken in full , it seems like the report merely increases the complexity of the media ownership debate rather than resolving it .
As a result , Lasar feels that " [ i ] f Michael Powell 's FCC did indeed suppress this document , the action suggests a highly politicized , even paranoid internal culture that feared even a nuanced challenge to its agenda . "
Senator Boxer is reportedly waiting for answers , and is threatening a full investigation of the issue if answers do n't turn up soon .
Here it is - after a fascinating debate that revealed how deeply you feel about art , our definitive list of 50 works that demand to be seen at least once in a lifetime .
Those of you who have contributed lists and single recommendations displayed a magnificent seriousness about art : you are interested in so much more than who won the Turner Prize .
You crave the absolute and the supreme , and are prepared to go a long way in search of it - from Tikal in Guatemala to Constable country .
A few artists make it onto almost everyone 's list : Leonardo , Michelangelo , Rembrandt and Picasso - with Michelangelo the artist who inspires the greatest awe .
" My head believes Darwin ; my heart trusts Michelangelo , " said one blogger .
The special ( exaggerated ? ) place western culture has given art and artists since Michelangelo 's day means that if you love great art , you 're going to spend a lot of time in Florence , Rome and Spain .
Richard Serra 's Torqued Ellipses , widely championed , prove it is still possible to make great art today .
Antony Gormley 's Angel of the North manifests an enduring belief in art and its power - although personally I 'm not convinced it lives up to its ambition .
Perhaps it does n't matter , so long as you find what you are looking for .
One writer contributed a highly personal account of seeing Georgina Starr 's video Crying .
" It was euphoric , I suppose .
A release .
Another piece of me wanted to climb through the screen and give her a cuddle . "
It has n't made the list , but that type of experience is what this project was about - the most intense encounters we can have with art .
Everything listed here can sustain a long and living engagement , which means even the oldest ( the Chauvet cave , painted 30,000 years ago ) is contemporary .
Great art is not so much timeless as always timely .

Adding monitors is just one way to gain added screen space , of course .
A monitor with a 24 - inch screen would offer about 50 percent more screen area than a single 19 - inch model and would take up less desk space than two 19 - inchers ( less than two feet from side to side , versus about 33 inches for a pair of 19 - inchers ) .
But for my applications , at least , the extra width of a two - screen array seems more useful than the extra height of a larger single screen .
And where more height would be useful -- reading Web pages , for example -- some 19 - inch and smaller screens can pivot from the normal " landscape " position to the more upright " portrait " mode .
Further , a pair of smaller screens will usually cost less than a single big one .
While a 24 - inch Dell " wide aspect " screen is now about $ 1,000 , a pair of 19 - inch Dells could cost as little as $ 550 -- about half that if you already had one 19 - inch monitor , and even less if you found one of the many bargains available in displays that size .
If you are willing to use a smaller monitor for your second display , you can save even more ; 17 - inch flat - panel monitors , for example , are often less than $ 200 each .
A pair of independent monitors just sitting side by side look functional but hardly stylish , and their separate bases occupy a lot of desk space .
For about $ 200 , you can attach two flat - panel monitors to a stand with a single pedestal , like those made by Ergotron , Mass Engineered Design , Zenview , 9X Media , Ladybug and DoubleSight .
Stands that stack two monitors instead of placing them side by side are also available , as are models holding three or four displays .
Adding more monitor outputs to a computer is usually not difficult .
For desktop PC's , you can either add a second graphics card ( the board that links your computer to your monitor ) or replace your single - output graphics card with a dual - output model ( about $ 80 and up ) -- and probably get other improvements ( like faster screen response for games ) in the bargain .
You can add more video cards if two screens are not enough and your computer has the slots to hold them , or buy triple and quad cards from Matrox and Nvidia .
( Just make sure you get a card that fits your computer 's graphics slot : PCI , AGP or PCI Express .
Your computer 's manual should tell you this , or you can run the system scanner software at www.crucial.com.)
If you have a laptop computer , or are reluctant to delve into your computer or hire a technician , you can use the Matrox DualHead2 Go , or Tritton SEE2 adapters .
The DualHead2 Go ( $ 169 , shopmatrox.com ) plugs into the VGA monitor output of laptops and some desktop computers ; the SEE2 ( $ 99 , retailers listed at www.trittontechnologies.com) plugs into a U.S.B. 2.0 socket .
And that gives me an idea : Adding a second monitor turned out to be the easiest , most cost - effective and significant improvement in my work since I replaced my modem with high - speed cable .
Now if I can just rig my laptop as a third screen hmmm .
Caller ID Spoofing
What ’s worse than a bad authentication system ?
A bad authentication system that people have learned to trust .
According to the Associated Press :
In the last few years , Caller ID spoofing has become much easier .
Millions of people have Internet telephone equipment that can be set to make any number appear on a Caller ID system .
And several Web sites have sprung up to provide Caller ID spoofing services , eliminating the need for any special hardware .
For instance , Spoofcard.com sells a virtual “ calling card ” for $ 10 that provides 60 minutes of talk time .
The user dials a toll - free number , then keys in the destination number and the Caller ID number to display .
Near as anyone can tell , this is perfectly legal .
( Although the FCC is investigating . )
The applications for Caller ID spoofing are not limited to fooling people .
There ’s real fraud that can be committed :
Lance James , chief scientist at security company Secure Science Corp. , said Caller ID spoofing Web sites are used by people who buy stolen credit card numbers .
They will call a service such as Western Union , setting Caller ID to appear to originate from the card holder ’s home , and use the credit card number to order cash transfers that they then pick up .
Exposing a similar vulnerability , Caller ID is used by credit - card companies to authenticate newly issued cards .
The recipients are generally asked to call from their home phones to activate their cards .
And , of course , harmful pranks :
In one case , SWAT teams surrounded a building in New Brunswick , N.J. , last year after police received a call from a woman who said she was being held hostage in an apartment .
Caller ID was spoofed to appear to come from the apartment .
It ’s also easy to break into a cell phone voice mailbox using spoofing , because many systems are set to automatically grant entry to calls from the owner of the account .
Stopping that requires setting a PIN code or password for the mailbox .
I have never been a fan of Caller ID .
My phone number is configured to block Caller ID on outgoing calls .

I have spent the past three weeks filming in the hillside barrios of Caracas , in streets and breeze - block houses that defy gravity and torrential rain and emerge at night like fireflies in the fog .
Caracas is said to be one of the world 's toughest cities , yet I have known no fear ; the poorest have welcomed my colleagues and me with a warmth characteristic of ordinary Venezuelans but also with the unmistakable confidence of a people who know that change is possible and who , in their everyday lives , are reclaiming noble concepts long emptied of their meaning in the west : " reform " , " popular democracy " , " equity " , " social justice " and , yes , " freedom " .
The other night , in a room bare except for a single fluorescent tube , I heard these words spoken by the likes of Ana Lucia Fernandez , aged 86 , Celedonia Oviedo , aged 74 , and Mavis Mendez , aged 95 .
A mere 33 - year - old , Sonia Alvarez , had come with her two young children .
Until about a year ago , none of them could read and write ; now they are studying mathematics .
For the first time in its modern era , Venezuela has almost 100 % literacy .
This achievement is due to a national programme , called Mision Robinson , designed for adults and teenagers previously denied an education because of poverty .
Mision Ribas is giving everyone a secondary school education , called a bachillerato .
( The names Robinson and Ribas refer to Venezuelan independence leaders from the 19th century . )
Named , like much else here , after the great liberator Simon Bolivar , " Bolivarian " , or people 's , universities have opened , introducing , as one parent told me , " treasures of the mind , history and music and art , we barely knew existed " .
Under Hugo Chávez , Venezuela is the first major oil producer to use its oil revenue to liberate the poor .
Mavis Mendez has seen , in her 95 years , a parade of governments preside over the theft of tens of billions of dollars in oil spoils , much of it flown to Miami , together with the steepest descent into poverty ever known in Latin America ; from 18 % in 1980 to 65 % in 1995 , three years before Chávez was elected .
" We did n't matter in a human sense , " she said .
" We lived and died without real education and running water , and food we could n't afford .
When we fell ill , the weakest died .
In the east of the city , where the mansions are , we were invisible , or we were feared .
Now I can read and write my name , and so much more ; and whatever the rich and their media say , we have planted the seeds of true democracy , and I am full of joy that I have lived to witness it . "
Latin American governments often give their regimes a new sense of legitimacy by holding a constituent assembly that drafts a new constitution .
When he was elected in 1998 , Chávez used this brilliantly to decentralise , to give the impoverished grassroots power they had never known and to begin to dismantle a corrupt political superstructure as a prerequisite to changing the direction of the economy .
His setting - up of misions as a means of bypassing saboteurs in the old , corrupt bureaucracy was typical of the extraordinary political and social imagination that is changing Venezuela peacefully .
This is his " Bolivarian revolution " , which , at this stage , is not dissimilar to the post - war European social democracies .
Chávez , a former army major , was anxious to prove he was not yet another military " strongman " .
He promised that his every move would be subject to the will of the people .
In his first year as president in 1999 , he held an unprecedented number of votes : a referendum on whether or not people wanted a new constituent assembly ; elections for the assembly ; a second referendum ratifying the new constitution - 71 % of the people approved each of the 396 articles that gave Mavis and Celedonia and Ana Lucia , and their children and grandchildren , unheard - of freedoms , such as Article 123 , which for the first time recognised the human rights of mixed - race and black people , of whom Chávez is one .
" The indigenous peoples , " it says , " have the right to maintain their own economic practices , based on reciprocity , solidarity and exchange ... and to define their priorities ... "
The little red book of the Venezuelan constitution became a bestseller on the streets .
Nora Hernandez , a community worker in Petare barrio , took me to her local state - run supermarket , which is funded entirely by oil revenue and where prices are up to half those in the commercial chains .
Proudly , she showed me articles of the constitution written on the backs of soap - powder packets .
" We can never go back , " she said .
In La Vega barrio , I listened to a nurse , Mariella Machado , a big round black woman of 45 with a wonderfully wicked laugh , stand and speak at an urban land council on subjects ranging from homelessness to the Iraq war .
That day , they were launching Mision Madres de Barrio , a programme aimed specifically at poverty among single mothers .
Under the constitution , women have the right to be paid as carers , and can borrow from a special women 's bank .
From next month , the poorest housewives will get about £ 120 a month .
It is not surprising that Chávez has now won eight elections and referendums in eight years , each time increasing his majority , a world record .
He is the most popular head of state in the western hemisphere , probably in the world .
That is why he survived , amazingly , a Washington - backed coup in 2002 .
Mariella and Celedonia and Nora and hundreds of thousands of others came down from the barrios and demanded that the army remain loyal .
" The people rescued me , " Chávez told me .
" They did it with all the media against me , preventing even the basic facts of what had happened .
For popular democracy in heroic action , I suggest you need look no further . "
The venomous attacks on Chávez , who arrives in London tomorrow , have begun and resemble uncannily those of the privately owned Venezuelan television and press , which called for the elected government to be overthrown .
Fact - deprived attacks on Chávez in the Times and the Financial Times this week , each with that peculiar malice reserved for true dissenters from Thatcher 's and Blair 's one true way , follow a travesty of journalism on Channel 4 News last month , which effectively accused the Venezuelan president of plotting to make nuclear weapons with Iran , an absurd fantasy .
The reporter sneered at policies to eradicate poverty and presented Chávez as a sinister buffoon , while Donald Rumsfeld was allowed to liken him to Hitler , unchallenged .
In contrast , Tony Blair , a patrician with no equivalent democratic record , having been elected by a fifth of those eligible to vote and having caused the violent death of tens of thousands of Iraqis , is allowed to continue spinning his truly absurd political survival tale .
Chávez is , of course , a threat , especially to the United States .
Like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua , who based their revolution on the English co-operative moment , and the moderate Allende in Chile , he offers the threat of an alternative way of developing a decent society : in other words , the threat of a good example in a continent where the majority of humanity has long suffered a Washington - designed peonage .
In the US media in the 1980s , the " threat " of tiny Nicaragua was seriously debated until it was crushed .
Venezuela is clearly being " softened up " for something similar .
A US army publication , Doctrine for Asymmetric War against Venezuela , describes Chávez and the Bolivarian revolution as the " largest threat since the Soviet Union and Communism " .
When I said to Chávez that the US historically had had its way in Latin America , he replied : " Yes , and my assassination would come as no surprise .
But the empire is in trouble , and the people of Venezuela will resist an attack .
We ask only for the support of all true democrats . "

How will Sun bounce back ?
Sun 's pumped out some exciting news lately ...
Project Blackbox is the coolest thing ever , their financial picture continues to improve ( less loss is the new profit ) , and they finally FINALLY open - sourced Java .
The new ( ish ) CEO Jonathan Schwartz is making good things happen at the top .
But if Sun is really going to pull this off , they need more than strategic decisions , hot products , and new technologies .
Focusing on the top of the org chart wo n't work unless the bottom gets just as much attention .
Maybe more .
Why is it that so often the employees who have the most direct human - to - human customer contact are the ones who get the least respect ?
Customer service is managed by someone , but you rarely catch a manager answering a customer call .
Customer education is managed by someone , but you wo n't catch a manager training a customer .
This does n't apply particularly to Sun of course -- I 'm just picking on them because I was -- and still am - - a small part of that story .
And given that Sun is overall a great place to work , whatever problems I see there are likely to be much worse elsewhere .
In the Good Days , most tech employees were treated like the scarce and precious resource we were .
Most of us knew it would n't last , and once the bubble burst we did n't expect things to stay the same .
It was a tough time .
But here 's where it gets both weird and wrong , because after the bubble burst , we were still the same people who were there when Sun was kicking ass .
We were still the same people who were so highly valued just a few month 's before .
Yet as things began to slide , and the layoffs began , we were magically transformed into people who were just " lucky to have a job and better shut up with the complaints " ( one of my manager 's exact words )
This is n't about layoffs -- they were necessary ( and in Sun 's case , still are ) .
This is about how a company treats the ones who were n't laid off .
I was at Sun last week -- in the Colorado flagship customer training facility -- and noticed the " Employee of the Quarter " plaque still on the wall in the main lobby .
I saw that there had been no new " awards " since 2002 .
What message does this send to employees ?
What message does this send to customers ?
More importantly , what impact does it have on customers when the employees who interact with them are no longer as highly valued as they once were ?
Actually , it 's worse than that -- in so many tech companies including Sun , many of the employees who interact with customers have been outsourced .
( Sun now outsources most of its customer education )
Most companies do n't outsource things they need to win a customer , but they have no problem outsourcing things the customer needs to use the product .
Technical support .
Training .
Customer support .
Most companies keep sales in - house but then have someone with no passion for the company 's products -- help the customer actually use the thing .
( Just one more example of the huge gap between how we treat customers before vs. after the sale . )
If we want customer evangelists , we better start with employee evangelists .
Having killer technology and a great team at the top is not enough if the employees -- people -- who have the greatest impact on whether the customer kicks ass are n't valued as highly as those who have the greatest impact on acquiring a customer .
It 's not about an " Employee of the Quarter " Office - Space / Dilbertish reward system ... it 's about saying to employees , " We need you .
You are the people who can make our customers succeed or fail with our products . "
Customers could not care less about the middle and upper management of a company .
They care about the guy who answered the phone .
They care about the guy who configured their servers .
They care about the guy who taught them to make Java sing .
Think hard about how you treat the people who touch what should be the company 's most valued asset -- the existing customers .
In my perfect world , we treat existing customer / users with great care , and we treat the people who interact with them with even greater care .
If a company like Sun and so many others wants to bounce back , they should put just as much energy into the bottom of the org chart as they do at the top .
[ Personal update : my back is much better , I 'm still on pain - killers -- but much less now .
I 'm planning to start real work again Monday .
So , if you 're still waiting for email or a call ... hopefully tomorrow ! ]

Great photo of the EOTQ board !!
Sheer genius .
It almost makes you feel like you 're in a McDonalds :-)
Why is it just the customer facing staff you need to treat with care ?
What about the other " grunts " who put in day - in and day - out .
These are the people who set the morale in the company , who start word of mouth marketing to their friends , who make or break any company .
Do n't just reserve your efforts for the people on the front line , remember the support staff that are needed to make it happen - from accounts admin staff through to " hygiene engineers " .
Everyone counts .

It 's all too familiar a story .
What was once touted as the company 's biggest asset somehow becomes the company 's biggest liability .
In many cases , I believe it 's not willful on the part of top management , it 's just they forget about doing right things .
It 's not on their list of priorities .
I believe at least 25 % of the CEO 's time should be thinking about customers ( marketing ) and at least 25 % of the CEO 's time should be thinking about the team that produces the results ( Human Resources ) .
Unfortunately in many companies neither of them gets that kind of attention .

Ever since I got my start , I 've noticed how whoever the patron talks to is The Librarian - from the titular Head Of All Things Library down through reference librarians and catalogers to student book shelvers and , yes , security guards and janitors .
Once you realize that the customer does n't make a distinction between front - line support and the top of the ladder , maybe you start working harder at keeping everyone well - informed , and treating everyone with respect .
At least , I try to .

" what should be the company 's most valued asset -- the existing customers . "
I worked in Technical Support for 4 + years for a market leading Silicon Valley software company .
There was an implicit hierarchy of resource allocation with regard to customers - it went something like this :
1. Potential customers with lots of money to spend
2. Potential customers with some money to spend
3 . Existing customers that had spent a lot of money
4. Existing customers that had spent some money
I left 3 years ago - I doubt if it has changed at all .
I also bet that this hierarchy describes 99 % of software companies that are publically traded .
Cheers

I think that only small / medium companies really NEED their customer - facing people to be passionate about helping customers .
It 's what sets the small startups apart from the mega - corporations , but once that small startup steps into the domain of mega- corporation , there 's ( usually ) no need to keep those passionate folks around if it 's cheaper to outsource them .
After all , they have their reputable brand name to make up for their mediocre support team .

Awesome post .
And you know what else customers do n't really care about ( besides mid-mgmt & CXOs ) — the name of your product !
Maybe , if companies took the hours and millions they spend on developing Just - The - Right - Name and redirected that time and money on things to improve conditions , et al for those who make the business run — maybe business would run better for all .
( Ah , wishful thinking . . .)

So , you think this works only in the workplace ?
How about in the real world ?
The Christmas after I got engaged , my fiancee gave me a windsurfer .
I thought I was in heaven .
Then we got married .
You know what I got that Christmas ?
A tie rack .
And you know what I got every Christmas and birthday after that ?
Ties .
I quickly learned the difference between being married and being engaged .
And despite that , we 're still married over 20 years later .

As someone who 's done a lot of environments work at Sun , I 'd like to thank you for having that be the ONLY picture you 've shared with the rest of the world ;-)
Certainly there 's a lot to clean up , starting with the cues we take from the physical world such as the one you 've pointed out .
The good news : we have an experience - design plan ( interiors , media , messaging , dos and don'ts ) for moving things in the right direction .
Small impressions lead to a larger brand impression , and it's imperative that we all understand this .
The bad news : getting every single employee , vendor or subcontractor -- in hundreds of locations around the world -- to actually care about how we communicate in our physical environments is another story .
Especially in an envioronment that often values rogue behaviors .
So there 's no easy way to win .
But we as a company are making money .
And it 's a lot easier to get people to care when we 're on the rise .

Richard Banks : " everyone counts "
Well - put .
You 're right ... it 's about everything and everyone at the bottom , not just the ones who directly interact with customers .
Steve : Q5 , a very good quarter , yes . ; )
Joe : " Once you realize that the customer does n't make a distinction between front - line support and the top of the ladder , maybe you start working harder at keeping everyone well - informed , and treating everyone with respect . "
You managed to say all that I meant , but in one simple sentence .
Thank - you .
Jason :
Wow , that hierarchy is scary .
The thing that always surprises me about things like this is that for so many industries and companies , the stats all show that keeping a customer is much less expensive than getting one .
Yet we 're still so bent on treating the prospects like gold and the onces we 've got like ... definitely NOT gold .
Rimantas :
Thanks for this !
I 'm going to order that book as well .
John Windsor :
That 's something I had n't thought of , John -- all that money spent on finding the NAME , that could be spent on actually making the product live UP to the name after the sale ... excellent point .
By the way , I just discovered your blog ( YouBlog.typepad.com ) and am liking it quite a lot .
Mitch : Windsurfer vs. ties / tie-racks ... hmmm...
I think they call this bait and switch ; )
Not that we all are n't guilty of it .
But if you 've been married for 20 years , I reckon both partners are doing something very , very right .
But I agree that it works everywhere , and perhaps especially in families .
It 's always been a fascination for me how people will treat perfect strangers with more politeness than they offer their kids and / or spouse .
Should n't we be treating our family members BETTER than we treat everyone else ?
Or at least the same ...
Neol : " I 'd like to thank you for having that be the ONLY picture you 've shared with the rest of the world ... "
You 're very welcome ; )
I should have mentioned that this facility is also wonderful .
It 's very easy to not even notice what 's been there for so long that it 's just part of the wall , and had I still been working there every day , I might have never realized it was there .
My intention was much less about what 's in the environment , though , and much more about it means that the Employee of the Quarter stopped .
Even if there were no more bonuses to be given for the ones getting the award , it still says that someone noticed you effort and performance .
But do n't get me started on whether they 're rewarding the right thing ... ( by " right " I mean " right for the customer " )
Anyway , I have n't been to all of the Sun facilities , but if you 've had anything to do with the Broomfield campus , well , it continues to be beautiful inside and out .
Especially when you have a west - facing window ...

This post seems a bit misplaced to me .
It did n't seem to contain so much clever , insightful and fresh ways of thinking about HR , as just emotional therapy from a disgruntled ex-employee ...
Posted by : Toni | Nov 21 , 2006 5:20:58 AM
Kathy -- absolutely fair comments .
I have walked through the Broomfield training center , and just did n't see this message we were sending to our customers .
Instead , I was focusing on listening in to our trainers , and seeing if they paid attention to good adult learning principles .
There was so much work to be done there , I missed the glaringly obvious .
Thanks ... we 'll pay attention to this around the world .
But that 's not your main point .
I get it ... the customer relationship matters .
I think it matters so much that every CLO in Sun is expected to be in the classroom at least once this year -- not just manage learning .
That includes me .
And our learning products need to focus on the customer first , and their workplace performance needs , not our products .
We 'll get there .
In the end , your main argument is that laying off employees destroys the customer relationship .
So best to throw the captains off the ship , or something else , anything else .
In simplest terms , that 's what I hear you saying .
And at this point , we disagree .
Shareholders own this company .
And we owe them a financially healthy company .
If we threw all the captains off the ship , it still would n't be enough to turn a profit .
( 3,000 managers X average salary )
Agreed our only solution should n't be layoffs .
And we fail to engage our employees minds and hearts sufficiently .
Let 's stay in this together ...

There are 33 questions in total .
Ready ?
Quite a while ago ( 2 years ? ) we started using a contact form .
Part of the reason for the contact form was to avoid having to post our e-mail address to the site .
Because we all know that posting your e-mail address on any web site is a sure way to get spammed to death .
However , over the last year , the amount of spam sent via our contact form has exploded , and it was time to figure out how to combat it .
For a brief time we used " captchas " .
The idea is simple .
You add a hard to read image of a few random letters asking a submitter to identify themselves as " human " by entering the text .
However , the problem is obvious :
To make it hard to OCR the image , it has to be quite hard to read .
I came across one perl script used by a bot , that can recognize simple captchas in a second .
Good captchas need to use colors , distorted letters and such , making them hard to read for many humans even if they have good eye sight .
Using such a form can be difficult if you have bad vision .
Our somewhat ugly home made captcha solution caused submissions to drop by about 30 % , which was n't acceptable .
Next , we implemented a couple of simple key word filters .
They worked ok , but its kind of hard for us .
What about people who are trying to send us a report that they see a bot that sends " Viagra " ads ?
Another approach we took ( and still take to some extent ) is to block spammers .
We had a lot of repeat offenders .
But then again , they sometimes come through proxy servers and from dynamic IPs , so we end up locking out legitimate users as well .
For what its worth :
We do see in some cases a couple thousand " spam attempts " from IP addresses after they get blocked .
What you are really looking for is a method that will make it harder for a machine to submit a report but will be invisible to the user .
Last week I experimented with this and came up with two ways to do so .
One is implemented now and works amazingly well .
The other does n't work for us but may work for you .
First the method that does n't work for us : Encrypted forms in Javascript .
This one does n't work for us since given our audience , I do n't want to use Javascript for anything that is affects usability of our site .
Sure , maybe some eye candy here and there , but that 's it .
Essentially encrypted javascript is what a lot of malware uses to disguise itself .
But why not use it to " hide " a form from bots ?
The work to decrypt it is done by the browser and the user will never know that the form is encrypted .
A spammer could implement a javascript parser , but its extra work .
And now you just made their spam - bot slower by a factor of 10 or however long it takes to decrypt the form .
The second method is simpler , and does not require javascript .
Instead , one or more fake form fields are added to the form .
But style sheets are used to make them " invisible " .
To further confuse the attacker , the fake form fields are given names like " subject " and such suggesting to the bot that these are the form fields they are looking for .
However , whenever a form is submitted with content in a " hidden " field , it is discarded .
I am not talking about the classic hidden form fields that are not user changeable , but form fields that are marked with " display : none " like :
Sure , in particular after I write this article , attackers may catch on .
But there are many ways to mark a form field as " invisible " .
You can randomize the names of your form fields to further confuse them .
In short : you again increased the workload on the spammer without affecting the regular user .
For a sample , just take a look at our contact form .
We received only about 3 or 4 pieces of spam after implementing this last week .
Usually we received dozens of pieces of spam a day .
Why not use an image to be identified ?
A house , or identify the gender of a person standing in the doorway , or a cat versus a dog .
Something that would lend itself to one - word identification .
Great idea .
I think that 's at least easier then some of the horrible captchas .
So far I have been successful by using a session variable that is set when the form is requested via http get .
If the submitted form does n't have the session variable set , I dump the email and return a bogus error message .
Also I strip any http :// or http://www from any submission so our users are n't likely to click on any links that load malware .
The domain name , path and filename remain but its not hard to reconstuct if its a legitimate url submission .
I did try the session variable , and it did n't work for me that well :-(.
Maybe I did n't implement it quite right .
[ on some site the ] submission from .. asks you to enter ... text found in a gif .
However , no matter what you enter the first time , it says you entered it wrong
Mean and devious .
I like it !
The best solutions I found requires symantical interpretation ...
For example : Complete this sentance : I ate a ____ and it was good .
... ( a ) hand ( b ) watermellon ( c ) rubber band ( d ) tire ( e ) Billy " The problems with this approach : ... non-english speakers ... 5 options is still 20 % spam ... "
All modern browsers do support style sheets , and for those that do n't you can leave a little note in the form telling them whats going on .
The fact that still some spam makes it past this method suggests that there is some manual spamming going on .
But its minimal ... and sure , lets have them hire armies of spaminators to have them submit these forms .
Either way you succeeded in making spam more expensive and shifting the economics against it .
Couple user feedback items :- Margles suggest to use a modified form of captcha : " " .-
Ed writes : "- Neal writes : " ... rubber tires ( drool ... )
Neal also points to this method which somewhat implements what was suggested above : http://www.kittenauth.com/ .

It 's a prank Bart Simpson would be proud of .
After several controversial stunts , including trying to flog knuckle - dusters outside a Bulldogs rugby league game and approaching the Prime Minister , John Howard , with an over - sized axe , ABC TV's Chaser boys have struck again .
The pranksters pulled off a stunt at Sydney Airport on Wednesday which saw Virgin Blue staff make a " final boarding call " announcement for five late passengers , including one which sounded suspiciously like Mr Al Qaeda and another which sounded like Mr Terrorist .
Less than a week since UK and US authorities foiled a plot to blow - up mid-air trans - Atlantic flights , The Chaser 's War on Everything decided to test domestic airport security in the most " puerile " way possible .
This is a brief introduction to general relativity , designed for both students and teachers of the subject .
While there are many excellent expositions of general relativity , few adequately explain the geometrical meaning of the basic equation of the theory : Einstein 's equation .
Here we give a simple formulation of this equation in terms of the motion of freely falling test particles .
We also sketch some of the consequences of this formulation and explain how it is equivalent to the usual one in terms of tensors .
Finally , we include an annotated bibliography of books , articles and websites suitable for the student of relativity .

Editorial note :
This entry has more dialogue and so on than usual and I ’m pretty uncertain about ordering and attribution , so do n’t start changing your opinions of people on the basis of things I say they said .
Update : Earlier versions of this post contained some glaring errors which I have corrected .
( Thanks to Paul Graham for pointing them out . )
After yesterday ’s talk , I head back with my friend Seth to my dorm room and he helps me pack .
We walk to the train together and head back to his house , where he lends me his airplane neck pillow and some Boston subway tokens .
I take the BART to Oakland airport where I catch my flight to Cambridge , Mass .
As I leave , my roommates ask where I am going .
“ Well , the least impressive answer is that I ’m interviewing for a summer job .
The most impressive answer is that I ’m getting funding for a startup company . ”
‘ Actually , you could make it more impressive , ’ Seth says .
‘ You could tell them that the guy you ’re getting startup money from is a famous programmer and author of a popular book and already thinks that your idea is worthwhile . ’
‘ Yeah , ’ I say , ‘ but they wo n’t know who that is . ’
Seth could n’t find any earplugs but despite the fact that a crying baby sits exactly one row in front of me , I sleep fine through the redeye .
When I wake up , I am in Boston and it ’s morning , which I have a little trouble wrapping my head around .
I take the shuttle to the nearby subway terminal and deposit one of Seth ’s coins , transfer twice , and find myself outside the hotel .
I check in , take a shower , iron some clothes , put them on , and lie down .
Then I jump up and start reviewing all sorts of things in preparation : imagining answers , trying out competitors , etc .
Around 11
Dad arrives ( he frequently works around here , so he flew in today ) and he takes me out to lunch .
We walk to restaurant after restaurant he knows about ; all of them are closed .
Eventually we end up at a pizza place and try to eat quickly .
We leave to find the offices of Y Combinator , the funding company .
It turns out that they ’re a lot further down the street than we imagined , so as we watch the clock strike later we begin walking quickly and then jogging .
We arrive at a sort of modern - looking “ light green concrete box ” with a skylight in the center .
We open the door and a woman ( who I will call 4 of 4 ) answers it .
We enter , me sweaty and my Dad out of breath .
Paul Graham appears from behind the corner , looking just like his picture brought to life .
We shake hands .
Paul notes my Daring Fireball shirt .
‘ I just found out about that site the other day , ’ he says .
Paul beckons me in further as my Dad leaves .
The building is decorated as a modernist home , with an expensive kitchen and some nice furniture .
The other two are out getting lunch , so Paul tries to chat a bit about the big table they ’ll need to fit everyone in here ( they plan on serving us dinners in , so we ’ll at least get some real food — “ vegetables ” — and some friends we are n’t spending all our days with ) .
But he ca n’t resist getting down to business .
‘ We ’ve got another idea that we think might be better for you , ’ he says .
Paul begins to pace the floor , as if composing an essay right there and then ; I try to spin around to keep facing him .
Current technology in the area is all other things which just happened to be used this way , “ like people eating out of jam jars ” because they have n’t discovered plates .
I mistakenly try to respond , but he ’s still spinning the story .
We flesh out the idea some and eventually Trevor Blackwell and Robert Morris , who Paul consistently calls rtm , turn up .
Trevor also looks just like his photo , down to the form - fitting burgundy shirt .
rtm looks just like his photo except for more pimples .
Paul leads the conversation .
Trevor fiddles with a PowerBook , occasionally chiming in with comments .
rtm sits quietly eating or flipping through some pieces of paper .
4 of 4 plays the overseeing mother , careful to keep the boys on track .
‘ Maybe we should give Aaron a chance to pitch his idea ? ’ she suggests .
I tell them my idea and we discuss it for a bit and they later try to merge it with their idea .
At one point we ’re discussing trying to match people ’s writing .
‘ You can just look for similar words , ’ Paul says .
‘ I do n’t think that will work , ’ Trevor responds .
‘ It works pretty well for spam filtering ! ’
Paul reports .
‘ Yeah , but people writing about different things use the same words — people might talk about both capitalism and communism but they might be on completely different sides ’
‘ True , but they generally use different words .
If you find capitalism and sexism in the same paragraph it ’s a pretty good guess the author ’s liberal .
They all believe it ’s some grand conspiracy . ’
4 of 4 pushes Paul to explain the idea behind Y Combinator and he reiterates the things from his VCs article .
He looks over our application , which he appears not to have read very carefully .
He points to our company name , a long word meaning something like “ insubstantial dot com ” .
‘ As the proud owner of hardtoremember.com , I can get that , ’ he says .
‘ I used to have easytoforget.com but I let the renewal lapse , ’ Trevor retorts .
‘ Actually , the only reason you have hardtoremember.com is because I let that lapse too and you snatched it up !’
I laugh rather loudly .
He looks at the personnel .
“ A sophomore at 22 ?
What ’s his story ? ”
After high school he went to join a startup .
‘ Went to join a startup ?
Sounds like our kind of guy !
Did you know him before ? ’
Yeah , we met through the ArsDigita Prize .
‘ Oh , because he was emailing me too .
You know that undergraduation essay I wrote ?
He ’s the guy .
Well , he was the straw that broke the camel ’s back . ’
( I think of the same phrase a moment before Graham says it . )
‘ And Sean B. Palmer ?
Know him , like him ? ’
‘ Yeah , ’ I say , ‘ h — ’.
Paul cuts me off , moving on .
‘ When would you have the first prototype done ? ’
‘ Well , we ’d hope to work on it over the next term so we ’d have it ready over the summer . ’
‘ Oh , wonderful , wonderful . ’ he says .
‘ What about this name ?
Infogami ?
You ’re going to always have to spell it out . ’
Paul says .
‘ Is n’t it just origami with info at the beginning ? ’ 4 of 4 asks .
‘ Well , it ’s confusing , ’ Paul says .
‘ In - FAH - gomee , ’ Trevor chimes in .
‘ All the names with blog in it are probably taken , ’ 4 of 4 says .
‘ No , you do n’t want blog in it , ’ Paul says .
‘ You want something bigger , something that can face the world .
You ’re not wedded to the name , are you ? ’
‘ No , we just picked it so we could stop discussing the name and move on , ’ I said .
‘ Oh , good , ’ Paul says , and moves on .
‘ How much time do we have ? ’ he asks 4 of 4 .
‘ Well , you ’re , uh , right on schedule — should be finishing up now . ’
‘ Oh , ’ he says , and gets up .
‘ So you ’ll start working on this right away ? ’ he asks .
‘ Yeah , i— ’.
I try to say ‘ if we ’re accepted ’ but he talks right over me .
‘ Alright !
Sounds great . ’
He shakes my hand .
‘ We ’ll probably call you around 7 . ’
We say goodbye .
‘ Feel free to take anything you like on your way out , ’ 4 of 4 says ; ‘ sounds good , ’ I reply .
Paul and Trevor squeal .
‘ Food !
Any food you like !’ she exclaims .
‘ See , I corrected myself , ’ she adds to Paul and Trevor as I head out the door .
I walk down the sunny Cambridge street , smiling .
I feel pretty confident of being accepted .
I head back to the apartment and email my cofounders .
We spend the afternoon , sightseeing around MIT — visiting the MIT museum with its Arthur Ganson sculptures and walking around the deserted Media Lab ( we try to smile at Kismet but while it locks onto our faces it does n’t respond ) .
Eventually we head back to the hotel and I take a nap .
I begin to wake up around 7:15 when the phone rings .
I hear my Dad answer it and start talking so I jump out of bed to grab it for myself .
But he ’s using his phone not mine .
I sit at the computer , hungry and tired , trying to wake up .
At 7:23 pm the phone rings .
‘ Hi Aaron , it ’s Paul Graham .
We ’re willing to invest [ such - and - such an amount ] .
Call me back in five minutes .
You got a pen ? ’
He gave me the phone number and hung up .
So I think about it for a minute or two , cal back and say yes .
‘ OK . ( off - phone ) When ’s Aaron tomorrow ?
( pause ) Can you come by at 10 am ? ’
Sure .
We go to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate .
The next morning I wake up and take the T to Cambridge Square and take the long walk down Garden Street to the Y Combinator offices .
( Bizarrely , the street always seems longer walking there than walking back . )
I get there early and , my stomach burbling ( not sure why I ’m nervous now that I ’ve already won ) , I sit down for a few minutes and fiddle with the zipper on my backpack .
I eventually summon the courage to knock on the door — no response .
I begin to wonder how I ever got inside last time .
After some hemming and hawing I open the door , only to reveal : another door .
I knock on this one .
No luck .
I slowly open it , only to hear voices chatting about Microsoft and something .
I spy a backpack lying in the corner so I assume the previous appointment is still going on and retreat .
I wander around the outside of the fancy little building , looking for anything interesting ( wow , trash bags ! ) .
Finally , I manage to just walk in .
Paul is talking to the previous appointment , who turns out to also be from Stanford , and welcomes me in .
Paul points to a whiteboard and lists off all the winners .
‘ We ended up flying everybody out to Cambridge .
On the site we said we ’d respond either yes , no , or come see us , but we ended up just using the last two .
We figured it ’s worth the $ 300 to see them face - to - face .
Real life is so much more high - bandwidth .
There were a lot of people whose ideas looked good on paper but were n’t so great when we talked about them in person .
But we probably ended up making tons of mistakes . ’
Stanford kid offers me a ride from the airport , but I get in too late .
Trevor mentions he ’s flying back tonight too .
‘ Oh ?
I thought you lived here , ’ StanfordBoy says .
‘ No , he has a robotics startup in Mountain View , ’ Paul explains .
‘ Have n’t you seen the Segway he built ? ’
We walk into the other room .
‘ See , this is typical Trevor - logic .
He wants to lose weight so he starts biking to work , but biking is too easy so he teaches himself to unicycle .
Then when he builds his own Segway , he decides that two wheels are redundant , so he builds a self - balancing unicycle . ’
Trevor happens to have the Eunicycle right here and demos it for us .
He manages to maneuver it right past me , sneaking into the little place between me and the counter .
I almost jump out of the way , afraid to knock him over , but he ’s quite good at it .
‘ The problem is you still have to balance it laterally , so you really have to be a trained unicyclist .
Even I have n’t ridden it , ’ Paul says .
‘ Do you ever go anywhere with it ? ’
StafordBoy asks .
‘ Oh yeah , I ride it into Mountain View for coffee all the time . ’
( That must really stop traffic , I think , remembering how much attention my little bicycle gets . )
StanfordBoy and Trevor chat about ( StanfordBoy plays with Segways , apparently ) and Paul takes me into the other room to give me my checks .
‘ How much did your flight cost ? ’
‘ Two hundred and eighty - six dollars and ninety cents , ’ I say .
He begins writing that out before realizing his error .
‘ I just wrote “ Pay to the order of two hundred and eighty - six dollars ” .
I wish I could just type these ; I ca n’t write anything anymore . ’
I sympathize .
‘ How much do you think plane tickets and rent will cost ? ’
‘ I have no idea . ’
‘ Well , two thousand dollars ought to cover it . ’
He writes out another check and slides it over .
‘ Now you want to go about finding an apartment .
You want to get a place on the red line [ the local subway ] because then you can go see people and people can go see you .
The best place to go is Davis Square , because it ’s cheap , fun , and on the red line .
Harvard is fun and on the red line but not cheap , Porter is cheap and on the red line but not fun , so I recommend Davis , Inman , and Central , in that order . ’
Underneath the table I sneak my notebook and pencil out of my pocket and begin secretly taking notes .
‘ Now the thing you want to get is one of these triple - decker houses converted into apartments , where the top floor is slightly smaller than the other two .
And then you ’ll be in exactly the same place as VisiCalc when they started it — in the top floor of a triple - decker in Davis Square . ’
( Actually , Paul later told me VisiCalc was started in the neighboring town of Arlington . )
‘ Yeah , but you do n’t want to code like VisiCalc , ’ Trevor says , ‘ that stuff was rotten . ’
‘ Well , it made money , did n’t it ? ’
Paul replies .
‘ Oh , there ’s one other charge we forgot to tell you about .
It will cost $ 1000 to incorporate in the State of Delaware , ’ Paul says .
‘ How much will it cost to renew it ? ’
‘ It costs $ 400 to renew it after a year , but the $ 1000 takes care of the first year .
I think that in a year you ’ll be able to realize whether it ’s worth the $ 400 or not . ’
‘ Do you have any other questions ? ’
I know I have tons , but I can’t really think of any and two other kids are waiting in the other room .
i see myself out .
I smile at the two kids , since I figure we ’re all friends now or something , but they just seem to glare at me .
I head back to see my dad at his office in MIT ’s Media Lab ( which I dislike , only in part to annoy my dad ) and begin looking for apartments .
Some Media Lab big shot comes in to say hi and my dad introduces me and says I ’m looking for apartments .
‘ Well , you could stay here , ’ he says .
‘ You could set up in the conference room .
There ’s a shower just down the hall and coffee every morning .
It ’d probably be a month before [ the boss ] finds out . ’
We all laugh extremely loudly , although my dad later insists this offer was serious .
‘ You could put up flyers asking for volunteers for an undergraduate research program .
You ’d just say “ Come to our office in the Media Lab ” — you ’d get tons of people , people love this place .
And if they tried to ask you for paychecks , you could just say “ oh , do n’t worry , it ’s for credit ” . ’
We decide to go have a look around Davis Square for lunch .
( The T is fast ; I notice it takes me the same amount of time to travel the three miles on the T between the two as it takes me to walk to class . )
The area seems nice enough , although nothing special .
A few places where bands play and so on , I guess , but I ’m not really enamored of concerts .
We eat lunch and head back to MIT .
Arguing about the merits of MIT , my dad plays the Noam Chomsky card .
I call him on it and we decide to go find Noam Chomsky ’s office , which turns out to be in the fancy new Frank Gehry - designed Stata Center .
I think we do , but it ’s sort of surrounded by desks with people at them , so we ’re too afraid to get close .
Peeking in though , it looks like it ’s being used for something else , since we see a couple sets of desks , although there is a jacket hanging outside the door .
Maybe I ’ll try a little harder over the summer sometime .
We then set off to find my old friend Ben , who ’s now a graduate student here and also works in the Stata Center .
Since the building is rather complicated ( I mean , just look at it ! ) , I look him up on the directory computers and we head off in search of his listed office .
We find the floor and proceed to walk down the hallway checking every office for his , but failing to find it .
The number just is n’t listed .
We walk back and check again .
We check the number on a computer terminal and find we got it wrong , it ’s on the other side , so we check that hallway .
Still no luck .
The number does n’t seem to exist .
We ask some people ; they have no idea .
Finally one confirms there ’s no such number here .
They suggest we try the same number in the opposite tower , so we do , and he ’s there .
( Lying directory ! )
Ben ’s as bright and animated as ever and he sits down to talk with us .
He asks what I ’m doing out here and I tell him and he congratulates me .
‘ Wow , that thing was everywhere , ’ he says .
( With some irony , this is partially my fault — according to Paul at least , I am partially responsible for getting the thing posted to Slashdot .
I did n’t really think about how this might hurt my chances if I decided to apply . )
‘ You must have been really impressive to get accepted . ’
Ben tells us what he ’s up to and we chat until we have to get going .
Back at the Media Lab , I realize that it ’s really not practical for me to get home from the airport .
I thought I would just take public transportation , like I did to get there in the first place , but my flight gets in at exactly the same time the last bus to the train leaves .
And even if I did manage to catch a taxi to the train station or something , I would n’t get home until 3 AM .
A taxi , on the other hand , apparently costs $ 100 .
My dad eventually finds some obscure site for a Chinese shuttle company with poor English that will do it for half that , so we pick that .
It ’s getting late so I head back to the hotel and quickly pack my stuff and catch a taxi to the airport .
I again sleep most of the way back but we manage to get in like half - an - hour early , so I resign myself to sitting outside waiting for the bus to arrive .
About ten minutes after it ’s supposed to arrive I check my phone and see they ’ve been calling me repeatedly to see if I ’ve gotten in yet .
I call them to say yes and they soon arrive .
The shuttle is driven by a kid with his friend in front , neither of them are Chinese .
‘ How is everything ? ’ the driver asks .
‘ We ’re a little new at this , ’ says his buddy .
‘ What ’s wrong with you ? ’ shouts the driver .
‘ You never tell the customer you ’re new !
That just scares them ! ’
I take out my book , trying not to get scared , but there ’s hardly enough light to read by .
We manage to get back around 1AM and I ’m stunned to see that kids are sitting and talking and playing ping - pong .
What ’s wrong with them ? , I wonder .
I just came back from an arduous journey and they ’re playing like it ’s nothing !
I head up to my room , but nobody seems to notice a thing .
My roommates are also just sitting at their computers , as if everything is normal .
I put my computer away and go to sleep , sleeping the sleep of a man who , whatever his surroundings , knows that at heart he is a capitalist .

The general surprise that Lebanese civilians are taking the brunt of Israel ’s onslaught  and the unwillingness in some quarters of the media to report the fact  reflects a poor understanding of Israel ’s historical use of violence .
Since its birth six decades ago , Israel has always been officially “ going after the terrorists , ” but its actions have invariably harmed civilians in an indiscriminate manner .
The roll call of dishonor is long indeed , but its highlights include : the massacre of some 200 civilians in Tantura , as well as large - scale massacres in at least a dozen other Palestinian villages , during the 1948 war that established Israel ; Ariel Sharon ’s attack on the village of Qibya in 1953 that killed 70 innocent Palestinians ; the Kfar Qassem massacre inside Israel when 49 farm workers were gunned down at an improvised army checkpoint ; a massacre in the same year in the refugee camp of Khan Yunis , in Gaza , in which more than 250 civilians were killed ; attacks on dozens of Palestinian , Egyptian and Syrian villages during the 1967 war ; the killing of six unarmed Arab citizens of Israel in 1976 ; the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in the Lebanese refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla in 1982 ; the unremitting use of lethal force by the army against unarmed Palestinians , often women and children , during the first intifada of 1987 - 93 ; the aerial bombardment of Qana in south Lebanon in 1996 that killed more than 100 civilians ; and the endless “ collateral damage ” of Palestinian civilians during the second intifada , including a half - ton bomb that killed a husband and wide and their seven children a week ago .
The true reasons for these deaths are concealed from credulous observers by Israel ’s use of Orwellian language .
When it says it is destroying the “ infrastructure of terror , ” Israel means it is crushing all Arab resistance to its territorial ambitions in the region .
The “ infrastructure ” includes most Arab men , women and children because they continue to support  against Israel ’s wishes  their peoples ’ rights to self - determination without interference from the Israeli army .
In this sense , and others , there is very little difference between what Israel is doing in Gaza to overturn the democratic wishes of the Palestinian electorate and what it is doing in Lebanon to smash any hopes of a democratic future for its northern neighbor .
In Gaza , it wants Hamas destroyed because Hamas is prepared to counter Israel ’s unilateral policies with its own unilateral agenda ; and in Lebanon , Israel wants Hezbollah obliterated because it is the only force capable , possibly , of preventing a repeat of Israel ’s long invasion and occupation of the 1980s and 1990s .
By rounding up the Palestinian cabinet , Israel is not destroying terror , it is clipping the political wings of Hamas , those in its leadership who are quickly learning the arts of government and searching for a space in which they can negotiate with Israel .
Through its rejectionist behavior , Israel is only confirming the doubts of those in the Hamas military wing who argue Israel always acts in bad faith .
Similarly in Lebanon , Israel is holding Hezbollah less to account with its attacks than the Lebanese people and their government , despite the latter ’s transparently shaky grip on the country .
Israel ’s military strikes polarize opinion in Lebanon , weaken Fouad Siniora and his ministers , and threaten to push Lebanon over the brink into another civil war .
Israel is keen to talk about “ changing the balance of power ” in Gaza and Lebanon , implying that it is trying to strengthen the “ democrats ” against the “ terrorists . ”
But this impression is entirely false .
Israeli actions are destroying what little balance of power exists in Gaza and Lebanon so that the two areas become ungovernable .
In Gaza , Israel has been engineering a debilitating struggle for power between Fatah and Hamas , while in Lebanon whatever hollow shell of national unity has existed till now is in danger of cracking under the strain of the Israeli onslaught .
Superficially at least , this seems self - destructive behavior on Israel ’s part , given that it has also been striving to detect the fingerprints of outside actors in Gaza and Lebanon .
In the case of Gaza , Israel points to Syria as a safe haven for the exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshal , to Hezbollah and Iran as sponsors of Hamas “ terror ” and even to a new al - Qaeda presence .
In the case of Lebanon , Israel additionally identifies the strong ties between Hezbollah and Damascus and Tehran .
So why would Israel want Lebanon and Gaza to be ravaged by factional fighting of the kind that might make them more vulnerable to this kind of unwelcome interference from outside ?
A history lesson or two helps clarify Israel ’s reasoning .
In the occupied Palestinian territories , Hamas was born during the upheavals of the first intifada and encouraged by Israel as a counterweight to the unifying secular Palestinian nationalism of Yasser Arafat .
In Lebanon , the Shi’ite militia Hezbollah was the inevitable byproduct of Israel ’s occupation of the south and its establishment of a mostly Christian proxy militia , the South Lebanon Army , against the Muslim majority .
In both cases it is clear Israel hoped that , by Islamizing its opponents in these regional conflicts , it would delegitimize them in the eyes of Western allies and that it could cultivate sectarianism as a way to further weaken the social cohesiveness of its neighbors .
Recently Israel has encouraged the slide deeper into Islamic extremism through its policies of unilateralism and its refusal to negotiate .
The same set of policies is being continued now in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon : the shattering of these two societies will only deepen the trend toward radical Islam .
Islamic movements not only offer the best hope of local resistance to Israel for these weakened societies but they also offer a parallel social infrastructure of health care and welfare services as state institutions collapse .
There is immediate advantage for Israel in this outcome .
With secular society crushed and Islamic resistance movements filling the void , Israel will be able to reinforce the impression of many in the West that Israel is on the front line of global “ war of terror ” being waged by a single implacable enemy , Islam .
Israel ’s ability to persuade the world that this war is being waged against the whole “ civilized ” Judeo - Christian
West will be made that bit easier .
As a result , Israel may be able to drag its paymaster , the United States , deeper into the mire of the Middle East as a junior partner rather than as an honest broker , giving Israel cover while it carves up yet more Palestinian land for annexation , puts further pressure on the Palestinians to leave their homeland , and destabilizes its regional enemies so that they are powerless to offer protest or resistance .
For some time President Bush has found himself in no position to criticize Israeli actions when Tel Aviv claims to be doing no more to the Palestinians than the US is doing to the Iraqis .
If the US allows itself to be handcuffed to Israel ’s even more extreme version of the “ war on terror , ” the consequences will be dire not just for the Palestinians or the region , but for all of us .
Solar Jacket
Okay , you have to admit that the solar shingles we showed you were pretty cool .
You have not seen anything yet !
Check out the Trademarked PowerFLEX ™ solar panels for jackets .
These solar panels are built exclusively for the SeV ( ScotteVest ) line of jackets .
These solar panels are lightweight , flexible , and incredibly powerful .
The solar pack is kind of an unusual size , but it only measures 16 " x 14 ” at its largest area .
The whole panel weighs less than 3 oz .!
The solar panels consist of unique flexible thin - film photovoltaic material made from copper indium gallium diselenide ( CIGS ) sun-absorbing material placed onto a thin substrate .
The solar panels connect to a battery that is about the size of a deck of cards .
It weighs approximately 5 oz .
and is hidden away inside the SeV jacket .
Incredibly , this tiny battery , once fully charged can charge a cell phone in 2 - 3 hours , a PDA in 3 - 5 hours , or many other gadgets .
The solar panels can even be used independently of the jacket to draw solar energy .
According to the manufacturer , " the battery powers your device almost immediately after the solar panels are exposed to sunlight .
Once the battery is fully charged , the panels can be removed and your portable electronic device can tap into the stored power .
Typical charge times in direct sunlight range from 2 - 3 hours , but direct sunlight is not required .
The battery pack can charge any device compatible with Universal Serial Bus ( USB ) chargers , including cell phones , PDAs , Game Boys , MP3 players , and other mobile devices . "
This has got to be the coolest jacket available !
Solar powered jacket ...hmmm !
What will they think of next ?
Nuclear underwear ?
Okay , I am sold ... take me to the store before my wife gets home !

Včerajšnja oddaja Piramida je kriva za tole protestno pismo , ki sem ga poslal na RTV Slovenija .
Že od prve oddaje Piramida , ki je na sporedu prvega programa ob torkih zvečer , sem prepričan , da format oddaje Piramida ne ustreza poslanstvu javne televizije , ki naj bi skrbela za dvigovanje nivoja komuniciranja v družbi in argumentiranega predstavljanja mnenj ter za produkcijo kakovostnih vsebin .
Oddaja Piramida ne izpolnjuje nobenega od navedenih postulatov .
Zato sem jo nehal gledati in se z argumentom , da ne morejo vse oddaje ustrezati vsem gledalcem , tolažil .
A je bil tak “ protest ” kratkega diha .
Mitja Čepič – prijatelj iz študentskih let in takrat sotrpin pri reviji Zofa – se je v Financah že razpisal o oddaji in za nekaj časa nekako pomiril moje razburjenje .
Da vam pišem , pa sem se odločil po včerajšnjem hujskaškem šovu ( tega tudi pri najboljši volji ne morem imenovati oddaja ) , v katerem se je potrdilo dejstvo , da format oddaje ne more zagotavljati pričakovanega nivoja kakovosti .
Oddajo sem si ogledal le zato , ker sem bil šokiran nad izborom gostov , ki so bili predstavljeni v napovedniku in ki je kar klical po katastrofi .
Posledica izbora gostov , ki so nastopili v oddaji 28 .
novembra , bi lahko bila v drugačnih okoliščinah kvečjemu neokusna oddaja , tako pa smo bili priča podpihovanju najnižjih človeških strasti .
Odgovornost za sovražni govor v oddaji , poceni senzacionalizem in situacijo , ki je nastala po omenjeni oddaji ne samo na hodniku RTV stavbe ampak tudi v slovenski javnosti , boste morali prevzeti vsi , ki ste to omogočili : voditeljica , ki situaciji v studiu ni bila dorasla , in uredniki , ki ste dovolili , da se takšna oddaja sploh pojavi na televiziji .
Zaradi zgoraj povedanega glasno protestiram proti tovrstni praksi in zahtevam , da oddajo – ne samo zaradi včerajšnje oddaje in posledic , ki jih bo imela – za vedno umaknete s sporeda .
Prah se je dvignil tudi v medijih :
Zganile so se tudi druge organizacije in posamezniki :
This is the first in a series of articles that will provide step - by - step instructions for implementing Bluetooth Proximity Detection .
We ’re going to focus on using it with Asterisk ®@Home , a terrific PBX which also happens to be free .
But your imagination is really the only limitation .
At the very least , when we ’re finished , you ’ll be able to walk out of your home or office carrying your bluetooth phone or headset and have your Asterisk server automatically transfer your incoming calls to your cellphone .
And , when you return carrying your bluetooth phone or headset , Asterisk will automatically cancel the call transfers and reactivate delivery of incoming calls to the designated phones in your home or office .
As simple as this concept may sound , the devil is in the details .
So we want to spend today warning you of all the minefields that lie ahead and telling you what hardware you ’ll need to make things work .
If you hurry , you can implement the whole system for just over $ 50 , and we ’ll show you how to do it without even owning a bluetooth cellphone .
In subsequent articles , we ’ll put the pieces together and get a basic system working .
Then we ’ll add more bells and whistles and give you some implementation and deployment suggestions .
You ’ll quickly come to appreciate how Bluetooth Proximity Detection can be used to implement all sorts of other features .
When we ’re finished , you ’ll also appreciate the potential of bluetooth to revolutionize the workplace .
And it goes far beyond your phone system .
Imagine an automated IN / OUT message board in businesses such as real estate or the advertising potential to tailor TV display ads in stores based upon not only your presence but also the type of cellphone you are carrying .
Your office can even kiss its old punch clock goodbye when we ’re finished .
For those with new Cadillac or Mercedes automobiles , you can unlock your car and start it just by approaching the vehicle with your " key " still in your pocket .
So where do we start ?
NOTE : This article has been updated to take advantage of TrixBox , freePBX , and the iPhone .
For the current article , click here .
Overview .
The basic idea behind proximity detection is that we run a software application on a computer to " watch " for approaching people .
We then want it to do something when you ( or a customer ) gets within range .
How do it know ?
Well , in our case , this is where Bluetooth comes in .
Unlike motion detectors which can’t tell the difference between a human and a gorilla , bluetooth devices all have a unique MAC address just like a network card .
And most bluetooth devices also have a name .
So long as the bluetooth device is configured to advertise its presence , we can detect when it is within range and when it ’s not .
That ’s the second major difference between bluetooth and traditional motion detectors .
Ever been in a public restroom or an office when all the lights went out because everybody was sitting too still for too long ?
So motion detectors have some limitations .
Bluetooth does n’t .
In case you ’ve been living under a rock for the past six years , bluetooth is a wireless communications protocol that uses short range radio frequency to connect devices into wireless personal area networks ( PANs ) .
The most common Class II 2.5 mW devices have a range of 32 feet ( 10 meters ) .
Class I devices have a range of up to 100 meters .
Most bluetooth cellphones , headsets , and computer peripherals such as mice and keyboards are Class II devices .
If you want more background , go here .
Prerequisites .
For our proximity detection project , we ’re going to connect a bluetooth network adapter to an Asterisk@Home box and make it our master .
That simply means we ’re going to use this network adapter to look for other bluetooth devices within range .
The only limitation is you ca n’t have your Asterisk@Home box shoved in a closet in the basement if you want this to work .
It will need to be within 30 feet or so of where you ’ll be when you ’re at home or in the office .
If this does n’t work for you , then here ’s an alternative .
Just get in the habit of putting your cellphone or bluetooth headset down near your Asterisk@Home box when you ’re " in " and take it with you when you ’re " out . "
Many offices , particularly in the real estate business , have a receptionist with agent mailboxes immediately beside or behind the receptionist desk .
Just put your Asterisk box with its bluetooth adapter under the receptionist ’s desk and leave your cellphone or wireless headset in your mailbox whenever you return to the office .
The adapter we recommend which is quirk - free is dLink ’s DBT - 120 .
You can find them on the net for about $ 30 , but you can usually beat that price by watching the Sunday circulars for computer and office depot / max stores in your area … if you do n’t mind mail - in rebates .
But , do you really want the PBX for your whole office sitting under the receptionist ’s desk ?
Probably not .
But do n’t worry , we ’ve got some other tricks up our sleeve so keep reading .
We keep mentioning a headset so we wo n’t keep you in suspense any longer .
You do n’t need a bluetooth cellphone to make our proximity detection project work .
A bluetooth wireless headset works just as well .
In fact , it works better !
And you ’ll have a great addition to your computer system and cellphone as an added bonus .
Cellphones have a nasty habit of putting themselves in sleep mode very quickly when not in use to conserve battery power .
The only problem is that most , if not all , cellphone makers turn off the bluetooth adapter when they activate sleep mode because they ’re all so short - sighted that the only thing they think you use bluetooth for is to talk to your wireless headset or exchange files with your PC .
Stupid !
Bluetooth headsets on the other hand are always on listening for a call .
The one we like has a rated standby time of 200 hours between battery charges so it ’s perfect for this project .
These devices typically cost anywhere from $ 50 to $ 100 but , if you hurry , there ’s a vendor selling our favorite , the Plantronics M3000 , for under $ 20 .
Here ’s the link at PriceGrabber .
Do n’t wait .
They ’re never this cheap , and this vendor only has 50 of them .
And Buy.com has a similar unit from IOgear for about the same price once you factor in the cost of shipping .
Will you need to wear your bluetooth headset and look like a Nerd to make this work ?
Not at all .
Just turn it on , stuff it in your pocket , and call it a key .
Now let ’s address the computer issues .
First , your machine obviously needs USB adapter support so you have a place to plug in your bluetooth adapter .
Second , we need a machine that can run software that can detect bluetooth devices .
Having spent a week scouring the Internet and testing various products which touted their bluetooth proximity detection , let me save you some time .
If you are fortunate enough to have a Sony Ericsson phone with bluetooth , some of the commercial products such as BluePhoneElite for the Mac or Salling Clicker for Mac or Windows work great for proximity detection .
There ’s even an open source product , Romeo for the Mac , that works .
If you have a single - tasking Palm device including the Treo 650 cellphone , do n’t waste your time .
And bluetooth headsets are n’t detected at all by any of the products .
This is primarily because proximity detection was considered a gee - whiz extra in most of these products so it ’s not implemented very well .
The good news is that , if you happen to have a bluetooth cellphone that does work with one of these products , it might make proximity detection more practical because you could handle the proximity interaction with your desktop machine instead of with your telephone system ’s PBX .
But , who cares .
We just want it to work .
So where does that leave us on the computer front ?
The bottom line is you ’re going to need a Linux machine and a fairly current version of the Linux operating system to get the bluetooth tools installed that we need .
As luck would have it , the new Asterisk@Home 2.0 beta release works great … and it ’s free .
And it automatically installs CentOS / 4 , the free knock - off of RedHat ’s commercial Enterprise Linux 4 .
Because Asterisk@Home is free and will run on any old clunker PC , you may want to install the Asterisk@Home 2.0 beta on a dedicated machine and just use it for proximity detection .
This solves the colocation problem with your main PBX , and it has the added benefit of reducing the load on your primary Asterisk server .
The other terrific benefit of this approach is you ’ll have a hot standby system for your main PBX , and we ’ll integrate that into our tutorials one of these days , too .
When your one and only Asterisk@Home box dies , do you really want to be without phone service ?
Keep in mind that proximity detection also takes some horsepower because we ’ll be running a script once a minute to see who ’s in and who ’s not .
And , no , Asterisk@Home 1.5 wo n’t work .
Believe me , we ’ve tried and it was just about as frustrating as trying to use a Treo 650 for proximity detection .
A total bust !
Well , that covers the basics and provides you the information you ’ll need to start assembling the pieces for the proximity detection project .
We ’ll leave it to you to get your bluetooth hardware ordered and to get your Asterisk@Home 2.0 beta up and running before moving on to Chapters 2 and 3 .
Some Recent Nerd Vittles Articles of Interest …
Each connection requires an overhead of at least 3 packets to be initiated ( SYN , SYN - ACK , and ACK packets ) .
This means that at least three round - trips are required to open a connection , which obviously slowed things down .
Due to the nature of TCP , which underlies HTTP , a connection gets " faster " the longer it is open .
By continously opening and closing new connections , HTTP would never be able to fully utilize its available bandwidth .
KeepAlive : either
On or Off , depending on whether Apache should allow connections to be used for multiple requests
: either On or Off , depending on whether Apache should allow connections to be used for multiple requests KeepAliveTimeout : how long , in seconds , Apache will wait after a request has been answered for another request before closing the connection
: how long , in seconds , Apache will wait after a request has been answered for another request before closing the connection MaxKeepAliveRequests : how many total requests a client can issue across a single connection
: how many total requests a client can issue across a single connection MaxClients : the total number of worker processes that Apache will allow at any given time
There was a link on Digg a couple of days ago to an article about how to tune Apache so as to survive a Slashdotting .
After reading it through , I came to the conclusion that the author had no idea what he was talking about .
Not only did he admit that he had never experienced the " Slashdot Effect " , but his advice was just plain wrong .
I offered a few comments there , but I figured that I should elaborate on a few of them here .
I 'll post each major configuration topic as a new blog entry , and today 's entry is about HTTP 's Keep - Alive feature .
The original HTTP protocol did not allow keep - alives , which meant that a connection was made to the server for each file that needed to be downloaded .
This was a very inefficient method of doing things , especially since web pages typically had several files that needed to be downloaded in order to be properly displayed .
Why was it inefficient ?
For two reasons :
The designers of HTTP realized this weakness in the protocol , and took steps to correct it in the next version of HTTP .
This new version of HTTP incorporated the concepts of keep - alives , where a client could keep a connection to the web server open indefinitely , or at least as long as the server permitted .
Although this somewhat went against HTTP 's original design goal of being " stateless " , it allowed for it to overcome its speed and overhead problems .
Now let 's examine how Apache works .
When you start Apache , a main " coordinator " process is created .
This main process is responsible for accepting incoming connections and passing them off to " worker " processes that it creates .
These workers then read users ' requests and send back responses .
Once a worker is done servicing a user 's requests , it reports back to the main process and then waits for a new connection to be handed to it .
So , in theory , keep - alives are a great thing .
They allow web clients and servers to fully utilize their available bandwidth , and reduces latency by eliminating the overhead of frequently opening new connections .
In a perfect world , you would want Apache 's KeepAliveTimeout setting to be " infinity " , so that web clients maintain a connection to the web server for as long as possible and thus everything on your web site pulls up as fast as possible .
Apache allows you to configure its behavior in regard to keep - alives through a few options in its configuration file :
The default Apache configuration file sets KeepAlive to be on , with a KeepAliveTimeout of 15 seconds and MaxKeepAliveRequests of 100 .
The MaxClients setting is set to 150 .
Unfortunately , nothing in life is free , not even keep - alives .
Each client connection requires Apache to create ( or use a waiting ) worker process to service its requests .
These worker processes can only handle one connection at a time , and each connection will last at least 15 seconds .
Apache will create a new worker process for each new connection until it hits its limit of MaxClients at 150 .
Thus , the cost of a keep - alive is one worker process for the KeepAliveTimeout .
Now imagine what happens when 1,000 web clients try to access your web site at the same moment ( e.g. when it first shows up on Slashdot ) .
The first 150 clients will successfully connect to your web server , because Apache will create workers to service their requests .
However , those web clients do not immediately leave ; after they 've downloaded your page , they will hold open their connections for 15 seconds until your server forces their connection to close .
The next 850 clients will be unable to access the web server , as all of the available Apache worker processes will be used up , waiting for 15 seconds on the unused connections to the first 150 clients .
Some of those 850 clients will queue up and wait for an available Apache process to service their request , but most will give up .
Perhaps some readers are wondering why you would n't just increase the MaxClients setting to something high enough to handle your peak load , like 2000 or something .
This is a very bad idea ; you can increase Apache 's MaxClients , but only at your own peril .
Because each Apache process consumes a bit of memory , you can only fit a certain number in memory before the web server begins to violently thrash , swapping things between RAM and the hard drive in a futile attempt to make it work .
The result is a totally unresponsive server ; by increasing MaxClients too high , you will have caused your own demise .
I will talk about how to figure out a good value for MaxClients in a future post , but a good rule of thumb might be to divide your total RAM by 5 megabytes .
Thus , a server with 512 megabytes of RAM could probably handle a MaxClients setting of 100 .
This is probably a somewhat conservative estimate , but it should give you a starting point .
So how do you fix the problem , other than by adding many gigabytes of RAM to the server ?
One easy way to get around this limitation is to either reduce the KeepAliveTimeout to a mere second or two , or else to simply turn KeepAlive off completely .
I have found that turning it down to 2 seconds seems to give the client enough time to request all of the files needed for a page without having to open multiple connections , yet allows Apache to terminate the connection soon enough to be able to handle many more clients than usual .
One interesting thing of which to take note is what the major Apache - based web sites allow , in terms of keep - alive timeouts .
In my ( very brief ) experiments , it seems that CNN craigslist , and Slashdot do n't permit keep - alives at all , while the BBC has a very short keep - alive timeout of under 5 seconds .
On the other hand , there are several other major Apache - based sites that do use a large keep - alive timeout ( Apple , CNET , etc ... ) , but they may have decided that they would prefer to take the performance hit so that they can have the " fastest " web sites as possible .
Of course , this is n't a perfect solution .
It would be nice to be able to have both high - performance as well as long - lived client connections .
Apache 2.2 , from what I understand , includes an experimental module that allows keep - alives to be handled very efficiently .
If it turns out to work well , then it could be a near - perfect solution to the problem .
It does have its problems ( i.e. it seems to require a threaded MPM , which is not recommended if you use PHP ) , but it could be incredibly useful in some situations .

Can You Help With Linear Algebra ?
I am glad to hear from both teachers and students .
I enjoy hearing about the experience that folks have with the book and I find suggestions helpful , especially bug reports .
I save these and periodically revise .
If you have something that you are able to share back then I 'd be glad to take a look .
For instance , I would love to have a topic on Machine Learning , or some sub - topic such as dimension reduction .
Of course , I reserve the ability to choose whether to edit or include it .
I gratefully acknowledge all the contributions that I use , or I can keep you anonymous .
In particular , I would exams or problem sets .
Some instructors have questions about using a text where the answers to the exercises are downloadable .
( I can't resist noting that for any widely - available text the Internet has copies of the answers . )
Thus additional sets of exercises without answers would answer the requests of some instructors .
If you could contribute your TeX or LaTeX source that 'd be great because then instructors could cut and paste .
I would also welcome contributions related to the emerging electronic tools .
For instance , if you have sets of questions that are suitable for Moodle quizzes and that you could share with other users of this book then write me and we can see about making them available .
The same holds for WeBWorK problem sets .
And , I would be glad to be able to include in the distribution a deck of Anki cards .

I am writing this in hopes that it will draw attention to the dubious practices and shoddy " customer service " I and many like me received this past week .
As part of their Black Friday special Office Max made their sale items available online .
On the night before Thanksgiving , I and many others ( possibly up to 1,100 ) ordered the Averatec 2370 12 " laptop for the sale price of $ 599 .
For the next week I checked the Office Max website and my order was listed as " Shipping in 6 - 9 days " .
On Thursday , i received an email stating that my order had been backordered .
I called Office Max customer service to confirm that , yes my order had been backordered and it would be back in stock in 10 business days .
Finally , yesterday , I got yet another email telling me that my order had be cancelled .
This is where things turned very sour .
Office Max is now , or has already , cancelled all of the orders received from their website for this laptop that exceeded their initial supply .
When I called customer service again I asked why my order was cancelled and was told that they can no longer get the laptop and that 's it .
Subsequently , later in the evening I was contacted by someone from Office Max offering a $ 50 gift card for the " inconvenience " of ordering a laptop at a $ 300 savings and having the company cancel my order .
I find it very hard to believe that this laptop is no longer being made .
It is still a new model and less than two months ago this model was upgraded by Averatec ( http://www.engadget.com/2006/10/17/averatec-goes-dual-core-with-ultraportable-2300/ ) .
I will be contactin Averatec on Monday to confirm that this model is still in production .
Office Max is able to get these laptops but would rather disappoint a possibly large number of their customers than take a loss on filling the orders that they willing took .
I placed my order .
Office Max took my money .
Cancelling orders simply because it is inconvenient for them to fill is one of the poorest examples of customer service I have ever seen .
It is false advertising at best and outright fraud at worst .
I 'm listing several links below for anyone who is in the same situation as I and would like to let the crooks at Office Max know how you feel .
These were gathered by the folks on the forums at Slickdeals .
net .
I 've also listed relevant links to forums that are discussing this topic .
If I 'm missing any forums please email me or post links in the comments .
I would love to have everyone who has had their order cancelled flood the number listed below with their complaintTO HELP PLEASE DIGG THIS STORY !!!
If we can draw attention to this then Office Max will have to pay attention and not be able to sweep us under the rug .

ス トレージ : GFSはGNU / Linuxのファイルシステム上に構築された分散ファイルシステムです。以下、「ストレージ」と呼んだ場合は、GNU/Linuxのファ イルシステムを意味しています(ファイルシステムであることはGFSの本質では無いので、ストレージがRDBであっても本質は変わりません ) 。
* インターフェー ス( API )
+ POSIX 互換では無いですが、一般的なファイル操 作API を提供しているようです。要は、gfs_open ( ) やgfs_read( ) などの API で す( API 名は想像です ) 。
+ ファイルの指定は、ツリーベースのファイルパスです。つまり、/usr/bin/emacsなどのファイルパスで一意に識別します。言うまでも無く、ファイルの実体は分散したPCのディスクにばらまかれています。
+ 特別な書き込みインターフェースとして、record-appendがあります。次のような事情のためです。GFSのファイルを書き込むクライアントは複
数存在しえます。つまり、ひとつのクライアントがwriteを連続して行っても、他のクライアントに割り込まれて、意図通りの書き込みにならないことがあ ります。record-appendはある単位で書き込みが割り込まれないことを保証したAPIです(GFSはこのrecord-appendの効率に最 適化されています )
+ snapshotと呼ばれ るAPI を提供しています。ディレクトリツリーの一部分を高速にコピーできる機能です。詳細は後述しますが、実際のファイルコピーを遅延することで、巨大ツリーのコピーであっても高速に実行できます。
+ リンク機構( ハードリンク、シンボリックリンク ) はありません。
* 概要
+ 構成ノードは、マスターノード、チャンクサーバ、クライアントの3種類です。
+ 単一のマスターノードが、ファイルのディレクトリツリーの状態管理、ロック管理、チャンク( 下記参照)の位置管理を担います。
+ 複数のチャンクサーバがマスターノードの下にぶら下がります。各ファイルは固定長のチャンクに分割されて、チャンクサーバのストレージに保存されます。各チャンクは、複数のチャンクサーバに複製されます(レプリケーション ) 。
+ クライアントは、GFSを利用するアプリと、それにリンクされるライブラリです。ライブラリはネットワークRPCを隠蔽したAPIを提供します。アプリ側 の視点で見ると、APIを通じてGFS上にファイルを作ったり、読み書きしたりします(*注4) 。GFS側の視点で見ると、アプリにリンクされたライブラ
リが、マスターやチャンクサーバとGFS通信プロトコルで話をします。
+ チャンク( ファイルのコンテンツの断片)自体の転送は、クライアントとチャンクサーバの間で直接行われます(マスターは転送に介在しません。マスターは、クライアントにチャンクサーバの位置を教えるだけです ) 。
* チャンク
+ GFS上に保存されたファイルは、固定サイズ( 64MByte )に分割されて保存されます。この分割された断片をチャンクと呼びます。
+ 各チャンクは、GFS上でユニークかつ変化しない( immutable ) ID ( =64 bitのchunk handle ) で識別されます。
+ chunk handle の割り当てはマスターが一元的に行います(*注5 ) 。
+ 1チャンクは、複製を持つ各チャンクサーバのファイルシステム上の1ファイルになります。chunk handleからローカルファイルパスへのマップは、各チャンクサーバが管理します。
+ 各チャンクは、複数のチャンクサーバ上に複製され同期されます。チャンクの複製数のデフォルトは3です。
+ チャンクはversionを持ちます。これは履歴管理のためではなく(GFSに履歴管理はありません)、チャンクの複製が正しく同期しているかを検出するためです(詳細後述 ) 。
* 構成ノードの概要
** マスター
+ マスターノードはシステムで単一です。
+ マスターの主な役割( 保持する状態 ) は次の6つです。
++ ファイルのディレクトリツリー(要は/usr/bin/emacsなどのファイルパス)の管理
++ ファイルからチャンクへのマップ( ファイルパスからchunk handlesへの対応 )
++ チャンクの位置情報管理(チャンクがどのチャンクサーバ上にあるか)
++ ファイルのロック処理
++ ファイルのその他のメタデータ管理(ファイルオーナー、ファイルパーミッション)
++ チャンクサーバの生存確認( HeartBeatメッセージで死んだチャンクサーバを検出)、状態管理(空きディスク容量や負荷 ) 。
+ 上の状態は、すべてオンメモリーに持ちます[ GFSのポイント ] 。
++ ディレクトリツリーの状態は、ストレージに持ちません。ディレクトリツリーへの変更は、すべて操作ログ(operation log)の形でストレージに書き込まれます(シャドウマスターのストレージにも )(*注6 ) 。
++ マスターがクラッシュしてオンメモリの状態が失われた場合、操作ログからディレクトリツリーをオンメモリに復元します( replay the operation log ) 。一般のファイルシステムであれば、ディレクトリツリーの状態をストレージに残すので、これはGFSの特徴的な点です。
++ 容易に想像できるように、操作ログは非常に巨大化します。巨大化した操作ログから状態を復元するには時間がかかります。このため、ある程度のタイミング で、操作ログにcheckpointを設定して、その時点の状態をストレージに保存します。クラッシュからの復帰は、最後のcheckpointとそれ以
降の操作ログから行います。
++ ファイルからチャンクへのマップも、同様に操作ログで保持します。
++ チャンクの位置情報とチャンクサーバの状態も、ストレージに持ちません。チャンクサーバの状態は、各チャンクサーバが知っていれば良い、という割り切りで
す。マスターがクラッシュから復帰すると、各チャンクサーバに状態(どのチャンクを持っているか)を問い合わせます。また、後述するGCのために、マス ターと各チャンクサーバは定期的に、チャンクサーバがどのチャンクを持っているかの情報をやりとりします。
++ 全てをオンメモリに押し込むために、設計上の工夫がいくつかあります(後述 ) 。
** マスターノードの障害対策
+ マスターノードが落ちたことの検出は、GFSの外部モニター機構で行っています。落ちると自動起動します。操作ログからオンメモリに状態を復元します。
+ マスターノードのハードウェア障害の場合は、別のマシンのマスターノードが起動します。切替えはDNSベースです。
+ シャドウマスターが複数存在して、操作ログで状態を同期しています。マスターが落ちている場合でも、read-onlyで稼働して、GFSを存続します。
** マスターノードのディレクトリツリー
+ ディレクトリツリーの内部データの持ち方は、普通のUnixのファイルシステムと違います。普通のUnixのファイルシステムの場合、ディレクトリごとに
ファイル一覧を持ちます。つまり、/usr/bin/emacsであれば、/usrディレクトリの1エントリにbinがあり、/usr/binディレクト
リの1エントリにemacsがあります。GFSは、ファイルパスからメタデータへの一元的なマップを持ちます。つまり、/usr、/usr/bin、
/usr/bin/emacsそれぞれのファイルパスからメタデータへマップする内部データ構造です(*注7 ) 。
+ このメタデータマップ( ディレクトリツリー )
をオンメモリで持つために、ファイルパスのprefix compressionをしてメモリを節約しています。詳細は書いてないのですが、おそらく、「/usrを/a、/binを/b、/emacsを/c」の
ような変換テーブルを持たせて、メモリを節約していると思います(*注8 ) 。
* ロック( 排他制御 )
+ 複数のクライアントが同時に同じファイルに書き込んだり、同名のファイルを作ろうとした時、排他制御が必要です。排他制御は、マスターが一元的にロック管理することで実現しています。
+ 全てのファイルパスは対応するロックオブジェクト( read- write lock ) を持ちます。つまり、/d1/d2/.../dn/leafのファイルパスが存在すれば、/d1、/d1/d2、...、/d1/d2/...
/dn、/d1/d2/.../dn/leafのそれぞれに、対応するロックが存在します(*注9 ) 。
+ 例えば、/usr/bin/emacsに書き込んでいる間、マスターは、/usrと/usr/binのreadロック、/usr/bin/emacsのwriteロックをロックします(*注10 ) 。
* 書き込みの同期( レプリカ間の同期 )
+ あるチャンクに書き込む時、マスターは、そのチャンクのレプリカを持つチャンクサーバの中のひとつを選んでleaseを与えます(*注11 ) 。
+ lease を与えられたチャンクサーバを 「 主( primary ) レプリカ 」と呼び、その他を 「 副( secondary ) レプリカ」と呼びます。
+ 複数のクライアントから同時に同じチャンクに書き込み要求が来た場合、主レプリカがそれらの書き込み要求に順序(serial number ) を付け、副レプリカはその順序に従ってチャンクに書き込みます。
+ マスターは各チャンクの最新versionを知っています。チャンクサーバがダウン中に同期の機会を逸しても、マスターが保持する最新versionと比
較することで、同期の機会を逸したことを検出できます(このような同期できていないチャンクをstale replicaと呼びます)。ちなみに、この場合、チャンクサーバはそのチャンクを捨てます。最新versionを持つチャンクサーバを探して同期を試み
るような複雑なことはしません。その代わり、チャンクの複製がひとつ失われたことをマスターに通知します。マスターは最新versionのチャンク(これ
を持つチャンクサーバをマスターは知っています)の複製を増やして、レプリカ数を保ちます。
+ クライアントはマスターから、チャンクサーバの位置と同時に現在のversionを受け取ります。クライアントがチャンクサーバにアクセスした時、チャンクサーバの持つチャンクのversionを確認して、stale replicaを検出します( エラー扱い ) 。
+ 各チャンクサーバが独自にチャンクのchecksum(32bit)確認をします。ディスク障害などでチャンクが壊れた場合、そのチャンクはstale replicaです。
+ [ issue ]
クライアントはチャンクサーバの位置をキャッシュするので、stale replicaを読む可能性はゼロではありません。append-onlyで使っていると、あまり問題にはならない、という主張をしています。
* 書き込み時の通信フロー
- [ クライアント=>マスター ]
主/副レプリカのチャンクサーバの位置を問い合わせます(クライアントはチャンクサーバの位置をキャッシュします)。主レプリカが未定の場合、マスターは主レプリカを決めます(leaseを渡します ) 。
- [ クライアント=>1チャンクサーバ ]
チャンクサーバのうち、ネットワーク的に最も近い(*注12)チャンクサーバに書き込みデータを送信します。
- [ チャンクサーバ=>チャンクサーバ=>...]
書き込みデータはレプリカを持つチャンクサーバ間を転送されます(*注13)。例えば、レプリカを持つチャンクサーバが3台ありA,B,Cとします。ネッ トワーク的にクライアントから近い順にB,A,Cだとすると、書き込みデータは「クライアント=>B=>A=>C」の順に転送されま
す。この時、クライアントは(おそらく)3台と、制御メッセージのやりとりはしているはずです。この時点ではまだ、それぞれのチャンクサーバはローカル
ディスクのチャンクに書き込みはしません。
- [ クライアント=>主レプリカ( のチャンクサーバ ) ]
レプリカを持つ全チャンクサーバが書き込みデータを受信した後、クライアントは主レプリカに書き込み要求を送信します。
- [ 主レプリカ( のチャンクサーバ ) =>副レプリカ( のチャンクサーバ ) ]
主レプリカは、書き込み要求にシリアル番号を割り振ります。主レプリカは、シリアル番号順にローカルディスクのチャンクに、書き込みデータを反映させま
す。ディスクエラーなどで書き込みに失敗した場合、クライアントにエラーを返します。主レプリカは、副レプリカ(達)
に書き込み要求( シリアル番号付 ) を
送信します。各副レプリカは、シリアル番号順にローカルディスクのチャンク(レプリカ)に、書き込みデータを反映します。反映後、主レプリカに応答を返し ます。
- [ 主レプリカ( のチャンクサーバ=>クライアント ]
主レプリカは、全ての副レプリカから応答を受信すると、クライアントに応答を返します。副レプリカのひとつでもエラーが発生すると(レプリカに齟齬が生じ
ると)、主レプリカはクライアントにエラーを返します(*注14 ) 。
* 読み込み時の通信フロー
- [ クライアント=>マスター ]
チャンクサーバの位置を問い合わせます(クライアントはチャンクサーバの位置をキャッシュします ) 。
- [ クライアント=>1チャンクサーバ ]
チャンクサーバに受信要求を投げて、チャンクデータを受け取ります。
* レプリカの配置
+ 次の3つの基準でレプリカを置くチャンクサーバを決定します(*注15 ) 。
-- ディスクの空き容量の多いチャンクサーバ
-- レプリカ作成要求が、ひとつのチャンクサーバに連続し過ぎないこと
-- 主レプリカと物理的に離れていること(同じラックのPCにレプリカが固まっていると、物理的な障害ですべて失われる可能性があります ) 、
+ チャンクサーバが落ちると、そのチャンクサーバの持つチャンクのレプリカ数が不足します。すぐに新しいレプリカが作られます
+ マスターは、定期的にレプリカの再配置( rebalance )を行います。チャンクサーバの負荷とディスク容量を見て、再配置を決定しているようです(詳細不明 ) 。
+ これらの戦略により、新しいチャンクサーバがクラスタに追加されると、徐々にレプリカの対象となって、新しいディスクが使われていきます。
* 削除ファイルの扱 い( GC )
+ ファイルを削除しても、すぐに実体は消しません。削除時は、マスターの(オンメモリの)メタデータに反映(特別な隠れファイル名にrename)するだけなので、高速です。
+ マスター上の定期タスク( 別スレッド)が、ディレクトリツリーをスキャンして、削除済みファイルを検出します。削除から3日(長い!)以上経っていれば、 実際の削除処 理( GC : Garbage Collection ) を行います。3日以内であれば、undeleteが可能です。
+ GCで、マスターが削除ファイルのメタデータをオンメモリから削除します(操作ログも残します)。この時点では、まだチャンクサーバのチャンクの実体は削除しません(*注16 ) 。
+ 各チャンクサーバは定期的に、持っているチャンクの一覧をマスターに提出します。この時、マスターは、削除済みファイルのチャンク( orphaned chunk ) があれば、チャンクサーバに伝えます。チャンクサーバは、チャンクの実体を削除します。
+ 課題 : 削除をかなり遅延させるアプローチなので、「作ってすぐ消す一時ファイル」大量に作る用途に向いていません。
* snapshot
+ ファイルやディレクトリツリー( の部分 ) の高速コピーです。
+ snapshotを取った瞬間は、マスターのオンメモリ上でメタデータの複製を行うだけです(*注17)。マスターは、snapshotされたチャンクの
参照カウンタを上げます。クライアントからマスターへ、そのチャンクへの書き込み要求が来た時、マスターは参照カウンターを見て、チャンク自体の複製をし
てから(それぞれのチャンクオーナー上で複製)、書き換えます( copy-on-write ) 。

Gone in 20 Minutes : using laptops to steal cars
High - tech thieves are becoming increasingly savvy when it comes to stealing automobiles equipped with keyless entry and ignition systems .
While many computer - based security systems on automobiles require some type of key -- mechanical or otherwise -- to start the engine , so - called ' keyless ' setups require only the presence of a key fob .
The expert gang suspected of stealing two of David Beckham 's BMW X5 SUVs in the last six months did so by using software programs on a laptop to wirelessly break into the car 's computer , open the doors , and start the engine .
" It 's difficult to steal cars with complex security , but not impossible .
There are weaknesses in any system , " Tim Hart of the Auto Locksmith Association told the U.K. 's Auto Express magazine .
" At key steps the car 's software can halt progress for up to 20 minutes as part of its in - built protection , " said Hart .
Because the decryption process can take a while -- up to 20 minutes , according to Hart -- the thieves usually wait to find the car in a secluded area where it will be left for a long period .
That is believed to be what happened to Mr. Beckham -- the crooks followed him to the mall where he was to have lunch , and went to work on his X5 after it was parked .
While automakers and locksmiths are supposed to be the only groups that know where and how security information is stored in a car , the information eventually falls into the wrong hands .
According to the Prague Post leaving such information on a laptop is what got Radko Souï¿ ½?ek caught for stealing several cars .
" You could delete all the data from your laptop , but that 's not good for you because the more data you have , the bigger your possibilities , " he says .
He says any car that relies on software to provide security can be circumvented by other software .
" Every car has its weak spot , " he says .
Souï¿ ½?ek faces up to 12 years in prison .
The Leftlane Perspective : Many modern cars now rely on software entirely for security .
Gone are the days where microchips supplemented mechanical locks as an additional security measure .
In the case of true ' keyless ' systems , software is the only thing between a thief and your car .
As computers become more powerful , will stealing cars become even easier ?
Never mind future cars with better security -- what about today 's cars a few years down the road ?
With cars as inexpensive as the Toyota Camry offering entirely keyless systems , these concerns a relevant to all consumers .
Researchers have discovered that even a small amount of MDMA , better known as ecstasy , can be harmful to the brain , according to the first study to look at the neurotoxic effects of low doses of the recreational drug in new ecstasy users .
The findings were presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America .
“ We found a decrease in blood circulation in some areas of the brain in young adults who just started to use ecstasy , ” said Maartje de Win , M.D. , radiology resident at the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands .
“ In addition , we found a relative decrease in verbal memory performance in ecstasy users compared to non-users . ”
Ecstasy is an illegal drug that acts as a stimulant and psychedelic .
A 2004 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) found that 450,000 people in the United States age 12 and over had used ecstasy in the past 30 days .
In 2005 , NIDA estimated that 5.4 percent of all American 12th graders had taken the drug at least once .
Ecstasy targets neurons in the brain that use the chemical serotonin to communicate .
Serotonin plays an important role in regulating a number of mental processes including mood and memory .
Research has shown that long - term or heavy ecstasy use can damage these neurons and cause depression , anxiety , confusion , difficulty sleeping and decrease in memory .
However , no previous studies have looked at the effects of low doses of the drug on first - time users .
Dr. de Win and colleagues examined 188 volunteers with no history of ecstasy use but at high - risk for first - time ecstasy use in the near future .
The examinations included neuroimaging techniques to measure the integrity of cells and blood flow in different areas of the brain and various psychological tests .
After 18 months , 59 first - time ecstasy users who had taken six tablets on average and 56 non-users were re-examined with the same techniques and tests .
The study found that low doses of ecstasy did not severely damage the serotonergic neurons or affect mood .
However , there were indications of subtle changes in cell architecture and decreased blood flow in some brain regions , suggesting prolonged effects from the drug , including some cell damage .
In addition , the results showed a decrease in verbal memory performance among low - dose ecstasy users compared to non-users .
“ We do not know if these effects are transient or permanent , ” Dr. de Win said .
“ Therefore , we cannot conclude that ecstasy , even in small doses , is safe for the brain , and people should be informed of this risk . ”
This research is part of the Netherlands XTC Toxicity ( NeXT ) study , which also looks at high - dose ecstasy users and aims to provide information on long - term effects of ecstasy use in the general population .

Israel is launching a campaign to isolate Iran economically and to soften up world opinion for the option of a military strike aimed at crippling or delaying Tehran 's uranium enrichment programme .
Pressure will be applied to major US pension funds to stop investment in about 70 companies that trade directly with Iran , and to international banks that trade with its oil sector , cutting off the country 's access to hard currency .
The aim is to isolate Tehran from the world markets in a campaign similar to that against South Africa at the height of apartheid .
Meanwhile , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is to be pursued in international courts for calling the Holocaust a myth , and saying Israel should be wiped off the map .
The case will be launched under the 1948 UN convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide , which outlaws " direct and public incitement to genocide " .
Before flying to London to spearhead the mission to sell the sanctions , the Likud party leader , Binyamin Netanyahu , said : " A campaign to divest commercial investment from Iran , beginning with the large pension funds in the west ... either stops Iran 's nuclear programme or it will pave the way for tougher actions .
So it 's no-lose for us . "
In December the UN ordered a ban on the supply of materials that could contribute to Iran 's nuclear and missile programme , and an asset freeze on Iranian companies and individuals .
But it stopped short of a full travel ban .
Israeli defence sources claim that Iran is close to the point of no return in its uranium enrichment programme using gas centrifuges .
A senior official said : " They currently have problems but if the programme is allowed to continue without interruptions we estimate they will have mastered the technology this year .
We expect a declaration from them in the next month , possibly on February 21 , the day of the Islamic Revolution , that they have reached significant achievements .
" It will be a bluff , but it will have the potential of marketing Iran as a regional superpower .
If they do it , a nuclear Iran will cast a long shadow over the whole of the Middle East ; we will have Hizbullastan in Lebanon , Hamastan here , and Shiastan in Iraq . "
Military analysts speaking at an annual conference in Herzliya , near Tel Aviv , claimed that Israel was facing an " existential threat " from the Iranian uranium enrichment programme , which Tehran has consistently claimed was for a civilian nuclear fuel cycle .
The only division of opinion was over the imminence of this threat .
In some ways , it really is n't fair to raise the most extreme example of the pro-war faction of the libertarian movement , the orthodox Objectivists centered around Dr. Leonard Peikoff and the Ayn Rand Institute , because — judging from his pronouncements on the subject of the Iraq war — the man is clearly crazed , as his Ford Hall Forum speech , " America Versus Americans , " given last year , makes all too abundantly clear .
But it is really such a clear distillation of pure evil that I can't resist citing it : it is far too inviting a target .
Peikoff is sorely disappointed by this war , for a number of reasons , first and foremost being that his preferred target , Iran , is not yet in America 's crosshairs .
The war in Afghanistan was a letdown for him because we took care not to inflict civilian casualties .
This , says Peikoff , is immoral : in Iraq , too , we are far too squeamish about innocent civilians .
And I note that Peikoff emphasizes the word " innocent , " even as he proclaims that it would be immoral not to condemn these innocents to death .
When someone in the audience cried out in horror at this brazen display of naked evil , Peikoff interrupted his talk and imperiously demanded " please throw that man out . "
A far cry from Ayn Rand herself , who , during the 1930s , took to the stump for Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie , and , when confronted by hecklers — of which there were plenty — gave as good or better than she got .
But the thuggish , hectoring Peikoff , whose high - pitched voice is in stark contrast to his stern admonitions , will have none of that .
Unlike the neocons , whose foreign policy he faithfully echoes , up to and including their iconization of Israel , Peikoff does n't hide behind any beneficent - sounding slogans , like " exporting democracy " and implanting free markets and the rule of law .
This , he claims , would be " altruism , " the worst sin in the Objectivist theology — although why freedom , in the abstract , and not just one 's own freedom , cannot be a value in and of itself is not at all clear to me .
And the clear implication is that the Iraqis , like the Palestinians , are considered " savages " by Peikoff , who would n't appreciate such a gift in any case .
No , what we must do , says Peikoff , is kill them — enemy soldiers and innocent civilians alike .
This same maniacal bloodthirstiness is expressed by Yaron Brook , the executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute , in a recent lecture on " The Morality of War , " in which he outdoes Peikoff — and also Cuffy Meigs — in the complete thuggishness of his stance , advocating the wholesale slaughter of innocent civilians in a total war of annihilation against the entire Middle East — except Israel , of course .
When one timorous questioner raises the issue of how Mr. Brook reconciles such a view with the central doctrine of individualism , which is that all people are endowed with inalienable rights , Brook brushes this aside with an impatient wave of his hand and declares that all enemy civilians are legitimate targets .
The reason is because your government represents you , whether you like it or not .
So much for the idea of individualism .
Yes , but what about a six - year - old child , asks the persistent — and clearly perplexed — questioner , who complains that he has trouble " internalizing " ( his word ) this monstrous doctrine of collective responsibility for the crimes of a ruling elite .
What , he wants to know , has the child done to deserve such a fate ?
Brook hems , and haws , apparently reluctant to come right out and advocate child murder on a mass scale — and in the name of " individualism , " yet ! — but , in the end , he gathers up his courage , and , in a wavering voice that sounds eerily like Elmer Fudd , declares that six - year - old kids suffer all the time because of their parents ' behavior .
This instance — in his view  is no different , he says , except in degree , reiterating his crazed view that when a government violates rights , all the citizens of that state are guilty , and can therefore be put to death .
How can people who claim to hold " rationality " as their highest value sink to such depths of depravity ?
The problem is that these people are living in a fantasy world of pure abstractions , in which everything is viewed through the lens of a Manichean struggle between Reason and Unreason , Modernity and Primitivism , the West and the Rest .
The humanity and reality of anyone deemed " irrational " is defined out of existence , so that it 's okay to torture and kill six - year - olds .
Because , you see , they are n't really people .
Not like us .
As I said , it is a bit unfair to hold up the Ayn Rand Institute and the Peikoff cult as an example of anything but pure psychopathology .
Because they really have gone over the edge .
But the influence of their West versus the Rest mentality runs deep in libertarian circles , due almost entirely , I would submit , to the influence of Ayn Rand , who dismissed Palestinians as subhuman " savages " and whose foreign policy views were based , not only any knowledge of specific areas of the world , but on highly stylized abstractions unconnected to any facts .
The same abstract , supposedly " philosophical " outlook is shared by the " soft " Objectivists , represented by the Objectivist Center , headed up by David Kelley .
In a statement , the Center had the following to say :
" The attack was a deliberate assault not only on America ’s civilian population and government , but on its culture of reason , individualism , achievement , and freedom , with all their derivatives such as science , technology , capitalism , progress , and toleration .
In many public statements  and in their choice of the World Trade Center as a target  the terrorists have declared their hatred for this culture and their wish to destroy it . "
The idea that Osama bin Laden and his cohorts , sitting in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan , suddenly came upon a copy of the Bill of Rights , and were so outraged that they decided to put a big dent in the New York City skyline is absolute nonsense .
The last time we had a problem with these people was back in the late eighteenth century , when the Barbary pirates decided to hijack American shipping .
To imagine that , suddenly , the Muslim world has decided to go on a crusade against America because we 're so rational , so tolerant , so wonderful , and so free is narcissism , pure and simple — and just plain wrong .
Listen to what Michael Scheuer , a currently serving CIA analyst who had served for years on the Agency 's Al Qaeda task force , has to say about this Bushian - Objectivist view of 9/11 :
The United States is hated across the Islamic world because of specific U.S. government policies and actions .
That hatred is concrete not abstract , martial not intellectual , and it will grow for the foreseeable future .
While important voices in the United States claim the intent of US policy is misunderstood by Muslims , that Arabic satellite television deliberately distorts the policy , and that better public diplomacy is the remedy , they are wrong .
America is hated and attacked because Muslims believe they know precisely what the United States is doing in the Islamic world .
They know partly because of bin Laden 's words , partly because of satellite television , but mostly because of the tangible reality of US policy .
We are at war with an Al - Qaeda - led worldwide Islamist insurgency because of and to defend those policies , and not , as President Bush mistakenly has said , " to defend freedom and all that is good and just in the world .
Bin Laden 's credibility and stature in the eyes of Muslims is due to his success in persuading them that they must fight a defensive jihad against those intent on eradicating Islam and conquering the Middle East .
The invasion of Iraq has certainly done much to convince any skeptics that he has a point , but many did not need much convincing , as our record in that part of the world already provided bin Laden with plenty of grist for his mill .
As anyone who examines what bin Laden and his allies have actually said — and Scheuer ’s recent book , Imperial Hubris :
Why the West is Losing the War on Terror , is a rich source of information on this subject — the Islamists are up in arms over five issues of major import :
US support for Israel that keeps Palestinians in the Israelis ’ thrall
US and other Western troops on the Arabian Peninsula
US support for Russia , India , and China against their Muslim militants
US pressure on Arab energy producers to keep oil prices low
US support for apostate , corrupt , and often tyrannical Muslim governments
In short :
They are over here , because we are over there .
Chalmers Johnson , the foreign policy analyst , has popularized the concept of " blowback " — the unintended consequences of government action in the international arena .
It is an idea that ought to be all too familiar to libertarians , who are second to none in tracing the origins of these consequences when it comes to government intervention in domestic affairs .
We face a worldwide insurgency directed at the American homeland as a direct consequence of our interventionist foreign policy .
Its roots , however , are not in abstractions , such as the terrorists ' alleged hatred of our way of life , but in blood - and - flesh realities such as the March 8 , 1985 car bomb that went off in a Beirut suburb .
The intended target , a radical Muslim leader , was shaken but left alive .
Eighty others , mostly women and children , were killed , and 200 were wounded .
The bombing , according to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post , was the work of CIA director William Casey , who had enlisted the cooperation of the Saudis .
Retribution was not long in coming .
A few months later , Arab terrorists took over a TWA flight from Athens and executed a US Navy seaman on board , as they railed that it was payback time for the Beirut bombing .
One hijacker kept yelling " New Jersey ! New Jersey ! " as terrified passengers cowered in their seats .
He was talking about the battleship New Jersey , which had rained down death and , yes , terror in the form of 2000 - pound shells on Beirut the previous year .
Scheuer deals , not in abstractions , but in specifics : not in " philosophy , " but in empirical , verifiable facts .
In order to discover the truth about what is going on in the world , it is necessary know what you are talking about : you can't derive the answers to the Palestinian - Israeli conflict , or the how to defeat Al Qaeda , or what position to take on the Iraq war , from knowing that " A is A . "
The daffy method of Peikoff , of Kelley , and of all too many libertarians leads to support for militarism , empire - building , and the defeat of the very values they claim to uphold .
The abstractionists are taking the easy way out : all they have to do is repeat a few rote formulas , insert a few words here and there , and — bingo — they have a glib explanation , an instant position , all worked out in advance .
That 's a lot easier than taking a reality - based approach : it means you do n't have to do any research , you do n't have to read the newspapers ( except the editorial page ) and you do n't have to educate others , except to inculcate in them the same formulas you have memorized for the occasion .
The policy of global interventionism has a long and complex and bloody history , and it must be understood in order to see the present horror we face in context .
Osama bin Laden did not just pop up out of nowhere : he was , in a sense , our own creation .
We funded him , supported him , armed him in order to " liberate " Afghanistan from the Red Army — and when he turned on us , like a " tame " cobra gone rogue , we had to " liberate " Afghanistan again — essentially undoing the previous " liberation . "
Antiwar.com , the popular website of which I am editorial director , exists to educate Americans and readers worldwide .
What is the War Party up to ?
Where will they strike next ?
What is the history of the latest target of our campaign of " liberation " ?
Like our sister site , LewRockwell.com , we debunk the lies , expose the frauds , and take a magnifying lens to the elaborate deceptions that rationalize America 's policy of perpetual war .
And we do it because this is the central issue of our times .
If we take the road to Empire , then the idea of limited government is doomed : the crushing weight of confiscatory taxation will smother our old republic , and stamp out the last vestiges of America 's libertarian legacy .
Every war is a test , and , with this war we face our greatest test .
Most libertarians , I am glad to say , are rising to the occasion : others  swept along by the rising tide of militarism and statism , enthralled by the rhetoric of warmongering demagogues , blinded by narcissism and hubris — are falling by the wayside .
The American libertarian movement has gone full circle : we have come , in the end , to a replication of our beginnings .
The modern libertarian movement was born in the shadow of the Vietnam war , and the split with the neocon - ized conservative movement over the question of the war and civil liberties .
Only this time , we are bigger , stronger , more confident : we have not forgotten our history .
Now let us prove ourselves worthy of it .

[ Excerpt ]
ROADKILL ROUNDUP
During the lunch of STS - 114 , the vehicle struck a vulture shortly after liftoff . �
Fortunately , there was no severe damage to the External Tank . �
However , that risk is unacceptable for launch .��
In an effort to reduce the risk associated with vultures , both for commuters and Space Shuttle launches , SGS Roads and Grounds has organized a " road kill posse " with support from the NASA Shuttle and Environmental Programs . �
This action is aimed at reducing the vulture population at KSC by reducing their food source�� �
In this effort , we need everyone 's help , therefore if you see a dead animal on or beside the road , please contact the Duty Office at 853-5211 and report the exact location of the animal .�
The SGS crew will be sent to quickly remove the carrion before the vultures are attracted to the free meal .��
Timely removal of road kill will help reduce the safety risk to commuter traffic , other animals attracted to the road kill , such as Bald Eagles , and ultimately to the Shuttle and its crew� �
Shuttle safety and environmental protection are everyone 's responsibilities .�
So call 853-5211 .
Any questions contact the NASA Environmental Program Branch at 867-8448 .

Why Features Don't Matter Anymore
6 ) Any feature that requires learning will only be adopted by a small fraction of users .
Learning new features , even the ones that a user might find interesting or intriguing , is a real issue : nobody has time .
Getting consumers to upgrade and adopt new features is one of the biggest problems software publishers face these days .
Why Features Don't Matter Anymore : The New Laws of Digital Technology [ acm.org ]
Read this article .
Please go read this article .
The Internet is so filled with die hard geeks we seem to have forgotten that there is actually a whole world of users out there who do n't give a shit about computers .
Because the Internet allows us to connect to geeks around the world , it seems like computer literate people are all around us .
It 's an illusion .
Most people do n't care about computers , they use a computer because they MUST , not because it 's so fucking great to be using a computer all day .
They use word processors and email to correspond about subjects completely unrelated to computers , the internet or technology .
I know , its hard to fathom , but trust me on this .
These people do n't care about your flexible , brilliant architecture .
They do n't wish to tweak settings .
They do n't want to spend more that 10 consecutive seconds confused .
They just want simple , they want to get their task done and move on .
They do n't want to spend time learning anything because they know they 'll probably just forget it long before they 'll need to do it again anyway .
If you are selling to committees ( i.e. expensive business software packages ) then competing on features is somewhat effective .
It 's the checkbox game when there is a big committee , mostly because design aesthetic and usability are far too subjective to be discussed by committees .
Instead , Brand X and Brand Y are pitted head to head on a big chart , and the one with the most checkboxes has the visible advantage .
People think " Well , it does have a SOAP api , in case we ever decide to go that way ... " and never check to find out that the SOAP apis are buggy and barely useful because they are n't evaluating the software on the SOAP merits .
But they feel better knowing something is there already in place , just in case .
This is why so much enterprise software is barely usable crap , this is why your office phone has 100 features that you can't figure out how to use .
But when creating software for individuals , simplicity sells .
Lots of features , especially the " powerful " features users need explained to them , do just the opposite and make people feel insignificant , stupid and most of all powerless .
People just want to get a very specific thing done , and then MOVE ON .
They do n't want to learn anything , they are n't interested in catching the next wave of technology .
It 's not because they 're dumb , it 's not because they 're lazy , it 's because they have other interests that occupy the bulk of their thoughts , and they are n't computer related .

Sketchy Scheme
An Introduction to Functional Programming
Lulu Press , 2011 - 4.5th edition - 189 pages - 6 " x 9 " format
Sketchy Scheme is an introduction to functional programming in Scheme .
Scheme is a language of the Lisp family with particularly clean syntax and semantics .
It is frequently used in research and education .
Functional programming is an approach that focuses on the evaluation of expressions .
Programs are formed by combining functions .
Most functional programming constructs are free of side effects , which allows to examine programs formally and prove properties of algorithms .
This book provides a step - by - step introduction to functional programming in Scheme .
It covers various aspects of the language like data types , conditions , recursion , list processing , lexical scoping , closures , function definitions , dynamic typing , etc .
By means of numerous examples of varying complexity , it takes the reader on an entertaining and informative tour through the language .
contact | privacy
Using email encryption is one way to protect the privacy of your electronic correspondence .
For a brief history and explanation of how they work : PGP and GnuPG .
I cannot make any sort of guarantee as to the efficacy of these programs , though I know that the NSA and the Federal Government fought the implementation and free dissemination of PGP for years .
For me , this is one of those “ 165,000 coyotes ca n’t be wrong … ” arguments .
Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it .
I am not able to write documentation for implementing GPG for Windows , since I do n’t use that platform every day .
If you ’re one of those people who does , and you can provide us with something like this for Windows , please do .
I make no guarantee about any of these products .
If it breaks your computer , contact the software designer , not me .
I am providing these links and these screenshots to aid in the installation of these products that I trust .
I hope that you find it useful .
First , you will need to pilot your browser to the Mac GnuPG site , which looks like this :
Scroll down that page until you find the link to download the Gnu Privacy Guard for your version of OS X .
In my case , it was 10.4.5 , but I have discovered that the 10.3 version works just fine :
After you click the link , you will be offered a download site ( or “ Mirror site ” ) from which to download the software .
Pick any one .
I usually try to pick the one in North Carolina or Atlanta , just because I am biased like that , y’all :
This will download the GPG archive to your desktop .
If you are running a current version of StuffIt or some other compression utility , it will probably automatically unpack the archive and mount a virtual disk :
The virtual disk contains the installer and some documentation .
( And a great big Happy Gnu logo . )
Double - click the GnuPG for Mac OS X .mpkp :
You will be asked if you want to run a program to determine if the software can be installed .
The answer is “ Continue ” :
There ’s a brief explanation of the package that you are about to install .
Click “ Continue ” :
There is an information page about GnuPG and some instructions that you might want to refer to if you find that I have not been thorough enough .
Please print these and then hit “ Continue ” :
The GPL licensing page comes next .
The GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL or simply GPL ) is the most popular free software license , originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU project .
If you wish to understand the GPL licensing agreement about distribution and use of software that is produced under this unique license , you can read more here .
And you will have to agree to it .
Just do it .
You will need to select a destination disk .
This will need to be your boot disk , where your system folder lives .
You will notice that my iPod and backup disk were not eligible to be destination disks for this software .
Next , you will chose the sort of installation you want .
I did not explore the customized packages , and just clicked “ Upgrade , ” in the interest of keeping it simple .
You will need to enter your password .
And then the installer runs .
It installs documentation in several languages , including , as I happened to catch as the installer was running , Russian .
When GPG has finished installing , you will get a message saying “ The Software was Successfully Installed . ” Click “ Close . ”
You will then return to to the Mac GnuPG site and scroll down to the Keychain Access Application .
Click the above link to download “ Keychain Access . ”
Again , you will have to select a mirror site .
The same rules apply as before - pick any one you like :
You will be informed that the file that you are downloading contains an application .
Click “ Continue ” :
The file that downloads will place a folder on your desktop .
There is no installer for the Keychain Access application .
Drag this file to the folder called Applications on your hard drive .
This is not to be confused with the Applications ( OS 9 ) folder .
Once it is properly installed , the GPG Keychain Access folder looks like this :
If you open the GPG Keychain Access folder , you will find four files .
You want to doubleclick the one called “ GPG Keychain Access ” :
As soon as the application opens , you will be informed that you do not have a private or secret key . ”
Briefly , here is how GPG works - this program will generate two keys , a public one and a secret one .
You will give the public one to everyone who you receive email from .
You will keep the private key close , since you ’re the only one allowed to use it .
The public key is used to scramble messages sent to you , AND ONLY THE PRIVATE KEY ( in conjunction with your password ) can unscramble them .
So , it ’s time to make those keys .
A brief introduction follows .
Make sure the “ Use assistant to generate keys ” is checked .
You will select the type of key you wish to use .
Go with DSA and ElGamal .
We used to use RSA or Diffie - Helman , but I do n’t think that ’s an option any more , due to patents and trademarks .
In keys , like most everything else important , size matters .
What this number indicates is the complexity of the algorithm used to encrypt your data .
The higher the complexity , the more processor cycles it takes to deal with it .
1024 is minimum .
I suggest 2048 , because 4096 is so massive that your computer will have a hell of a time creating the key in any kind of timely manner .
Pick whatever you ’re comfortable with , and be aware of the consequences .
Your key SHOULD expire .
If you forget your password or lose your private key , what are you going to do ?
Do n’t ask me how I know this .
Just make sure your key expires in a year or so .
Pick a date that is meaningful to you if you think it will help you remember .
Enter the email you will be using and your name .
You can also use your vCard file from Address Book by checking the check box underneath the comment field .
I did this for mine .
Your encryption is only as good as the strength of your passphrase in the event that someone somehow gets your private key .
Even if I have your private key and your passphrase is “ tHe kwicKK brwn f000xA@__jump3d ov3r the LaZZEE døg ! $ $ ” there ’s no way that I am going to be able to use a dictionary to crack that , nor am I going to be able to randomly guess that .
HOWEVER , are you going to be able to remember it ?
Choose well , and keep it close .
Retype and double - check your passphrase to make sure that it ’s right by clicking the “ Show Passphrase ” button .
This way you can make sure that you did n’t accidently have the Caps Lock button on or anything .
You will then have the opportunity to review what you have done .
Make sure your details are correct .
If they are not , use the “ Go Back ” button .
With a 2048 bit key , the actual making of the key takes a while .
Might be time to make a cup of tea or go chase the dog .
This took ten minutes for me , this morning .
When the bar is solid from left to right , you ’re done making the key .
Click finish .
You keys window should look similar to this , with your new public key at the top of the window .
Now , select that new key and click the “ Export ” button .
This is the first step to making your public key available to other users so that they can send you encrypted emails .
A “ Save ” dialogue box will pop up .
Click the blue arrow next to the window where the name of the file is displayed .
This will drop down a directories window …
which will look like this .
I suggest steering to the Documents folder and clicking the “ New Folder ” button …
Which will open this dialogue box .
Call the new folder anything you want .
GPG , but you can call yours Fred if you want .
Or Key archive .
Now , doubleclick in the window where the “ Save As ” gives you the file name , which for now is a series of random numbers and letters .
This should highlight the entire file name .
You will know this when all the letters and numbers are highlighted in blue .
Rename the file you are saving “ whatever_you_want_to_call_it.gpgkey ” I highly recommend keeping the “ .gpgkey ” at the end of the file name .
Then click Save .
Now , hold the control button on your keyboard , and click here .
This should give you a drop - down menu like this :
Select “ Download linked file ” and this file will appear on your desktop :
Go to the GPG Key Manager and click the “ Import ” button .
Pilot the window to your Desktop
and select the public key ( my public key ) that you just downloaded .
Click “ Open . ”
Once the key is imported you will see this message :
and after you click “ ok ” you will see my public key in your keychains .
Now , go back to Safari , or whatever web browser you use , and go to the Sente site for GPGMail .
Scroll down to the “ Download ” button .
This will take you to a list of links .
Choose the binary that matches the operating system you are using .
You will get the warning message “ GPGMail - 10.x.dmg contains an application . ”
Click “ Continue . ”
Once the file downloads , a window should automatically open .
This window contains an installer script called “ Install GPGMail . ”
Close Mail if you have n’t already , then doubleclick the script .
You will get a very brief note of explanation of what you are about to do .
Click “ Run . ”
Once the script has finished running , you will receive a message that it ran successfully , and you should “ Launch Mail . ”
When you open click “ New ” you will notice new features have been added to the composition window .
You have the ability to sign and encrypt emails now .
Signing the email tells the recipient , if he or she has your public key , that you did indeed enter your password and send this email .
This protects you from being impersonated by someone else using your email account .
You can also encrypt the message to a recipient .
Dropping down the “ Encrypted ” menu , you will see the name and email of every person whose public key you have imported .
If this is the first time you have done this , there should just be mine there .
Once you have selected my name in the “ Encrypted ” list , you can type a message and then hit “ Send . ”
You will then be asked to enter your passphrase to certify that YOU sent the email .
The encrypted message I receive ( and which anyone who intercepted would see , which is the whole point of this ) is a garbled mass of random numbers and letters .
When I click the “ Decrypt ” button in the upper right - hand corner of the window , I am queried for MY passphrase .
And then I see your signed message .
The only thing remaining for you to do is to send me an email with your public key attached .
Officials at Sunbelt Software , a Clearwater , Florida - based vendor of anti-spyware tools , say the company stumbled upon a massive ID theft ring that is using a well - known spyware program to break into and systematically steal confidential information from an unknown number of computers worldwide .
The operation was discovered last week during research Sunbelt was doing on a spyware program belonging to a particularly dangerous class of browser hijacking tools called CoolWebSearch ( CWS ) , according to Sunbelt 's president , Alex Eckelberry .
CWS programs are extremely hard to detect and remove , and are used to redirect users to Web sites that use spyware tools to collect a variety of information from infected computers .
Treasure Trove of Information
The CWS variant being researched by Sunbelt turned infected systems into spam zombies and uploaded a wide variety of personal information to a remote server apparently located in the U.S.
That server holds a " treasure trove of information " for ID thieves , Eckelberry says .
Sunbelt 's research showed that the information being uploaded to the remote server included chat sessions , user names , passwords and bank information , he says .
The bank information included details on one company bank account with more than $ 350,000 in deposits and another belonging to a small California company with over $ 11,000 in readily accessible cash , he says .
Many of the records being uploaded also contained EBay account information , he says .
Among the highly personal bits of information Sunbelt was able to retrieve from the server were one family 's vacation plans , instructions to a limo driver to pick up passengers from an airport , and details about one computer user with a penchant for pedophilia .
Sunbelt officials did not say how they accessed the material .
But the existence of a large file that the company said it retrieved from the remote server was confirmed by Computerworld .
Sunbelt says the file contained user names , addresses , account information , phone numbers , chat session logs , monthly car payment information , and salary data .
" It 's one of the most egregious things we have ever seen , " says Eckelberry .
" We know this kind of data is out there , but this is the first time we actually have the data that the criminals are using . "
Information gathered from infected computers is uploaded to the remote server and stored in highly organized files that appear to be accessed by multiple ID thieves , Eckelberry says .
The files grow to anywhere from 10 MB to 20 MB in size before they are refreshed with new information , he says .
Under Investigation
The FBI has been contacted and is working on the case , Eckelberry says .
In addition , Sunbelt has contacted some of the individuals and banks whose data has been logged to warn them of the compromise .
The domain of the remote server appears to have been registered in China , although the server itself is located in the U.S. , Eckelberry says .
" We are working to get that server taken down . "
He declines to offer more details .
A spokesperson for the FBI could not be reached for comment .
Sunbelt 's discovery brings home the seriousness and scope of the growing ID theft problem , says Pete Lindstrom , an analyst at Spire Security in Malvern , Pennsylvania .
" I think this stuff is much more significant than the notification of [ compromises ] by credit card companies , " Lindstrom says .
That 's because the credit card industry as a whole has better controls in place to detect and prevent abuses resulting from such compromises than individuals , he says .
" This stuff hits home because it 's personal .
It 's like taking something out of your home , " Lindstrom says .
" Each and every one of these accounts can be compromised , and it hurts someone . "

What makes a bug a " design bug " ?
Coding bugs arise strictly from error in the sequencing of computer commands .
Design bugs are born either before coding begins or are former coding errors that became design bugs by either being ignored over time or being carefully documented in the manual .
Once a coding bug has been acknowledged or purposefully ignored , it becomes part of the official design .
Design bugs tend to work through users , by tempting , cajoling , or forcing them to perform an action that results in damage .
A prejudice within the engineering community holds users to be rather pathetic and deserving of punishment if they err , an opinion that , sadly , most users share .
Because both engineers and users are quick to place blame on the user 's head , instead of the d'ohltish design , correction of design bugs typically takes a back seat to coding bugs of equal or lesser seriousness .
To make it on this list , a bug must be a design error , not a coding slip , must have either persisted more than five years or persisted more than one year and also be potentially catastrophic , causing the user to lose significant time , data , or worse .
November 4 , 2004 : Air Force pilot , Maj. Roberto Balzano , his F - 16 jet fighter lined up on the training school below , squeezed the trigger , strafing the facility with 27 rounds of 20 mm ammunition , sending 8 of the deadly 2 - inch slugs crashing through the roof to wreak havoc within .
Another terrorist training camp wiped from the face of the earth ?
Not exactly .
The target he struck was the Little Egg Harbor Township Intermediate School in New Jersey .
Ooops !
The only reason no one was killed was that the pilot 's night time training mission took place while the kids were home , tucked into bed .
What went wrong Maj .
Balzano not only believed his weapons were aimed at a target several miles away on the Air Force practice range , he had no intentions of firing his weapons .
Both the hardware and software design of the weapons system contributed to the error .
The process under which they were designed likely led to it .
The F - 16 has two major weapons systems , a rocket - bearing " targeting pod " and a gun .
The targeting pod can be rotated independently of the aircraft to lock onto a distant target .
The gun , however , is always fixed directly forward .
There 's value in having the gun aim straight toward the target .
When attempting to take out another aircraft during a dogfight , the pilot is busy enough aiming the plane toward the enemy without having to independently aim the gun .
Likewise , the rockets , used for targets many miles distant , should not require the aircraft to be aimed toward them to achieve a kill .
Even with these fundamental differences , both systems are manipulated with the same controls , with a mode switch to select which weapons system is in use .
Both weapons are fired by pressing a common trigger .
The trigger is a time - honored firing mechanism .
However , they 've fancied this one up : Pressing the trigger all the way down fires the weapon , but pressing the trigger half - way down will paint the pod 's target with a laser , offering the pilot target - orientation information .
Those of you who have tried to lock auto - focus on your camera by pressing the shutter half - way down know how well this works : half the time , you end up with an unwanted picture .
With the F - 16 , some of the time you end up with a shot - up school .
The Fourth Time 's a Charm This was the fourth such incident for the year 2004 .
( The other three , thankfully , also resulted in no death or injury . )
The solution arrived at after the first three ?
Pilots were to be told before every training flight , " do n't do that ! "
Specifically .
pilots were instructed never to press the trigger to do laser - orientation when the weapons control system was in gun-mode , even though it was evident that insufficient feedback existed to let the pilot know the system was in gun-mode .
In Maj .
Balzano's case , the pilot 's mind was in " rocket " mode , with his attention locked on the range target at which he had aimed his rotatable pod .
Because his weapons system , unbeknownst to him , was in gun mode , however , the accidental firing did not sent a rocket to where the pilot was aiming , but a string of heavy projectiles to where the aircraft and , hence , gun were at that moment pointing .
That turned out to be the Little Egg Harbor Township Intermediate School .
The Air Force , based on their having told the pilots each and every day , " do n't do that , " leaped at the opportunity to blame the fourth incident on pilot error .
However , the Accident Investigations Board did acknowledge that the Air Force really ought to fix the plane as " poorly - designed controls " contributed to the incident .
What we can learn from this
The problems with this interface are two : Identical controls used for asymmetrical weapons systems , with insufficient mode feedback .
A trigger dependent on a subtle difference in pressure to effect two radically different results .
The nature of these problems leads me to suspect two errors in process : Insufficient usability testing during development .
These are not subtle problems and should have been flagged .
Insufficient attention to personas and scenarios during task analysis , even before design began .
During combat , the mode problem could pose a problem shooting a rocket to the side when intending to fire on an aircraft toward the front would be problematic .
However , the trigger problem would probably be of little consequence .
( So you hit them with a few extra bullets . )
If the designers concentrated on combat , the dual - detent trigger might have seemed like a good idea .
However , if they had considered a scenario of error conditions with an armed training aircraft under US East Coast conditions , where aircraft must stray out of the small ranges ' immediate vicinity , maybe they might have considered that accidentally firing on civilian targets was a ) a reasonable possibility and b ) a really bad idea .
So many serious design errors that seem to pop up out of nowhere after a product ships could have been stopped in their tracks even before design begins .
Do proper field studies and task analysis as the start and you just might avoid shooting up either your local school or your company 's bottom line .
Bug on list since : 1 Feb 2005
Bug Name : Power failure crash Duration : >30 years Supplier : Desktop computer manufacturers Alias : " Oh , Sh - - ! " Product : Desktop computers worldwide Bug :
If the computer loses power for more than a few thousandths of a second , it throws everything away .
Class of error : " That 's the way Grandpa did it ... "
Principle : Protect the User 's Work Discussion : Somehow , the most destructive act a computer can carry out , other than destroying the contents of a hard disk , got " grandfathered in . "
Somehow it became OK for computers to just die if the power fails .
If cars modelled this behavior , you might drive your car from New York to Miami , run out of gas in Fort Lauderdale , 10 miles from your destination , and suddenly find yourself back in New York .
Immediate Fix : Web Developers Store ( encrypted ) information in cookies even before transfer to the server , so information is preserved from all but the most serious " melt - downs . "
Proposed Fix : Application Developers Convert your existing software and write new software to perform Continuous Save , so users cannot lose more than the last few characters typed or gestures entered .
Do not fail to provide sufficient Undo and Revert facilities enabling users to get back to where they were before they started doing the wrong thing .
For all the drawbacks of the crude system most applications have had until now , one advantage was that new drafts did not take the place of old until we said so .
Oh , and by the way , a dialog saying , " This action can not be undone .
OK Cancel , " is not a suitable substitute for a Revert facility for anything at any time .
Proposed Fix : OS 's Build support for Continuous Save and Revert into the toolbox .
Proposed Fix : Computer Hardware
Add electrolytic capacitors or high - current , low - capacity batteries to systems with volatile memory , with perhaps 15 to 30 seconds worth of power .
Have the OS initiate hibernation after around 2 seconds of power failure .
Thus the system will continue working during momentary glitches and will save your work and shut down during extended outages , offering the same protection now available to portable users .

Bug Name : The Macintosh Dock Duration : Four and counting Supplier : Apple Computer , Inc. Alias : " The Cool Demo " Product : Mac OS X Bug :
There are actually nine separate and distinct design bugs in the Dock , probably a record for a single object .
You can read about them all in my Article , " The Top 9 Reasons the Dock Still Sucks . "
Class of error : Confusing a demo with a product Principle : Demos and products are two separate entities .
The Demo's purpose in life is to help sell the product .
The product 's purpose is to serve the user .
Proposed Fix : Leave the Dock just as is .
It looks great on stage during presentations ; it looks great in the store .
However , allow the user a graceful way to turn it off once its shortcomings become apparent , substituting instead less flashy looking tools with real power behind them .
Discussion :
It 's not that the Dock sucks so much as a productivity tool as it is that Apple threw away so many more powerful , useful objects in its favor .
These , in an updated , extended form , should be returned .
For an article on how Mac users can " repair " these design flaws by themselves , using third party shareware , see my " Make your Mac a Monster Machine . "

Bug Name : Mysteriously dimmed menu items Duration : 25 years Nickname : " Dimmed & Dimmer " or " Gray Doubt " [ try saying it out loud ]
Supplier : Apple , Microsoft , Sun , Linux , et. al. Favorite Saying : " Ha , ha ! " [ in the manner of Nelson on the Simpsons ]
Product : All GUIs Bug : Designers offer no way for users to discover why a given menu or option has been dimmed ( grayed out ) , nor how to turn it back on .
Class of error : Users are teased with options that they cannot access without guessing what was in the designer 's mind Principle : Interfaces should be fully explorable .
Users should never have to guess at what unusual confluence of factors will enable them to take advantage of a given capability of a website , application , or system .
Proposed Fix :
Make grayed - out objects clickable , revealing what has caused the object to be dimmed and what the user can do about it .
Discussion :
This design bug has hung around since the work at Xerox PARC that laid the foundation for the Mac and the machines that followed .
In the earliest days , systems did very little , offering , therefore , few options .
It did not take users long to understand that the reason Print was dimmed was because there was no document open to print .
Then things got complicated .
Today , it can take users upwards of an hour to even a few days to figure out why an option is dimmed , often involving calls to the vendor .
Too often , the vendor does n't know either .
This bug has been ignored for too long and it has reached a critical point .
Too often , an item on the File menu , for example , is dimmed because of some interaction on the fourth menu over , one that has no apparent logical connection with the File menu or item being dimmed , at least not in the user 's world .
The software " knows " why it has dimmed the item .
Some decision or decisions led to the flag being set .
At the same time as the flag is set , the reason why should be made available .
If the user clicks on a grayed - out option , the reason or reasons should be made known .
And none of those , " Gosh , Oh , Gee , it could be any one of these 14 reasons or maybe something else " messages .
The message needs to be intelligent , responsive , and accurate .
This one is important .
This one needs to be done right .
Reader Ben Roubique has sent me documentation of Powerworld Simulator developed by Powerworld Corp .
It allows people to click on grayed out items and gives them lucid , targetted information on why a given field in their matrix is gray .
Only 1 million developers to go ...

Bug Name : Dumb sorts Duration : >30 years Supplier : Almost everyone Alias : " Really , Really Dumb Sort " Product : Almost everything Bug : 15 Dec 2008 sorts as being before 2 Jan 1900 Class of error : The Model T worked ; why change it ?
Principle :
It is as important to continuously improve the old as it is to create the new .
Principle : Sort based on human custom and usage , not the internal math of computer character storage Effect : People have been forced to learn bizarre and unusual ways of naming objects to force them to appear in the correct order .
Such tricks as adding leading zeros and reversing the order of dates have become pandemic .
Proposed Fix : Add intelligent Alpha-numeric sorts to lists throughout the world of computing .
Such sorts should be able to handle the proper sorting of expected numbers for the particular application .
Quite often this just means that A2 should come before A10 .
Sometimes it means doing more , such as properly parsing and sorting dates , times , and other special formats .
Add language - specific exceptions , such as ignoring " The " and " A " or " An " when alphabetizing English .
But wait !
No one would go that far , would they ?
Yes .
iTunes does this one already .
The payoff ?
The clean , forgiving iTunes interface has helped sell millions of iPods and song downloads measured in the hundreds of millions .
( Just do n't try to save any Les Paul songs , however , and expect to see them again .
iTunes , unlike you , did not sleep through French class and will , as reader Devin Chalmers points out , read " Les " to be French for " the . "
You will find Messieur Paul under " Paul , Les " ) Both Windows and Mac OSX have recently joined in , doing simple alphanumeric sorting .
They still will list a file called , " February 3 , 2004 " before a file called , " January 1 , 1901 , " but it 's a start .
( Some more complicated sorts will require the user to specify formats , such as US dating , European dating .
So be it .
Systems should be making such preferences available to visiting websites , anyway . )

Bug Name : URL naming bug Duration : >10 years Supplier : Browser Builders Alias : % 20 Off Bug Product : All Existing Browsers Bug : Many browsers disallow entry of spaces & other normal human - language characters into web addresses .
The rest do inappropriate things with them .
Class of error : Keep it ( too ) simple Principle : Support people 's ability to communicate in the manner to which they are accustom .
Discussion : Companies advertising in traditional media want to point people to their websites .
They need potential visitors to be able to remember their web addresses long enough to get to their computers .
That starts with people being able to read the addresses in the first place .
Scrunched - together web addresses are difficult for humans to both parse and remember .
History :
For the last millennium or so , speakers of European languages have consistently separated written words with spaces .
That changed around 30 years ago whenaspacebecameavaluableobjectnottobewasted .
Used to the existing system , later programmers feared that if they allowed users to include spaces in file names , etc. , that users might sometimes enter double spaces instead of single spaces , thereby creating different filenames from what they intended .
Because spaces are invisible , users might then may have difficulty figuring out what is wrong .
The easy solution ?
Keep forbidding spaces .
It turns out users do n't have those problems .
The Apple II introduced spaces in filenames almost 30 years ago , and no one has suffered any reported problems since .
Today , that byte storing a space costs less than 1 trillionth that it used to .
There is no longer any valid excuse for forcingPeopleToTypeLikeThisorworsetotypelikethis .
None . Nada . Kein .
Nikakoi .
Reader Zav suggests that we go beyond spaces , to allow such radical inclusions as ( gulp ! ) apostrophes , so we can visit Macy's on the web , in the same way we can in real life .
Proposed Fixes : Note : these proposed fixes are for URLs only .
Do n't bother writing me to tell me that they would n't work for , for example , lists of documents .
We know that .
Proposal 1 , from Tog : Allow advertisers to advertise and users to enter as many spaces and other normal characters in a web address as they want , then remove them all internally before matching .
At the same time , allow websites to store filenames with spaces and other normal characters , but , as was done with the user 's entry , remove them before matching the user 's request against them .
By removing all these characters just before testing , a proper match will always be assured , but the URL itself , as presented at the top of the window , will be easy for the user to read and will be the same as the URL advertised .
This scheme is analogous with how modern systems handle case , allowing both supplier and user the freedom to use whatever case they want by converting everything to lower case immediately before matching .
( Tog ) Proposal 2 , from Charles L Flatt : From a user - experience point of view , what I 'd really like is this : Company registers an IP address ( no URLs anymore ) Company registers up to ﬁve friendly names to associate with that IP .
These friendly names could be the same as those selected by other companies .
For instance , Software Meadows might be registered for an Ohio company and a Dublin company , each to a different web site .
A new service , possibly an addition to DNS , queries this database and returns the possible choices to the requester .
From the user 's point of view , she types in " Software Meadows " .
A select list appears saying " Software Meadows - Consulting - Ohio "
" Software Meadows - Retail Sales - Dublin "
She then choose the desired site .
In effect , I get this with Google today .
Registering the info would reduce the hits .
In fact , this is what directory services should provide , so the technology probably already exists .
[ This proposal would need special rules to keep me from opening a closet - sized book store in Podunk also named " amazon , " but the approach has great merittog ]
Proposal 3 : " Instant On , " from Mark Whybird : Processing of domain names already takes place : www.asktog.com, WWW .
ASKTOG.COM and www.AskTog.com all resolve to the same IP address already .
The extra line of code in the DNS software to make www .
Ask Tog.com and www .
Ask Tog '.com also resolve the same is so ridiculously easy that it could probably be done worldwide within a matter of weeks , at the outside .
The users would n't have to even update their browsers .

Bug Name : Let 's you save me some work Duration : > 12 years Supplier :
Too many people Alias : " Deal with it , users ! " Product : Many , many websites and a few apps Bug : Weird formats for standardized data Class of error : Pure laziness Principle :
It is your job as designer or programmer to reduce the work of the user , not make their life more difficult so you can save some work .
Discussion :
Ever come across credit - card input fields that forbid you to enter the number as found on the card ?
Ever been required to enter an American social security number without its hyphens ?
You 've been bitten by the " Let 's you save me some work " bug .
As far back as the 1970s , we had no reason to forcing such unnatural input , even though we were working with computers tens of thousands of time slower .
Today , there is just no excuse .
If you see such an input , you know there is a lazy person standing lying down ? behind it .
The worst of it is that we have a mountain of scientific data proving that forcing people to enter and error - check unchunked information causes significant slow - downs and errors , yet these lazy people persist and , worse , their managers let them get away with it .
The result is lost productivity and , in the case of electronic commerce , massive lost sales .
Why do I say " massive ? "
Because , while users may slog through to the end to buy an item today , they are going to be repelled at the idea of doing it again .
Proposed Fix : Accept data in all known , unambiguous formats for the data type involved .
Do the work on the back end to convert it to the format required by the data model .
Addendum by Kevin Grant :
This one 's actually equally important when interfacing between applications .
Microsoft would say Windows crashed because the user was n't supposed to enter 10 characters when 9 were requested ; UNIX developers know the rule " be liberal in what data you accept , but strictly format any data you emit " ( because they use it to tie dozens of small programs together in scripts ) .
By looking at the philosophical differences of both worlds , it is n't hard to see in which world problems are likely to exist !

Bug : ecommerce hostility Reported by : Tog & many others Duration : Since there was Web Supplier : ecommerce websites Products affected : Browsers & Websites Bug : ecommerce sites are making it as difficult to buy products as humanly possible Class of error : catastrophic to the bottom line Principle : Both current and repeat sales are being lost because we harass customers by demanding information that either is known or should be known to our systems Proposed Fix : Develop a single , standard way for users to easily make purchases : Website stopgap : Make Autofill work on more than just one browser .
Website development toolmakers :
Offer standard order form stationery , then call up your competitors and tell them they can copy it for free .
You will all benefit .
Browser suppliers :
Fix your Autofill , so that it exactly conforms to IE , since that ’s the only browser most of these guys will test against .
W3C : Come up with safe , secure standards for checkout activity .
The standards should include standardized form blocks , such as Name , address , phone number , along with a standard Autofill specification that everyone will use .
ecommerce industry :
You 're the ones throwing away millions of sales with both hands .
Collectively develop a " two - click " order process or some other circumvention of Amazon 's patent ( it 's a trivial undertaking ) , so people can buy on line the same way they have " in real life " for the past few thousand years .
Patent it and licence it for free to browser makers / website toolmakers , as long as the rules are strictly followed .
Invite Amazon to join as long as they 'll donate One Click .
Website long - term :
Once the standards are in place , use them .
If you find yourself on a browser that just wo n’t conform , tell your user !
About the third time a site informs them they are spending an extra 10 minutes filling out an unnecessary form because their browser wo n’t conform to an international standard , they ’ll switch , particularly if you supply links to modern browsers .
Discussion : Ever since Amazon slipped its unfortunate “ one click ” patent by the patent office , the rest of the ecommerce industry seems to have become resigned to making their customers ’ lives a living hell .
The lack of a single , supported standard for check - out is costing the ecommerce community billions of dollars in lost sales .
You may be feeling pretty good , knowing your log files show that only around 25 % of your customers are bailing on your check - out pages .
Do n’t .
I spent 15 years in bricks - and - mortar retail , and the instances of customers bailing after the deal is made is vanishingly small ( except in the case of high - pressure sales , like automobiles , etc. ) .
Not only are you leaving a lot of money on the table today , but the customer you harass today is far less likely to return tomorrow .
Can you imagine how you would react if the bricks - and - mortar stores did to you what you do to your customers ?
You go into the supermarket .
Every item you 're interested in is inside a box .
You press the button on the front of the box .
It kicks off a 30 second time delay .
You open the box .
There 's a fuzzy picture of the item along with a note that says it 's out of stock .
Nonetheless , you finally fill your cart with items that are in stock and go to checkout .
You hand over your ATM card , and they hand you a long , three - page form to fill out , similar , yet different than the one you filled out in another four stores down the block earlier today .
The same one you filled out in this store last week , and the week before that , and the week before that .
Across the street is another supermarket that has all the food on display , instantly available , and will take your ATM card with a smile , then seems to have the advanced technology known as a computer to gain all the information it needs about you without bothering you with a form .
Where would you be shopping tomorrow ?
You may think you 're still in good shape because all your competitors have websites that suck , too .
Guess again .
Your real competition is bricks - and - mortar stores .
The web bubble collapsed when Wall Street discovered that 's where everyone was going again .
Why ?
Because websites suck .
The web experience is a miserable experience , so bad that people will actually leave the comfort of their home and go through the miserable experience of fighting their way through traffic , crowds , and uniformed salespeople just to avoid having to deal with your site .
The abysmal state of ecommerce in particular and web checkout specifically has delayed the promise of the web for more than a decade .
Fix it !

Bug Name : " Smart " functions that are n't smart Observer : Tog & many others Duration : Since ~ 1986 Supplier : Many Alias : Dumb & dumber Product : any " smart " text processor routine Bug : " Smart " functions often make the wrong decisions Class of error : Incomplete design Principle :
The " smarter " you make an operation , the more responsibility you have to do it right .
Discussion :
You expect more from an executive secretary than you do from a clerk - typist .
Similarly , users expect more from a " smart " function than a simple one Case in point : drag and drop .
Originally , drag and drop was n't very smart .
It 's only rule was , " always drag the space after the word with it . "
This worked fine unless the word was at the end of a sentence , which resulted in the word 's leading space left behind , now separating the ( new ) last word in the sentence from the period .
Some cut and pastes still work like this , leading to , at best , frustration and , at worst , error , as people fail to notice the lingering space .
Even this cut and paste is not enough .
Smart cut and paste should also , for example , recognize that the two words or phrases separated by an " and , " " & , " " or , " vs. , " or some other fulcrum are being switched .
How ?
If a phrase before or after a conjunction is moved behind or in front of another word cluster , flip the second word cluster .
Then provide an easy undo if the user is intending more extensive editing .
Example sentence : " He wore a white tie and black shirt " Dragging " black shirt " to just before " white tie " should flip " white tie " to the other side of the " and . "
( A future version , with an actual functioning grammar checker could flip " black " and " white " if only " white " were dragged back to " black " 's position . )
The worst " feature " of today 's smart cut & paste is that computers keep " forgetting " how to do it .
In one text field they do it in a sophisticated manner , in a second , they do it in a clumsy manner , and in a third , they do n't do it at all .
Why ?
Because today smart cut and paste is left up to the application when it should be embedded in the system , either as an OEM tool or as a system - wide add - on .
Until that 's done , smart cut and paste will remain dumb .
Many other opportunities for smart abound :
How about the effort required when you add an opening phrase to an existing sentence ?
Example : " She will go to the store . "
You want to prefix it with , " When it stops raining , " but when you do , " She " does n't turn to " she . "
Even when you type in a lower case " s , " you are staring at " sShe , " and must forward - delete the old " S . "
Why is that ?
Finally , there are many functions we do n't even necessarily categorize as " smart " that are smart , or at least ought to be .
I 'm typing this discussion in Adobe GoLive , once the leading light of HTML editors , but slowly sinking in the sunset of mediocre add - ons .
One is their spell - checker .
It is dumb in one sense because it is not " live , " as spell - checkers are now expected to be .
Instead , it requires a special pass .
However , worse is that it , unfortunately , does n't know how to parse standard Englishor at least standard English punctuation .
An example is to be found in the previous sentence .
GoLive does n't know what a dash is , so it suggests I probably mean to say , " alongshore , " instead of " Englishor . "
( I guess it could be worse . )
GoLive also does n't know what a smart apostrophe is , so any possessive or contracted word that has been created anywhere but inside GoLive will be flagged as misspelled .
In my use , more than 95 % of the words it flags as misspelled are n't .
Now , that 's dumb , so dumb I often fail to do spell checking at all ( raising the wrath of my readers ) because the odds of my introducing an error by clicking the wrong button and flipping , e. g. , " Englishor " to be " alongside , " exceeds the chances of my finding and correcting a truly misspelled word .
Proposed Fix : Use your own software .
Observe experienced users doing the same .
Where can you either introduce , augment , or correct " smart " code so that it increases user - efficiency .

Bug Name : Focus - stealing Reported by : Andrewpants [ sic ] , Wally Hartshorn , and many others Duration : > 15 years User response : “ Hey , what just happened ? ” Bug :
Example A : You ’re typing a URL into your browser and the application that I clicked on 30 seconds ago finally starts up and interrupts your typing to launch itself .
Example B : You 're working on a multitasking system , typing away merrily in window A . Meanwhile , some background task decides it needs your attention , pops up a dialog , and moves the keyboard input focus from the window you were working on to its dialog box .
If you 're lucky , you 'll just momentarily type a few characters that are ignored .
If you 're unlucky , you 'll hit the space bar of the Enter key and select some default command , at which time the dialog box closes , leaving you to wonder what you just did .
Class of Error : Lack of “ awareness ” of the user ’s activity Principle :
The user is in charge Proposed Fix :
The OS needs to report whether the user is interacting with the computer , so that processes know whether it is appropriate to change focus .
Focus should never be changed when the user is actively typing .
Discussion by Andrewpants :
This happens under windows and under the various flavours of * nix that I use .
Damn it , the computer is meant to be a tool for me to use and my use ( typing stuff in ) should be given priority .
When the computer interrupts me to tell me something , it is acting ( in my opinion ) like a child demanding attention .
Some fixes for this are available , but it needs to be built into .
Discussion by Wally Hartshorn :
This has happened to me in several areas , including email notification dialogs .
My ( least ) favorite involves downloading a large file over a dialup connection using Internet Explorer .
The download might take 30 minutes , so I tend to work on other things while I wait .
When the download has completed , Windows pops up a dialog to show you that it is copying the downloaded file from some temporary area to the location where you wanted it .
( Why does n't it download the file there directly ? )
It helpfully has a Cancel button available ( because after waiting 30 minutes for the download , you might very well not want to wait the 10 seconds it would take to copy the file from one place to another ) .
Keyboard focus has been yanked from what I was doing to this dialog box , where anyone without very quick reflexes can accidentally hit the space bar and select Cancel .
How nice .
My memory might be incorrect , but I believe that the Commodore Amiga way back in 1985 prohibited any window from taking keyboard input focus away from the user .
Discussion by Tog : Focus - stealing was the biggest complaint among the letter - writers , with more than four times the number reporting any other bug .
This is at least partly a product of the natural selection for power - users brought about by the posting on Slash Dot .
It is worth heeding , however , as power users are both frequent users themselves and more likely to recognize irritants that even naïve users hate just as much , but can only verbalize as " something weird about this software . "
Beyond the examples given above , look for his bug also within browsers .
Try launching Google , then start typing a new URL into the browser ’s address box .
As soon as Google arrives , the focus will flip to Google , and the second half of your URL will appear in Google ’s input field .
( The bug is the browser ’s , not Google ’s .
I used Google merely as an example because it loads quickly . )
Check out your own software and ensure you are not likewise guilty .

Seven of the largest tunnels discovered under the U.S. - Mexico border in recent years have yet to be filled in , authorities said , raising concerns because smugglers have tried to reuse such passages before .
Among the unfilled tunnels , created to ferry people and drugs , is the longest one yet found -- extending nearly half a mile from San Diego to Tijuana .
Nearby , another sophisticated passageway once known as the Taj Mahal of tunnels has been sitting unfilled for 13 years , authorities say .
Though concrete plugs usually close off the tunnels where they cross under the border and at main entrance and exit points , the areas in between remain largely intact .
Filling the seven tunnels would cost about $ 2.7 million , according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials .
Accessing tunnels that run under private property is also a problem , as is a lack of coordination with Mexican authorities .
Mexican authorities have told their U.S. counterparts that they ’ve filled their end of the tunnels .
But U.S. officials express doubt , citing the high costs and examples of tunnels being compromised .
The Mexican attorney general ’s office , which handles organized crime , did not respond to numerous requests for interviews .

In recent years nearly 50 tunnels have been discovered running under the border from San Diego to Arizona .
Most are small , crudely constructed passages -- called gopher holes -- that are easily destroyed .
But filling the larger , more elaborate tunnels requires enormous amounts of material and expertise , especially because some were probably designed by mining engineers .
To prevent break - ins , authorities say they install motion sensors , which alert them to incursions .
But smugglers in some cases have been able to access existing tunnels by digging around the plugged entrance points , according to the U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , which heads the San Diego - based U.S. Border Tunnel Task Force .

In Nogales , Ariz. , traffickers have used one tunnel three times over a four - year span .
Tijuana smugglers were suspected of reusing a tunnel in 2004 , one year after its discovery inside a house in Mexico .
U.S. authorities have had to reinspect several other tunnels in response to suspicious activity or tips .
*
Unclear jurisdiction
Because of overlapping jurisdictions among federal border agencies , the responsibility for subterranean work was unclear for years .
The Border Patrol and the Drug Enforcement Administration each had some responsibility .
Advertisement
After the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2003 , the responsibility for filling tunnels was assigned to one agency : Customs and Border Protection .
Authorities cite this streamlining as progress .
But Customs and Border Protection has not filled any tunnels , and has capped only two since assuming control .
Michael Friel , an agency spokesman , said the agency is trying to find money in its budget to complete the work .
The 2007 budget for Customs and Border Protection is $ 7.8 billion .
Critics say the existence of so many unfilled tunnels poses a needless -- and inexcusable -- national security risk .
“ I was shocked to learn that these tunnels have n’t been filled in .
They should be , ” U.S. Sen .
Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) said in a statement .
“ The department should move , find money , and do it .
This is a huge department with a huge budget .
And if they do n’t have the money , they should tell us , and we will seek to get it in the emergency supplemental . ”

Among the unfilled passages :
* The so - called Grande Tunnel connecting warehouses in San Diego and Tijuana .
Nearly half a mile long , the tunnel was discovered in January 2006 and attracted global media attention as well as groups of local and national politicians , who were given tours of its cave - like depths .
The tunnel prompted Feinstein to propose legislation outlawing the construction of tunnels under the border .
* The 1,400 - foot tunnel called the “ Taj Mahal ” because of its lighting system and reinforced concrete walls .
The tunnel was discovered in 1993 .
Five years later , authorities suspected the passage had been reentered after 33 illegal immigrants were found covered in mud near the opening .
A metal lid over the tunnel opening had been cut .
Border Patrol agents say they never determined for sure if the passage was reused .
* Two long tunnels leading from Mexicali , Mexico , to a quiet residential area in Calexico , Calif .
One of them , discovered in 2005 , was equipped with a ventilation system , phone line and video surveillance equipment .

It is n’t cost alone that can keep tunnels unfilled .
Owners of private property also can slow the process .
In 2002 , after a tunnel was discovered running under part of his property in eastern San Diego County , David Field , a San Diego building inspector , feuded with the DEA over how to fill the quarter - mile - long passage .
The DEA wanted to use a concrete - soil mix .
Field , for environmental reasons , said he wanted the portion under his land filled only with dirt .
The tunnel featured a battery - operated cart on rails and was used to ferry what may have been tons of drugs over a 10 - year period , according to authorities .
In 2002 , the DEA sent Field a letter saying that drug traffickers would probably reuse the tunnel if it was n’t completely closed off and threatened to seize Field ’s property if the tunnel was compromised .
Field said the letter surprised him because he knew the agency had never filled the Taj Mahal tunnel found in 1993 .
“ I said that tunnel is still open ....
So how could this be a national emergency ? ”
Field said .

Authorities say they have had to check the tunnel twice to investigate tips that it had been reopened , but have found no evidence .
Smugglers can be determined about reclaiming their tunnels .
Take the case of the little light - blue house in Nogales .
The vacant building with barred windows is at 438 W. International St. , right across the street from the border , where a 20 - foot fence provides a formidable above - ground barrier .
Several years ago , smugglers , starting from a drainage canal in Mexico , dug under the border fence , under International Street , and under the yard , to a front room in the house .
Wooden slats and carpeting covered the opening , said Agent Mario Cano , a U.S. Border Patrol spokesman .
In December 2001 , U.S. authorities discovered the 85 - foot tunnel -- equipped with a rail and cart system -- and plugged it .
But the smugglers soon dug around the cap at the border and found their way back to the tunnel , Cano said .

Diggers used about 15 feet of that tunnel , then branched off and burrowed an additional 40 feet .
They surfaced near the house ’s driveway and covered the new opening with trash cans .
In March 2002 , that opening was discovered and sealed , Cano said .
Smugglers went to work again , this time using portions of the first and second tunnel before branching off to surface in another area of the yard , where they covered their latest opening with a tarp .
That branch and its opening were discovered in October 2005 .

Digging a new route

This month , authorities returned to the house again .
This time , two men were digging a new route , starting inside the home , Cano said .
They had progressed only 15 feet , Cano said , but may have intended to link up again with one of the existing tunnels under the property .
None of the passages have been filled , Cano said , although he believes portions may have collapsed because of heavy rains .
Even if the tunnels were filled , he said , the problem might not go away .
That ’s because smugglers have used the concrete fill to make support walls and ceilings for new tunnels , he said .
The filled - in passages also serve as markers , guiding crews to new areas where they want to go below ground .
The tunnel diggers ’ determination has bedeviled U.S. authorities , who have teamed with structural and civil engineers and geologists to devise the best ways to close tunnels .
They ’ve experimented with a type of concrete that will cave in if smugglers use it for support .

The cost to close the unfilled tunnels ranges from $ 200,000 to $ 700,000 .
But addressing the problem here solves only part of the problem because some tunnels extend hundreds of feet into Mexico , where U.S. authorities have no control .
Though Mexican authorities promise to fill tunnels , it ’s hard to know if they ’ve followed through , said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Frank Marwood , who heads the U.S. Tunnel Task Force .
Mexican authorities have occasionally permitted their U.S. counterparts to inspect tunnels for suspicious activity , including one time when a corpse was discovered on the Mexican side .
But it ’s not routine .

In 2004 , smugglers in Tijuana are believed to have reused a tunnel that Mexican authorities said they had filled .
The smugglers broke into a tunnel discovered a year earlier and formed a new tunnel heading toward a parking lot near the San Ysidro Port of Entry , U.S. authorities said .
The tunnel has since been filled in on the U.S. side , but the status of the Mexican side is unknown .
Corruption in Mexican border agencies complicates matters .
Last year , two Mexican customs officers were arrested on suspicion of being involved in the construction of a tunnel near the San Ysidro Port of Entry .
U.S. authorities also believe Mexico ca n’t afford to fill tunnels .
If so , the U.S. should provide assistance , some say .
“ It ’s a binational security breach , and I think the way to handle it is by a binational effort , ” Marwood said .

“ If they ’re not filled in , [ smugglers ] just branch out at one end or another . ”

41 year old ( and heavily pregnant ) Linda Evangelista is going to be on the cover of the August Vogue cover .
After over a year of featuring celebrities on the cover of American Vogue , Anna Wintour and co have brought back the Supermodel .
And Vogue are n’t the only ones harking back to the 90s when the “ model ” reigned supreme in the fashion world .
With Kate Moss appearing as the face of practically every high end designer campaign at the moment , and Naomi Campbell still the one to watch on the catwalk ( and in the newspaper reports ) , the Supermodels are back .
Throw in Christy Turlington for the Fall Versace campaign ( to be joined by Angela Lindvall , Carolyn Murphy , Daria Werbowy and Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) our magazines may not be graced by the young Hollywood crowd anymore .
Linda Evangelista is nearly seven months pregnant , and refreshingly , is not worried about her post - pregnancy figure .
“ I ’m not freaked out at all , I embrace it .
I believe I ’m doing everything to go through this as smoothly as possible .
I ’m either doing yoga or exercising every day . ”
There wo n’t be a “ comeback ” after the baby ’s birth , Evangelista says , because she does n’t plan on ever going away .
I wonder if Vogue paid the $ 10,000 dollars to lure Linda out of bed …
An air of mystery and fascination has surrounded Vincent Van Gogh ever since his death .
The artist ’s work has commanded astronomical sums at auction , and his mental state has been the subject of discussion and debate for over a hundred years .
Until today , the only photographs that existed of Van Gogh were from his teenage years .
But even these are the subject of debate — are they really of Vincent , or are they of another Van Gogh ?
A definitive answer remains elusive .
In Brussels around 1886 , photographer Victor Morin took a number of photographs of local clergymen .
Among these photos was a portrait of a man who bears an uncanny resemblance to the figure in many of Van Gogh ’s self - portraits , leading some to speculate that this photo might be of the artist himself .
Before this time of this photograph , Vincent ’s self portraits were obviously “ eyeballed ” ( to commandeer David Hockney ’s phrase ) and did not have a strong sense of realism .
However , subsequent self - portraits were as close to photo - realism as impressionist paintings could be .
Is it possible that Van Gogh used Morin ’s photograph as a guide to painting these new , realistic self - portraits ?
Some experts now believe that the artist may , in fact , have used the photo along with optical projection as a guide when creating these paintings .
This possibility is underscored by the fact that when the Morin photograph and some of Van Gogh ’s self portraits are overlaid , the close resemblance is hard to deny .
If this newly found photograph does indeed turn out to be of the adult Van Gogh , and if it could be proven that optical projection was used by this great impressionist , the implications could change art history .
***
Without the benefit of electricity and with only a simple piece of glass or a mirror , an artist could create a “ camera ” which would reflect the image he wanted to paint onto a canvas or a piece of paper .
This is the underlining principle in David Hockney ’s Secret Knowledge .
Although Van Gogh ’s self - portraits do not have the same photographic verisimilitude as some of the painting examples in Hockney ’s book and film , they do pose a similar question :
Why were some of Van Gogh ’s self - portraits and the portrait of his mother so much more detailed and “ real ” looking than his other portraits of the time ?
Because of the impressionistic nature of Van Gogh ’s paintings , we ca n’t take advantage of clues similar to those that Hockney found in some of the paintings of the old masters , such as out - of - focus objects in the paintings similar to those in photographs , or strong lighting features ( ‘ sun on the face ’ ) that would result from the use of a camera obscura — but the remarkable similarities in detail and composition between the paintings and the photos are strong evidence that Van Gogh ’s use of some sort of optical aids in these instances can not be easily ruled out .
We took a copy of the painting and overlaid the photograph of Van Gogh 's mother several times , each with increasing transparency .
The results were astonishing .
The face in the photo and in the painted image are exact matches .
Did Van
Gogh want such a perfect painting of his mother that he used optics as an aid in tracing the photograph onto canvas ?
***
If Van Gogh used optics to trace his image from the photograph , how could he have done it ?
Techniques for optically transferring an image include using glass ( a primitive lens ) , a concave mirror ( another primitive lens ) , or a camera obscura or camera lucida .
Van Gogh could have used any of these to project his photo onto canvas for tracing .
Roger Vaughan , of The Camera Lucida Company in Great Britain , sent us a camera lucida to try some experiments for ourselves .
We took the camera lucida and used it to make the sketch below from the Van Gogh photograph .
Camera lucida tracing of the Van Gogh photograph laid over the Saint - Rémy self - portrait with 50 % opacity .
The tracing is directly taken from the photograph except that the right eye was adjusted so that it 's looking at the viewer as in Van Gogh 's many self - portraits .
Note that it would take great skill and talent to take a sketch like this and make a worthwhile painting from it .
We do not imply that Van Gogh cheated by using optics or that using optics in any way would diminish his accomplishments .
Projection of a source image is merely both a short cut and a way to help assure that everything is in perspective , thus creating a more life - like painting .
Using optics is similar to a carpenter using a nail gun rather than a hammer to drive nails — it does n’t make the carpenter ’s work inferior , but it allows it to be completed in less time .

For the last thirty - five years , Joseph Buberger ’s vocation has been the history of photography .
His studies include most of the 19th century and early 20th century photographic processes , starting with images done in 1839 .
Many of the images Buberger has discovered have been published and now belong to major institutions .
He has daguerreotypes in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Museum of fine art in Houston , and others .
Twenty years ago , Buberger became involved in identifying photographs of well - know people in history .
He came across a daguerreotype of Ulysses S. Grant , a younger , different looking Grant than the one we are familiar with from the fifty - dollar bill .
His job was to authenticate the photo .
Alan Phillips , a friend of Buberger , was one of the first people involved in creating a forensic overlay of the Grant photo , ( a time - consuming process before the advent of digital tools such as Photoshop ) .
Alan is now the correction - imaging manager at the Wadsworth Atheneum , the oldest public art museum in America .
When the Van Gogh photograph came into Buberger ’s hands , Philips was already doing the initial forensic work .
These results convinced Buberger that this indeed was a photograph of Vincent Van Gogh .
Subsequently , Buberger exhibited the Van Gogh photograph at the Seton Gallery University of New Haven in the Henry Lee Institute of Forensic Sciences .
Dr. Albert Harper , the Executive Director of the Henry Lee Institute of Forensic Sciences , is also an investigator specializing in forensic anthropology .
Dr. Harper sponsored the exhibition , as it is his belief that the photograph is indeed that of Vincent Van Gogh .
The Van Gogh photograph , 4 ½ x 6 ½ ” has been authenticated as being taken between the years of 1885 and 1890 based on the thickness of the cabinet card as well as the materials that were used from that period .
One of the first experiments was to take a self - portrait sketch of Van Gogh ( Paris , summer 1887 , lead pencil and India Ink on paper , 31.6 x 24.1 cm , Amsterdam ) and overlay the drawing with the photograph .
The two were a close match .
In a letter to Buberger from Van Gogh scholar Pascal Bonafoux , author of the quintessential tome Van Gogh : Self Portraits , Bonafoux writes , “ Your discovery is fantastic !!! …
Looking at this photograph , I have no doubt : this man is Vincent himself . ”
“ But , ” author of The Van Gogh Files , Ken Wilkie asks , “ how did this photograph end up in the archive of a French - Canadian photographer [ Victor Morin ] ? ”
Where did this photograph come from ?
An antique dealer in Massachusetts purchased an album of photographs by the late Morin .
These photographs consisted mainly of clergymen , and the album was taken apart and the photos sold separately .
While artist Tom Stanford was thumbing through the photos in the dealer ’s shop , he recognized the photo of Van Gogh immediately .
He purchased it for one dollar .
How did Quebec - based photographer Victor Morin shoot a photo of Vincent Van Gogh ?
And what was Van Gogh 's photo doing among photos of clergymen ?
These are two questions we will return to in part two of our article in the next issue of Seventh Hour Blues .

Fortune 500 companies claim to be “ entrepreneurial , ” as do charities and government agencies .
Members of many Washington think tanks dub themselves “ policy entrepreneurs . ”
Even children who mow lawns and run lemonade stands get the “ entrepreneur ” label .
But as the term has come into wide use , its meaning has gradually eroded , leaving open the question of who entrepreneurs really are and what distinguishes their ventures from conventional ones .
After all , a startup can look a lot like a regular old small business .
The recent 2006 Wharton Entrepreneurship Conference , organized by the school ’s Entrepreneurship Club , took on this issue , inviting a group of , well , entrepreneurs to discuss their backgrounds and business philosophies and offer advice to those interested in taking the plunge .
Raffi Amit , academic director of Wharton ’s Goergen Entrepreneurial Management Programs , set the tone for the discussion by noting that academic research has debunked much of the conventional wisdom about entrepreneurs .
“ There ’s a myth that entrepreneurs have special traits that distinguish them from other people , ” he said .
“ But research shows no unique characteristics .
There ’s a myth that entrepreneurs are risk takers .
But research has shown that they try to manage risk .
They outsource it where they can .
And there ’s a myth that entrepreneurs have some sort of secret method that they can apply to venture after venture .
But many second - time entrepreneurs fail . ”
What ’s left ?
The dozens of speakers and hundreds of attendees at the conference debated the issue as they tried to find an answer .
Their discussions resembled a concert by jazz great Duke Ellington ’s famous orchestra — improvisational and occasionally circuitous .
Ellington named one of his most famous compositions “ Money Jungle , ” an apt moniker , perhaps , for this year ’s conference and the complicated , often wild world occupied by entrepreneurs .
$ 25,000 Credit Card Debt
According to Sam Hamadeh , founder and chief executive of Vault.com , a New York publisher of job information , being an outsider increases the likelihood that someone will want to start his own venture .
“ The more you are part of the establishment , the more you are giving up to start a business , ” he said .
“ Minorities , immigrants , gays and lesbians are all more likely to start businesses than other people . ”
Hamadeh , for his part , sacrificed the securest of establishment jobs — an offer from a prestigious law firm — to start Vault .
Having just graduated from a dual - degree program at Wharton and the University of Pennsylvania Law School , he figured he had to plunge in then , or risk never making the effort .
“ When you graduate is as good a time as you ’ll see to start a business , ” he said .
“ The negative is you ’re broke .
But the positive is you ’re broke , so you ’ve got nothing to lose .
I talk with my friends in investment banking who claim they want to try something entrepreneurial , and it ’s always , ‘ Just one more bonus season … . ' ”
Hamadeh , a conference keynote speaker , also touched on a topic that would become a theme for the day :
The trials of working with venture capitalists .
“ There ’s too much emphasis today on venture capital as a funding source , ” he said .
“ Historically , most businesses are funded using friends and family , credit cards , Small Business Administration loans and second mortgages .
Very few companies are venture backed .
I started Vault with $ 25,000 in credit card debt . ”
Venture capital , he added , “ makes sense for very few companies .
When you ’re in something that requires a lot of money to start or where time - to - market is critical , then maybe it makes sense . ”
John Tedesco , president and CEO of Santa Monica , Calif . - based Guardian Mobile Monitoring Systems , agreed with Hamadeh ’s assessment that socially established , financially secure individuals tend to be the least willing to quit their jobs and start companies .
“ The more wealth and prestige you accumulate , the more risk averse you become , ” he argued .
That makes sense : Failure costs more if you have more to lose ; it ’s the difference between securing a loan with a $ 1 million house and a $ 100,000 condo .
Yet Tedesco also pointed out that people with money , credentials and connections are , in some ways , best situated to bounce back from business setbacks .
If their ventures fail , they can tap jobs that might not be open to others .
“ The traditional corporate job is like a train , ” he quipped .
“ There ’s always another one coming . ”
“ I Was Just Solving a Problem ”
Farhad Mohit ’s parents immigrated from Iran to the United States , where he grew up .
Yet he still retains some of the outsider point of view .
After graduating from the University of California at Los Angeles , he worked as a computer programmer at Andersen Consulting ( now Accenture ) .
“ I hated it , ” he recalled .
“ I hated the bureaucracy and the suits . ”
He applied to Wharton in the mid-1990s , mainly to escape .
“ I figured I would get an MBA and then maybe a PhD .
I thought I would be a perpetual student . ”
Once in school , he avoided the investment banking and consulting jobs that attracted many of his classmates .
He had done the corporate route and knew that , for him , it was a suffocating option .
“ Then I ran into the Internet and saw an opportunity .
Nobody knew what an Internet entrepreneur was supposed to look like and dress like , ” said Mohit , who has long hair and a full beard and jokes about owning exactly one suit , which he calls “ the fund - raiser ” since he only wears it when he meets with potential investors .
While in school , he and two Wharton friends organized Shopzilla , a website that helps consumers find bargains and also rates online retailers .
After graduation , one friend quit .
Mohit and his remaining partner moved the company to Los Angeles and , in 2005 , sold it to E.W. Scripps for $ 525 million .
“ I had no interest in shopping , ” Mohit said .
“ I was just solving a problem . ”
Offering up a bit of his personal philosophy , he added , “ Opportunities are all around you .
Luck is everywhere .
Just look around . ”
One shared quality among the entrepreneurs who came to the conference was their optimism .
For them , entrepreneurship does n’t require dreaming up an idea as obscure and knotty as Einstein ’s theory of relativity .
Rather , it entails snatching one of the many opportunities that , if you are paying attention , you will encounter through your job or through your experiences — and frustrations — as a consumer .
Rob Poor , founder and president of Cambridge , Mass . - based Adozu , a maker of wireless networking systems , put it this way : “ I ’ve come to view the world as a place of intellectual abundance . ”
He studied music at Oberlin College before becoming a computer programmer .
Then he worked under Apple founder Steve Jobs and film director George Lucas .
About a decade ago , he returned to school for a doctorate and wrote his dissertation on the ways in which a wide variety of independent electronic devices can beam data to each other .
That eventually led to his founding of Adozu .
Jeff Citron also sees a world full of business opportunities .
When he tries to decide which one to act on , he seeks out “ disruptive technologies ” — ones that fundamentally alter the ways of commerce in a sector of the economy .
His first efforts came in the securities industry , with Island ECN , an electronic trading network , and Datek Online , a web - based brokerage .
Now he ’s chief executive of Vonage , a New Jersey - based provider of Internet telephony .
Disruptive technologies , Citron said , enable startups to jump into large , lucrative markets where established leaders have become complacent .
“ When faced with a technological decision , these old guys do n’t know what to do .
Their response to new ideas is often to say , ‘ It wo n’t work . ' ”
Lazy orthodoxies can allow new entrants to thrive in niches that seem full of capable incumbents , as Dell did in personal computers and Southwest did in airlines .
Yet Citron also pointed out that aspiring entrepreneurs should n’t assume that a disruptive technology alone will propel a startup to profitability .
Execution and even luck matter , too .
“ Plenty of disruptive technologies never actually disrupt a market , ” he noted .
“ For a lot of different reasons , they never get adopted .
Look at the Betamax video format .
It should have won out , but VHS did a better job of getting to the market . ”
Betamax provided higher quality video reproduction , but Sony , its maker , initially limited the length of tapes to an hour , while VHS recordings ran as long as three hours .
Likewise , a low price alone wo n’t roil a market , although entrants often focus , to the exclusion of all else , on lowering prices , he said .
“ What disrupts is higher quality at a lower price . ”
Take web - enabled commerce .
People often rave about the savings created for consumers , which are huge , but just as important is increased convenience .
Online shoppers do n’t battle crowds at the mall during the holiday season , nor do they have to shop during conventional business hours .
The KISS Rule
According to both Poor and Citron , another pitfall for aspiring entrepreneurs is spending too much time thinking about all the gee - whiz features they might add to their products .
Instead , they should bang out prototypes and put them in consumers ’ hands as quickly as possible .
“ Remember the KISS rule : ‘ Keep It Simple , Stupid , ' ” Citron said .
“ Give your product to your mom .
Can she use it without any problems ?
Then you ’re ready to go . ”
Or as Poor put it : “ Fail early and learn . ”
Plus , once a company starts attracting customers , many of the other obstacles facing new ventures , like finding investors , will begin to work themselves out , both men said .
That was Punita Pandey ’s experience when she launched San Jose , Calif . - based netCustomer , which provides software support and services for large companies .
Initially , Pandey spent significant time pitching venture capitalists on her idea of outsourcing computer services to India — and getting nowhere .
“ I realized that what I should do was go out and look for customers , ” she said .
“ I had thought that I did n’t pitch well .
But once we had customers , we suddenly got the attention of VCs . ”
The role of venture capitalists sparked nearly as much talk at the conference as the challenges that entrepreneurs face .
Indeed , several panelists argued that venture capitalists are the main challenge for entrepreneurs .
“ Did anyone ever notice how rich VCs are ? ” quipped Lucinda Duncalfe Holt , chief executive of Commerce360 , a Plymouth Meeting , Pa. , online marketing firm .
“ That money comes at your expense if you ’re an entrepreneur . ”
The conferees ’ consensus : Venture capitalists are n’t the vultures that some entrepreneurs portray them as , but they ’re not entrepreneurs ’ friends , either , and they should n’t be the first place one turns for money .
The best ones bring valuable industry expertise and contacts , but all of them demand a lot in terms of equity and control in exchange for their money .
For that reason , Holt puts venture capital as number seven on her list of funding sources for new companies — and she has led three startups .
Before turning to venture capital , she will try to tap personal savings , debt , angel investments , government loans and grants and even financing from potential vendors and customers .
Mousimi Shaw , for her part , increased her student loans to help start Sikara & Co. , a jewelry maker .
More so than other types of investors , venture capitalists insist on telling you how to run your business , said Rodger Desai , chief executive of New York - based Rave Wireless .
Their recommendations can seem shortsighted , even wrongheaded .
“ A lot of VCs have never managed anyone or worked in an operating company .
So as a founder , you do have to fight for what you believe in .
You ’re the only one who really knows . ”
Plus , VCs are necessarily impatient .
They need to see a return on their investment — or at least salvage what money they can — within about five to seven years so they can give a return to their investors .
If a company has n’t been acquired or sold stock to the public by then , and most startups never do , then the VCs will push for a sale or merger .
These realities have prevented Thomas Knobel from looking outside for money for his startups .
He has opted to bootstrap them , including his current one , Carlsbad , Calif . - based Nobel Co. , a seller of prepaid international phone cards .
“ Not everybody can bootstrap their company , and getting money from the outside can be easier than working it internally , ” he said .
“ But it ’s also more expensive in the long run .
It ’s easy to give equity and very expensive to get it back , and equity is really the only thing you have in your business . ”
Iraq would overshadow Mr Blair 's record , said the report
Report analysis
The invasion and the post - war " debacle " have damaged the UK's global influence , said the Chatham House report .
Outgoing director Victor Bulmer - Thomas said Mr Blair 's successor would have to build better relations with Europe .
But Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett told the BBC the " whole thesis of this note is just plain wrong " .
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " Nobody said that Tony Blair has so much influence that single - handedly he can solve all the problems of the world . "
But , Mrs Beckett added : " The notion that we do not have any influence out there [ in the Middle East ] , or in the European Union , or in the United States is just not true . "
She said Mr Blair probably had some " regrets " about what had happened in Iraq but not the " toppling of Saddam Hussein " .
The Chatham House report found that , despite military , political and financial sacrifices by the UK , Mr Blair had been unable to influence the Bush administration in " any significant way " .
Blair has learned the hard way that loyalty in international politics counts for nothing
Professor Bulmer - Thomas
Rebalancing UK foreign policy
It said there was no evidence British pressure had led to Mr Bush accepting a two - state solution in the Middle East .
" Blair has learned the hard way that loyalty in international politics counts for nothing , " said Professor Bulmer - Thomas .
" And his successor will not make the same mistake of offering unconditional support for US initiatives in foreign policy at the expense of a more positive relationship with Europe . "
Rethink euro
The report , which assessed British foreign policy since 1997 , says Mr Blair 's successor would also have to rethink Britain 's role within the European Union and distance it from the US .
The new prime minister would have to look again at opposition to the euro and the Schengen agreement , which ends controls on international frontiers .
Professor Bulmer - Thomas said Mr Blair 's foreign policy during his first term , 1997 to 2001 , had been a " qualified success " .
The report said the next PM must rethink Britain 's European role
He demonstrated his European credentials , while also forging a close working relationship with then US president Bill Clinton .
And Libya 's decision to abandon its nuclear weapons programme , along with pushing climate change up the international agenda , counted among Mr Blair 's successes , the report added .
But Professor Bulmer - Thomas , who steps down as Chatham House director on New Year 's Eve , said : " Despite a number of successes , especially in his first term , Tony Blair 's time in office will be overshadowed by the disaster in Iraq . "
He said the UK's response to the recent Iraq Study Group findings should be to forge a common European response - or risk international isolation .
' Stand up '
In November , comments from a US official that Britain got nothing back from its relationship with the US and that President Bush often ignored Mr Blair were later disowned by the State Department .
HAVE YOUR SAY Of course Blair has influenced Bush

Visiting Iraq this week , Mr Blair reiterated his determination to stand " four square " behind the Iraqi government in its battle to defeat terrorists .
He told British troops : " If we do n't stand up and fight for the people of tolerance and moderation who want to live together , whatever their faith , then the people of hatred and sectarianism will triumph . "
Britain 's teenagers have a secret .
The money spent by media companies buying up well - known internet chatrooms such as Friends Reunited and MySpace has missed the target .
New figures show that the busiest community website is the unheralded Faceparty .
Teenagers are so obsessed with the site that last year it saw more traffic than Yahoo's email service , Tesco 's website and Amazon .
Only eBay , Google and Hotmail are viewed more often in Britain .
The site allows its 6 million members to send each other messages .
Members have their own mini-sites with pictures of themselves and details of their tastes .
They can browse other members ' sites and start conversations with thousands of people they have never met .
' I check my messages every single day , ' explained 16 - year - old James Hardman from Leeds .
' All my mates do it .
We want to find some nice lasses and just text and email each other .
We 're meeting a couple of them in the school holidays .'
James is one of the rare members brave enough to put his phone number on the site , but says he has only been bothered by ' weirdos ' once or twice .
He is more coy about the ' adult section ' of his site , where members can put up naked pictures of themselves and choose who gets to see them .
' My pictures are quite rude but I have n't let anyone see them yet .
I 'd be very careful about that .'
The popularity of the site has raised concerns : some parents are worried about inappropriate banter on the site , and the possibility that some ' young people ' are adults posing as teenagers .
Members are encouraged to sign up for special privileges : for £ 24.95 a year they are no longer restricted to sending five messages a day , and for an additional £ 38.95 over - 18s can buy the right to see the site 's adult content .
Rupert Murdoch spent £ 334 m to buy the similar site MySpace last year , but it seems new media cannot be controlled as easily as the traditional press .
' Cat ' , 19 , says : ' I definitely prefer Faceparty to MySpace .
MySpace is all corporate now . '
The technology magazine . net recently proclaimed Faceparty to be ' best community site ' .
Its editor , Lisa Jones , explains : ' It 's really grown under the radar .
Since Murdoch bought MySpace , everyone 's heard of it .
But Faceparty has got this underground appeal .'
Gemma , 17 , joined after a friend 's recommendation .
' I only checked it out because one of my friends made me and now I 'm hooked .
It 's the best way to kill time at college . '
The director of Faceparty , David Bamforth , says : ' The grown - ups know all about MySpace , but very little about us .
Their kids get home from school and spend hours on it .
We try really hard to keep out of the press . '
The site offers a rare glimpse behind the sullen exterior of Britain 's teenagers .
Laura , 16 , from Nottingham , is happy to share her philosophical thoughts : ' I live life 2 the full , REMEMBA U NEVER MISS A GD THING TILL IT LEAVES YAH . '
Members are also asked a series of questions .
Most struggle to name a favourite author , with pop stars scoring highly .
Laura 's effort is typical : ' Jordans Autobiography is wkd bt i dnt really read . '
Nick Barham , author of Disconnected : Why Our Kids Are Turning Their Back On Everything We Thought We Knew , says : ' Online communities are all about sociability .
It 's just a different kind of sociability .
You decide how the world will see you - your best - looking , or stupidest , photo .
Your favourite phrases , not your embarrassing silences . '

This is kinda fun .
In our last post , we saw software that was being sold without even modifying an HTML template .
Let ’s play with that some more .
Do an exact search for [ “ then delete this pink text ” ] .
You can find lots of software packages where no one has bothered to update a template :
Someone is spitting out all sorts of software .
Here ’s one to teach you how to blog and ping :
But my favorite has to be all those testimonials .
Are they real ?
Here ’s one with testimonials “ for example purposes only ” :
These testimonials are for “ example purposes only , ” but are they real ?
I have no idea .
But here ’s a web page where the same people wax enthusiastic about a different product :
Humph .
David Crow apparently thinks everything is a killer ap [ sic ] .
He probably looks at faucets and goes “ Amazing !
I turn this thing , and water flows out !
This is an absolute , killer ap ! ”
Weird , wild stuff .
Okay , now let ’s take a completely different example .
Here ’s one where the testimonial is left blank except for a default of “ Monterey , CA ” :
Now let ’s find that software package template on other sites .
Hey , there ’s a couple !
Testimonial # 1 :
And now here ’s testimonial # 2 :
Wow , what a coincidence that the empty template has a default of Monterey , CA , and both Ryan Smith and Ross Obrian also live in Monterey , CA !
Did Ryan really double his money in 48 hours , and just happen to live in Monterey ?
Maybe , but I ’m skeptical .
My point is that you should always use your critical thinking skills , whether you ’re evaluating an e-book , a magazine article , an informercial , or what some random person is saying in a blog post .
Librarians have been thinking about this stuff for a good long time ; here ’s a page with advice about evaluating web pages .

The Only Issue This Election Day
There is only one issue in this election that will matter five or ten years from now , and that 's the War on Terror .
And the success of the War on Terror now teeters on the fulcrum of this election .
If control of the House passes into Democratic hands , there are enough withdraw - on - a- timetable Democrats in positions of prominence that it will not only seem to be a victory for our enemies , it will be one .
Unfortunately , the opposite is not the case -- if the Republican Party remains in control of both houses of Congress there is no guarantee that the outcome of the present war will be favorable for us or anyone else .
But at least there will be a chance .
I say this as a Democrat , for whom the Republican domination of government threatens many values that I hold to be important to America 's role as a light among nations .
But there are no values that matter to me that will not be gravely endangered if we lose this war .
And since the Democratic Party seems hellbent on losing it -- and in the most damaging possible way -- I have no choice but to advocate that my party be kept from getting its hands on the reins of national power , until it proves itself once again to be capable of recognizing our core national interests instead of its own temporary partisan advantages .
To all intents and purposes , when the Democratic Party jettisoned Joseph Lieberman over the issue of his support of this war , they kicked me out as well .
The party of Harry Truman and Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- the party I joined back in the 1970s -- is dead .
Of suicide .
The " War on Terror "
I recently read an opinion piece in which the author ridiculed the very concept of a " war on terror , " saying that it makes as much sense as if , after Pearl Harbor , FDR had declared a " war on aviation . "
Without belaboring the obvious shortcomings of the analogy , I will agree with the central premise .
The name " war on terror " clearly conceals the fact that we are really at war with specific groups and specific nations ; we can no more make war on a methodology than we can make war on nitrogen .
However , there are several excellent reasons why " War on Terror " is the only possible name for this war .
1 . This is not a war that can be named for any particular nation or region .
To call it " The Iraq War " or the " Afghanistan War " would lead to the horrible mistake of thinking that victory would consist of toppling certain governments and then going home .
In fact , it is precisely the name " War in Iraq " that is leading to the deep misconceptions that drive the Democratic position on the war .
If this were in fact a war on Iraq , then in one sense we won precisely when President Bush declared victory right after we occupied Baghdad .
And in another sense , we might not see victory for another five years , or even a decade -- a decade in which Americans will be dying alongside Iraqis .
For a " War in Iraq " to linger this way is almost too painful to contemplate .
But we are not waging a " War in Iraq . "
We are waging a world war , in which the campaigns to topple the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan were brilliantly successful , and the current " lukewarm " war demands great patience and determination from the American people as we ready ourselves for the next phase .
2 . We cannot name this war for our actual enemies , either , because there is no way to name them accurately without including some form of the word " Islam " or " Muslim . "
It is our enemies who want to identify this as a war between Islam and the West .
If we allow this to happen , we run the risk of achieving the worst of all possible outcomes :
The unification of one or both of the great factions of worldwide Islam under a single banner .
President Bush and his administration have shown their grasp of our present danger by stoutly resisting all attempts to rename this war .
We call it a " War on Terror " because that allows us to cast it , not as a war against the Muslim people , with all their frustrations and hopes , but a war in which most Muslims are not our enemies at all .
That can be galling for many Americans .
When , after the fall of the towers on 9/11 , Palestinians and others poured into the streets , rejoicing , it was tempting to say , A plague on all of them !
But it is precisely those people -- the common people of the Muslim world , most of whom hate us ( or claim to hate us , when asked by pollsters in police states ) -- whom we must treat as if they were not our enemies .
They are the ones we must win over for us to have any hope of victory without a bloodbath poured out on most of the nations of the world .
Nation Building
Another charge against the Bush administration 's conduct of the war is that they are engaged in the hopeless task of " nation - building . "
And this is true -- except for the word " hopeless . "
But what is the alternative ?
I 've heard several , each more disastrous and impossible and even shameful than the one before .
In the New Testament , Jesus once used the analogy of a person who was possessed by a devil .
When you cast out the devil , do n't you leave an empty house , swept clean , to which seven devils will now come to live , making things worse than ever ?
No matter which miserable dictatorship we moved against after the Taliban -- and we had no choice but to keep moving on if we were to eradicate the grave danger we faced ( and face ) -- we would have faced the same problem in Syria or Iraq or Sudan that we had in Afghanistan :
We had to establish order in a nation that had never actually become a nation .
The boundaries on the ground in the Middle East were not formed in the traditional way -- by compromise or war .
Instead , European powers drew lines that pleased their fancy .
The lines did not create the hatreds that plague the region , but they guaranteed that traditional enemies would have to face each other within these boundaries .
It is in part because of the resulting chaos and oppression that groups like the Taliban and Al - Qaeda and the Shiite fundamentalists of Iran have been given an opportunity to offer the solution of returning to the core values of Islam -- as defined , of course , to their private advantage .
If we topple one government and then walk away , the result in any Middle Eastern nation would be civil war , and the probable winner would be the well - funded international terrorist groups that do not shrink from wholesale murder in pursuing their cause .
Just as Kerensky 's attempt at a liberal government in revolutionary Russia was almost instantly snuffed out by Lenin 's Bolshevik thugs in 1917 , so also would any attempt at unified democratic government in Iraq , Iran , Syria , or Afghanistan be quickly converted into Islamo - fascism of one stripe or another .
And if that happened , Islamicist puritanism would be seen in every nation as the " wave of the future . "
Just as , when Nazi Germany was in the ascendant , the nations of southeastern Europe quickly made their accommodation with Hitler , since the alternative was to be swept away like Poland , France , or Yugoslavia , so also would nominally democratic nations adopt the trappings of Islamicism -- if they were n't already toppled by puritan revolutions from within .
Democracy -- the Other Hope
Wherever Islamicism has been tried , the result has been identical to Communism 's miserable track record .
The people are oppressed ; the worst sort of vigilantes and thugs terrorize the population ; the new power elite , regardless of their supposed piety and dedication to a holy cause , is quickly corrupted and comes to love the wealth and privileges of power .
When there is no hope of deliverance , the people have no choice but to bow under the tyrant 's lash , pretending to be true believers while yearning for relief .
In Russia it came ... after more than seventy years .
China and Cuba are still waiting -- but then , they started later .
So it would be in the Muslim world -- if Islamicism were ever able to come to seem inevitable and irresistible .
You know : If America withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan and exposed everyone who had cooperated with us to reprisals .
As happened in South Vietnam .
The negotiated peace was more or less holding after American withdrawal .
But then a Democratic Congress refused to authorize any further support for the South Vietnamese government .
No more armaments .
No more budget .
In other words , we forcibly disarmed our allies , while their enemies continued to be supplied by the great Communist powers .
The message was clear :
Those who rely on America are fools .
We did n't even have the decency to arrange for the evacuation of the people who had trusted us and risked the most in supporting what they thought was our mutual cause .
We did it again , this time in the Muslim world , in 1991 , when Bush Senior encouraged a revolt against Saddam .
He meant for the senior military officers to get rid of him in a coup ; instead , the common people in the Shiite south rose up against Saddam .
Bush Senior did nothing as Saddam moved in and slaughtered them .
The tragedy is that all it would have taken is a show of force on our part in support of the rebels , and Saddam 's officers would have toppled him .
Only when it became clear that we would do nothing did it become impossible for any high - ranking officials to take action .
For the price of the relatively easy military action that would have made Saddam turn his troops around and leave the Shiite south , we could have gotten rid of him then -- and had grateful friends , perhaps , in the Shiite south .
That is part of our track record :
Two times we persuaded people to commit themselves to action against oppressive enemies , only to abandon them .
Do you think that would - be rebels in Iran and Syria and North Korea do n't remember those lessons ?
Fortunately , there are other lessons as well : West Germany and Japan , Taiwan and South Korea , where liberated nations were protected .
In the first two , we took on the task of nation building and transformed both political cultures into democracies .
In the latter two , we tolerated strongman dictatorships for many years , but eventually we made it clear that it was time for democracy , and under our protective umbrella , the governments were transformed and oppression ended .
So ... which America is operating now in the Muslim world ?
In Iraq and Afghanistan -- but especially Iraq -- President Bush is behaving according to America 's best and most honorable tradition .
We did not come to destroy , we came to liberate and rescue , he says -- by word and deed .
We bring freedom and opportunity .
Our money will help rebuild your devastated ( or never built - up ) economies ; our expertise will help train your most talented people to be ready for prosperity and self - government ; and our military will keep enemies from overwhelming you as you reinvent yourselves .
Instead of leaving an empty house , swept clean but unprotected , waiting for the devils of Islamic puritanism to come take over , President Bush has sworn that America will bring democracy , and that American soldiers will do their best to protect the decent , ordinary people until they are able to protect themselves .
The Competing Stories
Here 's the story the Islamic puritans are telling : The West is full of terrible evils -- atheism , sexual filth of all kinds -- in defiance of God 's will .
So seductive are the wiles of Shaitan that many Muslims aspire to dress , act , and live like westerners .
Only by turning to full enforcement of ancient Muslim law can Islam purify itself and resist the blandishments of the west .
It 's evil on one side , God on the other .
If all we had to answer them was Hollywood movies , politically correct anti-religious dogmas , and the other trappings of a West that is almost as decadent as the Islamicists claim , then we would only prove their point .
Instead , President Bush has offered something quite different .
We do n't want to turn you into mini-Americas , he says .
We offer you , instead , democracy , in which you can choose for yourselves what parts of western culture to adopt .
You will govern yourselves .
It is n't a choice between wickedness and righteousness , it 's a choice between freedom and oppression .
In other words , through nation - building , through the promise of democracy , Bush has created a rallying point with far stronger resonance than anything the Islamic puritans have to offer .
What is their program , after all ?
We 'll take your sons and get them to blow themselves up in order to murder westerners !
Forget the rhetoric -- Muslim parents are human beings , and there is nothing more devastating than to lose a child .
The only consolation is when it seems to be in a noble cause .
But because of President Bush 's promise of democracy , the Muslim puritan cause does not seem noble to more and more Muslims .
Even if they live in countries ( or neighborhoods ) where they dare not speak up -- yet -- they do not want any of their children to die just so that the rest of them can live and suffer in slavery to a privileged , selfish class of elitist tyrants .
President Bush 's story offers the common people hope of living decent lives and seeing their children live to adulthood , to grow old surrounded by grandchildren .
The Al - Qaeda , Ayatollah story promises them dead children and the lash .
There are , of course , fanatics who will embrace Islamic terrorism because they choose to blind themselves to the truth and embrace the noble - seeming lies of the tyrants .
Al - Qaeda does not lack for recruits .
But it also does not lack for people who fear and hate them .
There are few pro-Al - Qaeda demonstrations on the Arab street .
The people remember the images of liberated Iraqis tearing down the images of Saddam .
And they know -- because they have relatives and friends , they hear from merchants and travelers -- that in most of Iraq , there is freedom and prosperity like never before .
They 're getting the story , at the level of gossip and personal anecdote , that the anti-American media -- you know , Al - Jazirah and the New York Times -- never report :
The Americans really mean to give the Iraqis self - government .
You hear about the power outages in Iraq and it 's always somehow Bush 's fault .
What nobody points out is that these outages come in places where Saddam barely offered electricity at all .
The reason the new power systems can't cope is because the newly prosperous Iraqi people are buying -- and plugging in -- vast quantities of electrical appliances they could never afford to buy before !
When a town that used to have two dozen refrigerators and washing machines now has two thousand of each , the old power supply is never going to do the job .
" Americans Wo n't Stay "
How do the Islamicist tyrants answer the obvious success and growing appeal of Bush 's democracy program ?
They kill people , of course .
But they also tell the story , over and over : " America will never stick it out .
We 'll keep killing Americans till they give up and go away , and then you will answer to us ! "
Until they believe that the Islamofascists are never coming into power , many people will remain afraid to commit themselves to democracy .
Under those circumstances , the remarkable thing is how courageously the Shiites of the south have embraced democracy , and how many of them are beginning to trust that we mean what we say .
But against Bush 's promises and the actions of our brave and decent soldiers , the tyrants can set the behavior of Bush 's political opponents , who are doing their best to promote the propaganda of the tyrants .
Every Congressman who says " We must set a timetable for departure " is providing ammunition to the tyrants in their campaign of terror .
Because even more than they fear terrorist bombs , the pro-democracy forces within Iraq and Afghanistan fear American withdrawal .
Every speech threatening withdrawal is a bomb going off in Baghdad , killing , not people , but the will to resist the tyrants .
Bin Laden predicted it .
The Democratic Party in America is following his script exactly .
Can We Win ?
That is certainly not what most who call for withdrawal intend .
They see Americans dying and they have no hope of victory .
The Iraq War ( as they call it ) is costing lives and shows no sign of ending .
Meanwhile , Iran is getting nuclear weapons , North Korea already has them , Syria and Iran are sponsoring continuing and escalating attacks on Israel -- how can we possibly " win " a war that threatens constantly to widen ?
Let 's cut our losses , retire to our shores , and ...
And will you please stop and think for a moment ?
There is no withdrawal to our shores .
American prosperity requires free trade throughout most of the world .
Free trade has depended for decades on American might .
If we withdraw now , we announce to the world that if you just kill enough Americans , the big boys will go home and let you do whatever you want .
Every American in the world then becomes a target .
And , because we have announced that we will do nothing to protect them , we will soon be trading only with nations that have enough strength to protect their own shores and borders .
Only ... what nations are those ?
Not Taiwan .
If they saw us abandon Iraq , what conclusion could they reach except this one :
They 'd better accommodate with China now , when they can still get decent terms , than wait for America to walk away from them the way we walked away from Vietnam and Iraq .
We cannot win by going home .
In a short time , " home " would become a very different place , as our own prosperity and safety steadily diminished .
Isolationism is a dead end .
If we lose our will to protect the things that support our own prosperity , then what can we expect but the end of that prosperity -- and of any vestige of safety , as well ?
The frustrating thing is that if people would just look , honestly , at the readily available data from the Muslim world , they would realize that we are winning and that the course President Bush is pursuing is , in fact , the wisest one .
Mistakes
Critics of Bush love to cite the many " mistakes " his administration has made .
Most of these " mistakes " are arguable -- are they mistakes at all ? -- and when you sum up the others , with any kind of rational understanding of military history , the only possible conclusion is that this is the best - run war in history , with the fewest mistakes .
And most of the mistakes we 've made are the kind that become clear to morning - after quarterbacks but were difficult to avoid in the fog of war .
Worse yet , Bush 's opponents invariably depict these mistakes as being the result of deliberately chosen policies -- a ludicrous charge , but one that is taken seriously by an astonishing number of people who should know better .
The game , you see , is blame .
It 's not enough to say , Bush made a mistake .
You have to say , Bush deliberately did it wrong for evil purposes and he must be punished .
But let 's accept the fairy tale that this war has been badly run .
That still does not change the fact that on all of the biggest points , Bush has made exactly the right choice -- and he has been the only one who has even seen the need to make those choices !
Take North Korea , for instance .
Bush recognized instantly that North Korea , with China as its sponsor and protector , is simply beyond the reach of American power at this time .
This will not always be true , but his administration is pursuing a careful , quiet , firm policy of diplomatic pressure on China to do what must be done to curb North Korean insanity .
What about Iran ?
The idea of a ground war in Iran -- especially when we 're still fighting in Iraq -- seems impossible .
But it is also probably unnecessary .
Because Iran 's present government is not just hated , it is also losing its grip on power .
Not on the trappings of power -- they control the " elections " to such a point that nobody can be nominated without the approval of the ayatollahs .
But government power -- even in democracies -- depends absolutely on the will of the people to obey .
And when you rule by tyranny and oppression , the obedience of the people comes from the credibility of the threat of violence from the government .
The obvious examples are Red Square in Moscow and Tiananmen Square in Beijing .
In Moscow , when Yeltsin and the pro-democracy demonstrators defied the tanks , the Russian Army did not open fire .
Why not ?
Either they refused to obey the order to shoot , or the order was not given -- but if it was not given , it was almost certainly because the tyrants knew that it would not be obeyed .
In other words , the government had lost the ability to inflict deadly force on its own population .
In Tiananmen Square , however , the government gave the order and the troops did fire .
As a result , the tyranny continued -- and continues to this day .
Tyrannies only continue in power when they can give the order to kill their own people and be obeyed .
In Iran , there have been several incidents in the past months and years where troops refused to fire on demonstrators .
This is huge news ( virtually unreported in the West , of course ) , because of what it means :
The ayatollahs ' days are numbered .
If President Bush invaded Iran on the ground , bombing Iranian cities and killing Iranian soldiers , he would accomplish only what Hitler did by invading Russia -- uniting an oppressed people in support of a hated tyrant .
But , as was pointed out in a pair of excellent analytical pieces in the most recent Commentary magazine , we do n't have to do anything of the kind .
Oil Is Our Weapon , Too
Iran 's ace - in - the - hole is not its nuclear weapon -- in their rational moments , even the most rabid of the ayatollahs must understand that if they ever used ( or allowed someone else to use ) a nuclear weapon , we would destroy them , period .
That nuke is meant only as a deterrent -- it can't be used any other way -- and while there 's a remote chance that Iran might allow their nukes to be put into the hands of some terrorist group , it would have to be a group they control absolutely .
In other words , it would not be Al - Qaeda .
( Though Hezbollah would be bad enough . )
The real threat from Iran is their ability to shut down the Persian Gulf and cut off the world 's supply of oil from Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Iran , and the Gulf nations .
That would not really bother the United States -- gas prices would shoot up on the open market , of course , but we can get by on oil provided by non-Gulf sources .
Not so for the rest of the world , though .
And Iran is poised , with small boats and thousands of missiles , to shut down all oil production and transportation in the Persian Gulf .
What few seem to realize ( according to the article in Commentary ) is that Iran is far more dependent on oil revenues than we are on getting their oil .
When President Bush determines that he has given the Iranians ample chance to demonstrate to the few rational statesmen left in Europe that there is no possibility of meaningful negotiations with the tyrants of Tehran , his obvious course of action is to shut down Iranian power in the gulf and seize their oil assets .
If we strike first , we can eliminate their ability to do mischief in the gulf quite readily .
Their forces , however numerous , are pathetically vulnerable .
Unlike their dispersed and shielded nuclear development capability , their military forces in the gulf are in obvious and accessible positions .
So are their own oil assets .
They are as dependent on the Gulf to reach the world oil market as any of their neighbors .
If we seize their oil platforms , destroy their shipping , and impose an absolute blockade on Iranian shipping in the Gulf -- while eliminating their ability to damage anybody else 's shipping -- how long do you think the tyranny would remain in power ?
Here 's a hint :
They 'd run out of money very , very quickly .
Here 's another hint :
Their military is already refusing to obey their most outrageous orders .
When the military finds themselves saddled with a government that has brought the destruction of most of their oil revenues , all because of their insane determination to take on the United States , how long before the ayatollahs are arrested and sent home ?
Or else made irrelevant by placing a " committee of public safety " above them , to veto their decisions and make peace with the West ?
Maybe it would n't turn out that way .
But it 's our best chance -- and that 's the chance that Bush is obviously preparing for .
He has made no attempt to prepare the American people for an invasion of Iran .
But he has made it crystal clear that Iranian misbehavior will not be tolerated -- and that regime change is the desired outcome .
If Iran 's ayatollahs were toppled , how long would Syria continue to misbehave ?
Answer : About fifteen minutes .
Syria is a poor country .
They are only able to make trouble because they have Iran 's support .
Shiites and Sunnis
Here 's the other asset we have that no one seems to take into account when judging Bush 's conduct of the War on Terror :
We are really caught up in an ancient civil war between Shiites and Sunnis .
Al - Qaeda on the Sunni side and Iran 's ayatollahs on the Shiite side have both been playing the same game all along .
They do n't seriously think that they can conquer the United States ( yet ) -- so why have they been provoking us ?
Because they 're belling the cat .
Or poking the bull with sticks .
Why ?
Because they are performing on the stage of world Islam , putting on rival plays .
Both plays have the same message : Look , we 're the heroes who have God on our side , because we 're the ones who have provoked the great Shaitan and gotten away with it !
Iran 's Shiites had the upper hand for quite a while , bringing down one U.S. President ( Carter ) and getting another -- tough - guy Reagan -- to withdraw the Marines from Lebanon and then come begging to Iran 's door in his stupid , cowardly arms - for - hostages deal .
Then Al - Qaeda had the upper hand in their play , showing the Muslim world that it was the Sunnis who were blowing up American boats and embassies and , finally , the twin towers in New York City itself .
It 's all theatre .
It 's all an effort by Bin Laden to restore the Caliphate with himself , of course , as Caliph -- spiritual dictator of the Muslim world .
The goal ?
Not just to unite Sunni Islam under a Caliph again , but to then make war on and crush Shiite resistance .
That is the prize .
Only when it is won would a united Islam be ready to conquer the rest of the world , finishing the task that was left unfinished by previous waves of Muslim conquest .
Meanwhile , Iran 's ayatollahs are trying to show the Muslim world that it is they , the Shiite leaders , who have God on their side .
That was what the recent campaign in Lebanon was all about -- to steal the glory back from Al - Qaeda .
But wait .
It 's even more complicated than that .
Because there are other divisions within the Muslim world .
Iraqi Shiites have no love for , and do not accept the authority of , the Persian clerics .
Arabic - speaking Shiites have no desire to have Farsi - speaking Shiites rule over them .
So we have an amazingly convoluted situation in the middle east .
Iran and its puppet , Syria , are cooperating in support of the Sunni resistance in Iraq .
Why ?
It 's not because Syria 's rulers are nominally Baathist as Saddam was -- Baathism is dead .
Instead , it 's the ancient tribalism that is at the fore .
Syria 's rulers are members of a tiny religious minority that is an offshoot of Shia , and thus they help Iran maintain access to its Shiite allies in Lebanon partly in order to shore up their own position vis-a - vis their own mostly - Sunni population .
So why are these Shiites and crypto-Shiites supporting the Sunnis in Baghdad ?
Because anything that keeps America distracted is good for them .
And if the Americans do pack up and go home , then the Shiites can claim the victory -- even though it 's mostly Sunnis who are blowing themselves up in Israel and Baghdad .
Besides , the Sunni insurgents in Iraq are keeping the Iraqi Shiites off balance .
The last thing the Iranian ayatollahs want is for Iraq to become a democratic nation with a Shiite majority , because at that moment it will be the Iraqi Shiite leaders who will have the most credibility as leaders of the Shiite wing of Islam .
So the leadership of the Iraqi Shiites are perceived as rivals by the ayatollahs of Iran .
Thus the Iranians support the Iraqi Shiites ' enemies -- providing the weapons that are used to murder Shiites in Iraq .
It 's an astonishingly twisted game -- and as long as we do n't do anything really , really stupid , like withdrawing from Iraq , all these various treacheries will inevitably lead to the fall of the tyrants in Iran , and therefore in Syria , and therefore the taming of Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Bush 's game is to keep from letting any of these faction unite , while preparing to deliver strategic blows that can bring down the ayatollahs at relatively little cost .
Every action has repercussions .
Just as our withdrawal from Iraq would terrify and silence our allies everywhere , and embolden our enemies , so also would the fall of the ayatollahs -- particularly if it is as the result of an American intervention in the Gulf -- make waves everywhere .
Democracy would be perceived as the wave of the future .
Our friends in many countries would feel free to speak up for democracy and pro-American policies -- and their enemies would be afraid to silence them .
North Korea might go through a paroxysm of defiance -- but they would still understand the lesson .
America will not be bullied by tyrants .
We will stand for democracy , destroying our enemies at the " time and place of our choosing . "
Negotiations with North Korea would instantly take on a very different tone ; and China 's attitude , too , would become considerably more cooperative with us .
This is the victory that awaits us -- and it remains possible for two reasons only :
1. America 's brilliant , brave , and well - trained military , which projects not just power but decency and compassion wherever our soldiers go , and
2. President George W. Bush , who , regardless of his critics and detractors , has steadfastly pursued the only course that holds the hope of victory without plunging us into a worldwide war with a united Islam or isolating America in a world torn by chaos .
Those are the scylla and charybdis that threaten us on either hand .
If we do not win this containable war now , following the plan President Bush has set forth , we will surely end up fighting far bloodier wars for the next generation .
And the rhetoric of this election proves that we have precious few politicians in either party who have the brains , will , or courage to be taken seriously as alternatives to George W. Bush in the guidance of our nation through this dangerous , complicated world .
If we , the American people , are stupid enough to give control of either or both houses of Congress to the Democratic Party in this election , we will deserve the world we find ourselves in five years from now .
But Bush , being the wise and moderate politician that he is , may actually be able to continue his foreign policy despite the opposition of a Democratic Congress .
What really scares me is the 2008 election .
The Democratic Party is hopeless -- only clowns seem to be able to rise to prominence there these days , while they boot out the only Democrats serious about keeping America 's future safe .
But the Republicans are almost equally foolish , trying to find somebody who is farther right than Bush -- somebody who will follow the conservative line far better than the moderate Bush has ever attempted -- and somebody who will " kick butt " in foreign policy .
So if we get one of the leading Democrats as our new President in 2009 , we 'll be on the road to pusillanimous withdrawal and the resulting chaos in the world .
While if we elect any of the Republicans who are extremist enough to please the Hannity wing of the party , our resulting belligerence will likely provoke Islam into unifying behind one of the tyrants , which is every bit as terrifying an outcome .
I hope somebody emerges in one of the parties , at least , who commits himself or herself to continuing Bush 's careful , wise , moderate , and so - far - successful policies in the War on Terror .
Meanwhile , we have this election .
You have your vote .
For the sake of our children 's future -- and for the sake of all good people in the world who do n't get to vote in the only election that matters to their future , too -- vote for no Congressional candidate who even hints at withdrawing from Iraq or opposing Bush 's leadership in the war .
And vote for no candidate who will hand control of the House of Representatives to those who are sworn to undo Bush 's restrained but steadfast foreign policy in this time of war .
" As voters are coming out of their cars and walking up towards their polls , one person is videotaping the voter as he walks towards the polling place , " she said .
Then another person , wearing an American flag bandana and a shirt with the image of a badge ironed or embroidered on it , approaches with a clipboard to talk to the voter .
" While the clipboard person is . . . talking to [ the voter ] , the cameraperson comes up and starts videotaping their face , " Perales said .
As this happens , the third man -- with a gun visible in a sideholster -- stands next to the voter .
According to Perales , he is wearing a shirt with an American flag on it , and camouflage shorts .
The men only approach Latino voters , she said , and noted they have been doing so since early this morning .
Some modern ships are too large to pass through the Panama Canal
President Enrique Bolanos said the new route - which would cost $ 18 bn ( £ 9.5 bn ) and take 12 years to complete - was needed for the rise in world shipping .
Panama is due to vote in three weeks on whether to expand its own canal , to let larger ships pass and cut queues .
Nicaragua sought to play down fears its canal would compete for the same trade .
Speaking to Western defence ministers meeting in Nicaragua , Mr Bolanos called for international backing for a project he said would bring new economic life to the region .
" The galloping increase in world business demands another canal in addition to a widened Panama Canal , " he said .
Super-ships
If built , the Inter - Oceanic Nicaragua Canal would cut time and several hundred miles off the route from China to Europe or North America .
Nicaragua has long held dreams of its own canal and was considered a potential route before the Panama waterway was constructed .
Panamanians will vote in a referendum on 22 October on whether to upgrade their canal , in what would be the biggest expansion since it opened in 1914 .
Some modern ships are now too wide to go through the canal , and those ships that can pass have to queue for hours .
Under the proposals , wider locks and deeper and wider access canals would enable the canal to take ships carrying up to 10,000 containers .
At present the limit is 4,000 containers .
However , critics argue that when the work is finished in 2014 - 15 , the Panama Canal will still be inadequate , causing it to miss out on business .
The 80 km ( 50 - mile ) waterway , which is used mainly by the US , Japan , China and Chile , currently handles nearly 5 % of global trade .

ListT [ ]
Haskell is so strict about type safety that randomly generated snippets of code that successfully typecheck are likely to do something useful , even if you 've no idea what that useful thing is .
This post is about what I found when I tried playing with the monadeven though I had no clue what purpose such a monad might serve .
I 've talked about using monad transformers a couple of times .
One time I looked at compositions of various types of side - effect monad , and more recently I looked at compositions of the List monad with side - effects monads .
So it was inevitable that I got onto composing the List monad with itself to get This is literate Haskell , modulo the unicode characters .
So start with the the ordinary List monad , which is all about considering choices .
For example the expressioncan be interpreted as a program that chooses x to be each of the values 1 , 2 and 3 in turn , applies f to each one and collects up the result to give .
The List monad will happily make choices within choices .
So the expressionconsiders , for each possible choice of x , each possible choice of y .
The result is .
More generally , for fixed sets a , b , ... c the expressionreturns the cartesian product a×b×…×c .
In the fully general case , a , b , …c could all depend on choices that were made earlierbut right now I 'm talking about the case when a , b , … , c are all ' constant ' .
Here 's a slightly different way of looking at this .
Suppose a person called Player ( P for short ) is playing a solitaire game .
At the first turn , P chooses a move from the set of possible first moves , then chooses a possible move from the set of second moves and so on .
We can see that if we write the codethe result is a list , each of whose elements is the sequence of possible plays in the game .
If theare all ' constant ' then its just the cartesian product of the plays at each turn .
But it 's straightforward to adapt this code to enumerate all possible plays in a more general solitaire game - and that 's exactly how the List monad is sometimes used to solve such games .
So if List is about making choices , composing List with itself might seem to be about making two types of choice .
And the most familiar situation where you need to iterate over two possible types of choices comes when you consider two player games .
So I 'll tell you a possible answer now : is the game analysis monad !
Let 's look at some examples of code in themonad .
As I pointed out earlier , we usewhen we want a to be a list in the inner monad andwhen we want a to be a list in the outer monad .
So inwe can expect to use both of these with lists .
Consider
The value is [ [ ( 1,3 ) , ( 1,4 ) ] , [ ( 2,3 ) , ( 2,4 ) ] ] .
There 's a nice interpretation of this .
Introduce a new player called Strategist ( S for short ) .
Think ofas meaning a choice for S andas a choice for P .
We can read the above as : for each first play a that S could make , go through all the first plays b that P could make .
What 's different from the solitaire example is how the plays have been grouped in the resulting list .
For each decision S could have made , all of P's possible plays have been listed together in a sublist .
But now consider this expression :
We get : [ [ ( 3,1 ) , ( 4,1 ) ] , [ ( 3,1 ) , ( 4,2 ) ] , [ ( 3,2 ) , ( 4,1 ) ] , [ ( 3,2 ) , ( 4,2 ) ] ] .
Maybe you expect to see the same result as before but reordered .
Instead we have a longer list .
Our interpretation above no longer seems to hold .
But actually , we can salvage it ?
Go back to thinking about solitaire games .
We can read the code for test2 as follows :
First choose a value for x , ie .
x=1 . Now choose a value for y , ie .
y=3 .
Put ( 1,3 ) in the list .
Now backtrack to the last point of decision and choose again , this time y=4 .
Put ( 1,4 ) in the list .
Now backtrack again .
There are no more options for y so we backtrack all the way back to a again and set x=1 , and now start again with y=3 , and so on .
Now we can reconsider test4 in a two player game .
Think about the choices from the point of view of working through all of P's options while fixing one particular set of choices for S .
( It took me a while to get this concept so I 'll try to explain this a few different ways . )
So P chooses b=3 and then S makes some choice , say a=1 .
Now we backtrack to P's next option , b=4 .
But on backtracking to P's last choice we backtracked through S's choice and on running forward again , we must make some choice for S , say a=1 again .
There were 2 ways P could have played , so we end up with two distinct sequences of plays : ( 3,1 ) and ( 4,1 ) after P has worked through all of his options .
We have a list with two possibilities : [ ( 3,1 ) , ( 4,1 ) ] .
But S could have played differently .
In fact , because we play S's move twice for each sequence of P's moves there are three other ways this sequence could have come out , depending on S's strategy : [ ( 3,1 ) , ( 4,2 ) ] , [ ( 3,2 ) , ( 4,1 ) ] or [ ( 3,2 ) , ( 4,2 ) ] .
And that is exactly what test4 gave : for each strategy that S could have chosen we get a list of all the ways P could have played against it .
We get a list of 4 lists , each of which has two elements .
Each of those elements is a sequence of plays .
I 'll try to make precise what I mean by ' strategy ' .
By strategy we mean a way of choosing a move as a function of the moves your opponent has made .
That 's what we mean by a program t play a game : we give it a set of inputs and it then responds with a move .
Its move at the nth turn is a function of everything you did for the previous n - 1 turns .
So consider the example above .
After P has chosen from [ 3,4 ] , S must choose from [ 1,2 ] .
So S 's strategy can de described by a function from [ 3,4 ] to [ 1,2 ] .
There are 4 such functions .
Once we 've fixed S's strategy , there are 2 possible ways S can play against it .
Again , we have 4 strategies , and 2 plays for each strategy .
And here 's another way of looking at this .
We 'll go back to simple games where the set of options available at each stage are constant and independent of the history of the game .
Let mean a game where A is the set of S's strategies and B is the set of ways P can play against those strategies .
( The set B does n't depend on S's choice from A because we 're now limited to ' simple ' games . )
Now introduce a binary operator * such that * is the game where the moves start off being those in but when that 's finished we move onto .
In * , P's options are simply B×D .
So we know that in some sense * = for some X . Now S's first move is from A so that bit 's easy .
S's second move from C depends on P's move from B .
So S's second move is described by a function from B to C. So * ≅.
( I use ≅ because I mean ' up to isomorphism ' .
C×A also describes S's strategies equally well . )
* is a curious binary operation .
It might not look it , but it 's associative ( up to ismorphism ) .
And it has a curious similarity to the semidirect product of groups .
Anyway , we can write test4 using this notation .
It 's computing * ( up to isomorphism ) . [ 1 ] is just a convenient way of saying " no choice " and it gives us a way to allow P to move first my making S's first move a dummy one .
Multiplying gives .
[ 1,2 ] has 4 elements .
So again we have 4 strategies with two ways to play against each of those strategies .
It 's interesting to look at * * .
This is * which is .
This has a straightforward explanation : S gets to choose from A directly , to choose from C depending on how P plays from B and to choose from E depending on how P plays from both B and D.
And yet another way of looking at things .
Suppose S and P are going to play in a chess tournament with S playing first .
Unfortunately , before setting out on the journey to the tournament S realises he ’s going to be late and is going to be unable to communicate during the journey .
What should S do ?
A smart move would be to email his first move to the tournament organisers before leaving on the journey .
That would buy him time while P thinks of a response .
Even better , S could additionally send a list of second moves , one for each move that P might take in his absence .
Going further , S could send a list of third moves , one for each of the first two moves that P might take in his absence .
These emails , containing these lists , are what I ’m calling a strategy .
When you enumerate a bunch of options in themonad you end up enumerating over all strategies for S and all responses for P.
It appears there ’s a kind of asymmetry .
Why are we considering strategies for S , but plays for P ?
This is partly explained by the above paragraph .
Inthere is an implicit ordering where S ’s moves are considered to be before P’s .
So if one of S ’s choices comes after P’s , it needs to be pulled before P’s and that can only happen if it ’s replaced with a strategy .
There ’s also another interesting aspect to this .
When considering how to win at a game , you do n’t need to test your strategy against every possible strategy your opponent might have .
You only need to test it against every possible way your opponent could play against it and they only need to find one play to show your strategy is n’t foolproof .
Sodescribes exactly what you need to figure out a winning strategy for a game .
Anyway , that ’s enough theory .
Here an application .
The following code computes a winning strategy in the game of Nim .
( If you do n’t know Nim , then you ’re in for a treat if you read up on it here .
The theory is quite beautiful , but I deliberately do n't use it here . )
It uses brute force to find a winning strategy for S and additionally outputs a proof that this is a winning strategy by listing all possible ways the game could play out .
Note that I ’m using themonad so I can log the moves made in each game .
I 've also added another game , a variant of Kayles that I call Kayles ' .
In Kayles ' there are n skittles in a row .
On your turn you knock over a skittle and whichever of its immediate neighbours are still standing .
The winner is the person who knocks over the last skittle .
( The code describes the rules better than English text and you can adapt the code easily to play on any graph . )
Evaluateorto get a display of a winning strategy and a proof that it wins ie .
a list of all possible games against that strategy showing they lead to P losing .
For example nim starts [ [ [ 2,3,1 ] , … ] ] because a move to piles of size 2 , 3 and 1 is a win in Nim .
( 2⊕3⊕1=0 for those who know the theory . ) kayles ' starts [ [ [ 1,2,3,4,5,9,10,11,12,13 ] , … ] ] which means a winning move is to knock down skittles 6 , 7 and 8 ( you may see why symmetry makes this an obvious good opening move ) .
DISCLAIMER : I 'm not claiming this is a good algorithm for solving games .
Just that it illustrates the meaning of Finally a question .
Are all monad transformers a form of semidirect product ?
Footnotes : [ 1 ]
I have n't worked out the details but ListT [ ] probably is n't actually a monad .
But it 's close enough .
It 's probably associative up to ordering of the list , and as I 'm using List as a poor man 's
Set monad , I do n't care about ordering .
An alternative ListT is provided here .
I 'm not sure that solves the problem . [ 2 ]
I 'm pretty sure Set can't be implemented in Haskell as a monad .
But that 's another story .
