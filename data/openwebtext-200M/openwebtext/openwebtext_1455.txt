Once more , it is Carnival Season in many countries around the world with a Roman Catholic heritage .
Celebrations and parades are put on just prior to the observance of Lent .
Over the past few weeks parades and celebrations have taken place throughout Europe , the Caribbean and South America .
An estimated 730,000 foreign tourists , many fleeing snowy winter conditions in Europe and the United States , traveled to Rio de Janeiro , Brazil for this year 's celebrations .
Collected here are a handful of images from some of the elaborate celebrations of this Carnival season .

Ruth Lilly , a prolific philanthropist who was the last surviving great - grandchild of pharmaceutical magnate Eli Lilly , died Wednesday in Indianapolis , a family spokesman said .
She was 94 .
The cause of death was not released .
Over the course of her life , the reclusive Lilly gave away the bulk of her inheritance from the Eli Lilly & Co. fortune , donating an estimated $ 800 million , mainly to Indiana - based charitable and arts institutions .
In 2002 , she gave $ 100 million to an obscure but influential literary association based in Chicago .
The gift highlighted a personal detail -- Lilly had written poetry since the mid-1930s , to little acclaim .
“ Poetry has no greater friend than Ruth Lilly , ” said John Barr , president of the Poetry Foundation , which received the grant , in the obituary posted online Thursday by the Indianapolis Star .
Lilly was born Aug. 2 , 1915 , in Indianapolis and lived there her entire life .
She was the first of two children of Josiah K. Lilly Jr. , whose grandfather founded the pharmaceutical company in 1876 .
She shared her first name , Ruth , with her mother .
At 26 , she married Guernsey Van Riper , the son of a local advertising executive .
The marriage lasted 40 years , but she spent many of them hospitalized as she struggled with severe depression .
The couple , who had no children , divorced in 1981 .
In her 70s , Lilly found relief from her symptoms when she began to take Prozac , the antidepressant developed by Eli Lilly & Co. that came on the market in 1988 .
Prozac “ made a world of difference , ” her physician , Jack Hall , told the Star in 2002 .
“ Prozac changed her life . ”
A family statement released Thursday said that during her later years , Lilly ’s philanthropy widened her circle of contacts and interests , and her life “ became much more interesting and rewarding . ”

A few days ago I wrote about the claims that Windows 7 was a memory hog , and that Windows 7 systems tended to be short on memory .
The claims were made by " Craig Barth , " CTO of Devil Mountain Software , a Florida - based company that has a small utility that collects Windows performance data and sends it to DMS 's servers , where it is then collated and interpreted .
For its part , DMS was unimpressed with our coverage .
" Company representatives " made a blog post " rebutting " my original coverage .
Though that post has largely been redacted , it posted a number of graphs based on my system data , and confirmed that after " reviewing " my data , the reason that their software claimed my system to be low on memory is because it is .
This seemed shady , to say the least — publishing data specific to my system in an attempt to point score .
Clearly , the entire XPnet system offers vanishingly little privacy or security .
Nonetheless , the " researchers " at DMS were adamant that I was low on memory .
The truly dishonest nature of DMS really became apparent this weekend .
Larry Dignan at ZDNet uncovered that Craig Barth simply does n't exist .
Devil Mountain Software is actually operated by tech blogger Randall C. Kennedy who was , until the weekend , a paid writer for InfoWorld .
" Was " because he 's been let go after his failure to disclose his relationship with DMS .
When writing for InfoWorld , Kennedy regularly promoted DMS's XPnet .
His writing routinely parroted DMS 's scandalous memory - usage " findings " in what turned out to be shameless , but secretive , acts of self - promotion .
InfoWorld too promoted DMS 's software agent , under the branding Windows Sentinel .
For his part , Kennedy claims that InfoWorld knew all along about his dual identities — the implication being that at InfoWorld , it 's perfectly cool to pimp your own company 's software under the guise of " journalism " — and further , and far more excitingly , that this was a deliberately orchestrated , Microsoft - organized smear campaign .
The multibillion dollar software giant is , apparently , so extraordinarily damaged by Kennedy 's harmful allegations that it called in favors to get ZDNet to reveal that Randall C. Kennedy has lied about who he is ( when Craig Barth was directly asked if he was Kennedy , the response was an outright denial ) and misrepresented his relationship with companies he has written about .
Given that the influence of his coverage appears minimal and that ZDNet has only now revealed the truth , this is more than a little outlandish .
For its part , InfoWorld explicitly denies the claim that its editors were in on the deception ( see Eric Knorr 's comment in the comments section of the post ) .
The fact that Randall C. Kennedy was caught in a falsehood does not mean that he is wrong on technical issues .
One can create personas , shill for one 's own company when working as a paid blogger , and claim persecution by Microsoft , but these things do not in and of themselves mean he is wrong about the Windows 7 memory usage .
No , he 's wrong because he is misinterpreting and misunderstanding the statistics collected by Windows and using them to draw misleading conclusions .
As an added bonus , Kennedy now claims that the " low memory " warning that his software gave my system was a configuration error of some unspecified kind , and that after analyzing my data ( making it the second time that DMS has examined my data ) , my system is n't low on memory at all !
There 's no way I 'm low on memory .
Truly
Unfortunately , after verifying the configuration is indeed what Kennedy says it should be , my system is still being claimed to be low on memory , even though it is n't .
Clarifying the role of SuperFetch
There was one error in my original article .
I still stand by the conclusions I made , but I was wrong to suggest SuperFetch was involved .
The DMS software uses three counters to gauge memory usage : " committed bytes , " " page in , " and " pagefile usage " ( which is a percentage ) .
Windows has two pools of " memory " available to it ; physical RAM , and pagefile space .
The sum total of this storage is measured by a performance counter called " commit limit . "
Whenever a program asks Windows to allocate some memory , the allocation is added onto the count of committed bytes .
It 's an accounting thing ; Windows will only allocate ( commit ) as much memory as it can access through the pagefile and physical memory .
In other words , committed bytes can never be larger than the commit limit .
This is in contrast to some other OSes like Linux , which can " overcommit " ; they can allocate more memory to applications than they actually have available to them .
The reason that this is safe is that in both Windows and other OSes , an allocation does not actually use any memory .
The allocation only uses memory when the application tries to read or write from the allocated memory .
Until that point , it 's in a kind of limbo .
Windows still accounts for it ( because it could use memory if the application tries to use it ) , but it does n't reduce the amount of physical memory that 's in use , and it does n't occupy any space in the pagefile .
Linux uses overcommit because it assumes that a reasonable proportion of allocated memory is never actually used , and so it would be wasteful to ensure that every allocated piece of memory has somewhere to store it .
This is actually not a bad assumption , in general .
For various reasons , it 's quite common for programs to demand more memory than they use .
With that in mind , it 's normally safe to allocate more memory than the OS can get its hands on , because the OS will rarely be in the situation that it has to make good on its all its allocation .
On those rare occasions where this does happen — where Linux has to tell the application , " You know that memory I said you could have ?
Turns out I was lying ; it does n't exist " — Linux is forced to terminate processes to free up some memory .
This can't happen on Windows , but the tradeoff is that Windows will tend to need a larger pagefile .
Big enough to ensure that every memory allocation can be made real , just in case it has to do so .
Given that disk space is normally plentiful and that Windows has long used flexible pagefiles rather than static swap partitions , this too is a reasonable tradeoff to make .
All this should explain in part why committed bytes is not a counter worth using .
Committed bytes includes all those allocations made by applications that Windows has to account for ( to prevent overcomitting ) but which are n't actually being used .
My mistake was in believing that committed bytes included cached data ( after all , physical memory being used as cache is indeed in -use , so it seemed reasonable to charge it against committed bytes ) .
This was wrong ; cached data lives in a special state .
It is n't quite the same as free memory ( since it does contain some information ) , but it is n't exactly in -use , either ( since it can be instantly discarded if necessary ) .
The other two counters that DMS used are similarly lacking in relevance .
The Page Ins counter indicates the number of pages of memory that has to be read from disk .
Pages are one of the ways in which memory is organized by the OS ; the OS can only allocate memory in page - size chunks ( usually 4096 bytes ) , so any allocation is a whole number of pages , any read or write to the pagefile is a whole number of pages , and so on and so forth .
It 's true that a page in occurs when data has to be read from the pagefile due to previously being discarded from physical memory , and this is certainly an event you do n't want to occur regularly .
However , that 's not the only thing that can cause a page in .
I was quite deliberate when I said " read from disk " ; I did not mean " read from pagefile . "
The pagefile is one of the things on the disk that can fulfill a page in operation , but it is not the main thing .
Executables and libraries are also paged in .
When you run a program ( or when that program loads a DLL ) , Windows does not load the entire program into memory .
Instead , only those portions of the executable that are actually needed are loaded into memory .
Everything else is left residing on - disk , to reduce the pressure on the machine 's physical memory .
Each time a new part of the executable needs to be read from disk ( due , for example , to choosing a menu item in the program that had n't previously been used ) , this incurs a page in .
If you regularly start programs , you will regularly experience page ins .
Not because the system is low on memory or having to read from the pagefile a lot , but because that 's how programs are loaded by Windows ( and every other modern OS , in fact ) .
Starting programs is a regular occurrence on my computer ;
Web browsers like Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 8 start a new process for every tab you create , for example , and I create tabs often .
Page
Ins can be indicative of problems , but that is far from guaranteed .
So anyway , I continue to stand by my claim that DMS 's software cannot diagnose the situation it is claiming to diagnose ( low memory ) and hence the claim that a large proportion of Windows 7 machines are low on memory cannot be justified on the basis of DMS 's software .
The claims look more like self - serving hype .
It 's a common technique ; Microsoft is a big target , and any news that 's bad for Microsoft tends to be good for pageviews .
My name is Mia , I kill people and have a penis ... but I can learn to wuv you .

The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 at Denisova Cave Scientists have identified a previously unknown type of ancient human through analysis of DNA from a finger bone unearthed in a Siberian cave .
The extinct " hominin " ( human - like creature ) lived in Central Asia between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago .
An international team has sequenced genetic material from the fossil showing that it is distinct from that of Neanderthals and modern humans .
Details of the find , dubbed " X - woman " , have been published in Nature journal .
Ornaments were found in the same ground layer as the finger bone , including a bracelet .
Professor Chris Stringer , human origins researcher at London 's Natural History Museum , called the discovery " a very exciting development " .
Whoever carried this mitochondrial genome out of Africa about a million years ago is some new creature that has not been on our radar screens so far
Svante Paabo
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
" This new DNA work provides an entirely new way of looking at the still poorly - understood evolution of humans in central and eastern Asia . "
The discovery raises the intriguing possibility that three forms of human - Homo sapiens , Neanderthals and the species represented by X - woman - could have met each other and interacted in southern Siberia .
The tiny fragment of bone from a fifth finger was uncovered by archaeologists working at Denisova Cave in Siberia 's Altai Mountains in 2008 .
An international team of researchers extracted mitochondrial DNA from the bone and compared the genetic sequence with those from modern humans and Neanderthals .
Origin unknown Mitochondrial DNA comes from the cell 's powerhouses and is passed down the maternal line only .
The analysis carried out by Johannes Krause from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , and colleagues revealed the human from Denisova last shared a common ancestor with modern humans and Neanderthals about one million years ago .
This is known as the divergence date ; essentially , when this human 's ancestors split away from the line that eventually led to Neanderthals and ourselves .
The Neanderthal and modern human evolutionary lines diverged much later , around 500,000 years ago .
This shows that the individual from Denisova is the representative of a previously unknown human lineage that derives from a hitherto unrecognised migration out of Africa .
" Whoever carried this mitochondrial genome out of Africa about a million years ago is some new creature that has not been on our radar screens so far , " said co-author Professor Svante Paabo , also from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology .
The divergence date of one million years is too young for the Denisova hominin to have been a descendent of Homo erectus , which moved out of Africa into Asia some two million years ago .
And it is too old to be a descendent of Homo heidelbergensis , another ancient human thought to have originated around 650,000 years ago .
However , for now , the researchers have steered away from describing the specimen as a new species .
Dr Krause said the ground layer in which the Denisova hominin fragment was found contain tools which are similar to those made by modern humans in Europe .
Slice of time " We have ornaments , there is a bracelet , so there are several elements in the layers that are usually associated with modern human archaeology , " he told BBC News .
" That 's quite interesting , but of course , it is hard to prove that the bone is strongly associated to this archaeology , because it is possible that bones could have moved within the site .
" We are also not sure how exactly the excavation was done .
It could have come from a deeper layer , so that 's hard to say . "
The " Hobbit " persisted until 12,000 years ago on Flores Professor Clive Finlayson , director of the Gibraltar Museum , said the find presented a number of questions , such as to what extent culture could continue to be used as a proxy for different prehistoric human groups .
Referring to his research on Neanderthals and modern humans in southern Iberia , he told BBC News : " The assumption is that when one group - the moderns - arrives the other group disappears .
Here you have a very clear example of co-existence for long periods .
" Where is the rule that says you can have only one species in an area ?
Especially if they 're at low density ... the implications are big . "
The research contributes to a more complex picture that has been emerging of humankind during the Late Pleistocene , the period when modern humans left Africa and started to colonise the rest of the world .
Professor Finlayson has previously argued : " A time slice at a point in the late Pleistocene would reveal a range of human populations spread across parts of Africa , Eurasia and Oceania .
" Some would have been genetically linked to each other , behaving as sub - species , while the more extreme populations may well have behaved as good species with minimal or no interbreeding . "
It was long known that modern humans overlapped with Neanderthals in Europe , apparently for more than 10,000 years .
But in 2004 , researchers discovered that a dwarf species of human , dubbed " The Hobbit " , was living on the Indonesian island of Flores until 12,000 years ago - long after modern humans had colonised the region .
Difficult classification Neanderthals appear to have been living at Okladnikov Cave in the Altai Mountains some 40,000 years ago .
And a team led by Professor Anatoli Derevianko , from the Russian Academy of Sciences , has also found evidence of a modern human presence in the region at around the same time .
Professor Stringer commented : " Another intriguing question is whether there might have been overlap and interaction between not only Neanderthals and early moderns in Asia , but also , now , between either of those lineages and this newly - recognised one .
" The distinctiveness of the mitochondrial DNA patterns so far suggests that there was little or no interbreeding , but more extensive data will be needed from other parts of the genome , or from the fossils , for definitive conclusions to be reached . "
The archaeology of Denisova presents a puzzle of sorts Experts have been wondering whether X - woman might have links with known fossil humans from Asia , which have controversial classifications .
" Certain enigmatic Asian fossils dated between 250,000 - 650,000 years ago such as Narmada ( in India ) , and Yunxian , Dali and Jinniushan ( in China ) have been considered as possible Asian derivatives of Homo heidelbergensis , so they are also potential candidates for this mystery non-erectus lineage , " said Prof Stringer .
" However , there are other and younger fragmentary fossils such as the Denisova ones themselves , and partial skulls from Salkhit in Mongolia and Maba in China , which have been difficult to classify , and perhaps they do signal a greater complexity than we have appreciated up to now . "
Other experts agreed that while the Siberian specimen may be a new species , this has yet to be shown .
" We really do n't know , " Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History in New York , told the Associated Press news agency .
Dr Tattersall , who was n't involved in the new research , added : " The human family tree has got a lot of branchings .
It 's entirely plausible there are a lot of branches out there we do n't know about . "

A team of chemical engineers at Cornell have created a palm - sized device that could one day turn troops into human wall crawlers , using an adhesive bond inspired by beetles .
No surprise that Darpa , the Pentagon agency often inspired by sci-fi , is behind this one .
They 've been funding superhero efforts for years , from Superman X - Ray vision to human flight via cannonball ( well , sorta ) .
Spider - Man capabilities have been a top priority too , in hopes that troops might one day scale verticals " without the need for rope or ladder . "
So far , wall - climbing projects have yielded scampering robots , but have n't mimicked the results in humans .
In 2006 , Stanford researchers took inspiration from geckos to create a robot that clambered along surfaces using synthetic setae , the tiny , sticky hairs that give geckos their climbing skills .
And last year , a research team at SRI International devised bots that stuck to walls using electrostatic charges .
Meanwhile , Darpa was also funding research into Cornell 's water - based adhesion device , which is inspired by the Floridian leaf beetle that can adhere to leaves with power 100 times stronger than its own body weight .
The gadget consists of a three - layered plate powered by a common 9 - volt battery .
The electric field pumps water through each layer , causing droplets to pop through tiny holes in the top layer .
Each water droplet yields minimal force , but when thousands of them work together , they create enough surface tension for a square - inch device to hold up more than 15 pounds .
The smaller the device , and the more holes , the stronger the adhesion forces .
Once the researchers master the pump mechanism to make adhesive forces even stronger , they want to turn humans into Spider - Man .
Paul Steen , lead researcher on the project , envisions shoes or gloves that can bear loads while they stick to and release from walls .
Estimates that extrapolate from the research paper conclude that a 3 - by - 5 - inch plate on the sole of a shoe could support a fully grown 225 - pound man .
Unlike gecko - inspired wall walkers , which could n't scale slippery surfaces , the device can handle water and adhere to " wood , brick , linoleum , plastics , metals and other surfaces of various roughness . "
It also offers instant release , by reversing the electrical charge , so that a load ( or a person ) can stick and release easily .
Because of their massive surface tension , the gadgets might also come in handy to blow stuff up .
Steen says the ability to pack millions of holes into a very small space , creating mega-electric force , means that a credit card - sized device could bust open a door or blow through a rock fissure , using no more power than that of a standard battery .
And as if human Spider - People with palm - sized explosives is n't cool enough , Steen 's ultimate vision is to use the device to create real - life transformers :
Moving the water droplets around would yield instantly morphing objects :
Further , imagine control with a precision that enables grab - release waves to be propagated along an active joint between two surfaces , one flexible and the other rigid , say .
Then , zipping and unzipping of adhesive bonds against the flexible component opens the possibility of reconfiguring ( morphing ) objects to take different geometric shapes , all in real time .

GOP : WE'LL KILL THE LIARS WHO SAY WE ARE INCITING VIOLENCE ' Where does it say in the Constitution that you can't use the ' n - word ? ''
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON - ( PTSD News ) - Republican leaders are vehemently denying their tactics and rhetoric have been responsible for the major recent increase in political violence .
" Just because I said it 's time to take aim and drop those terrorist health care supporters in their tracks is not reason to blame me if a few patriotic Americans exercise their Second Amendment rights to righteously blow the heads off those who support Nazi Muslim Communist death panelists who want shove their socialist health care down our throats , " said former Alaskan [ half ] governor and former Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin on Thursday .
" The liberal press has it all wrong when they accuse me of telling Tea Party heroes to hang and burn in effigy the tyrant who has occupied the White House , " said Representative Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn ) .
" I never said nothing about it being in effigy . "
Conservative Fox pundit Glenn Beck expressed his outrage on Thursday .
" When I ask who among my followers will be the hero to step up and end the rein of terror of the American Nazi Democrat Party that 's led by that racist reparation minded dictator who hates white people , I can't see how this could be connected in any way with fair and balanced minded Americans wanting to exercise their First Amendment rights to shout the truth at Obama and his henchmen and to exercise their God given rights to protect themselves with pre-emptive strikes against home grown liberal terrorists .
And , where does it say in the Constitution that you can't use the ' n - word ? ' "
" If there is anyone to blame for any violence , it 's the Democrats themselves , " said House Republican Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
" They 're the one who are trying to reform health care and the ones who have elected a black president years before Americans are ready for such radical ideas . "

When American and allied forces pushed into the Taliban stronghold of Marja , in southern Afghanistan , last week , they had the advantage of knowing where dozens of roadside bombs had already been planted .
And when some troops came under fire , they called in help from a weapon that has quietly become one of the military ’s most versatile tools on the Afghan battlefield : the drone .
The use of the drones has expanded quickly and virtually unnoticed in Afghanistan .
The Air Force now flies at least 20 Predator drones  twice as many as a year ago  over vast stretches of hostile Afghan territory each day .
They are mostly used for surveillance , but have also carried out more than 200 missile and bomb strikes over the last year , including 14 strikes near Marja in the last few days , newly released military records show .
That is three times as many strikes in the past year as in Pakistan , where the drones have gotten far more attention and proved more controversial for their use in a country where the United States does not have combat forces .
There , they are run by the C.I.A. , as opposed to the military , and the civilian casualties that they have caused as they have struck at leaders of Al Qaeda and the Taliban , amid Pakistani sensitivities over sovereignty , have stoked anger and anti-Americanism .
IT might come as a surprise to most espresso drinkers , but some of the most obsessive figures in coffee take their cues not just from Italy , but from Japan .
Just peek inside Blue Bottle Coffee in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , on March 10 when it is scheduled to open ( inspection permitting ) .
Sharing the counter with two espresso machines are two “ pour over ” bars where drip coffee is made a cup at a time using a Japanese kettle with a swan - neck spout that delivers a thin , precise stream of water .
On weekends there will be “ nel drip ” coffee made with Japanese flannel filters .
And there are the showstoppers , the five Japanese slow - drip devices for iced coffee , each three feet tall  they look like an aristocrat ’s science experiment , the wood and brass frames supporting a network of glass globes and adjustable nozzles that mete out liquid at 88 drops a minute .
The Pope confirmed yesterday that he will make an official state visit to Britain this September – and immediately launched an attack on the Government ’s plans to introduce stronger equality legislation for gay men and women .
In the first official announcement from the Vatican that the head of the Roman Catholic Church will tour Britain , Pope Benedict XVI called on his bishops to continue campaigning against the Equality Bill which he said threatened religious freedom .
His comments attracted anger from gay rights groups and secularists , who have now promised to protest throughout the pontiff ’s visit .
In a letter to the Catholic bishops of England and Wales , many of whom are currently in Rome on an “ ad limina ” visit , Pope Benedict publicly criticised Britain ’s equality legislation for the first time .
“ Your country is well known for its firm commitment to equality of opportunity for all members of society , ” he wrote .
“ Yet as you have rightly pointed out , the effect of some of the legislation designed to achieve this goal has been to impose unjust limitations on the freedom of religious communities to act in accordance with their beliefs .
“ In some respects it actually violates the natural law upon which the equality of all human beings is grounded and by which it is guaranteed . ”
In a separate warning to any bishop thinking of deviating from the Vatican ’s lead on such controversial issues , Pope Benedict also reiterated the need for the Church to “ speak with a united voice ” .
“ In a social milieu that encourages the expression of a variety of opinions on every question that arises , it is important to recognise dissent for what it is , and not to mistake it for a mature contribution to a balanced and wide - ranging debate , ” he said .
“ It is the truth revealed through scripture and tradition and articulated by the Church ’s Magisterium that sets us free . ”
The Pope ’s comments were a clear assault on the Equality Bill , which consolidates the past 40 years of equality legislation and aims to expand rules stopping employers from discriminating against gay employees because of their sexuality .
Churches and religious organisations are currently exempt from the legislation , an exemption the Pope believes his bishops must make sure they maintain .
Last week , an amendment to the Bill which would have more clearly defined which jobs could continue to discriminate against homosexuals was defeated in the House of Lords with help from the Anglican bishops who are also exposed to any expansion of the equality legislation .
Yesterday , the National Secular Society ( NSS ) said it would try to mobilise a broad protest movement against the Pope ’s visit which would include secularists , gay groups , family planning organisations , pro-abortion groups and “ anyone who feels under siege from the Vatican ’s current militancy ” .
They also criticised the estimated £ 20 m cost to the taxpayer that a state visit to Britain – the first by any Pope – would inevitably entail .
“ If the Catholic Church wishes its leader to come here , it should pay for the visit itself , ” said Terry Sanderson , president of the NSS .
The veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell said his group Outrage ! would protest throughout the Pope ’s visit .
“ The Pope ’s criticism that British equality legislation ‘ violates the natural law ’ is a coded attack on the legal rights granted to women and gay people , ” he said .
Political web memes really came into their own in the 2010 decade .
They became more nuanced , more pointed , and in most cases , much funnier than they ever were before .
Here 's a rundown of the best of the bunch from the years 2010 through 2018 .
We 'll update the list as the decade continues to gift us with memes that mock our political system ... and the clowns who occupy our nation 's most powerful offices !
01 of 46 2010 : Auto - Tune the News Via YouTube / schmoyoho .
Auto - tuning videos is n't new ( remember the Bedroom Intruder song ? ) , but this was the year when the trend really took off .
Weezer followed the trend and the result is this episode of " Auto - Tune The News . "
02 of 46 2010 : Levi Johnston for Mayor Via Adweek Back in 2010 , a bro named Levi Johnston had a short - lived flash of fame because he was Sarah Palin 's daughter Bristol 's babydaddy .
Did you follow all that ?
After Levi took it all off for a " Playgirl " photo spread , he decided to run for mayor of his hometown of Wasilla , Alaska .
Naturally , the internet thought that was a terrible idea , and using those aforementioned " Playgirl " photos , they peppered the web with fake " Levi Johnston for Mayor " posters and videos .
03 of 46 2010 : " I Am Not a Witch " Via Know Your Meme .
Christine O'Donnell is a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Senate in Delaware in 2010 .
During her campaign , O'Donnell ran an ad in which the staunchly Christian , conservative candidate denied that she 's actually a witch .
" I am not a witch , " O'Donnell proclaimed ... which is exactly something a witch would say , is n't it ?
Hmmm ....
The original video that spawned the meme is here .
04 of 46 2010 : The Rent Is Too Damn High Via Imgur .
Jimmy McMillan ran in the New York state gubernatorial election in 2010 , and " The rent is too damn high " was one of his campaign slogans .
These simple words inspired the " X is too damn high " meme , which lived on well after McMillan 's campaign did .
05 of 46 2011 : Teabonics Via Funnysigns.net .
Teabonics is a portmanteau from the words " Tea Party , " as in the Tea Party movement , and " Ebonics , " a kind of jargon spoken by African Americans .
Teabonics refers to the spelling and grammar issues on Tea Party picket signs .
06 of 46 2011 : Occupy Wall Street Via Quickmeme .
" We are the 99 percent ! " 2011 saw ongoing protests in New York City and other places in America and Europe .
These protesters hoped to highlight and fix inequality and reduce corporate lobbyists ' influence on U.S. politics .
07 of 46 2011 : Pepperspray Cop Via Know Your Meme .
At one Occupy Wall Street protest at University of California , Davis , a horrifying image of a U.C. Davis police officer pepper spraying a group of peacefully protesting college kids went viral .
Georges Seurat 's masterpiece " A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte " served as the perfect backdrop for Pepperspray Cop .
08 of 46 2011 : First World Problems Via Runt of the Web .
The # FirstWorldProblems hashtag often circulates on Twitter .
It 's used to mock the privileged citizens whose problems are considered " easy " by most standards .
09 of 46 2011 : The Situation Room Via Rolling Stone .
White House photographer Pete Souza captured this image of President Barack Obama and his staff in the Situation Room of the White House while getting updates on the mission to kill Osama bin Laden .
The iconic image was soon Photoshopped into a variety of different scenarios , each one funnier than the last .
10 of 46 2012 : Texts From Hillary Via textsfromhillaryclinton.tumblr .
Reuters photographer Kevin Lamarque took this now - famous picture of then - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as she waited to fly off on a military jet .
While she waited to depart , Clinton was reading something on her cell phone while wearing a chic pair of shades .
Friends Adam Smith and Stacy Lambe , both public relations agents in Washington , D.C. , saw the image and created a popular Tumblr blog called Texts From Hillary Clinton .
And a meme was born !
The bloggers even got a chance to meet Clinton , who admitted that she was a fan of the meme .
11 of 46 2012 : Clint Eastwood 's Empty Chair Via picsmine.com .
Hollywood legend and conservative politician Clint Eastwood appeared as a guest speaker at the 2012 Republican National Convention on August 30 , 2012 .

Michigan Students Reprimanded for ' Distasteful ' 9/11 Shirts Muslim students say shirts were intended to show class spirit , not threaten
Jan. 6 , 2010  --
A group of Arab - American high school students were reprimanded for wearing sweatshirts they made which school administrators said " distastefully " referenced the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center .
Eleven boys from Edsel Ford High School 's graduating class of 2011 in Dearborn , Mich. , wore hooded sweatshirts to school Monday depicting the numeral 11 with windows drawn on each digit , so they looked like towers .
Alongside the towers is a thunderbird , the school 's mascot , flying towards them .
The text below the images read " You ca n't bring us down . "
" The whole design gave prominence to the 9/11 tragedy , and of course was very upsetting to staff and students , " said Principal Hassane Jaafar in a statement .
School officials said the boys intended the shirts to be displays of class pride and did not understand that they would be perceived as offensive .
" After talking with the students , it became clear that there were no intentions of harm , rather a very inappropriate and distasteful attempt to draw attention to themselves and to the class of 2011 , " said Jaafar .
The principal said the sweatshirts were confiscated , the students were reprimanded and the principal planned to meet with the students ' parents .
Some 300 people showed up at a Parent Teacher Student Association meeting Tuesday night at which administrators discussed the incident .
Some parents supported Jaafar 's decision to confiscate the shirts , but not suspend the boys , while others believe disciplinary action should have been taken , said Jennifer Browne , president of the PTSA .
" I support our principal and his handling of the situation " Browne told ABCNews.com .
" But I know not everyone is happy with it .
Some people chose to interpret the sweatshirts as support of terrorism or a threat of a terrorist attack . "
Some Parents Want Students Disciplined for 9/11 Sweatshirts
Of the 1,500 students at the school , half are Arab and Browne said she believed some of the parents ' reactions may have been racially motivated .
" My personal feeling is that a lot of people did overreact .
People would n't have felt nearly as threatened if these were white girls who made the shirts instead of Arab - American boys .
The messengers , not the message , were at issue for these individuals , " she said .
The students had the sweatshirts , which included each of their nicknames above the 9/11 image , made at a shop over Christmas break and wore them Monday , their first day back .
Browne , mother of a daughter in the class of 2011 , said some of the reaction to the shirts may have been in response to the botched bombing by an alleged Muslim terrorist on a Christmas Day flight bound for nearby Detroit .
None of the students ' names have been made public .
The America - Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) has done a very unwise thing :
It has issued a statement criticizing the Obama Administration , rather than Israel , for its reaction to the Netanyahu government ’s recent announcement of more illegal settlement blocks in East Jerusalem–an announcement that was made during Vice President Joe Biden ’s visit last week , an act of extreme rudeness on top of its unquestioned illegality .
This is quite remarkable .
I may be wrong–and commenters are welcome to correct me–but I can’t remember another ethnic or religious lobbying group publicly siding with a foreign country against the President of the United States …especially when the country in question is engaging in behavior that the international community believes is illegal .
Once again , every U.S. President since Richard Nixon has called for a freeze of settlements being built in Palestinian areas , including East Jerusalem , conquered by Israel in 1967 .
AIPAC stands , with Israel , against every one of those Presidents .
I certainly hope AIPAC comes to its senses soon .
But I suspect it wants a showdown with the Obama Administration , which , unlike its Bush predecessor , has stood with the rest of the world in requesting that Israel adhere to Road Map laid out by the so - called quartet ( the U.S. , E.U. , U.N. and Russia ) , a plan the West Bank Palestinians seem to be taking seriously .
This is an attempt by AIPAC to show muscle and force the Obama Administration to back down : Israel has tremendous support in the United States , especially among Evangelicals ( who believe that the achievement of a Greater Israel–that is , the annexation of Palestinian lands –would be a precursor of the Rapture ) .
As an American Jew , I find this extremely embarrassing and unfortunate .
This could get very , very ugly .
Feminism is a Darwinian blind alley .
In biological terms , there is nothing that identifies a maladaptive pattern so quickly as a below - replacement level of reproduction ; an immediate consequence of feminism is what appears to be an irreversible decline in the birth rate .
Nations pursue feminist policies at their peril .
It ’s no secret that Western man has given up breeding .
A society needs to have 2.1 births per woman in a lifetime if it ’s going to maintain a steady population .
Besides the U.S. and Iceland , no western nation is even close .
Putting the problem in chart form may help to illustrate its enormity .
Here are some of the fertility rates for western countries and their projected white populations by 2050 , not counting migration .
I estimated 4.9 million nonwhites for the UK and knocked that out of the population , 6.4 in France , 1.7 in the Netherlands , 2.5 in Germany , and 10 million for all other EU countries .
The total EU white population is 491.5 million - 25.5 million nonwhites = 466 million .
Also , the TFR was adjusted from the official number of 1.51 to 1.45 due to the higher nonwhite birth rate .
Canada has around 2.7 million nonwhites .
Their overall TFR is 1.58 ; I estimated the white number at 1.5 .
Russia is about 20 percent nonwhite .
^EU member
*ex Soviet state , non EU member
It can be projected that the total number of white people lost from the EU , Canada , Switzerland , the Balkans , Norway and the ex-Soviet states including Russia will be around 279,000,000 .
To put that in perspective , that ’s more than the losses due to World War I , World War II , the Nazi regime and all communist governments in history combined .
Of course , deciding against having children is not equivalent to starving people in gulags .
Still , whatever the causes of the birth slump , the result is hundreds of millions of lives not existing that otherwise would have .
Perhaps low birth rates are not a cultural phenomenon and the number of children people have is based more on economic considerations .
Looking at birth rates for the world as a whole casts doubt on that possibility .
The top five countries are Congo , Guinea - Bissau , Liberia , Niger and Afghanistan .
Not exactly places known for their prosperous middle - classes .
Even within first - world countries , if there ’s a correlation between wealth and fertility , it ’s negative .
In the U.S. , black and Hispanic households are worth about one tenth of what white household are .
But according to estimates , Hispanic women have 3.0 children each , blacks 2.2 , and whites 2.0 .
Ukraine ’s nominal GDP per capita is less than $ 4,000 a year while its TFR is indistinguishable from that of Italy ( $ 39,000 ) , Spain ( $ 35,000 ) or the Czech Republic ( $ 21,000 ) .
We must conclude that there is something besides economics that is going on here .
If you find a white population somewhere , it ’s almost certain that it ’s not going to be reproducing itself enough to survive .
There is one major exception .
After the 2004 presidential election , Steve Sailer famously analyzed Caucasian fertility rates in Red ( those that voted for the Republican candidate ) and Blue ( those that voted Democratic ) states .
He found that the top 19 states in fertility ( and 25 out of the top 26 ) voted for George W. Bush .
Amongst the 50 states and Washington , DC , the correlation between white fertility rate and the Republican share of the white vote was 0.86 ( 0.84 in 2000 ) .
Sailer hypothesizes that the lower cost of living in Red States makes child bearing more feasible .
In a tempting contrast , the cost - of - living calculator provided by Realtor.com says that a $ 100,000 salary in liberal Manhattan buys only as much as a $ 38,000 salary in conservative Pinehurst , North Carolina .
Likewise , a San Francisco couple earning $ 100,000 between them can afford just as much in Cedar City , Utah , if the husband can find a $ 44,000 - a- year job ” and then the wife can stay home with their children .
Moreover , the culture of Cedar City is more conducive to child rearing than San Francisco .
While this kind of thinking is on the right track , it doesn ” t address why some women choose cariers and others families as much as it does why those with particular characteristics end up in one place rather than another .
After all , those from New York are free to move to Idaho and vice versa .
But it does show that we ” re dealing with a cultural issue — one of the soul , not the pocketbook .
Utah , the only majority Mormon state in the Union , has a 2.45 TFR .
That ’s pretty impressive , especially considering Utahans watch the same TV and listen to the same music ( both of which encourage libertinism and nihilism ) as the rest of America .
While cost of living considerations may explain some of the difference in TFR between New York and Utah , they do less to shed light on the disparity between Utah and the rest on the socially conservative and sparsely populated heartland .
Taking an international perspective , there seems to be two ways to have a replacement fertility rate in the modern world .
A ) Be really religious .
B ) Be really r-selected .
Since Europeans aren ” t Africans , that leaves option ( A ) as the only proven method for replacement Caucasian fertility .
The potential success in this area of any secular philosophical system is speculative .
Remember that next time you see Bill Maher on TV foaming at the mouth about those stupid Christians who won” t bow before the god of evolution .
The ultimate irony is that championing Darwinism has , as Katarina Runske wrote of feminism , been a Darwinian dead end .
Put bluntly , liberal secular humanists are on the verge of extinction .
To get an idea of the cluelessness of the evangelical Darwinians , look not further than Richard Dawkins ’s recent article “ What Use is Religion ? ”
The author begins by distinguishing between proximate and ultimate causes .
To get an idea of what he ’s talking about , think of a moth that flies into a lamp and kills itself .
The proximate cause is that the physiology of the insect and physical properties of light cause the moth to behave in a suicidal way .
An ultimate cause is evolutionary : in the conditions in which the insect evolved , the only light in the night sky was the moon , which the moth was able to use as a compass without ever running into it .
Saying we believe in religion because it feels good is a proximate explanation , the same way that saying we eat sugary foods because they taste good is .
The evolutionary “ why ”  just is n’t there .
Dawkins ”  answer to “ what use is religion ? ” has something to do with children , but nothing to do with the likelihood of having them .
My specific hypothesis of the necessity of religion is all about children .
More than any other species , we survive by the accumulated experience of previous generations .
Theoretically , children might learn from experience not to swim in crocodile - infested waters .
But to say the least , the child whose brain includes this rule of thumb will be at a selective advantage : Believe whatever the grown - ups tell you .
Natural selection builds child brains just this way .
In addition , this very quality automatically makes them vulnerable to infection by mind viruses .
For excellent survival reasons , child brains trusts parents and elders whom their parents tell them to trust .
An automatic consequence is that the “ truster ”  has no way of distinguishing good advice from bad .
The child cannot tell that “ 
If you swim in the river , you ” ll be eaten by crocodiles ”  is good advice but “  If you don ” t sacrifice a goat at the time of the full moon , the crops will fail ”  is bad ( or at least , unnecessary ) advice .
Dawkins compares religion to an Internet virus in this way .
A good computer does what you tell it .
That makes it a wonderful machine capable of doing spreadsheets , but also likely to follow harmful instructions .
To Dawkins , religion is a late arriver like the artificial light which kills the moth that is behaving in ways that in other conditions were evolutionarily adaptive .

</iframe ></p>
The problem with using that explanation for religion is that spirituality has been around for too long .
There has been plenty of time for evolution to preserve the positive results of blind obedience and do away with what ’s harmful and wasteful .
For similar reasons , Harpending and Cochran theorize in The 10,000 Year Explosion that Jewish intelligence was a recent adaptation .
The Jews have unusually high intelligence and a susceptibility to a group of similar diseases .
The genes for disease may have not had time to be selected against .
They are around because they are part of the package that includes traits which are adaptive and make up for the fact that the carrier is more likely to die from a particular group of illnesses .
Had Jewish intelligence been around for much longer — Harpending and Cochran say it reached its abnormal level in the Middle Ages — then evolution would ” ve had time to create a healthier high - IQ race .
If man ’s spiritual side goes back tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , or even millions of years , it ’s unlikely that he couldn ” t have evolved to both obey elders as a child and as an adult only believe things that he has empirical evidence for , if such a thing was adaptive .
After all , evolution does produce secular , empirical - minded men ( Dawkins and I among them ) .
We simply haven ” t been able to outbreed believers .
Since man ’s been talking a lot longer than he ’s been writing , it ’s hard to date the birth spirituality or belief in life after death .
As good a guess as any for the start of religion is when humans started taking the trouble to ceremoniously bury their dead .
That ’s been happening for at least 100,000 years .
We may trace spirituality even further .
OriginsNet.org has put together the evidence for religiosity in the great apes in their “ Appendices for Chimp Spirituality . ”
As the article recounts , after a 10 - year old female bonobo was killed by a leopard , the tribal elders encircled the body almost immediately , some making loud displays and calls , others sitting in solemn silence .
The body was eventually groomed and cared for , and the high - status apes would n’t allow any other apes access to the body .
Surely if these alpha apes could talk , they would ” ve declared themselves a priesthood and said they were praying for the poor child ’s soul !
There ’s also evidence that animism and a certain reverence for nature has a very long lineage .
Jane Goodall observered that at the onset of thunderstorms , chimpanzee males would often perform spectacular aggression displays , charging , swaying back and forth , and brandishing and shaking branches .
Goodall sensed that the Chimpanzees were expressing something like the emotion of awe .
Religion may have evolved to protect us from slipping into hedonism , or to instill a sense of duty in order to go bear the difficulties of childbearing .
It may simply be that those who thought God was on their side exterminated the prissy atheist cavemen ( who probably also believed their women should be “ liberated ”  and hunt for themselves . )
The issues of the evolution of religion and exactly why it ’s good for the fertility rate in the modern world are outside the scope of the article .
There isn” t even an established theory on the evolution of the brain yet .
( I ” m partial to Geoffrey Miller ’s belief that it has something to do with sexual selection , but I wouldn ” t bet a week ’s salary on it . )
What we can say with certainty is that Dawkins ’s idea that religion brings nothing to man , or , indeed , harms him , is patently false , whether we see things from the perspective of how long faith has been around or what ’s happening today to people without it .
A quick look at the CIA Factbook proves that Dawkins is very wrong when he claims , “ religion has no survival value for individual human beings , or for the benefit of their genes . ” 
If , in the end , all evolution cares about is survival , it ’s liberalism that must be considered the virus .
Our ancestors who had religion survived while those of us without it might not .
The two most evolutionarily successful men in written history were probably Genghis Khan and the Prophet Muhammad .
But only the latter invented a religious justification for his conquests .
Now his ethny ( loosely defined ) continues to claim land while the Mongolians are a measly five million and dwindling .
Among whites , the two most fertile groups are by far the mentioned Mormons and the Anabaptists .
Though the Old Testament ignores the afterlife , the Hebrews ’ great reward for pleasing God was that the they could spread their genes .
Millennia later , God ’s chosen are still around , while the Canaanites exist only in word .

There may be nothing we can do to stop the current trends .
Whites may simply not be fit for the world they created .
Perhaps the few that are have already become religious fanatics and simply need time to expand their numbers .
We won ” t know until there ’s a white elite that doesn ” t declare war on the traditional beliefs of their people .
Russia may be providing a test case ( albeit not a perfect one .
The government may have started to encourage nationalism and religion , but there ’s still the poisonous effects of the Western - American media ) .
Even if it was granted that the modern world , with its feminism and secularism , produced all the happiness one can imagine , it can not last .
A baby born today may live to see the extinction of the Lithuanians ( projected to be a population of 760,000 by 2100 , possibly all assimilated into other ethnicities ) .
Any philosophy that guarantees that those that adopt it will be gone within a few generations can only be embraced by nihilists .
The patriarchal and god-fearing will inherit the earth , one way or another .

It is a common misconception — to paraphrase a commenter in the previous post on common misconceptions about publishing , that " the only two people that matter are the author and the reader ( one puts creativity in , the other money : the rest add cost ) " .
This is a bit like saying that in commercial air travel , " the only two people that matter are the pilot and the passenger ( the rest add cost ) " .
To which I would say : what about the air traffic controllers ( who stop the plane flying into other aircraft ) ?
What about the maintenance engineers who keep it airworthy ?
The cabin crew , whose job is to evacuate the plane and save the passengers in event of an emergency ( and keep them fed and irrigated in flight ) ?
The airline 's back - office technical support staff who 're available by radio 24x7 to troubleshoot problems the pilots can't diagnose ?
The meteorology folks who provide weather forecasts and advise flight planners where to route their flights ?
The fuel tanker drivers who are responsible for making sure that the airliner has the right amount of the right type of fuel to reach its destination , and that it 's clean and uncontaminated ?
The designers and engineers at Boeing , Airbus , Embraer , or the other manufacturers who build the bloody things in the first place ...?
I hope you can see the point I 'm trying to make .
To be direct : a manuscript is not a book .
The author 's job is to write the manuscript .
The publisher 's job is to turn a series of manuscripts originating from different suppliers into consistently produced books , mass - produce them , and sell them into distribution channels .
Note the phrase " series of manuscripts " .
Small outfits like Golden Gryphon Press ( who published the first two of my Laundry novels in hardcover ) work on a handful of individual titles ( in GG 's case , 1 - 3 ) in any given year ; each book gets special attention and is handled as a separate job .
Larger publishers — be they recently - graduated - from - small - press outfits like Subterranean Press or operations like Tor operate on a production line basis .
Tor publish 250-300 books a year .
Each incoming manuscript goes through a series of production stages , and if there 's a hold - up they lose their slot in the publication queue ( unless the book is very , very special , for major - bestseller values of special ) .
What is the production workflow for a book by a professional author working under contract with a publisher ?
The author writes a manuscript .
Note : a manuscript is not a book .
It 's a bundle of pages of written text ( or a text file on a computer : most big publishers these days insist , for no sane reason , on receiving a Microsoft Word 2003 .doc file — probably because it's the commonest format people use with support for italics , underlining , boldface , and headings ) .
The author may suggest a title ( the publisher does n't have to accept their suggestion ) .
The manuscript has been worked over and polished by the author to the best of their ability , but will inevitably contain typos , grammatical infelicities , continuity errors , factual errors , internal inconsistencies , and muddy bits where the author was typing on autopilot .
( And these are the good , publishable manuscripts from authors with a track record .
For some insight into how bad the bad stuff can get , read this and weep . )
The author or their agent send the commissioned manuscript to their editor .
( I 'll write about agents and acquisitions in a future entry . )
Note : outsiders often have some strange ideas about what editors do .
These days , an editor is a middle manager .
Their job is , in conjunction with a marketing manager , to determine what titles to acquire for their list ; to negotiate deliverables and deadlines with authors : to provide high - level guidance and feedback to authors : and to ride herd on the production pipeline so that Sales and Marketing receive each quarterly or triannual batch of new titles on schedule .
Editors not infrequently enjoy editing , but there 's a lot more to the job than that .
Here 's one editor 's perspective on how you wind up in the job . )
The editor reads the MS .
If it 's in need of more work , they tell the author what they want doing .
( " It needs a purple singing dinosaur and a surprise ending .
Oh , and get rid of the DEATH guy , he 's a downer . " )
But more often than not , they accept the manuscript .
This notifies Accounting to pay the author ( or their agent ) the second tranche of the book advance ( I 'll talk about royalties , advances , and how authors make money in a future posting ) , the Delivery and Acquisition money .
They then work out where to slot the MS into their production queue .
Marketing .
In general , the marketing spend on a book is around 5 % of the dollar value of the books the publisher expects to ship .
It may be more if the publisher is trying to build this particular author 's sales .
An editor talks about marketing , including where the money goes .
Note : this activity starts when the book is delivered , before it is published — but the budget is based on expected revenue which wo n't be known until the orders are in .
So to some extent the degree of marketing push depends on the editor 's ( or marketing director 's ) best guess as to how well the book will do .
Scheduling .
This is hammered out in the rough before the contract commissioning the book is even signed .
Generally , large publishers like authors to deliver one MS per twelve months , like clockwork , because their production line is geared to turn manuscripts into published books in twelve months .
However , the clock only begins ticking when the MS is accepted by the editor : so the editor looks at the calendar about 12 months ahead , works out where there 's room to slot the book in — ideally in a month preceding the summer or pre-Christmas sales peak ( if the book 's likely to sell well ) — then works backward to sort out when the various steps in the process must take place .
Note that it does n't take 12 months to produce every book — but 12 months is ample time to process the slowest book in the queue , by the recluse who does n't use email , writes with a quill pen , and is always late reviewing the page proofs .
Copy editing .
The MS is sent to an external copy editor ( usually a freelance editor specializing in the genre in question ) .
The copy editor 's job is to keep the author from embarrassing themselves in public .
To this end they need to regularize spelling and typography and nomenclature , spot inconsistencies and obvious errors , fix spelling mistakes , and telepathically read the author 's mind to ensure that the manuscript reflects the author 's pure and original intent rather than looking as if a barrelful of monkeys had a fight for ownership of the keyboard .
Traditionally , copy editors work on a paper MS using red pencils to indicate their changes ; larger publishers are now switching to all - electronic workflow , hence Word change tracking and notes .
The result , a Copy - Edited Manuscript or CEM , is returned to the editor within 2 - 4 weeks .
The author reviews the CEM .
( For some reason my publishers ' editorial assistants seem to love to send me CEMs for review the week before Christmas , with a due - back deadline of January 4th .
It 's especially fun when two publishers pull this stunt simultaneously .
Perhaps they think nobody loves me and I welcome the distraction ...?)
Alas , copy editors are not , in fact , telepathic .
Sometimes they get stuff wrong — rarely , they get lots of stuff wrong .
So when the editor receives the CEM they bounce it to the author for review .
The author can override the copy editor 's changes and , if necessary , add corrections of their own .
There are usually multiple changes per page — ranging from trivial stuff ( serial comma policy at $ PUBLISHER differs from author 's usual style ) to " you 've referred to your hero as Joe sixteen times and Jim fourteen times in the MS — which is right ? "
The author typically has up to four weeks to review the CEM and return it to editorial .
If it 's on paper , the author must use a different colour of crayon from the copy editor , otherwise whackiness ensues .
Electronic workflow involves change tracking and lots more irate marginalia , followed by hoping that Word or OpenOffice do n't corrupt the file .
Advance Reading Copies .
If the book is going to be promoted heavily , the editor arranges a production run of ARCs .
These are trade - paperback - sized print - outs of the manuscript , sometimes with rudimentary typesetting , and a non-glossy cardboard cover .
They go to reviewers ( the lead time for a book review in Publisher 's Weekly , Kirkus , or another news outlet is several months ) , other authors ( if a cover quote is being solicited ) , and sometimes to bookstore buyers to promote a title that 's expected to sell well .
Note that despite its crude appearance , an ARC costs a lot more to produce than a finished hardback — it 's laser - printed and hand - bound , in small numbers , so not all books get ARCs .
Someone — typically the office intern or editorial assistant — has to mail the ARCs out .
Book design , cover design , front and back flap copy , and cover artwork .
The editor pulls together a description of the book and / or the original manuscript .
These are used to brief the art director , who if necessary commissions an artist to produce a painting .
( Cover paintings may not be necessary if the fashion is currently for abstract / design - driven covers in marketing . )
The art director also works out a suitable cover design for the book .
A marketing / blurb writing person / editor also writes the flap copy ( the text on the back of the book that makes you want to read it ) .
The goal of book design is to motivate shoppers unfamiliar with the author to pick the book up .
Nothing more and nothing less .
( Retail psychology tells us that shoppers who handle a product are more likely to buy it .
Existing loyal fans will buy it anyway .
So the book design is aimed at appealing to new readers . )
CEM delivered to Typesetting .
Publishers these days own neither internal typesetting departments nor printing presses .
What happens at this point is that the copy edited manuscript is sent to an external typesetting bureau , where a typesetter with a workstation running either Quark Publishing System or ( increasingly , these days )
Adobe InDesign sets up a Book project , imports the styles specified by the publisher 's standard book design , and imports and reflows the CEM — making sure that all the changes are incorporated into the DTP file .
If the book is still being produced with paper - on - pencil workflow , at this point the poor bloody typesetter has to go through it page by page entering manual corrections ( and undoubtedly injecting new and creative errors of their own ) .
Marketing copy .
The editor develops a pitch for the book that will motivate their marketing and sales force .
At a company like Tor , internal meetings are held between editorial and sales several times a year , at which the editors present their new and forthcoming titles and explain their selling points , target audience , and special angles .
The sales team then go forth and push the book at store buyers ( who choose which titles to stock in retail store chains ) and wholesale buyers ( ditto for wholesale channels ) .
The picture at other publishers may be different ; for example Ace ( part of Berkley publishing group , part of Penguin , turtles , recursion , etc. ) have a smaller number of higher level marketers who liaise directly with the buyers for the big chains ( Barnes and Noble , Borders ) .
This stage is critically important , because the retail and wholesale buyers place their orders before the size of the print run is finalized .
Review page proofs .
The typeset file is used to generate a PDF image of the book , as it will appear on paper .
This is sent to editorial , who send a copy to the author and , hopefully , one or more proofreaders .
At this point , the job of the author ( and the proofreaders ) is to correct errors introduced during the typesetting process , and possibly typos they did n't spot earlier — but not to make substantive changes .
Again , around one month is allowed for reviewing page proofs and returning the marked - up chunk of dead trees ( or an annotated PDF file , or a list of page / line number / error tuples ) to editorial , who pass it back to the typesetters for fixing .
( Parenthetical note : there is no such thing as a clean page proof .
Authors are blind to their own persistent spelling idiosyncracies , typesetters get stuff wrong , and so on .
But in general , the more eyeballs — and more proofreading passes — a set of proofs receive , the fewer errors will be left in the finished book . )
Collate advance orders and order the print run .
The sales folks have spoken to the big chain buyers and wholesalers , who guess at how many books they can sell and place orders .
If these are trade books they are sold typically on 90 - or 120 - days net credit , sale or return .
( That is : if the bookseller orders a carton of 24 books , they must either return unsold stock or pay up the agreed wholesale price when invoiced after 90 or 120 days .
So they 're running on credit from the publisher . )
If they are mass market books they are sold on net credit , but instead of being returned for credit , the wholesaler / retailer returns the stripped covers and pulps the book block .
( Which means that MMPBs unsold after 90 or 120 days are treated like spoiled grocery stock .
The mass market pipeline is absolutely insane , but it mirrors how magazines are sold ; it was brought in during the 1930s / 1940s to sell cheap paperbacks and arguably kept the publishing industry from collapsing , but today ... let 's just say I have n't met anybody who 's in favour of it .
Note that although mass market paperbacks are all C - format in size , not all C - format paperbacks are " mass market " books ; in the UK , the sale - or - strip channel died in the late 80s / early 90s , and today — as far as I know — all British C - format paperbacks are sold on sale - or - return terms . )
On the basis of these advance orders , and experience which tells them how many extra copies to print for late orders / specialist stores , the publisher orders a print run from a print shop .
The print run : this is the moment of truth .
( If the editor has coughed up a $ 100,000 advance against a 10 % royalty on cover price , they need to ship $ 1 M of books ( cover price ) ; if the advance orders add up to 2500 hardbacks , senior management are going to start asking difficult questions . )
Some rough figures : a typical first SF / fantasy novel in hardback from a major US publisher will ship 3500 - 5000 copies .
Anything over 10,000 is nudging towards the bestseller list ; a fiction book that shifts 25,000 in its first month in hardcover is going to be in the New York Times top 20 .
Mass market paperback runs are much larger — 15,000 - 30,000 — but 25 - 50 % will be pulped and the profit margin on them is vanishingly narrow compared to those juicy hardbacks .
Oh , and the long tail applies : the top 3 on the New York Times bestseller list easily outsell the next 30 combined , and # 4 to # 30 combined probably outsell the next three million .
The printing process may include multiple stages : ordering of paper ( different grades of paper have different properties and costs ) , then printing of book blocks ( containing the pages of the books ) , trimming , printing of colour cover flats , folding and binding , or printing of signatures , stitching and trimming , binding , printing of dust jackets , and folding ( depending on whether paperback or hardback , with variations depending on whether the hardbacks are saddle - stitched — as is still common in the US market — or perfect ( glue ) bound — as is the case for most British hardbacks ) .
At least the old process of cutting photographic plates is obsolete ; most commercial printers these days have machines that take in a properly imposed postscript or PDF image and act ( from the user 's point of view ) like a gigantic Postscript printer ( fed by barrels of ink and giant rolls of paper ) .
It takes 2 - 4 weeks from ordering the print run to the shipping pallet of finished books to appear on the publisher 's warehouse loading bay , depending on how busy the print shop and how complex the manufacturing process are .
Shipping .
Someone in a warehouse has to ship out several hundred or thousand cartons of books to stores , and a smaller number of larger palletloads to wholesalers .
Invoicing and accounting .
I 'm going to tip - toe past this particular pit of festering insanity .
Let 's just say that if you 're shipping to dozens of wholesalers , a handful of large bookstore chains , and literally hundreds of small bookshops , it gets hairy fast .
( Multiply by 300 titles a year with an average in - print life of 5 years if you 're someone like Tor . )
Note also that the contracts the publisher signs with their authors dictate that the authors will be paid a royalty ( percentage share of the proceeds ) based on the number of books sold and the sales channel through which they are sold .
The authors almost certainly have a contractual right to order a third - party audit if they think you 're screwing with their figures .
And if the figures are out , you ( the publisher ) pay for their audit , in addition to the money you owe then .
After I hand in an MS , I expect to do another 3 - 6 weeks ' solid work on the book before it is published — mostly in the CEM - checking and page proof - checking stages .
After I hand in the MS , I expect my publisher to put in ... well , Tor produce 300 books a year with 60 staff , so it 's about ten person - weeks per book in house , but this does n't include the external copy editor , proofreader , typesetter , printer , and other outsourced tasks , which probably double it again .
Overall , the process of turning a manuscript into a book is estimated to cost $ 7000 - $ 20,000 — an amount comparable to the author 's likely earnings from the book .
In fact , the actual division of labour on a book is split roughly 50/50 between the author and the publisher .
In summary , while it 's true that the author is the one with the creative input , they only do about half the work .
And the other half of the job is not optional .
The reason publishers exist is to provide for division of labour ; if I did the other 50 % to bring my rough manuscripts up to published - book - quality , I 'd only be able to write half as many novels .
Millions of Britons face being snooped on by a new European agency
It is understood the agency will concentrate on anyone thought “ xenophobic ” or likely to commit a crime involving the environment , computers or motor vehicles .
This could include covert monitoring of people who deny the existence of climate change or speak out on controversial issues .
Paul Nuttall , chairman of the UK Independence Party , said : “ I am horrified .
We thought Gordon Brown ’s Big Brother state was bad enough but at least we are going to kick him out in May .
These guys we cannot sack until we leave the EU . ”
James Welch , legal director of campaign group Liberty , said : “ We have huge concerns that Europol appears to have been given powers to hold very sensitive information and to investigate matters that are n’t even crimes in this country .
Any extension of police powers at any level needs to be properly debated and scrutinised . ”
Until January 1 , Europol was a police office funded by various states to help tackle international organised crime .
But it has been reborn as the official criminal intelligence - gathering arm of the EU and Brussels has vastly increased its powers .
It can now target more than simply organised crime and the burden of proof required to begin monitoring an individual has been downgraded .
Europol has also been absorbed into the EU superstructure , so it will be centrally funded , sweeping away a key check on its independence .
Campaigners last night expressed concern over the vague list of “ serious crimes ” which the agency can help investigate , which include racism and xenophobia , environmental crime and corruption .
Among personal details that can be gathered and stored are “ behavioural data ” including “ lifestyle and routine ; movements ; places frequented ” , tax position and profiles of DNA and voice .
Where relevant , Europol will also be able to keep data on a person ’s “ political opinions , religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership and data concerning health or sex life ” .
Sean Gabb , director of the Libertarian Alliance , warned that it threatened our right to free speech .
“ It does n’t surprise me that Europol has been handed these rather frightening powers , ” he said .
“ We now live in a pan -European state so it was to be expected that it would have a federal police force with powers over us .
“ There is a real danger that opposition to EU policies could make an individual liable to arrest .
Election prognosticator Charlie Cook ( who I like and respect ) has been quick to trash Democratic chances this November .
Just a few short weeks ago , he said :
[ It 's} very hard to come up with a scenario where Democrats do n't lose the House .
It was actually pretty easy to come up with a scenario where the GOP did n't pick up nearly 40 seats , but Cook -- who in December 2007 was predicting Democratic gains of 2 - 7
House seats in 2008 when they won 21 -- was sticking to his guns .
It 's not a new phenomenon -- the Beltway crowd is quick to pounce on perceived Democratic vulnerabilities , and slow to respond to Republican ones ; just another facet of your liberal media at work .
Still , it was a weird call for Cook to make , since Republicans would have to take out 33 incumbents to win back the House .
As Chris Bowers notes , that is all but impossible :
In 2006 and 2008 , Democrats won the national popular vote by 6.49 % and 8.65 % respectively .
Despite this , they still only defeated 37 Republican incumbents in those two years combined .
With Republicans nowhere close to that level of strength in the generic congressional ballot , it is still more likely than not that Democrats will retain control of the House .
The signs are certainly not there for a massive Republican wave .
In fact , what early advantages Republicans have had appear to be receding :
For example , there 's the new Ipsos poll for McClatchy newspapers :
Looking ahead to November 's elections , 50 percent said they 'd vote for Democratic candidates if the election were today , while 40 percent said they 'd vote for Republicans .
The Pollster.com poll composite shows the two parties neck and neck :
But take out the crappy YouGov internet poll ( which leans Democratic ) and Rasmussen , and you get :
Rasmussen 's numbers are single - handedly propping up the GOP , showing leads that no other credible pollsters shows .
But even with Rasmussen 's suspect numbers included , the trend is certainly up for Democrats .
That 's not all .
Republicans are losing top recruits , including this one from a swing D+2 district in Oregon :
Initially lauded by Republicans nationally as their best hope to win a House seat long held by Democrats , [ Springfield , Oregon , Mayor Sid ] Leiken faced an uphill battle against [ Rep. Peter ] DeFazio , a 24 - year incumbent .
Leiken did poorly in campaign fundraising ; as of the most recent filings , DeFazio had at his disposal more than 100 times Leiken ’s campaign cash .
Plus , observers said Leiken ’s violation of Oregon campaign laws last year could have hurt him .
Leiken paid a $ 2,250 fine for unlawfully converting $ 2,000 of his mayoral campaign money to personal use .
And Alabama Rep. Bobby Bright , a supposed goner considering he represents a district that is R+16 , shows that , well , he 's not a goner :
A new poll conducted for Rep. Bobby Bright 's ( D - AL ) campaign shows that while he may sit in a very vulnerable CD , he starts out in strong shape for re-election .
The survey , conducted by Anzalone - Liszt ( D ) , shows Bright leading Montgomery Councilor Martha Roby ( R ) , AL school board member Stephanie Bell ( R ) and businessman Rick Barber ( R ) handily .
The survey was conducted 2/8 - 11 , among 500 LVs ;
It has a margin of error of +/- 4.4 % .
The survey was first posted in the Montgomery Advertiser .
General Election Matchups
Bright 54 % Bright 55 %
Roby 30 Bell 29 Bright 58
Barber 26
If Republicans can't compete against the Bobby Brights of the party -- freshmen congresscritters in tough Southern districts , or field top - tier candidates against the DeFazios in competitive swing districts , then their chances of massive national gains are all but nil .
Heck , even Cook seems to have noticed .
Today , he made several race rating changes , including Bobby Bright's :
Governors Ratings Changes TX GOV Lean R to Toss Up House Ratings Changes AL - 02 Bobby Bright Toss Up to Lean D AR - 01 OPEN ( Berry ) Lean R to Toss Up NC - 08 Larry Kissell Lean D to Likely D
I suspect we 'll be seeing more of this in the coming weeks .
Democrats have suffered their nadir well in advance of November 's elections .
Republicans like Jim Bunning have reminded voters of the GOP agenda .
Health care reform is just weeks away from passing ( yes , I 'm an optimist ) , giving Democrats an epic and hard - fought victory , and Republicans continue to face severe funding gaps at all levels .
Their one advantage , the intensity gap , is in jeopardy as the teabaggers splinter and begin supporting either fringe or third - party challengers , and Democrats are starting to wake up ( thanks Blanche ! ) .
At this point , Democrats are still poised to suffer setbacks in November , but no chamber will change hands .
Yet Republicans have so convinced themselves of their epic victory against " socialism , " that even incremental gains will shatter them .
Their expectations have been set so high , aided by Cook and other analysts like him jumping the gun , that meeting them is an impossibility .
And therein lies our own motivation :
We help build the firewall , protect our most valuable members , lose some of our ( Blue Doggy ) deadweight , play offense in some key places , and deny Republicans their triumph , and we 've won the cycle .
Playing defense is n't as glamorous as playing offense , but if we come out of it a more cohesive party , we 've won , and if we shatter the GOP 's will in the process , so much the better .
Denver Public Schools the Target
School Based Health Clinics As the Conduit
Vaccines for All School Children is the Goal
What Does Pharma Know ?
( Natural News )
The golden calf of public health was smashed in this recent flu season as many in the United States outright rejected the H1N1 vaccine .
Pharmaceutical companies are now holding the bag , as millions of doses of the vaccine are rotting on shelves or being discarded as hazardous waste .
Or are they ?
The manufacturer may find it more cost effective to dump them into the arms of our public school systems .
Parents would revolt if they knew that the pharmaceutical industry , the Department of Health and Human Services , and Centers for Disease Control have allocated millions of dollars in funding to establish vaccine clinics in the public schools .
Pumping children with experimental vaccines in public school is about to be pursued as a matter of policy .
Recently , a news article ( http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_14290... ) in the Denver Post highlighted two grants issued by the Centers for Disease Control totaling $ 1.6 million dollars to vaccinate students attending Denver Public Schools ( http://communications.dpsk12.org/announcemen... ) .
One grant ( http://communications.dpsk12.org/announcemen... ) funds an effort to establish a sustainable school - based vaccination program utilizing the yearly influenza and experimental H1N1 vaccine .
The hope is to create a partnership between public health ( Denver Health ) , school personnel ( Denver Public Schools ) , and an entity ( Kaiser Permanente ) that would bill third party payers .
The second grant ( http://www.cdc.gov/od/pgo/funding/IP08-006.h... ) provides cash for vaccinating children with the newly approved diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine ( Tdap ) , meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4 ) , and human papillomavirus vaccine ( HPV ) .
The new vaccines for adolescents are among the most expensive vaccines ( http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/cdc... ) recommended today for any age group .
Lead investigator of Denver In - School Immunization Project , Dr. Judith Shlay , of Denver Health , readily admits that if all goes well , plans are in place to implement school - base vaccine clinics ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHjiImtTJKI ) nation - wide ( a high level overview of this plan ( http://www.nasbhc.org/site/c.jsJPKWPFJrH/b.2... ) was presented to the National Assembly on School - Based Health Care by Dr. Shlay ) .
The Denver In - School Immunization Project ( http://denverhealth.org/portal/Services/Publ... ) has long been in the works .
It was paved in the late 1970s and early 1980s by incrementally creating School - Based Health Clinics ( SCHC ) .
In 1978 , The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ( RWJF ) , a non-profit organization funded by the Pharmaceutical Company , Johnson and Johnson ( http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/20040... ) , contributed $ 2.3 million dollars to the state of Colorado , ( http://www.rwjf.org/reports/grr/032293.htm ) making SBHCs a reality .
Illnesses such as ADD / ADHD , Cervical Cancer , diabetes , asthma , obesity , and learning disabilities were of little consequence in the '70s .
However , these disabling syndromes and the medications aimed at treating them have all reached epidemic proportions and astronomically profitable sales .
In the past , parents have discovered challenging a school - based medical model can be extremely dangerous .
In September , 2000 , Ms. Patti Johnson , a former Colorado State education board member , testified before Federal Congress ( http://www.politicalwatchdog.com/psych_fraud... ) concerning Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) .
In the 1990s , the much - hyped drug , Ritalin , was maneuvered into public schools to address the growing epidemic of hyperactivity .
Mrs. Johnson testimony was prophetic and foreshadowed a future scenario where parents could be charged with medical neglect if they refused to medicate their child per the school 's request .
If School Based Health Clinics are being used as the conduit to vaccinate children , the federally - funded Vaccines For Children ( VFC ) ( http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/par... ) program and third party insurance coverage provide the finances .
According to the grant approved by the CDC , the VFC program would provide " free " vaccines to an estimated forty percent of children in the United States who are not covered by third party insurance plans .
"
The goal is for this ( Denver In - School Immunization Project ) to be .
And we need to see at the end of the day , when all the dust settles at the end of this school year , whether the amount that was reimbursed for all these different insurance companies , adds up to the amount of time and effort it took to actually have the clinic . "
( Emphasis added ) Dr. Matthew DaleyEvaluator of the Denver In - School Immunization ProjectKaiser PermanenteColorado Public Radio InterviewFebruary 17th , 2010
Put into context , the implications of the Denver In - School Immunization Project are enormous .
We are speaking of a captured market for vaccine manufacturers ( guaranteed purchase of vaccines ) , insurance companies ( guaranteed rise in premiums ) , and government funding ( VFC ) all footed by taxpayer dollars .
The total price per vaccinated adolescent in the private sector is approximately $ 500 ( http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authored_ne... ) .
That 's a lot of cash .
Dr. Matthew Daley is very aware that a paltry 1/3rd of adolescents receive their yearly influenza vaccine , for example .
In a semi-recent presentation , ( http://www.preventinfluenza.org/NIVS_2009/7%... )
Dr. Daley shows obtaining parental consent is a barrier to mass vaccination in a school setting .
Furthermore , the presentation suggests improved financial incentives for providing influenza vaccinations .
Dr. Daley must be sharing his notes with RAND Corporation because it is almost the exact message RAND pitched to the pharmaceutical giant , Sanofi Pasteur .
In 2007 , a study performed by RAND Corporation , funded by Sanofi Pasteur , investigated the most efficient way to vaccinate ( http://www.rand.org/pubs/documented_briefing... ) low - income adolescents .
Nicole Lurie , ( http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_sum... ) one authors of the white paper , is now an adviser to Kathleen Sebelius , the Secretary of Human Health Services ( HHS ) .
Mrs. Lurie has a long history of traversing the revolving door between private industry , government duties , and academic appointments ( there is no difference from the former head of the CDC , Julie Gerberding , ( http://vactruth.com/2010/01/04/julie-gerberd... ) becoming President of Merck Pharmaceuticals Vaccine Division ) .RAND 's report identifies barriers that would obstruct " alternative vaccination campaigns , " otherwise known as " in-school vaccination programs . "
The list of legal issues includes parental consent laws , absence of a reliable medical home ( where an adolescent receives medical treatment such as a doctor 's office ) , and access to vaccine registration information .
That 's right , mom and dad .
Your current ability to refuse vaccines , which is protected by most state laws , is considered a barrier to Pharmaceutical Interests !
With Public Relations at the foreground , The RAND paper further recommends that Sanofi Pasteur create " Vaccine Champions " or " Registration Champions . "
Vaccine champions are " ardent supporters of a cause
They can bring about change by educating those around them and spurring others into action through local events , meetings , or publications . "
Coincidentally , non-profit organizations such as The Immunization Partnership are following lockstep with the RAND Corporation 's group - think .
It also has " Immunization Champions . " ( http://www.immunizeusa.org/iz-champions/
If vaccines are mandated for public school attendance , and most likely they will be , you can bet that it wo n't matter whether the vaccine is experimental or not .
With rising awareness of the chronic effects of mass vaccination , public skepticism and outcries will likely be countered with fear mongering ( http://www.scribd.com/doc/19212191/2004fluno... ) by fanatical vaccine advocates and lobbying groups funded by Big Pharma interests .
The only real way to protect the safety of our children is to fiercely safeguard state exemption laws that uphold parents ' freedom to choose whether to vaccinate or not .
Yet , by blending society 's Federal Educational Framework with a superficial medical model , vaccine proponents have a road map to overcome any damaging future resistance to experimental vaccines .
Could it be any clearer that if left unchecked , the pharmaceutical industrial complex soon will be calling the shots instead of parents ?
Jeffry John Aufderheide is the father of a child injured as a result of vaccination .
As editor of the website www.vactruth.com he promotes well - educated pediatricians , informed consent , and full disclosure and accountability of adverse reactions to vaccines .
Standing in a Boulder courtroom on a blustery Friday evening , waiting for the jury to return with its verdict , Jennifer Latham feels a knot twisting in her stomach .
She thinks she might throw up .
She takes a few deep breaths .
The nausea passes just as the jury starts filing in .
Where this sick , anxious feeling came from , she has no idea .
But it has nothing to do with doubt .
She knows she is right , knows she is going to win .
She has known it all along .
It 's been a long haul to get to this moment .
Four years of acrid legal wrangling with Time Insurance , the Milwaukee - based health insurance company Latham sued for breach of contract and bad faith .
Countless hours of hearings and depositions .
Two weeks of a hard - fought trial , riddled with objections and bench conferences and relentless scrutiny of her medical records .
At times she found it almost impossible to sit still , fidgeting in her chair or retreating from the plaintiff 's table to sit with her parents in the back of the courtroom .
But none of that matters now .
She 's right .
She 's going to win .
She has known it since — well , since she first realized what the insurance company had done .
The knowledge did n't come all at once .
She has no memories of the accident and only fragmentary images of the next few weeks , as she struggled to learn to walk and read again and deal with the effects of a traumatic brain injury .
But once she figured out what had happened , she knew it was up to her to do something .
She had , she says now , a calling .
In 2005 , Latham and her husband , Alex , were severely injured when a meth dealer fleeing police ran a stop sign in Longmont and broadsided their car .
The couple suffered broken limbs , head trauma and a host of other injuries .
Both spent weeks in the hospital .
At the time , Alex Latham had no health insurance .
Jennifer did — or so she thought .
She 'd signed up for health insurance with Time , also known as Assurant Health , five months before the accident .
But as the hospital bills began to roll in , the company launched a review of her application and prior medical records , a process known as " post - claim underwriting . "
A
Time employee then wrote a letter that Latham 's attorney , Marc Levy , describes as " a sucker punch to the gut , " informing her that the company was rescinding her policy — not just canceling it , but obliterating it , as if it never existed — because she had failed to disclose information about her health history on the application she 'd submitted .
For people unable to obtain group health insurance through their employer , rescission of an individual policy can be a kind of death sentence .
Once you 've been rejected for alleged fraud on your application , it 's almost impossible to obtain health insurance elsewhere .
Lawyers for Time , the nation 's oldest individual medical - policy provider , say that rescission is a rare remedy , affecting only half of 1 percent of its clients .
" It 's a way to keep this kind of insurance as affordable as possible , " defense attorney Ellis Mayer told the jury .
" The fact that certain people are rejected for insurance is part of the business . "
But Time 's use of rescission to avoid paying pending claims has come under fire across the country .
The company has run afoul of Colorado regulators over its rescission process and was fined $ 2.1 million in Connecticut for improperly denying hundreds of claims .
The practice has also triggered a barrage of lawsuits — most of them settled out of court .
Last summer , Time 's CEO was grilled before Congress about the fact that his company had saved $ 150 million in five years by rescinding 8,500 policies , sometimes over vague symptoms or notations in medical records that the patient was never told about .
For some pundits , the company has become the poster child for avaricious , weasel - word insurance companies in the debate over health care reform .
Latham 's attorney told the jury that Time 's application process was confusing , that the insurance agent asked his client summary questions and then filled out the convoluted form for her , and that the " investigation " in search of fraud was cursory at best .
" They 've never produced a scintilla of evidence that she had any intention to mislead , " Levy said .
" This is a game of gotcha .
They can take away anybody 's insurance policy . "
Jennifer Latham 's medical bills to date total close to $ 200,000 .
Unable to work , she and Alex lost their home in Longmont to foreclosure in 2006 ; they are now getting divorced .
Jennifer lives on disability checks and walks with a rod in her leg .
She and the two youngest of her four children have had no private health insurance since Time rescinded their policy .
People who have known her a long time — her mother , her thirteen - year - old daughter — say that Latham is a different person than she was before the accident .
She was once a voracious reader , a take - charge mom , a teacher with the patience of Job .
Now she 's sensitive to bright light and noise , has trouble focusing , is forgetful , impulsive , gets upset easily .
Yet there 's one thing , they say , that the brain injury did n't alter : her sense of right and wrong .
" She 's a remarkable woman , " says Levy .
" She has never described herself as a victim .
But she does have a high sense of integrity , and to be called a liar for four years bothered her a great deal . "
As the jury hands over its verdict , Jennifer Latham already knows that vindication is at hand .
She knows she 's right .
She 's going to win .
And Time Insurance is about to discover just how badly it has miscalculated : about the routine business of taking away people 's health insurance , about this Boulder jury , about its own by - the - numbers defense — and , most of all , about Jennifer Latham .
Five years ago , everything seemed to be falling in place for Latham .
She was changing careers , raising four kids and living in a five - bedroom house in Longmont that her second husband , a savvy and successful real - estate agent , had found at a bargain price .
At 35 , she felt she was finally on the right track .
Raised in rural Michigan , Jennifer had earned an honors degree in elementary education and married the boy next door .
Inspired by the writings of Jack Kerouac , the couple moved to Colorado in 1997 .
Jennifer found a job at a preschool in Broomfield that offered free daycare for their two daughters .
Over the next four years she moved to Boulder , then Lafayette , divorced her first husband , became a director for Children 's World Learning Centers and married Alex Latham .
The Lathams soon had two more children , Eden and Jackson .
Alex 's business was taking off , and Jennifer decided to quit her job to stay at home with the children while studying for her own real - estate license .
By the fall of 2005 , she was putting in eighteen miles a day on a stationery bike , doing yoga and working on having a body like Jennifer Lopez .
" I was in the best shape of my life , " she says now .
It all came apart in a heartbeat , a block from home , during a trip to the grocery store .
On Sunday , October 23 , she was preparing for a visit from her parents , who were going to watch the kids while she and Alex headed for the Vegoose music festival in Las Vegas , featuring Dave Matthews and Widespread Panic ; a friend had backstage passes .
She and Alex got in their Hyundai and headed to King Soopers for supplies .
A few blocks away , Shawn Todaro checked the mirrors on his rented Silverado and saw a state trooper quietly tailing him .
A parolee with a record of drug , weapon and theft charges stretching back to 1992 , Todaro was n't planning to get stopped .
Not with 87 grams of methamphetamine , worth about $ 13,000 , hidden in the floor of his truck .
Todaro took off .
He blasted through a stop sign at 23rd and Collyer and T - boned the Hyundai , pushing it through a fence and into a tree , crumpling it like a soda can .
The trooper arrived moments later .
Todaro struggled with the officer , pulled a gun and fled on foot , leaving behind his meth and the screams of the people in the other vehicle .
Eight days later , police tracked Todaro 's cell phone to a house in Fort Collins .
He surrendered after a five - hour standoff .
He pleaded guilty to vehicular assault and several related charges ; Boulder District Judge Lael Montgomery gave him thirty years .
The Lathams had already received their sentence : shattered legs , lacerations , head trauma , internal injuries .
If two emergency rescue workers had n't lived yards from the crash and responded immediately with their equipment , the couple might not have survived at all .
Jennifer 's parents , Jim and Sheila Shields , learned of the accident while on their way to Colorado from Michigan .
They drove through the night and went straight to the hospital .
Sheila could scarcely believe that the battered figure in the ICU was her daughter .
" She was so swollen , " she recalls .
" Cuts and bruises all over her .
She was in and out of consciousness .
She was talking about toilet - paper people .
She did n't realize she was married to her second husband .
She was all over the place . "
Jennifer 's own recollections of those first few weeks of rehabilitation are hazy .
Her first post - accident memory is of being wheeled into a shower , realizing that she could n't walk or bathe herself .
She did n't recognize her own sister .
She drifted off from conversations .
" I had to relearn everything , " she says .
" Who I was .
That I had kids .
I had to learn how to walk .
Then they had to put bracelets on my ankles because I wanted to escape . "
She returned home in December , with her father appointed as a temporary legal guardian .
One of the challenges facing her parents — along with taking care of toddlers who barely knew them , driving Jennifer to medical appointments , getting the older kids to and from school , visiting Alex at another hospital — was figuring out why the insurance company was n't paying her bills .
When she left her job at Children 's World , Jennifer had relinquished her group insurance , too .
Her two older daughters were covered by her first husband 's insurance , but she kept bugging Alex to get health insurance for them and the two youngest .
Tired of waiting , she 'd called an insurance agent named Jennifer Smith in May , five months before the accident , and had arranged a short - term policy for the family through Assurant Health , one of Time Insurance 's entities .
Assurant advertises short - term policies — with numerous exclusions and high deductibles — as gap coverage for people between jobs , using the slogan " because anything can happen . "
But those policies expire after six months , and Smith contacted Latham in August to urge her to replace the policy with a long - term one that would offer more benefits .
Just how and when the application got done remains a matter of some dispute , but a policy was soon issued for Jennifer , Eden and Jackson Latham .
( Alex Latham was excluded from the long - term policy , for reasons never clarified at trial . )
Yet it soon became apparent to the Shieldses that Assurant was refusing to process Jennifer 's medical bills , submitted by providers in the wake of the crash .
Shortly before Christmas , a letter arrived from Assurant underwriter Kathy Sellers , stating that a review of Jennifer 's medical records had revealed several pertinent items she had n't disclosed in her application , including a " uterine prolapse with surgical resolution discussed , " incontinence , an ER visit for shortness of breath and some " abnormal " diagnostic tests .
The letter stated that Latham had fifteen days to return a consent form , removing herself from coverage , or the company would revoke her children 's health insurance , too .
The letter did n't make much of an impression on Jennifer at the time ; still deep in the fog of her head injury , she was pleased at the idea that she'd be getting a check when the company refunded her premiums .
But the doctors had urged her parents to push Jennifer a bit , get her involved in " adult " decisions about her care .
On December 28 , she called Sellers to demand an explanation .
The call was recorded by Time .
" I have been turned down for being covered , and I do n't understand why , " she said .
Sellers started reading off the answers given on Latham 's application .
" I did n't fill that out , " Latham responded .
Sellers mentioned the uterine prolapse — a slipping or sagging of the uterus , a condition that 's not uncommon among women who've had vaginal delivery of several children .
" It does n't say anything about that in the application , " Latham said .
" My question to you is , is every single thing that ever happened to me in my life , I 'm supposed to record ? "
It was a short , awkward conversation , interrupted by howling kids and Jennifer shouting at someone , " Get away from that ! "
Sellers promised to send Latham a copy of her application .
The Shieldses showed the rescission letter to Marc Levy , the lawyer whom they and Alex 's parents had hired to try to deal with auto insurance issues surrounding the accident .
A veteran of insurance defense work , Levy was astounded .
He calls Sellers 's missive the " stupid , stupid , stupid letter , " a reference to a fatally callous insurance document in John Grisham 's The Rainmaker .
" I defend insurance companies for a living , and I was offended , " he says .
" Shocked , really , that any company would treat an insured that way .
My clients do n't do that . "
As Levy saw it , the letter offered his client something akin to Sophie 's Choice : Relinquish your contract or we 'll cut off your kids , too .
In Colorado , there are only two ways for a company like Time to legally rescind an insurance policy : Obtain a court order or the consent of your policyholder .
This looked like an attempt to bully Latham into consent .
And what were the stated reasons ?
An episode of incontinence ?
Shortness of breath ?
Were these conditions asked about on the application ?
Had she been diagnosed with some specific disorder ?
Even if she had , Colorado is an " intent " state , meaning that the company has to show the applicant intended to deceive the company rather than innocently omitted something .
A member of Levy 's firm wrote back to Sellers , asking for more information and more time to respond , given the holiday and Latham 's condition .
A response was promptly received , stating that the company is " currently conducting a review based on your appeal . "
A few days later , one of Latham 's medical providers called Time to find out if the company was going to reimburse a $ 70,000 bill that had been submitted .
That conversation was also recorded by the insurance company .
" The claim is here , " Time 's customer service rep said .
" There is a pre-existing investigation that has been opened . "
The rep hinted darkly about the patient 's " undisclosed medical history . "
When the provider asked if the bill was going to be paid , the rep let her know just how seriously the company was considering Latham 's appeal .
" It 's not going to be paid , " he snapped .
" I can guarantee you that . "
A New York native raised in Oklahoma , Marc Levy comes across as a born litigator , with an appetite for the contentiousness of the courtroom .
But as Jennifer Latham 's dispute with Time Insurance crept toward trial , her attorney recognized that the case was spiraling into a rarefied — and costly — level of conflict .
Levy had never seen a bad - faith case he considered quite as blatant as this one , or an opponent more doggedly determined to deny any wrongdoing .
" I think there 's a business model here , " Levy says .
" The insurance company knows that if they deny a hundred claims , 95 of those people are going to go away .
They know that five of them might consult with a lawyer , and that two or three of them might get a lawyer to take their case .
And they know they 're going to make it very expensive and protracted for those people to pursue their case . "
The two sides battled over records , venues and deposition schedules , resulting in numerous delays .
Time tried three times to get the case shifted from Boulder to federal court in Denver .
The last attempt came only a month before the trial was scheduled to begin and was rebuffed by Judge Richard Matsch , who drily observed that " the defendant 's motivation appears to be avoidance of unfavorable rulings and the trial date . "
The company 's strategy seemed to be to test how much the plaintiff was willing to spend to see her day in court .
But then , practically on the eve of trial , the defense made a surprising settlement offer .
It was a nice round number : one million dollars .
Another person would have jumped at the offer — particularly one in Latham 's lean circumstances , supporting four children on a monthly Social Security income of less than $ 1,700 .
Another attorney , having fronted umpteen hours and upwards of $ 80,000 in costs in a contingency case , would have twisted his client 's arm to take it .
But not Levy .
And not Latham .
She turned down the deal .
It was a lot of money in her world , all right , but so little for a company like this one .
She wanted people to know what Time Insurance had done .
How many people less fortunate than her had taken the money and been silenced ?
" You 're going to think I 'm a crazy girl , " she says now .
" But I feel I had a calling .
Be the change you want to see in the world — that 's what I am trying to do . "
Like a lot of trials , Latham v. Assurant was largely about documents and experts .
Time had based its decision to rescind the policy on three instances of medical care that the company 's post - claim review had uncovered .
In 2004 Latham had been seen at a local clinic for pelvic discomfort and told a physician 's assistant that " it feels like something is falling out . "
Six months later , she 'd gone back to the clinic complaining of shortness of breath ; she was referred to a hospital emergency room , which performed an EKG and other tests and released her .
Time 's attorneys contended that such information was exactly what its application requested when it asked whether " any proposed insured had any diagnosis of , received treatment for , or consulted with a physician concerning " a broad spectrum of medical conditions .
The clinic and hospital visits had n't been noted on the application , even though having an EKG " is not something you easily forget , " as defense attorney Ellis Mayer put it .
But Levy 's expert witnesses characterized the medical records as ambiguous , requiring more investigation than Time bothered to do .
John Grund , an attorney who 's co-authored textbooks on insurance law and usually testifies on behalf of insurance companies , told the jury that it was n't clear from the record that Latham had been diagnosed with uterine prolapse , let alone told that she needed surgery ; in any event , Time had excluded the condition from the policy even before the accident .
As for the ER visit , the record reported a " negative workup . "
Latham had been told she was having a panic attack and sent home ; small wonder that she would deny having any respiratory problems on the application form five months later .
Defense witnesses made much of a notation about an " abnormal " EKG , but there was no indication a doctor had reviewed that finding or that anyone had told Latham about it .
In some details , Time 's interpretation was just wrong .
In referring her case to the company 's rescission panel , the underwriter claimed that the ER records showed that Latham had responded to treatment with albuterol , a drug used for asthma .
Latham 's chart stated no response to albuterol , suggesting that her shortness of breath was n't a respiratory issue .
In Grund 's opinion , Time 's review of the records was skewed toward rescission , and its appeal process was a " sham . "
The phone call from Latham to Sellers , which was played for the jury , should have triggered a more careful review of her health history .
" If you 're taking the position that she intentionally misrepresented material facts , " Grund said , " this [ call ] suggests something to the contrary .
You 've got to investigate it .
They did nothing . "
Yet documents and experts could only take the case so far .
In the end , the case hinged on whether Latham was more credible than the witnesses from Time .
Levy did his best to introduce the jury to the impassive , bean - counting corporate culture he'd been battling for four years .
He played the phone call from the customer service rep who " guaranteed " Latham 's bills would n't be paid .
He played excerpts of Assurant president Don Hamm 's stumble before Congress .
He introduced evidence that company officials had done so many rescissions the week Latham lost her insurance — 109 in two hours , about 68 seconds apiece — that they had to schedule three cases , including Latham's , for the following day and had no specific memory of her situation at all .
Insurance agent Jennifer Smith testified that she read the questions on the application verbatim to Latham .
Latham insisted that Smith asked very general questions , without all the detail found in the application , and filled out the form for her .
Uterine prolapse was never mentioned .
" She asked if I had reproductive problems , " Latham said .
" We laughed because I had all these kids . "
In a deposition taken in another lawsuit , a Time employee said that the application questions usually are n't asked verbatim but in " a little more customer - friendly " manner .
A transcript of an application interview produced in that same case shows the question about " reproductive problems " being posed the same way that Latham says she was asked about it .
Tugging on a canary - yellow sweater and straining to focus on Levy 's questions , Latham insisted she did n't knowingly mislead anyone .
" I may be silly , I may be stupid , I may be naive , but I 'm not a liar , " she said from the witness stand .
" I try to live my life in a certain way .... I was a teacher of little kids . "
" What 's life like without health insurance ? "
Levy asked .
" Life is hard .
I cry a lot .
A lot of specialists do n't take Medicaid .
If they do , they say they do n't have any space available .
It 's the first thing they ask about : insurance . "
Time 's legal team was led by Robert Walker and Walter Wilson , two attorneys from a prominent Mississippi defense firm .
Walker aspired to a certain Southern delicacy in his cross-examination of Latham , but the performance seemed lost on a Boulder jury .
He asked if a doctor had examined her " female regions " during her 2004 clinic visit , and you could almost smell the magnolias bursting into bloom .
But Walker 's cross had its missteps , too .
He asked Latham to read aloud a passage from her deposition .
As she began to stumble over the words , he hastily retrieved the document — but not before the incident brought home to the jury how the accident had made reading an arduous chore .
Walker seemed puzzled that she 'd managed to maintain auto insurance — for a van with bald tires donated by a local charity — while having no health insurance .
He established that her medical bills had eventually been paid out of funds extracted from insurance on the rented truck that hit her and her own auto coverage , as if that made up for any alleged breach of contract by his company .
But if Latham emerged unscathed in cross-examination , the same could not be said of Time 's highest - ranking witness , Darinka Sever .
An eighteen - year veteran of the company , the manager who oversees the rescission process , Sever was the embodiment of Time 's corporate spirit : bland but unyielding , fond of razor - thin distinctions of language rarely found outside an underwriting manual , and utterly fixated on the bottom line .
Sever defended the rescission of Latham 's policy to the bitter end .
There was no need to call Latham or her insurance agent or even her doctor before revoking her insurance , she testified : " The records were pretty clear . "
Had Time known about the ER visit for shortness of breath , the policy would never have been issued , she said .
Levy asked her if the company had ever bothered to process Latham 's appeal .
The policyholder never appealed the decision , Sever insisted .
Incredulous , Levy asked about the letters he'd received stating that the company was " conducting a review based on your appeal . "
Form letters , Sever said .
There was no appeal .
What about Jennifer Latham 's phone call ?
Was n't that a request for an appeal ?
What about the letter from Levy 's office asking for more time ?
" The letter from your office is a request for information , not an appeal , " Sever said .
The company had done nothing wrong .
Not when it started telling medical providers the policy was no longer in effect , a day after notifying Latham of its intent to rescind .
Not when it sent Latham a form letter asking for details of the accident six months after rescinding the policy .
Not even when it sent her the stupid , stupid , stupid letter , offering to keep her children insured if she would immediately consent to what was , in effect , financial ruin .
" We gave them the opportunity to at least keep the kids on the plan , " Sever said .
" It 's not a process to trick anyone . "
When not on the stand , Sever sat at the defense table , consulting with Time 's attorneys .
By the time the trial was over , jurors had come up with their own nickname for the unemotional , all - business , gray - haired manager .
They called her Cruella .
This is a big day for Jennifer Latham , " Levy told the jurors at the start of his closing argument .
" This is , in fact , her appeal .
After four years , we finally got here . "
He called Time 's rescission panel a " star chamber " and wondered how any process so relentless — more than a hundred rescissions in two hours — could be described as a " fair and thorough " review .
Since " the only regard Time has is for numbers , " he had a few numbers of his own .
By his calculations , the company had saved $ 116,000 per work day over five years by taking away customers ' health insurance .
He asked for $ 2 million in economic damages and $ 5 million in punitive damages against the company .
" We think health insurance should be about the people they promise to insure , the people they promise to take care of , " he said .
" You people are the last hope ....
Please process our appeal . "
Defense attorney Walter Wilson said that the application asked questions " in plain English " that required Latham to disclose the ER visit and list her uterine prolapse under " disorder of the reproductive organs . "
He denied that his client was calling Jennifer Latham a liar .
" Time is saying Ms. Latham knowingly misrepresented her health information , " he said — a distinction that seemed to elude everyone but the defense team .
Wilson played for the jury once more the phone call Latham had made two months after the accident , asking why she was being refused coverage .
He apparently was trying to persuade the group that " Time was never told that Ms. Latham wanted a review of her claim . "
But the sound of a frustrated , badly injured woman pleading with a blasé underwriter seemed to have the opposite effect on the jury .
( " I 'm glad they played that the last day , " juror Denise Kaatz told Westword the day after the verdict .
" Hearing that again made me even more confident that she was n't trying to deceive or lie . " )
As for the $ 150 million Time supposedly saved through rescissions , the sum was a " nebulous concept , " Wilson argued .
So was Latham's " alleged emotional distress " from losing her health insurance .
The evidence that his company had anything to do with the suffering inflicted on her and her children was " scant at best , non-existent in reality . "
That was too much for Latham 's father , Jim Shields , who abruptly stood up in the back row .
" You can go to hell on that , mister , " he said , and stormed out of the courtroom .
After the jury departed for deliberations , Wilson asked for a mistrial .
Shields 's outburst had " visibly upset " two female jurors , he claimed , and since four of the six were women , he did n't see how his company could get a fair shake .
But Judge Roxanne Bailin had polled the jurors about Shields 's expression of concern for the fate of the defense attorney 's soul , and all had said that it would n't influence their decision .
The judge denied the motion .
Levy had urged the jurors to send a message loud enough " so that Milwaukee can hear you . "
Six hours later , they came back with a verdict that was much , much louder than he had anticipated .
The jury decided that Time had breached its contract with Latham and owed her $ 183,551 for her medical bills .
And $ 7.3 million for emotional distress .
And $ 2 million for economic damages resulting from bad faith , plus additional sums for her children 's future medical expenses , economic damages , non-economic damages — all told , the package of punitive and compensatory damages totaled $ 37.3 million , one of the largest bad - faith judgments in Colorado history .
Latham turned to Levy , tears in her eyes .
" Maybe this will change the way they do business , " she said .
Some jurors wanted to give her even more .
Foreman Dan Vela was in favor of awarding $ 150 million as a way of punishing Time .
" They did n't have a leg to stand on , " says Vela , a general manager for a gutter company .
" I hope we sent a message back to them that this was wrong . "
" Most of their witnesses seemed dishonest , defensive and just showed a basic lack of humanity , " says Kaatz , a production manager for an apparel company .
" It was kind of frightening . "
Through a spokesman , Time officials declined interview requests .
Several days later , the company issued a terse statement : " While we cannot discuss the specifics of this case , we disagree strongly with the verdict and will vigorously pursue post - trial motions and appeals . "
Latham 's staggering award could be reduced or nullified on appeal .
But under Colorado law , the punitive damages could also be increased if Judge Bailin finds that the company continued to engage in harmful conduct " in a willful and wanton manner " or aggravated the damages in the way it litigated the case .
It could take years to resolve the matter , and Latham does n't expect her life to change dramatically in the near future .
When she told her six - year - old son about the verdict , his response was , " Now we can buy all the gas we want , Mom . "
Her own reaction to the nebulous concept of $ 37 million is similar .
" My mind does n't go that big , " she says .
" The day - to - day activities of being a grownup are hard for me .
If I have any money , I spend it .
I do n't mean to .
I lose it .
It just goes away .
I used to be really good with money . "
In the aftermath of the accident , she was extremely angry about losing her insurance .
But over time she learned that " you can live in anger or you can live in peace . "
The same thing goes for the man who plowed into her and Alex ; she does n't know his name , but she would like to meet him some day .
What 's important to her is not the terrible times she endured getting to the courtroom , but where she finally arrived , the place she knew she would be all along .
" I feel vindicated , " she says .
" I feel like maybe I am going to be changing things . "

Please name them in the comments , and explain why .
Undergraduate women who join a sorority are more likely to judge their own bodies from an outsider 's perspective ( known as self - objectification ) and display higher levels of bulimic attitudes and behaviors than those who do not take part in the sorority 's recruitment process .
Over time , those women who join the group also show higher levels of body shame .
These findings , part of Ashley Marie Rolnik 's senior honors thesis at Northwestern University in the US , are published online in Springer 's journal Sex Roles .
On college campuses across the US , thousands of women join sororities every year through a structured recruitment process -- the sorority rush .
Although these sisterhoods provide college women with opportunities for personal growth and enrichment , they have been criticized for their potential to lead their members to focus excessively and unhealthily on their appearance .
Rolnik 's study is the first to test objectification theory ( which links self - objectification to body dissatisfaction and shame , eating disorders and associated behaviors ) outside the laboratory in a real - life context .
They surveyed 127 first - year college women aged 17 - 20 years at a US Midwestern University to investigate the relationship between participation in a sorority rush , self - objectification , and eating disorder behaviors .
The students were split into two groups : those who went through the recruitment process and joined the sorority , and those who did not take part in any aspect of the rush .
At four different time points ( before the rush ; a few days into the rush ; on the day the bids to join are received ; and one month after the rush ) , participants completed online questionnaires .
Levels of self - objectification and disordered eating behaviors were higher among rush participants than among women who did not take part , throughout the study period .
A month after the rush , new members also displayed higher levels of body shame .
Those women with higher body weights were more likely to drop out of the rush process and feel dissatisfied with it , even though those who dropped out were not overweight but simply less thin than those who joined the sorority .
These findings suggest that sorority membership may exacerbate pre-existing , problematic attitudes and behaviors .
The authors conclude : " Interventions aimed at reducing sorority women 's focus on physical appearance may hold promise as one of the many routes to addressing body image disturbance and eating disorders among sorority members .
As sororities are very powerful at influencing the norms and ideals of their members , a move away from a focus on appearance and towards a set of norms that encourages healthy eating habits and more positive approaches to body image has real potential . "
If you 're a huge space buff , you might not be surprised by anything in this video tour of the International Space Station .
But it 's still great to just get a simple walkthrough of this incredible project and all its corners
Earlier today the CFTC held a sham hearing in which , among other things , the organization discussed position limits in PM speculation , because , you know , it 's the mom and pop speculators that destroy the precious metal market ( not JP Morgan or the New York Fed mind you ) .
The hearing could not have come at a more opportune time .
GATA has just broken a major story , in which a London metals trader - slash - whistleblower exposes JP Morgan 's silver price suppression / manipulation scheme .
At this point none of this should be at all shocking , and the only thing that matters is when CFTC 's ex-Goldmanite Gary Gensler will be fired for allowing hundreds of billions of dollars to be sucked out of the PM market on behalf of such major market manipulating entities as JP Morgan and the New York Federal Reserve , for whom it transacts .
Do n't worry - the answer to that rhetorical question is " never " , as it is the administration 's goal to make all the millionaires among the bulge bracket firms billionaires , via legalized theft from honest investors .
Furthermore , if indeed the CFTC is complicit in these manipulative events , as GATA suggest , we hope our objective mainstream media readers enjoin GATA in seeking justice for this criminal breach of proper regulatory enforcement .
From GATA :
Additional Statement by Bill Murphy , Chairman
Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee
to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Washington , D.C. , March 25 , 2010
On March 23 , 2010 , GATA Director Adrian Douglas was contacted by a whistleblower by the name of Andrew Maguire .
Maguire is a metals trader in London .
He has been told first - hand by traders working for JPMorganChase that JPMorganChase manipulates the precious metals markets , and they have bragged to how they make money doing so .
In November 2009 Maguire contacted the CFTC enforcement division to report this criminal activity .
He described in detail the way JPMorgan Chase signals to the market its intention to take down the precious metals .
Traders recognize these signals and make money shorting the metals alongside JPM .
Maguire explained how there are routine market manipulations at the time of option expiry , non -farm payroll data releases , and COMEX contract rollover , as well as ad - hoc events .
On February 3 Maguire gave two days ' warning by e-mail to Eliud Ramirez , a senior investigator for the CFTC's Enforcement Division , that the precious metals would be attacked upon the release of the non-farm payroll data on February 5 .
On February 5 , as market events played out exactly as predicted , further e-mails were sent to Ramirez while the manipulation was in progress .
It would not be possible to predict such a market move unless the market was manipulated .
In an e-mail on February 5 Maguire wrote : " It is common knowledge here in London among the metals traders that it is JPM 's intent to flush out and cover as many shorts as possible prior to any discussion in March about position limits .
I feel sorry for all those not in this loop .
A serious amount of money was made and lost today and in my opinion as a result of the CFTC 's allowing by your own definition an illegal concentrated and manipulative position to continue . "
Expiry of the COMEX April call options is tomorrow , March 26 .
There was large open interest in strikes from $ 1,100 to $ 1,150 in gold .
As always happens month after month , HSBC and JPM sell short in large quantities to overwhelm all bids and make unsuspecting option holders lose their money .
As predicted by GATA , the manipulation started on March 19 , when gold was trading at $ 1,126 .
Last night it traded at $ 1,085 .
This is how much the gold cartel fears the CFTC 's enforcement division .
They thumb their noses at you because in more than a decade of complaints and 18 months of a silver market manipulation investigation nothing has been done to stop them .
And this is why JPM 's cocky and arrogant traders in London are able to brag that they manipulate the market .
This is an outrage and we are making available to the press the e-mails from Maguire wherein he warns of a manipulative event .
Additionally Maguire informed us that he has tape recordings of his telephone communications with the CFTC , which we are taking the appropriate legal steps to acquire .

Dear Mr. Ramirez :
I thought you might be interested in looking into the silver trading today .
It was a good example of how a single seller , when they hold such a concentrated position in the very small silver market , can instigate a selloff at will .
These events trade to a regular pattern and we see orchestrated selling occur 100 % of the time at options expiry , contract rollover , non -farm payrolls ( no matter if the news is bullish or bearish ) , and in a lesser way at the daily silver fix .
I have attached a small presentation to illustrate some of these events .
I have included gold , as the same traders to a lesser extent hold a controlling position there too .
Please ignore the last few slides as they were part of a training session I was holding for new traders .
I brought to your attention during our meeting how we traders look for the " signals " they ( JPMorgan ) send just prior to a big move .
I saw the first signals early in Asia in thin volume .
As traders we profited from this information but that is not the point as I do not like to operate in a rigged market and what is in reality a crime in progress .
As an example , if you look at the trades just before the pit open today you will see around 1,500 contracts sell all at once where the bids were tiny by comparison in the fives and tens .
This has the immediate effect of gaining $ 2,500 per contract on the short positions against the long holders , who lost that in moments and likely were stopped out .
Perhaps look for yourselves into who was behind the trades at that time and note that within that 10 - minute period 2,800 contracts hit all the bids to overcome them .
This is hardly how a normal trader gets the best price when selling a commodity .
Note silver instigated a rapid move lower in both precious metals .
This kind of trading can occur only when a market is being controlled by a single trading entity .
I have a lot of captured data illustrating just about every price takedown since JPMorgan took over the Bear Stearns short silver position .
I am sure you are in a better position to look into the exact details .
It is my wish just to bring more information to your attention to assist you in putting a stop to this criminal activity .
Kind regards ,
Andrew Maguire

Dear Mr. Ramirez ,
Thanks for your response .
Thought it may be helpful to your investigation if I gave you the heads up for a manipulative event signaled for Friday , 5th Feb .
The non -farm payrolls number will be announced at 8.30 ET .
There will be one of two scenarios occurring , and both will result in silver ( and gold ) being taken down with a wave of short selling designed to take out obvious support levels and trip stops below .
While I will no doubt be able to profit from this upcoming trade , it is an example of just how easy it is to manipulate a market if a concentrated position is allowed by a very small group of traders .
I sent you a slide of a couple of past examples of just how this will play out .
Scenario 1 .
The news is bad ( employment is worse ) .
This will have a bullish effect on gold and silver as the U.S. dollar weakens and the precious metals draw bids , spiking them higher .
This will be sold into within a very short time ( 1 - 5 mins ) with thousands of new short contracts being added , overcoming any new bids and spiking the precious metals down hard , targeting key technical support levels .
Scenario 2 .
The news is good ( employment is better than expected ) .
This will result in a massive short position being instigated almost immediately with no move up .
This will not initially be liquidation of long positions but will result in stops being triggered , again targeting key support levels .
Both scenarios will spell an attempt by the two main short holders to illegally drive the market down and reap very large profits .
Locals such as myself will be " invited " on board , which will further add downward pressure .
The question I would expect you might ask is :
Who is behind the sudden selling and is it the entity / entities holding a concentrated position ?
How is it possible for me to know what will occur days before it will happen ?
Only if a market is manipulated could this possibly occur .
I would ask you watch the " market depth " live as this event occurs and tag who instigates the move .
This would surly help you to pose questions to the parties involved .
This kind of " not - for - profit selling " will end badly and risks the integrity of the COMEX and OTC markets .
I am aware that physical buyers in large size are awaiting this event to scoop up as much " discounted " gold and silver as possible .
These are sophisticated entities , mainly foreign , who know how to play the short sellers and turn this paper gold into real delivered physical .
Given that the OTC market ( where a lot of the selling occurs ) runs on a fractional reserve basis and is not backed up by 1 - 1 physical gold , this leveraged short selling , where ownership of each ounce of gold has multi claims , poses a very large risk .
I leave this with you , but if you need anything from me that might help you in your investigation I would be pleased to help .
Kind regards ,
Andrew T. Maguire

If you get this in a timely manner , with silver at 15.330 post data , I would suggest you look at who is adding short contracts in the silver contract while gold still rises after NFP data .
It is undoubtedly the concentrated short who has " walked silver down " since Wednesday , putting large blocks in the way of bids .
This is clear manipulation as the long holders who have been liquidated are matched by new short selling as open interest is rising during the decline .
There should be no reason for this to be occurring other than controlling silver 's rise .
There is an intent to drive silver through the 15 level stops before buying them back after flushing out the long holders .
Regards ,
Andrew

A final e-mail to confirm that the silver manipulation was a great success and played out EXACTLY to plan as predicted yesterday .
How would this be possible if the silver market was not in the full control of the parties we discussed in our phone interview ?
I have honored my commitment not to publicize our discussions .
I hope you took note of how and who added the short sales ( I certainly have a copy ) and I am certain you will find it is the same concentrated shorts who have been in full control since JPM took over the Bear Stearns position .
It is common knowledge here in London among the metals traders that it is JPM 's intent to flush out and cover as many shorts as possible prior to any discussion in March about position limits .
I feel sorry for all those not in this loop .
A serious amount of money was made and lost today and in my opinion as a result of the CFTC 's allowing by your own definition an illegal concentrated and manipulative position to continue .
Bart , you made reference to it at the energy meeting .
Even if the level is in dispute , what is not disputed is that it exists .
Surely some discussions should have taken place between the parties by now .
Obviously they feel they can act with impunity .
If I can compile the data , then the CFTC should be able to too .
I would think this is an embarrassment to you as regulators .
Hoping to get your acknowledgement .
Kind regards ,
Andrew T. Maguire

Just logging off here in London .
Final note .
Now that gold is undergoing short covering , please look at market depth right now in silver and evidence the large selling blocks in a thin market being put in the way of silver regaining the technical 15 level , which would cause a short covering rally and new longs being instigated .
This is resulting in the gold - silver ratio being stretched to ridiculous levels .
I hope this day has given you an example of how silver is " managed " and gives you something more to work with .
If this was long manipulation in , say , the energy market , the shoe would be on the other foot , I suspect .
Have a good weekend .
Andrew

Dear Mr. Ramirez ,
I had n't received any acknowledgement from you regarding the series of e-mails sent by me last week warning you of the planned market manipulation that would occur in silver and gold a full two days prior to the non-farm payrolls data release .
My objective was to give you something in advance to watch , log , and follow up in your market manipulation investigation .
You will note that the huge footprints left by the two concentrated large shorts were obvious and easily identifiable .
You have the data .
The signals I identified ahead of the intended short selling event were clear .
The " live " action I sent you 41 minutes after the trigger event predicting the next imminent move also played out within minutes and exactly as I outlined .
Surely you must at least be somewhat mystified that a market move could be forecast with such accuracy if it was free trading .
All you have to do is identify the large seller and if it is the concentrated short shown in the bank participation report , bring them to task for market manipulation .
I have honored my commitment to assist you and keep any information we discuss private , however if you are going to ignore my information I will deem that commitment to have expired .
All I ask is that you acknowledge receipt of my information .
The rest I leave in your good hands .
Respectfully yours ,
Andrew T. Maguire

Good afternoon , Mr. Maguire ,
I have received and reviewed your email communications .
Thank you so very much for your observations .

A hysteria of sorts has been generated by reports that some of China 's products lack quality control .
Some cat food has been tainted .
A few cell phone batteries have blown up .
Cough syrup contained stuff that makes you sick .
And so on .
In response , the Chinese government actually executed its regulatory head of food and product safety , Zheng Xiaoyu .
How very strange this last point is !
In the West , we long ago gave up the idea that these people are actually supposed to carry out their jobs and should be personally responsible for their failure to do so .
What is most striking about these criticisms is how historically insular they appear in light of the modern history of China .
This is a subject that is deeply painful , horrifying in its detail , highly instructive in helping us understand politics — and also puts into perspective these reports of recent troubles in China .
It 's a scandal , in fact , that few Westerners are even aware , or , if they are aware , they are not conscious , of the bloody reality that prevailed in China between the years 1949 and 1976 , the years of communist rule by Mao Zedong .
How many died as a result of persecutions and the policies of Mao ?
Perhaps you care to guess ?
Many people over the years have attempted to guess .
But they have always underestimated .
As more data rolled in during the 1980s and 1990s , and specialists have devoted themselves to investigations and estimates , the figures have become ever more reliable .
And yet they remain imprecise .
What kind of error term are we talking about ?
It could be as low as 40 million .
It could be as high as 100 million or more .
In the Great Leap Forward from 1959 to 1961 alone , figures range between 20 million to 75 million .
In the period before , 20 million .
In the period after , tens of millions more .
As scholars in the area of mass death point out , most of us can't imagine 100 dead or 1000 .
Above that , we are just talking about statistics : they have no conceptual meaning for us , and it becomes a numbers game that distracts us from the horror itself .
And there is only so much ghastly information that our brains can absorb , only so much blood we can imagine .
And yet there is more to why China 's communist experiment remains a hidden fact : it makes a decisive case against government power , one even more compelling than the cases of Russia or Germany in the 20th century .
The horror was foreshadowed in a bloody civil war following the Second World War .
After some nine million people died , the communists emerged victorious in 1949 , with Mao as the ruler .
The land of Lao - Tzu ( rhyme , rhythm , peace ) , Taoism ( compassion , moderation , humility ) , and Confucianism ( piety , social harmony , individual development ) was seized by the strangest import to China ever : Marxism from Germany via Russia .
It was an ideology that denied all logic , experience , economic law , property rights , and limits on the power of the state on grounds that these notions were merely bourgeois prejudices , and what we needed to transformed society was a cadre with all power to transform all things .
It 's bizarre to think about it , really : posters of Marx and Lenin in China , of all places , and rule by an ideology of robbery , dictatorship , and death that did not come to an end until 1976 .
So spectacular has the transformation been in the last 25 years that one would hardly know that any of this ever happened , except that the Communist Party is still running the place while having tossed out the communist part .
The experiment began in the most bloody way possible following the second world war , when all Western eyes were focused on matters at home and , to the extent there was any foreign focus , it was on Russia .
The " good guys " had won the war in China , or so we were led to believe in times when communism was the fashion .
The communization of China took place in the usual three stages : purge , plan , and scapegoat .
First there was the purge to bring about communism .
There were guerillas to kill and land to nationalize .
The churches had to be destroyed .
The counterrevolutionaries had to be put down .
The violence began in the country and spread later to the cities .
All peasants were first divided into four classes that were considered politically acceptable : poor , semi poor , average , and rich .
Everyone else was considered a landowner and targeted for elimination .
If no landowners could be found , the " rich " were often included in this group .
The demonized class was ferreted out in a country - wide series of " bitterness meetings " in which people turned in their neighbors for owning property and being politically disloyal .
Those who were so deemed were immediately executed along with those who sympathized with them .
The rule was that there had to be at least one person killed per village .
The numbers killed is estimated to be between one and five million .
In addition , another four to six million landowners were slaughtered for the crime of being capital owners .
If anyone was suspected of hiding wealth , he or she was tortured with hot irons to confess .
The families of the killed were then tortured and the graves of their ancestors looted and pillaged .
What happened to the land ?
It was divided into tiny plots and distributed among the remaining peasants .
Then the campaign moved to the cities .
The political motivations here were at the forefront , but there were also behavioral controls .
Anyone who was suspected of involvement in prostitution , gambling , tax evasion , lying , fraud , opium dealing , or telling state secrets was executed as a " bandit . "
Official estimates put the number of dead at two million with another two million going to prison to die .
Resident committees of political loyalists watched every move .
A nighttime visit to another person was immediately reported and the parties involved jailed or killed .
The cells in the prisons themselves grew ever smaller , with one person living in a space of about 14 inches .
Some prisoners were worked to death , and anyone involved in a revolt was herded with collaborators and they were all burned .
There was industry in the cities , but those who owned and managed them were subjected to ever tighter restrictions : forced transparency , constant scrutiny , crippling taxes , and pressure to offer up their businesses for collectivization .
There were many suicides among the small - and medium - sized business owners who saw the writing on the wall .
Joining the party provided only temporary respite , since 1955 began the campaign against hidden counterrevolutionaries in the party itself .
A principle here was that one in ten party members was a secret traitor .
As the rivers of blood rose ever higher , Mao brought about the Hundred Flowers Campaign in two months of 1957 , the legacy of which is the phrase we often hear : " Let a hundred flowers bloom . "
People were encouraged to speak freely and give their point of view , an opportunity that was very tempting for intellectuals .
The liberalization was short lived .
In fact , it was a trick .
All those who spoke out against what was happening to China were rounded up and imprisoned , perhaps between 400,000 and 700,000 people , including 10 percent of the well - educated classes .
Others were branded as right wingers and subjected to interrogation , reeducation , kicked out of their homes , and shunned .
But this was nothing compared with phase two , which was one of history 's great central planning catastrophes .
Following collectivization of land , Mao decided to go further to dictate to the peasants what they would grow , how they would grow it , and where they would ship it , or whether they would grow anything at all as versus plunge into industry .
This would become the Great Leap Forward that would generate history 's most deadly famine .
Peasants were grouped into groups of thousands and forced to share all things .
All groups were to be economically self - sufficient .
Production goals were raised ever higher .
People were moved by the hundreds of thousands from where production was high to where it was low , as a means of boosting production .
They were moved too from agriculture to industry .
There was a massive campaign to collect tools and transform them into industrial skill .
As a means of showing hope for the future , collectives were encouraged to have huge banquets and eat everything , especially meat .
This was a way of showing one 's belief that the next year 's harvest would be even more bountiful .
Mao had this idea that he knew how to grow grain .
He proclaimed that " seeds are happiest when growing together " and so seeds were sown at five to ten times their usual density .
Plants died , the soil dried out , and the salt rose to the surface .
To keep birds from eating grain , sparrows were wiped out , which vastly increased the number of parasites .
Erosion and flooding became endemic .
Tea plantations were turned to rice fields , on grounds that tea was decadent and capitalistic .
Hydraulic equipment built to service the new collective farms did n't work and lacked any replacement parts .
This led Mao to put new emphasis on industry , which was forced to appear in the same areas as agriculture , leading to ever more chaos .
Workers were drafted from one sector to another , and mandatory cuts in some sectors was balanced by mandatory high quotas in another .
In 1957 , the disaster was everywhere .
Workers were growing too weak even to harvest their meager crops , so they died watching the rice rot .
Industry churned and churned but produced nothing of any use .
The government responded by telling people that fat and proteins were unnecessary .
But the famine could n't be denied .
The black - market price of rice rose 20 to 30 times .
Because trade had been forbidden between collectives ( self - sufficiency , you know ) , millions were left to starve .
By 1960 , the death rate soared from 15 percent to 68 percent , and the birth rate plummeted .
Anyone caught hoarding grain was shot .
Peasants found with the smallest amount were imprisoned .
Fires were banned .
Funerals were prohibited as wasteful .
Villagers who tried to flee the countryside to the city were shot at the gates .
Deaths from hunger reached 50 percent in some villages .
Survivors boiled grass and bark to make soup and wandered the roads looking for food .
Sometimes they banded together and raided houses looking for ground maize .
Women were unable to conceive because of malnutrition .
People in work camps were used for food experiments that led to sickness and death .
How bad did it get ?
In 1968 an 18 - year - old member of the Red Guard , Wei Jingsheng , took refuge with a family in a village of Anhui , and here he lived to write about what he saw :
" We walked along beside the village …
Before my eyes , among the weeds , rose up one of the scenes I had been told about , one of the banquets at which the families had swapped children in order to eat them .
I could see the worried faces of the families as they chewed the flesh of other people 's children .
The children who were chasing butterflies in a nearby field seemed to be the reincarnation of the children devoured by their parents .
I felt sorry for the children but not as sorry as I felt for their parents .
What had made them swallow that human flesh , amidst the tears and grief of others — flesh that they would never have imagined tasting , even in their worst nightmares ? "
The author of this passage was jailed as a traitor but his status protected him from death and he was finally released in 1997 .
How many people died in the famine of 1959 – 61 ?
The low range is 20 million .
The high range is 43 million .
Finally in 1961 , the government gave in and permitted food imports , but it was too little and too late .
Some peasants were again allowed to grow crops on their own land .
A few private workshops were opened .
Some markets were permitted .
Finally , the famine began to abate and production grew .
But then the third phase came : scapegoating .
What had caused the calamity ?
The official reason was anything but communism , anything but Mao .
And so the politically motivated roundup began again , and here we get the very heart of the Culture Revolution .
Thousands of camps and detention centers were opened .
People sent there died there .
In prison , the slightest excuse was used to dispense with people — all to the good , since the prisoners were a drain on the system , so far as those in charge were concerned .
The largest penal system ever built was organized in a military fashion , with some camps holding as many as 50,000 people .
There was some sense in which everyone was in prison .
Arrests were sweeping and indiscriminate .
Everyone had to carry around a copy of Mao's Little Red Book .
To question the reason for arrest was itself evidence of disloyalty , since the state was infallible .
Once arrested , the safest path was instant and frequent confession .
Guards were forbidden from using overt violence , so interrogations would go on for hundreds of hours , and often the prisoner would die during this process .
Those named in the confession were then hunted down and rounded up .
Once you got through this process , you were sent to a labor camp , where you were graded according to how many hours you could work with little food .
You were fed no meat nor given any sugar or oil .
Labor prisoners were further controlled by the rationing of the little food they had .
The final phase of this incredible litany of criminality lasted from 1966 to 1976 , during which the number killed fell dramatically to " only " one to three million .
The government , now tired and in the first stages of demoralization , began to lose control , first within the labor camps and then in the countryside .
And it was this weakening that led to the final , and in some ways the most vicious , of the communist periods in China 's history .
The first stages of rebellion occurred in the only way permissible : people began to criticize the government for being too soft and too uncommitted to the communist goal .
Ironically , this began to appear precisely as moderation became more overt in Russia .
Neo-revolutionaries in the Red Guard began to criticize the Chinese communists as " Khrushchev - like reformers . "
As one writer put it , the guard " rose up against its own government in order to defend it . "
During this period , the personality cult of Mao reached it height , with the Little Red Book achieving a mythic status .
The Red Guards roamed the country in an attempt to purge the Four Old - Fashioned Things : ideas , culture , customs , and habits .
The remaining temples were barricaded .
Traditional opera was banned , with all costumes and sets in the Beijing Opera burned .
Monks were expelled .
The calendar was changed .
All Christianity was banned .
There were to be no pets such as cats and birds .
Humiliation was the order of the day .
Thus was the Red Terror : in the capital city , there were 1,700 deaths and 84,000 people were run out .
In other cities such as Shanghai , the figures were worse .
A massive party purge began , with hundreds of thousands arrested and many murdered .
Artists , writers , teachers , scientists , technicians : all were targets .
Pogroms were visited on community after community , with Mao approving at every step as a means of eliminating every possible political rival .
But underneath , the government was splintering and cracking , even as it became ever more brutal and totalitarian in its outlook .
Finally in 1976 , Mao died .
Within a few months , his closest advisers were all imprisoned .
And the reform began slowly at first and then at breakneck speed .
Civil liberties were restored ( comparatively ) and the rehabilitations began .
Torturers were prosecuted .
Economic controls were gradually relaxed .
The economy , by virtue of human and private economic initiative , was transformed .
Having read the above , you are now in a tiny elite of people who know anything about the greatest death camp in the history of the world that China became between 1949 and 1976 , an experiment in total control unlike anything else in history .
Many more people today know more about China 's exploding cell - phone batteries than they do about the hundred million dead and the untold amount of suffering that occurred under communism .
When you hear about shoddy products coming from China or wheat poorly processed , imagine millions in famine , with parents swapping children to eat in order to stay alive .
And what do China 's critics today recommend ?
More control by the government .
Do n't tell me that we 've learned anything from history .
We do n't even know enough about history to learn from it .

Lord Of
The Rings prequel made by a fanatic using her £ 25,000 life savings scores 500,000 views on the internet
She did n't have Peter Jackson 's £ 200 million budget , eight years of filming time or the spectacular scenery of New Zealand to work with .
But Kate Madison could match his boundless passion - and with it managed to make her own Lord Of The Rings film .
The amateur actress was so inspired by the blockbuster Rings trilogy created by Jackson she wrote , directed and produced a prequel based on material from the original JRR Tolkien books .

Her hour - long movie Born Of Hope , made on a budget of just £ 25,000 , is already a success , with more than 500,000 people viewing it for free on the internet .
Miss Madison , 31 , from Cambridge , said that watching the trilogy had blown her mind .
' The battle scenes and the array of incredible characters really inspired me and I was desperate to have a go at making an epic myself , ' she said .

She put her £ 8,000 life savings into the project , worked as an office temp to gain extra cash and raised a further £ 17,000 by posting a trailer on YouTube appealing for donations .
She convinced more than 400 cast and crew to give their time for free , and played the part of Elgarain the forest ranger herself .
And over a year , starting in mid-2008 , she filmed Born Of Hope in locations around England .

Miss Madison said : ' There were times when it was cold and wet and we were up to our eyes in mud standing in the middle of a forest wondering if we could make this a success .
' But now it 's all done it 's an amazing feeling . '
Her story was based on two paragraphs Tolkien included in the appendix to his books , which mentioned the adventures of Arathorn and Gilraen , the parents of Aragorn , who was played in the Jackson films by Viggo Mortensen .
[ caption ]
It was shot in Epping Forest , Essex , and West Stow , Suffolk , after seeking permission from local authorities .
Christopher Dane , who plays Arathorn in the film alongside Beth Aynsley as his wife Gilraen , said the experience had been ' exhilarating ' .
The 45 - year - old actor from Muswell Hill , north London , added : ' It was brilliant fun and we have produced an entire film for less than Peter Jackson spent on breakfast for his cast while he was filming the original in New Zealand . '
Jackson 's first Lord Of The Rings film , The Fellowship Of The Ring , was released in 2001 , followed by The Two Towers in 2002 and The Return Of The King in 2003 .
They became among the most successful films of all time , grossing almost $ 3 billion between them .
Jackson is now collaborating with Mexican director Guillermo del Toro on a two - part adaptation of Tolkien 's The Hobbit , due for release in 2011 and 2012 .
I recently heard someone say the time has come for some civil disobedience and the intrusive nature of the Census makes it the perfect place to start .
I could not agree more .
The American people need to draw a line in the sand and tell the reprobates in the federal government we will no longer tolerate their usurpations of power .
If the American people are going make a stand and go toe to toe with the federal government , then they need a basic understanding of some constitutional principles because these principles are universal and pertain to every power exercised by the federal government .
Constitutional Principles
Principle No. 1 . The Constitution established a separation of power between the States and their federal government .
James Madison explained this principle in Federalist Essay No. 45 :
The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined .
Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite .
The former will be exercised principally on external objects , as war , peace , negotiation , and foreign commerce ; with which last the power of taxation will , for the most part , be connected .
The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs , concern the lives , liberties , and properties of the people ; and the internal order , improvement , and prosperity of the State .
The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger ; those of the State governments in times of peace and security .
On the Duty of Civil D... Thoreau , Henry David Best Price : $ 4.33 Buy New $ 3.99 ( as of 05:00 EST - Details )
In the New York State Convention debating ratification of the proposed constitution in 1788 , John Jay , who was one of the authors of the Federalist Essays and would later become a justice of the United States Supreme Court , expressed this principle as follows :
What are the objects of our state legislatures ?
Innumerable things of small moment occupy their attention ; matters of a private nature , which require much minute and local information .
The objects of the general government are not of this nature .
They comprehend the interests of the states in relation to each other , and in relation to foreign nations .
Thomas Jefferson discussed this principle in various writings throughout his political career .
In 1816 he wrote :
The way to have good and safe government is not to trust it all to one , but to divide it Let the national government be entrusted with the defense of the nation , and its foreign and federal relations ; the state governments with the civil rights , laws , police , and administration of what concerns the state generally
The best key for the solution of questions of power between our governments is the fact that every foreign and federal power is given to the federal government , and to the states every power purely domestic .
* * *
The federal is , in truth , our foreign government
The federal government was empowered to deal with foreign affairs and relations between the States while the States would concern themselves with domestic affairs .

The powers of the federal government are commonly known as delegated powers because when that government was established , the States delegated , not surrendered , a portion of their sovereign powers to the federal government .
The powers not delegated to the federal government are known as reserved powers .
Principle No. 2 . The Constitution established a federal government of limited enumerated powers .
Under this system of government , every power not granted to the federal government and enumerated in the Constitution is denied .
This principle is the foundation of the Constitution and exists independent of the Tenth Amendment .
That Amendment is merely a secondary level of restraint on the powers of the federal government .
In Federalist Essay No. 14 , James Madison wrote that adoption of the proposed constitution would not grant the federal government general legislative authority throughout the United States :
[ I]t is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws .
Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects
Alexander Hamilton addressed the principle of limited government in Federalist Essay No. 83 :
The plan of the convention declares that the power of Congress shall extend to certain enumerated cases .
This specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority , because an affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd , as well as useless , if a general authority was intended .

Wolfe , Claire Best Price : $ 14.10 Buy New $ 57.50 ( as of 03:45 EST - Details )
The federal government only exists within the sphere of its delegated powers and is constitutionally powerless to act absent a specific grant of power .
It should be noted that there are no implied powers beyond the delegated powers .
For example .
Congress has been granted  the power to establish post offices .
Therefore , Congress can pass any law necessary to the establishment and maintenance of post offices .
This would include such incidental powers such as printing stamps , affixing their value , appropriating money for postal trucks , etc .
Members of Congress constantly attempt to reverse this principle .
I have lost count of the number of times I have watched one of these clowns hold up a copy of the Constitution and claim their powers are unlimited except in those instances were the Constitution places a restriction on their power .
These individuals are either corrupt , incompetent , or both .
Principle No. 3 . Constitutionally , the federal government cannot use its delegated powers to encroach on the powers reserved to the States .
In other words , the federal government cannot convert its federal and foreign powers into domestic powers to do things not entrusted to that government , i.e. , use principle No. 2 to circumvent principle No. 1 .
Constitutional Provisions for the Census
The provision for the Census is found in Article I , Section 2 , Clause 3 of the Constitution .
It is confined to determining the number of Representatives [ in the House ] and imposing direct Taxes among the several States .
Representatives and direct
Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union , according to their respective Number The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States , and within every subsequent Term of ten Years , in such Manner as they shall by Law direct .
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
The reader will note the power to make laws concerning the Census is restricted to the actual enumeration . 
In the case of direct taxes ( a direct tax is a tax on property based on ownership ) , this provision requires Congress to apportion the tax among the individual States based on population .
For example .
Lets say in 1790 , two years after the ratification of the Constitution , Congress prepared a budget and decided to impose a direct tax to raise the needed revenue .
And , based on the Census , Virginia had 30 % of the population of the United States .
Under the rule of apportionment , Virginia would have been responsible for 30 % of the tax .
The States collect the tax and turn the money over to the federal government .
Direct taxes are inherently unfair because one State , with ten percent of the population , might be one of the richest States while another State , with the same percentage of the population , might be one of the poorest .
Yet , under the direct tax formula imposed by the Constitution , both States would be required to pay the same amount .
The Founders feared the use of direct taxes so they created a system to discourage their use .
Since direct taxes must be apportioned based on population , an enumeration is needed to determine the percentage of tax for each State .
The Federal Government Distorts the Purpose of the Census
On their web - page , the Census Bureau explains the purpose of the Census as follows :
The U.S. Constitution ( Article I , Section 2 ) mandates a headcount of everyone residing in the United States .
The population totals determine each states Congressional representation .
The numbers also affect funding in your community and help inform decision makers about how your community is changing .
The reader will note that the federal governments statement of purpose does not comport with the Article I , Section 2 , Clause 3 of the Constitution .
Since decisions about our communities are not within the class of powers granted to the federal government ( see constitutional principle No. 1 ) , the reader will not find a reference to it in the limited powers granted to the federal government ( see constitutional principle No. 2 ) .

HBO is attempting to drum up some additional business and exposure for The Pacific , the new 10 - part miniseries produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks who collaborated on HBO ’s Band of Brothers , by offering the first hour aka pilot to view for free online .
The pilot episode debuted just last night so it comes as somewhat of a surprise that HBO would dole it out online so soon .
Do n’t get too excited .
This is the only episode that will be available for free .
You will need to subscribe to HBO or wait for the Blu-ray Disc and DVD release to view the other nine .
The wait for The Pacific to arrive on home video may not be as long as you might think .
At the Atlanta premiere for the show , it was announced that The Pacific in its entirety would arrive on DVD ( and presumably Blu-ray ) Father ’s Day weekend ( via Blu-ray.com ) .
That would put its release date at June 15 .
Further corroborating the early arrival of The Pacific are active pre-order listings on HBO ’s online stores for the Blu-ray ( $ 99.98 ) and DVD ( $ 79.98 ) editions .
So watch The Pacific ’s pilot now and own it on Blu-ray in three month ’s time .
Sounds good to me !

Facebook appears to have directly contacted Australian administrators of Facebook Pages to remind them of tools available to moderate objectionable content within their sub-sections of the giant social networking site .
The company has recently come under increasing pressure from a number of parties in Australia to clean up its act .
For example , Queensland Premier Anna Bligh wrote to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in late February , appealing for help in blocking offensive material from being posted on memorial sites for Queensland girl Trinity Bates .
Shortly after , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he would investigate an idea being promoted by Sunrise and independent senator Nick Xenophon to setup an online ombudsman to deal with such complaints .
He said it was obvious which material went too far , and rejected any criticism that it was draconian to address offensive online material .
In a letter emailed to at least two administrators of a Facebook Page this week ( one seen by Delimiter and one other ) , Facebook said it was aware that Australians had used the site to rally around the tragic events surrounding the deaths of Elliot Fletcher and Trinity Bates .
“ Unfortunately , a few individuals demonstrated a complete lack of respect towards the families and friends of Trinity and Elliot and added inappropriate content to these pages , ” it said .
“ In light of these events , we wanted to remind you of the different options available to Page administrators to help you moderate the content on your Page . ”
Controls that Facebook Page administrators have access to include the ability to limit the types of content people can post on Facebook walls ( such as blocking videos and photos ) , removing individual pieces of content , or banning people that are abusive .
“ You can also always report people on the site by using the ‘ Report ’ buttons located on most pieces of content , but please remember that you have the ability to administer your Page as well , ” the note , from “ The Facebook Team ” said .
Delimiter has contacted Facebook ’s Australian public relations agency by email to ask for a comment and to verify the email is genuine .

Susan Franck , vice president of marketing for the chain , said she was intrigued about the four types of diners Mr. Rapp had identified .
The customers he calls “ Entrees ” do not want a lot of description , just the bottom line on what the dish is and how much it is going to cost .
“ Recipes , ” on the other hand , ask many questions and want to know as much as they can about the ingredients .
“ Barbecues ” share food and like chatty servers who wear name tags .
“ Desserts ” are trendy people who want to order trendy things .
“ We ca n’t do much of a price increase , yet we ’re searching for ways to increase our profit for the franchises , ” Ms. Franck said .
“ If you have a signature item , make a logo for it , put more copy to it , romance the description with smokehouse bacon , country ham or farm fresh eggs . ”
She said the chain took dollar signs off the menu in 2007 , and now on the test menu , instead of an omelet and orange juice , there is “ the light and fluffy Heavenly Omelet ” and “ Minute Maid orange juice . ”
In the “ Ten Commandments for Menu Success , ” an article published in Restaurant Hospitality magazine in 1994 , Allen H. Kelson , a restaurant consultant , wrote , “ If admen had souls , many would probably trade them for an opportunity every restaurateur already has : the ability to place an advertisement in every customer ’s hand before they part with their money . ”
And like advertisements , menus contain plenty of subliminal messages .
Some restaurants use what researchers call decoys .
For example , they may place a really expensive item at the top of the menu , so that other dishes look more reasonably priced ; research shows that diners tend to order neither the most nor least expensive items , drifting toward the middle .
Or restaurants might play up a profitable dish by using more appetizing adjectives and placing it next to a less profitable dish with less description so the contrast entices the diner to order the profitable dish .
Research by Brian Wansink , director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University and the author of “ Mindless Eating : Why We Eat More Than We Think , ” suggests that the average person makes more than 200 decisions about food every day , many of them unconsciously , including the choices made from reading menus .
Menu design draws some of its inspiration from newspaper layout , which puts the most important articles at the top right of the front page , where the eyes tend to be drawn .
Some restaurants will place their most profitable items , or their specials , in that spot .
Or they place a dotted outline or a box around the item , put more white space around it to make the dish stand out or , in what menu researchers say is one of the most effective tools , add a photograph of the item or an icon like a chili pepper .
Affären Operation Hippokrates
Wie ernst ist es dem Gesundheitsminister mit seiner jüngsten Attacke auf die Industrie ?
Seine FDP hat gerade den mächtigsten Pharmakritiker des Landes entsorgt .
Erst wurde die Ablösung beschlossen - dann nach Gründen gesucht .
Die Chronologie einer Intrige .
The second proposal is to extend something like the caps that already prohibit banks from holding more than 10 % of federally insured deposits , to other kinds of liabilities .
I asked , but got no clarity , on what exactly this means .
Are regulators going to swoop in whenever a diversified financial institution has too big a share of the total liabilities in all US debt markets ?
Or are they going to intervene when a bank becomes dangerous to one particular debt market , the way Lehman turned out to be in commercial paper ?
One thing is clear , though : the banks screwed up .
As I 've been saying for months now , it was a simply gigantic mistake to seek huge profits and big bonus pools .
Yes , I know that they were competing for talent with foreign banks .
Well , they kept the talent , and now it looks like they may well lose the profitable lines of business that they needed the talent for .
Last time I looked , Goldman 's proprietary investments made up something like 90 % of its profits .
Do they give up their profits , or their implied government guarantee ?
Either move is going to hurt , which is why , despite reporting record profits today , Goldman 's stock is down 4 % at this writing .
Now , as to the merits of the policy : is it a good idea ?
On first pass , I 'm going to say tenatively yes .
The government is recognizing that banks " paying back " the funds they were given is essentially meaningless , because they 've still got a very , very valuable implied government guarantee .
One could argue that they 've had it since 1991 when the Federal Reserve got the power to loan money to investment banks in extremis .
But since last fall , it 's the next best thing to explicit .
That means the government needs to take steps to mitigate its own risk .
The way you do that is to decouple the key operation the government insures -- the funneling of credit from those with money to those who want to borrow it -- from making bets on market outcomes that can go badly wrong .
And to ensure that no institution has enough liabilities to take down the system if it fails .
That said , I 'm not necessarily confident that this is going to work .
I 'm not even sure that I understand how it will work at this point .
I have only a hazy understanding of how the liability limits will be enforced , and after talking to administration officials , I 'm not sure that they really know either ; they seem to be waiting to see what the legislators and regulators say .
And while splitting off proprietary investment seems like it might mitigate systemic risk , it may be very hard to enforce .
Would " eating your own toxic waste " be prop trading , or client service , for example ?
It 's possible that this thing will end up with loopholes you could drive a truck through , and if so , it will probably be worse than nothing .
Too , I have n't talked to any prop traders or investment banking executives this morning .
They might be able to offer a convincing reason we should n't do this .
SALT LAKE CITY — House Majority Leader Kevin Garn admitted as the Legislature adjourned Thursday night to a nude hot - tubbing incident with a teenage girl 25 years ago .
In a tearful statement in a packed House chambers , Garn said the mistake has " now come back to haunt me " as the woman has gone public with the story .
The Layton Republican said he entered into a confidentiality agreement with the woman in 2002 and paid her $ 150,000 .
" I was 28 years old and I foolishly went hot - tubbing with a young woman nearly half my age .
Although we did not have any sexual contact , it was still clearly inappropriate — and it was my fault , " Garn said in a statement .
" One of the consequences of that decision was the negative impact it had on this young person 's life .
Years later , when I was running for Congress , she decided to bring this incident to the attention of the media .
" Shortly thereafter , my wife and I met with her , and at her demand , I paid her $ 150,000 .
While this payment felt like extortion , I also felt like I should take her word that the money would help her heal .
She agreed to keep this 25 - year - old incident confidential .
Now that this issue is coming up again , it is apparent to me that this payment was also a mistake . "
House members , their spouses , staff members and a full public gallery where poised to celebrate the close of the 45 - day session when Garn took the microphone and silenced those in attendance .
Gov. Gary Herbert had just completed delivering his traditional end - of - session address to House members and left the floor moments before Garn spoke .
House Speaker Dave Clark , R - Santa Clara , was visibly upset following Garn 's confession and was the only legislator to speak afterwards .
" I do n't know the man you speak of , but I know the man I consider a friend , a leader and an asset to the state of Utah , " Clark said .
" I would ask my fellow colleagues that their hearts might be open , and that we wish you and your family all the best and we hope that you remain with us . "
According to the Standard - Examiner in Ogden , the woman 's name is Sheryl Maher and she now lives in New Hampshire .
She told the newspaper the incident has haunted her .
She said she was 15 at the time of the incident .
" I never wanted to do this , " said Maher , explaining that she has resisted going public .
The Deseret News learned of the allegations against Garn just before the GOP primary election in 2002 .
Garn sat down and spoke about the incident with Deseret News reporters and editors .
At the time , Garn and now - U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop , R - Utah , were in a tight primary race seeking the Republican nomination for the 1st Congressional District and Garn was the Utah House majority leader , a position he has , again , achieved .
Deseret News editors decided not to run a story about the indiscretion at that time , since the GOP primary was only weeks away and the incident had occurred years before .
The editors decided to wait to see if Garn advanced in the primary before deciding whether to publish a story .
Because Garn lost that primary , and therefore was also retiring from the Utah House , the newspaper never published a story .
Garn later told the newspaper that he had spoken directly to the woman , had met with her along with his wife , that lawyers had gotten involved and that for an undisclosed sum of money that Garn had paid the woman , she had signed a confidentiality agreement agreeing not to talk about the long - ago incident publicly .
The Deseret News had no further contact with her .
Garn ran for his old Layton Utah House seat several years later and was eventually elected again into House GOP majority leadership — the position of majority leader that he holds today .
Since the Deseret News believed that the woman had signed a legal agreement not to speak about the matter again , it did not pursue the story , in part because it had happened so long ago when Garn was in his 20s .

Top 5 reasons why Russia failed at the Olympics ( Photo © Cameron Spencer / Getty Images )
With the early quarterfinals exit , Team Russia set a new negative record as this was the worse Olympic outcome in their history .
Since the first participation , 1956 Olympics in Cortina , Italy , Russia never had such a poor result .
Team Russia ’s roster was , on paper , the tournament ’s finest , but they could n’t live up to the expectations , even in the round robin , which Bykov ’s team ended with two wins and one loss , which determined the pairing with Canada .
RussianHockeyFans.com offers you top five reasons why Russia failed at 2010 Olympics .
Reason 5 : Underestimation of the opponents
If someone remembers well , we used this reason also for the WJC failure article .
While this was not the case in the quarterfinals match against Canada , this sure played a role in the other Russian defeat , against Slovakia .
In that game Bykov ’s team played without passion , as Bykov himself stated after the game , probably thinking that it would have been enough a 5 - minute push to run away with the win .
Well , it was n’t enough .
I ’m putting some stress on this because if team Russia would have won they would have got a better seed , staying off team Canada so early .
Reason 4 : Lack of spirit among leaders
Top players , especially in the game against Canada , did n’t really show up and took the team on their shoulders .
Alexander Ovechkin has been invisible in the quarterfinal match , not to talk about Evgeni Nabokov and Ilya Kovalchuk .
About Kovalchuk , unfortunately he did n’t manage to repeat the great effort he had in the two latest World Championships .
Let ’s browse the roster in depth .
Alexander Semin , only two assists , Alexander Radulov , only one goal and one assist , Pavel Datsyuk , one goal and two assists .
These are not the performances a contender would need from its top players , especially considering that Ovechkin , Malkin , Semin , Kovalchuk and others are without any doubt among the best players of the world .
Reason 3 : Chronic lack of goaltending
And here we go again .
Even if putting all the blame over Nabokov would n’t be fair , once again team Russia lacked quality goaltending .
Considering the good performances by both Nabokov and Ilya Bryzgalov in the latest international competitions , it was reasonable to expect kind of the same in Vancouver .
But unfortunately Nabokov did n’t deliver against Canada , letting in a couple of soft goals in the first period .
And when Bykov benched him , after the sixth goal , it was too late .
As said , it was unexpected .
Nabokov finished the Olympics with a terrible .853 of saves percentage and a GAA of 4.16 .
For comparison ’s sake , at the 2006 Turin Olympics he had , respectively , .940 and 1.34 .
At the Quebec World Championship , .929 and 1.78 .
It ’s safe to hope that for Sochi 2014 Semyon Varlamov will mature enough to take the starting or the backup role .
Reason 2 : Bad coaching
Yet another common point in Russian defeats at any level .
There is plenty to talk about the bad coach decision in the 2010 Olympic Hockey Tournament .
The first thing that we should notice is Nabokov ’s usage in the quarterfinals .
Why Bykov let him between the pipes after such a bad performance in the first period ?
While it ’s easy to talk with hindsight and claim that Bryzgalov should have started , it ’s safe to say that he should have been benched after the third goal or the first period to try sparking the team .
He did had a couple of nice saves , but , conceding goal after goal , he lost confidence .
When Bykov swapped him with Bryzgalov , the game was 6 - 1 , too late .
Another problem of this team has been the powerplay .
The Russians could assemble man advantage units made up of most of the world ’s best players and yet they were the third last worst team in the round robin with 12.5 % .
The same percentage as Germany , who surely did n’t ice players of the caliber of Ovechkin , Malkin , Semin and Kovalchuk …on the same line .
If we take the overall rankings , Russia stays the ninth seed with 15 % .
Once again , these are n’t statistics you can put together if you want your team to be a contender .
The third coaching ’s fault was probably an over usage of the third and fourth liners .
During the quarterfinals , only in the third period Bykov gave the top lines a bigger role , but once again , it was too late .
Besides , Semin played not even three minutes in the game ’s final stanza .
The last thing we ’ll notice was that most of time team Russia did n’t feature good teamplay , but mostly relied on one - by - ones or trying to do it all alone .
Vyacheslav Bykov has been team Russia ’s second big disappointment after Nabokov .
It looked like a good coach was finally found , but it looks like he ’s not Olympic quality .
Reason 1 : Let ’s face it , Canada was the best team
Canada dominated Russia since the first minute .
After the first period many would have asked if this was a WJC game or an Olympic game as the game was loopsided in favor of the Canadians in a fashion never seen during international games .
In the quarterfinal match Canada had much more than Russia in all departments : a better goalie ( Luongo ) , better defensive play and , a bit surprisingly , better offense too .
They might have less “ names ” , but they managed to overcome all this with a more focus and physical play .
There is n’t much else to say on this matter , simply the best team deservedly won .
Russian Hockey Federation will have plenty to think over in order to avoid another debacle on the home soil in 2014 .

Concerned Women For ... Nutritional Supplements ?!
by Jeremy Hooper
Okay , so we 're about to show you a couple of things , and we 're not exactly sure what it is that we 're showing you .
But here are three things that we do know .
(1) There 's a company called Vemma , which involves the marketing and selling of " health and wellness " drinks :
(2) The company , as well as the multi - level marketing plan attached to it , is nothing if not controversial .
The internet is filled with sites questioning the legitimacy of the plans , with the words " pyramid scheme " even tossed around by some .
Detractors are direct , but so are supporters :
Report : Vemma Corporation
Is VemmaBuilder a Scam ?
( see the comments on this one )
Whether or not it is scammy or a legitimate money - making opp .
is not really for us to say .
But there certainly seems to be discussion to be had there .
(3) The extremely anti-gay ( and that 's an understatement ) Concerned Women For America have gotten in bed with the plan :
We knew they sold homo - hostile snake oil .
But Vemma ?
So what does this all mean ?
Well again :
We really do n't know .
This is a very bizarre thread that we have pulled , and there 's more to learn here .
But we do have some questions :
Is this Vemma company directly partnering with the anti-gay CWA , therefore rightfully directing our focus / ire towards them ?
Is CWA hard up for cash , and therefore getting its members in a new kind of money - making scheme in order to raise funds ?
Will drinking Vemma lead one to say that marriage equality for same - sex couples constitutes " a sham that will devalue all marriages , " and that gay couples " live together to form a household in defiance of the prevailing moral codes to render meaningless an institution that has been the bulwark of the family and society throughout history " ?
After all , Concerned Woman Janice Crouse said this and more just last week .
We 're concerned humans .
Time for some answers .
**UPDATE , 3/19 : CWA 's fundraiser : Now with much better access to spine alignments [ G - A - Y ]
Your thoughts
Wingnuts being involved with whacky pyramid schemes ( or even ponzi schemes ) is nothing new .
The Mormons are well - known for their association with Amway / Quixtar , and the reports of Mormons being involved in multi-million dollar ponzi schemes keep coming .
The RRRW preaches " morality " but as most of you know their version of morality is all about what people do with their genitals and has nothing to do with honesty , integrity or treating other human beings decently .

Did Bernie Madoff empty LaHaye 's coffers too ??
Does she really drink that crap ??
And , why can't she make the claim that the spawn DO actually like it , rather than speculate as to it 's palatability ??
Is this the same swill that Pat Robertson was hocking ??
I was waiting to see her take a swig of it ... is that footage on the cutting room floor ??
Maybe it does n't taste as good as she claims ??
Maybe she could n't keep a straight face after tasting it ??
Maybe her gag reflex is back ??
So many questions indeed !!

I do think that LaHaye did step over the line in her attempt to sell this miracle tonic .
When she says that the fruit juice improves immune response , she makes a claim that she can't backup .
It 's okay to say that the elixir contains " immune boosting vitamins " , or some stupid nonsense like that , but you can't actually say that it boosts the immune system unless you can prove it .
If these guys could prove it , they would .
The FTC and FDA might have something to say to Mx. LaHaye when her bootay gets hauled into court ... and that non-existent " proof " fails to materialize .

If you ask me , Vemma is that sort of MLM whose earnings are contingent upon downline recruitment more so than sale of bona fide products or services , the latter likely to be excused as " merely a formality , " as if letting slip the fact that they actually have no product or service to sell .
Otherwise known as a Ponzi scheme ( after Charles F. Ponzi , who perfected the scam with a Boston " investment house " in 1919 as offered to double investors ' monies held for 90 days ) .

FBI raids on suspected militia members over the weekend jolted a public already concerned about far - right violence that surfaced during the health care reform fight .
Nine suspected members of a “ Christian ” militia group have been charged with seditious conspiracy , attempted use of weapons of mass destruction and other related charges , federal prosecutors announced March 29 .
The nine are from Michigan , Ohio and Indiana , where federal raids took place over the weekend .
The indictment names a militia group called the Hutaree as conspiring to oppose the U.S. government by force .
The group was planning a double attack on local law enforcement , the Detroit Free Press reports .
The Hutaree says it is preparing to fight the “ antichrist ” until death .
On its web site , links to training videos and Biblical - like rants can be found along with a banner across the page telling its members : “ Training April 24 contact headquarters immediately . ”
The Southern Poverty Law Center lists Hutaree as among the 127 active militias associated with so - called “ Patriot ” groups .
SPLC ’s Mark Potok warns that radical right , extremist groups are on the rise .
These groups are fueled by racism , especially anti-immigrant racism and rage at the nation ’s first African American president , Barack Obama , he says .
“ Furious anti-immigrant vigilante groups soared … during 2009 , ” Potok writes .
Violent militia groups who had their “ heyday ” during the 1990s , including in the Oklahoma City bombing , have reemerged , according to SPLC ’s research .
“ Already there are signs of similar violence emanating from the radical right .
Since the installation of Barack Obama , right - wing extremists have murdered six law enforcement officers , ” Potok writes .
He points out a growing “ cross- pollination between different sectors of the radical right not seen in years , ” with more cooperation on agendas and ideologies .
Such “ cross pollination ” may have been at work with the Hutaree group .
The media reports Hutaree members contacted another Michigan militia member for help , which he claimed he declined giving .
Hutaree promotes extremist ideas that have found wide acceptance among right - wing political movements , including the Republican Party .
At the GOP ’s 2009 Senate - House fundraising dinner , actor Jon Voight got a rousing ovation when he called Obama the “ false prophet ” in a heavily Armageddon - rhetoric - laden speech .
Similar rhetoric is seen in the tea party movement .
SPLC ’s Potok says while the tea partiers “ cannot fairly be considered extremist groups , ” they are “ shot through with rich veins of radical ideas , conspiracy theories and racism . ”
New York Times columnist Frank Rich notes a connection between the tea-bag protestors and racism .
“ [ T ] he health care bill is not the main source of this anger and never has been .
It ’s merely a handy excuse , ” he writes , comparing the anti-health - care attacks to the 1964 attacks on civil rights legislation .
GOP politicians , most notably Sarah Palin , have been promoting extremism , and even violence , along with their favored news outlet , Fox , and spokesperson Glenn Beck .
Examples abound .
In the wake of the health care vote , Palin urged her followers not to retreat , but to “ RELOAD . ”
She also put rifle crosshairs over the map of districts of lawmakers who voted “ Yes . ”
Democrats and others have pointed to such language as an example of the way Republicans have incited angry actions and threats .
Beck , among other things , has lectured that “ progressivism ” is a “ cancer ” eating America and the Constitution and akin to fascism .
For recent peoplesworld.org articles on the ultra right and racism :
Beware of the new racist counteroffensive
Tea party ’s ugly reality : racism , sexism , homophobia

Target enrichment has been a major driver behind the clinical adoption of next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) over the last decade because it simplifies analysis and provides a cost - effective method of massive parallel resequencing .
It has not only replaced Sanger sequencing , but it is actively dispensing the need for parallel copy number variant ( CNV ) analysis using classic techniques .
Did you know that your brain makes up about 2 % of your body weight … but uses about 20 - 25 % of your body ’s total energy , just for its basic activity ?
That ’s one hungry brain !
No wonder it ’s good to eat nutritious foods that offer a lot of energy .
The brain of a newborn baby is even more amazing , as it takes up about 60 % of the baby ’s energy as the brain grows at an astonishing pace .
McGarrigle last performed six weeks ago alongside her children in London Canadian folk singer Kate McGarrigle has died of cancer at the age of 63 .
The mother of singers Rufus and Martha Wainwright , McGarrigle died at home in Montreal on Monday .
She had been battling cancer since summer 2006 .
Kate rose to prominence with sister Anna when they recorded together in the 1970s .
" Sadly our sweet Kate had to leave us last night , " Anna said .
" She departed in a haze of song and love surrounded by family and good friends , " she wrote on their website .
" She is irreplaceable and we are broken - hearted .
Til we meet again dear sister . "
The pair first attracted attention in 1974 when Linda Ronstadt recorded their song Heart Like a Wheel as the title track for one of her albums .
The sisters ' first record came out in 1975 , titled Kate and Anna McGarrigle , and brought them critical acclaim .
Rufus Wainwright recently cancelled an upcoming tour due to a " family illness "
Other artists who covered the pair 's songs included Emmylou Harris , Billy Bragg , Kirsty MacColl , Judy Collins and Elvis Costello .
" Kate was a folk singer through and through , a bi-lingual Canadian who celebrated her heritage and drew on it for songs that were to become standards on the folk scene , " said BBC Radio 2 folk show host Mike Harding .
" It is tragic that she has finally lost her fight with cancer - she was a beautiful and rare human being . "
Kate McGarrigle and her sisters - she had another called Jane - grew up in a mountain village in Quebec .
Kate 's own songs included The Work Song , Cool River and Lying Song .
She was was once married to fellow folk singer Loudon Wainwright lll and received the Order of Canada in 1994 , one of the country 's highest honours .
' Warmth and feeling ' BBC Radio 2 host Bob Harris described her music as " very human " .
" Through the years , I 've played Kate and Anna McGarrigle 's music on my programmes and really loved the warmth of their music .
" When she sang in French there was a warmth and a feeling to it that kind of transcended language in some way and communicated anywhere . "
McGarrigle made her last public appearance six weeks ago at a concert with Rufus and Martha Wainwright at the Royal Albert Hall in London .
The show raised $ 55,000 ( £ 33,600 ) for the Kate McGarrigle Fund , which she set up in 2008 to raise awareness of sarcoma , a rare cancer that affects connective tissue such as bone , muscle , nerves and cartilage .

Portland - Subject to local approval , revises charter provisions relating to contracts procured by the City ; authorizes city council to fix the time and place of regular meetings of the council ; requires a two - thirds vote of the city council to adopt an ordinance or resolution where specified ; clarifies that certain ordinances may require a minimum time between two readings prior to becoming effective .
- Amends Chapter 568 of the Private Acts of 1939 ; as amended .
HB2916 has been assigned Public Chapter Number 50 by the Secretary of State .
The implications were clear .
There is a reason that fat people cannot stay thin after they diet and that thin people cannot stay fat when they force themselves to gain weight .
The body 's metabolism speeds up or slows down to keep weight within a narrow range .
Gain weight and the metabolism can as much as double ; lose weight and it can slow to half its original speed .
That , of course , was contrary to what every scientist had thought , and Sims knew it , as did Hirsch .
The message never really got out to the nation 's dieters , but a few research scientists were intrigued and asked the next question about body weight :
Is body weight inherited , or is obesity more of an inadvertent , almost unconscious response to a society where food is cheap , abundant and tempting ?
An extra 100 calories a day will pile on 10 pounds in a year , public health messages often say .
In five years , that is 50 pounds .
The assumption was that environment determined weight , but Albert Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania wondered if that was true and , if so , to what extent .
It was the early 1980s , long before obesity became what one social scientist called a moral panic , but a time when those questions of nature versus nurture were very much on Stunkard 's mind .
He found the perfect tool for investigating the nature - nurture question - a Danish registry of adoptees developed to understand whether schizophrenia was inherited .
It included meticulous medical records of every Danish adoption between 1927 and 1947 , including the names of the adoptees ' biological parents , and the heights and weights of the adoptees , their biological parents and their adoptive parents .
Stunkard ended up with 540 adults whose average age was 40 .
They had been adopted when they were very young - 55 percent had been adopted in the first month of life and 90 percent were adopted in the first year of life .
His conclusions , published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1986 , were unequivocal .
The adoptees were as fat as their biological parents , and how fat they were had no relation to how fat their adoptive parents were .
The scientists summarized it in their paper : " The two major findings of this study were that there was a clear relation between the body - mass index of biologic parents and the weight class of adoptees , suggesting that genetic influences are important determinants of body fatness ; and that there was no relation between the body - mass index of adoptive parents and the weight class of adoptees , suggesting that childhood family environment alone has little or no effect . "
In other words , being fat was an inherited condition .
Stunkard also pointed out the implications : " Current efforts to prevent obesity are directed toward all children ( and their parents ) almost indiscriminately .
Yet if family environment alone has no role in obesity , efforts now directed toward persons with little genetic risk of the disorder could be refocused on the smaller number who are more vulnerable .
Such persons can already be identified with some assurance : 80 percent of the offspring of two obese parents become obese , as compared with no more than 14 percent of the offspring of two parents of normal weight . "
The long list of those who think the Lakers miss Trevor Ariza just increased by one .
Even Ron Artest agrees ?
“ He ’s a better player than me , ” Artest said Tuesday .
But Ron-Ron , nobody ever said he was better , we just said he was a better fit .
“ He ’s a better player , ” Artest repeated emphatically .
“ He ’s won a ring , I have n’t .
I ca n’t even compare to him .
He ’s a better player . ”
Artest also agrees , incidentally , with the part about Ariza being a better fit .
“ He probably is , ” Artest said .
“ He ’s a role player , a great role player .
I have n’t been a role player .
Many times
I ’ve had to carry the load , this is a different look for me . ”
It is this different look that has some of the Lakers covering their eyes .
Entering the season ’s final stretch , basketball ’s wackiest star is performing his nuttiest act yet .
Ron Artest is barely raising an eyebrow .
He has n’t figured out the flow of the Lakers offense this season , he has sometimes seemed a step slow on defense , and he ’s made little impact on the team ’s toughness .
In a move engineered by the Buss family last summer , Artest was signed here from the Houston Rockets to replace Ariza , who then signed with Houston , after balking at the Lakers ’ contract offer .
It is a move that some Lakers folks would now take back .
It was a move that many of us thought should never have happened in the first place .
Ariza did n’t have Artest ’s star power , but he was a better offensive complement to Kobe Bryant , a more versatile team defender , and a guy who had survived the championship battle to win a ring .
He was a known quantity who would have been an invaluable soul in the difficult quest to win a second consecutive title .
Artest was a Lakers unknown who is still , well , a Lakers unknown .
“ With Ron , there ’s a little synapse there , a little delayed reaction , ” Coach Phil Jackson said .
“ That ’s just Ron , regardless .
All the guys have had to get used to it . ”
The adjustment has been fine in the locker room , where , contrary to initial fears , Artest has been a model of unselfishness and deference .
The adjustment has n’t been so easy on the court , where he ’s been just as quiet .
After 70 games , the team is 52 - 18 , four games behind the pace of last season ’s Lakers .
Less than a month before the playoffs , the difference between the two versions can be found in the difference between Artest and Ariza .
This year ’s team seems unsure of itself .
Last year ’s team had no doubt .
While Artest is averaging fewer points , rebounds and assists than Ariza , he has better shooting percentages , but it ’s not about their numbers , it ’s about their presence .
The Lakers are still waiting for Artest , 30 , to fit into an offensive flow where the younger Ariza existed seamlessly .
The Lakers are still waiting for Artest to shut down more opponents like he shut down Denver ’s Carmelo Anthony at the end of last month , and make the sort of big defensive plays Ariza made regularly .
“ Artest is still figuring things out , but we expected that , ” said teammate Lamar Odom .
Expected it , or feared it ?
Remember , the Buss family suddenly acquired Artest and dumped Ariza seemingly without similar enthusiasm from either General Manager Mitch Kupchak or Jackson .
While both men publicly endorsed the deal , one must wonder whether today they are still shaking their heads .
Artest is certainly shaking his head .
While his previous comments about Ariza were made with a straight face , it was clear that they contained some annoyed sarcasm .
Here he is , on his best behavior , and it ’s still not enough ?
He did n’t force the Lakers to sign him .
He did n’t ask to shoulder Ariza ’s memory .
He ’s just trying to fit in , and growing increasingly frustrated that he ’s not .
“ People see me play , they know what type of player I ’m about , ” he said .
“ ‘ What I was before , it ’s not as important , what ’s more important is winning and playing team ball .
I could be averaging a lot of points and making people real happy , but that means somebody else would not be reaping the benefits .
They won a championship last year , a lot of guys deserve to still shine . ”
Spoken like a great teammate .
If only he were so eloquent on the court , where , as Jackson noted , there often seems to be something missing .
“ I do n’t know .
I do n’t know , ” Artest said , pausing .
“ I mean , I ’m making my mark defensively .
My defense has been unbelievable .
I do n’t know whose defense has been as unbelievable as mine . ”
He also notes that he has lost 15 pounds during the season , saying he ’s down to 253 and slowly working into postseason shape .
“ It ’s OK to put it on me , talk about me , that means I ’m still alive , ” Artest said .
The Lakers can only hope .

Following reports of multiple attacks on the offices of Democrats who voted for healthcare reform over the weekend , Republican House whip Eric Cantor held an angry press conference on Thursday claiming that his office had been attacked by gunshot and accusing Democrats of " dangerously fanning the flames " .
But on closer examination the " attack " on Cantor 's office turns out to be ambiguous at the least .
On Thursday , Cantor said :
" Just recently I have been directly threatened .
A bullet was shot through the window of my campaign office in Richmond this week , and I 've received threatening emails .
But I will not release them , because I believe such actions will only encourage more to be sent . "
He went on to say : " It is reckless to use these incidents as media vehicles for political gain .
That is why I have deep concerns that some [ senior Democrats ] are dangerously fanning the flames by suggesting that these incidents be used as a political weapon . "
So what happened at Cantor 's office in the Virginia district he represents ?
Let 's read yesterday 's official press release from the local police :
Richmond Police Investigate Cantor Building Vandalism
The Richmond Police Department is investigating an act of vandalism at the Reagan Building , 25 East Main St , Richmond , Virginia .
A first floor window was struck by a bullet at approximately 1 am on Tuesday , March 23 .
The building , which has several tenants including an office used by Congressman Eric Cantor , was unoccupied at the time .
A Richmond Police detective was assigned to the case .
A preliminary investigation shows that a bullet was fired into the air and struck the window in a downward direction , landing on the floor about a foot from the window .
The round struck with enough force to break the windowpane but did not penetrate the window blinds .
There was no other damage to the room , which is used occasionally for meetings by the congressman .
So let 's see : the police describe it " vandalism " , and say a " bullet was fired in the air " and broke the window on its way down but so weakly that it could n't even make it through the window blinds .
Was Cantor 's office the object of the attack ?
Today the Richmond police are describing the event as " an act of random gunfire , " which seems more accurate .
Of course , other facts may come to light .
Until they do , while Cantor 's claim is true in a strict sense – a bullet was fired and it did go through the window of his office – it would seem he 's making more of this than the incident deserves .
And since the office is in Virginia – a state where " open carry " of firearms is legal and a hotspot of gun ownership – the occasional bullet is going be found .
Certainly , it does n't compare to the unambiguous attack on the Democratic party office in Rochester , New York , in the form of a brick with a note attached reading : " Exremism [ sic ] in the defense of liberty is no vice " – a phrase coined by Republican presidential candidate and conservative icon Barry Goldwater .
Cantor , like other US politicians , has certainly received threats over the years : Fox News 's report on the vandalism noted : " Cantor is the highest - elected Jewish official in the country and the only Jewish Republican in the House . "
Several leading Republicans have condemned the attacks , including House minority leader John Boehner , who said yesterday : " Violence and threats are unacceptable .
They have no place in a political debate .
We need to take that anger and channel it into what I would describe as positive change . "
You do n’t buy a Ferrari expecting the latest in green technology , but there are signs of environmentally friendly evolution in Maranello .
Not only did Ferrari ’s chief executive , Amedeo Felisa , tell the British press that V - 6 cars could be in the company ’s future , but Luca di Montezemolo , the company ’s chairman , also announced recently that it was bringing a hybrid version of the 599 GTB to the Geneva Motor Show in March .
He described the hybrid as “ a great path towards the future . ”
Hold on , though .
The Sierra Club is n’t likely to bestow awards on the supercar manufacturer anytime soon .
The V - 12 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti ( with nine miles per gallon in the city and 16 on the highway as an automatic ) still makes the Greenercars.org list of “ 10 Meanest Cars for the Environment . ”
But asked about the possibility of V - 6 - powered Ferraris by Autocar , Mr. Felisa said , “ If I had to answer the question a year ago I would have said no , but attitudes are changing and we build cars for customers . ”
He added , “ If you look at global warming , the right solution is not fully electric . ”
Sound , in the form of a rich exhaust roar , is important to Ferrari , he said , and the company “ will not make engine sounds with speakers . ”
The V - 6 car , anathema to purists , is probably not imminent — Mr. Felisa said , “ In 20 years , who can say ? ” — but a Ferrari hybrid is definitely coming , though there ’s no assurance it will ever see production .
Matteo Sardi , a Ferrari North America spokesman , said : “ It is going to be a prototype , and it will appear in Geneva .
We absolutely think ahead of everybody in technology research , and a hybrid is in line with that . ”
The hybrid has long been rumored , especially since the company patented a “ four - wheel - drive system with hybrid propulsion ” a year ago .
In that concept , the gas engine and electric motor drive the front or rear wheels separately .
In practice , according to Motor Authority , that could enable the driver to switch between rear - and four - wheel - drive , and enable brief spurts of battery - only power .
And that , the site said , “ will vastly improve Ferrari ’s carbon footprint and position in the eyes of environmentalists . ”
Health insurers across the country are dramatically increasing rates and slashing benefits for many of the estimated 17 million consumers with individual insurance policies , while making it almost impossible to obtain affordable alternatives .
The problems have captured national attention as President Obama steps up his campaign in Washington for a healthcare overhaul and Congress investigates rate hikes of as much as 39 % by Anthem Blue Cross in California .
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and members of Congress this week continued a drumbeat of criticism of insurers , including Anthem , saying they are putting profits ahead of customers who must buy individual policies rather than group coverage .
Sebelius released a report Thursday that drew attention to big rate hikes sought by insurers in several states , including California , Oregon , Michigan and Connecticut .
“ Millions of Americans are in the least secure marketplace . . . the one in which people have virtually no options , ” Sebelius said .
“ Their only choice is to pay increases or drop the coverage . ”
More daunting is the prospect of millions more workers being forced to buy individual policies as employers look to further slash or eliminate company - paid group health benefits .
Rate increases are forcing many policyholders to make undesirable choices .
In an effort to reduce their rates , many consumers are raising deductibles as high as $ 7,500 and paying more out of their pockets for basic services .
Others are avoiding visiting doctors for fear of tainting their medical histories .
Some are canceling their coverage altogether .
And it ’s not only people with serious conditions , such as cancer and diabetes , who have a hard time navigating individual markets .
A variety of preexisting conditions -- such as ear infections , varicose veins and sleep apnea -- make others just as vulnerable .
Consider Tatiana Korolshteyn , an unemployed Redondo Beach mother who ca n’t pay Anthem ’s 39 % rate hike and fears that other insurers will reject her because of a 2 - year - old back injury , caused by a car accident , that has since mostly healed .
“ These are awful choices , ” said Korolshteyn , 35 .
“ I feel trapped . ”
Rate increases by insurance companies are a fact of life for the nation ’s insured , but sharp hikes this year in California have provoked a national outcry that has brought criticism from President Obama and prompted investigations in Sacramento and Washington .
Next week , state and federal officials will conduct public hearings into Anthem ’s impending increases , which take effect May 1 .
( Originally set for March 1 , the increases were delayed by parent WellPoint Inc. for two months while independent actuaries , hired by California ’s insurance commissioner , review them . )
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) announced Friday that she would introduce legislation next week to dramatically expand federal authority over health insurance premiums .
Her bill would allow the secretary of Health and Human Services to review , modify or deny “ unjustified ” increases in states such as California where insurance commissioners have limited authority .
Feinstein ’s effort , and next week ’s public hearings , follow public outrage by policyholders , regulators , consumer advocates and lawmakers , including Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) , who is presiding over a congressional inquiry .
Health insurance leaders say they agree that individual markets are rife with problems but insist that the trouble is caused by factors beyond their control -- namely , the soaring cost of medical care and the churn of customers who enter or leave the individual market , depending on employment .
The sour economy has prompted many younger and healthier people to forgo or cancel insurance , companies say .
As a result , insurers have had to spread the cost of individual insurance over smaller numbers of ailing policyholders who keep coverage they desperately need .
“ A lot of what you see today is a product of the way the market works , ” said Robert Zirkelbach , a spokesman for America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the industry ’s Washington - based lobbying arm .
“ The market is broken .
Those people who do need the coverage wind up covering the cost of everyone else . ”
WellPoint executives say that about a third of Anthem ’s 800,000 individual policyholders in California turn over annually .
Well Point underestimated how much it would have to pay for its customers ’ care in 2009 , executives said .
The company told congressional investigators last week that it lost money in California ’s individual market in 2009 .
“ At the end of the year , when all things were said and done , premiums were insufficient to cover claim costs that we actually paid out , ” said Brian Sassi , who oversees individual markets nationwide for the company .
Insurers in California and most other states have wide latitude to pick applicants for individual coverage , rejecting those they do n’t want as they compete for the healthiest customers .
Individuals have little if any leverage to negotiate rates the way that companies can bargain on behalf of large blocks of employees .
Unlike group insurance plans offered through employers , individual plans factor customers ’ medical histories into their premiums .
Insured individuals have different rates , depending on their ages , locations and health conditions .
Insurers say the selection process is key to controlling costs .
But it also can lock consumers into policies in which premiums escalate rapidly , particularly if a policyholder becomes sick after buying a plan .
Such consumers have little choice but to pay the higher costs , with limited ability to evaluate prices , critics say .
Comparative rate information for such plans is hard to come by in most states , including California .
“ Insurance companies in the individual market in states have long figured out how to manipulate the policies and the prices in order to shake off bad risk or charge you through the nose if you stay , ” said Karen Pollitz , a research professor at Georgetown University ’s Health Policy Institute .
“ It ’s a mess of a market .
And there ’s no security of coverage . ”
A handful of states , including New York and New Jersey , do not allow insurers to cherry - pick customers .
In such states -- and under health reform proposals pending in Congress -- insurers are required to sell policies to all buyers , regardless of preexisting conditions .
In addition , the national reform bills would bar insurers from charging more because of health problems .
That would be welcome news to Kathy Klossner , 50 , of San Diego County , who makes a point of visiting the doctor as seldom as possible for fear of tarnishing her medical record .
Klossner ’s insurer , Woodland Hills - based Health Net , notified her in January that her insurance premium would rise 35 % , to $ 372 a month from $ 276 .
Concerned about losing insurance and eager to lower her premium , Klossner is increasing her deductible to $ 4,800 from $ 3,600 .
She sees her insurance as a hedge against catastrophic illness .
“ I ’m very scared to go to the doctor for anything , ” she said .
“ I ’m just so frustrated . ”

Even though the U.S. financial system nearly experienced a total meltdown in late 2008 , the truth is that most Americans simply have no idea what is happening to the U.S. economy .
Most people seem to think that the nasty little recession that we have just been through is almost over and that we will be experiencing another time of economic growth and prosperity very shortly .
But this time around that is not the case .
The reality is that we are being sucked into an economic black hole from which the U.S. economy will never fully recover .
The problem is debt .
Collectively , the U.S. government , the state governments , corporate America and American consumers have accumulated the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world .
Our massive debt binge has financed our tremendous growth and prosperity over the last couple of decades , but now the day of reckoning is here .
And it is going to be painful .
I can only think of one word to encapsulate Thrasher - world on Saturday Feb 6th and that word is " unexpected " .
I expected a Thrashers Townhall full of Season Ticket Holders in full revolt .
I expected someone might stand up and rip up their tickets and throw them down in disgust .
I expected to hear calls for the GM to be fired and new ownership .
I expected someone to yell " show him the money ! "
Instead I witnessed a spirited and rather honest - back - and - forth between fans , GM and ownership .
I heard a surprisingly candid and mature discussion about the state of the team from both fans and management .
From the fans , I heard anger and frustration , but also a recognition that their is more than one way to build a hockey team .
From management , I heard both the GM and owner take their lumps and admit that " we 've made mistakes " but also pledge that " we 're here to win hockey games and we 're committed to accomplishing that goal . "
There was a lot less salesmanship and a lot more plain speaking than I expected .
[ More details on the Townhall coming up below . ]
That meeting was followed by an unexpected hockey game .
The Thrashers team had lost the night before to the Washington Capitals .
Historically , NHL teams struggle in the 2nd of back to back games .
In the Thrashers case , their difficulty was exacerbated by the historic snowfall in Washington which caused them to consume 10 hours traveling home to Atlanta .
The start of the game against Florida had to be pushed back almost an hour .
Given those conditions , I would not have been surprised to see a tired team bereft of their star player produce a stinker effort .
Instead , the team came out with great passion and energy and out - shot and out - worked the opponent .
Ron Hainsey fought , Tobias Enstrom and Pavel Kubina pinched in like the ghost of Bobby Orr. Zach Bogosian and Evander Kane were rowdy , and new Thrasher Nicklas Bergfors supplied a beautiful game winner .
The players moved around on the power play , and the passing was crisp .
Reasoner and Oduya were outstanding on the PK , and Hedberg was up to the task in goal .
They played like a like a team .
If every hockey game was this exciting , the tickets would sell themselves .
It was easily one of the most entertaining games of the season .
With the late start , the crowd was all there from the National Anthem and they were prepared to make some noise .
The team fed off the nearly full building .
It was both startling and exciting at the same time .
It was very unexpected .
Now the Thrashers get a couple days off to practice with their two new guys before the face a critical 3 game road trip before the Olympic Break .
If they lose all three , their playoffs aspirations are on life support -- it is so hard to make up points in March with all of the three point games and falling behind by 6 - 7 points could be fatal .
However , if they get only one win , they 're in trouble , but it could still work out favorably .
Two wins and they will have set themselves up for the NHL version of March Madness where they battle for one of those last three playoff berths .
These next three games in February are incredibly important contests .
Thrashers Townhall Meeting Recap
[ As usual I took detailed notes , but unless I use quotes , it is a paraphrase of what was said . ]
The fans packed the Hawks Practice court and almost every seat was taken .
Season ticket reps lined one wall .
On the other wall were senior management of the team and building .
When Don Waddell walked in he was accompanied by two owners ( Bruce Levenson and Ed Peskowitz ) and the CEO of Philips Arena .
There was definitely tension in the air .
Waddell began by talking about the arduous travel from DC .
They departed via bus at 9 a.m. to Richmond , VA .
Grazed a truck on the icy roads where they lost a mirror , reached their plane by 2 pm , but had to wait 2 more hours to be de-iced and for weather clearance .
The takeoff was a real " white knuckler " and they did n't reach Philips Arena until almost 6 pm .
Waddell then shifted to Kovalchuk and did an overview of contract talks .
They met with his agent almost a year ago in April .
Then , in June , they talked with Kovalchuk at his home about which free agents to target that summer .
In July , Kovalchuk said he wanted to wait to see how the team looked before starting talks .
Waddell said " I really thought he wanted to stay , so we waited . "
The team was winning , and in November , Kovy green - lighted talks .
Kovalchuk 's side asked for 12 years at the cap max of $ 11 + million and they never budged from that number .
The Thrashers countered with multiple offers of different contract lengths and dollar amounts ranging from 7 years to 10 years .
Their 10 year offer combined with the money the Thrashers had already paid Kovalchuk in his first 8 seasons , would have added up to a career total of $ 149 million -- which is more money than any player has ever made in a career in the NHL .
They offered more money per year than any other NHL player currently makes .
Kovalchuk 's position was that he felt he deserved the cap max and would wait to free agency on July 1st to see if a team would meet that price .
Once trade talks began the market was " smaller than the number of rumored teams " because everyone knew his contract demands where high enough that they could n't acquire him and hope that he would sign for less money .
A pure rental trend simply does n't bring as much .
Talks really came down to three teams and the offers where not amazing .
Their goal was to acquire both immediate help and future considerations .
Cormier : Thrashers Rick Dudley and Dan Marr both had him ranked as the # 1 prospect in NJ system .
Devils refused to part with him for first 24 hours of serious talks , finally relented then they said no deal without him .
Oduya : plays big minutes , can not have too many quality defenseman , plays in all situations , signed for several years to reasonable contract -- Dudley really liked him as well .
Berfgors : can score the puck , young and crafty , will mature with other young talent like Kane .
Change creates new opportunities .
It was Ilya 's team before -- by design -- now the door is open for other leaders to step up .
" I think the team was ready for a change , not a knock on Ilya , but they always looked at him .
Sometimes that was not enough .
They 're disappointed because Ilya is a good person and teammate and sad to see him go .
But they are ready to compete for the playoffs -- it was a very determined room on Friday . "
He then opened it up to questions .
Everybody knew that some questions needed to be brought up and the first guy did not disappoint .
He asked Don if he should n't step down and let Dudley take over ?
Waddell said that " I have no intention of stepping down .
It is ownership 's decision not mine . "
He said that Dudley is a good evaluator of talent .
" I have made some mistakes in the past , but if we had kept Kovalchuk the price was so high that later we would have to choose between keeping either Bogosian or Kane " when it came time for their pay raises .
" under a cap system you have to make choices , the pie is only so big and the players understand that too . "
The next questioner continued the line of attack by saying , " this franchise can't retain top guys .
Going way back we let Staios , Brunette , and Savard depart , when are we going to keep our stars ? "
Waddell :
We agreed that the team did choose to pass on Staios , Brunette and Savard , while Hossa and Heatley made their own decisions to leave .
Q What about the three goalies ?
Waddell :
We 're pretty happy with what we have seen this year .
Goaltending has not been our biggest problem .
Mannino is tearing it up in the AHL .
We will not keep 3 goalies at NHL level , not enough starts or practice time to go around .
The market for goalie trades is not good though , return will be very modest .
[ Later another goalie question was asked but I 'm going to put both answers here . ]
2nd question was basically , " What 's the problem with Kari ? "
Waddell pointed to his lack of dependability and indicated that in the locker room the players no longer feel like they can count on him and perhaps they do n't play as hard for him as they do for Hedberg .
Another tough , but good question , came next , " Why does this team play listless half the time ?
Is n't that the job of the coaching staff to have these guys ready ?
Waddell : " Of course it is on the coach , but the players also have to take responsibility as well .
I watch the games and just like you I ask myself why the slow starts .
Unlike you guys I can go down to the locker room and ask the players -- I do n't always like the answers I get .
It is a big concern , we have discussed it a lot .
I think we have been better in the 1st period the last time games with the exception of the Carolina game .
He made a joke that we should all just keep talking through the 1st " because we will be down 2 - 0 anyway " -- which was prophetic .
Earlier DW had left open the possibilty of making an offer to Ilya Kovalchuk if he reaches the UFA market in July .
So someone asked " Why would we even attempt to re-sign Kovy on July 1st if the team wants to head in a new direction ?
If you go with a new philosophy should n't you stick with it ? "
In his answer Waddell focused on the current Thrashers roster and their potential to compete .
He said " I know half you guys in here hate me , so let me put it this way [ pause ]
Rick Dudley thinks we have the talent right now to be a playoff team . " [ laughter in the room ]
Next question was about the identity of the team now .
Waddell :
We can't just rely on being flashy to win games , neither do we want to try and win every game 2 - 1 - - margin of error too small , boring hockey .
We 've always been offensive minded , but we have made some improvement on the defensive side .
Adding Oduya another step in that process .
We will score goals without Ilya , but we still need to cut down our goals allowed to win games .
Then Waddell tossed out that Valabik had probably injured his ACL and was likely down for the season .
" He 'll get an MRI on Monday to confirm it , but it does n't look good . "
Next questioner critiqued both Kovalchuk and the sausages -- no I 'm not making this up .
He said Kovalchuk took his helmet off on the bench toward the end of a recent game and looked like he had given up , bad signal from the captain .
Also game experience had declined and sausages are smaller .
The guy sitting behind me said " I never thought I 'd miss Aramark . "
Waddell tried to make amends to this STH - - let 's just say that guy is getting a new ticket rep .
Waddell mentioned next season they might offer benefit package with a menu of choices because not everyone wants the same side benefits .
[ Personally I thought this was a rather creative approach , but it will certainly require work by the staff to keep track of who gets what . ]
Another pointed but rational question next .
" I 've been a STH for many years , tell me why I should renew ? "
Of all the questions asked the entire night this one proved most troublesome for DW .
He began by talking about how a team is not just one individual .
Then he said that fans should give the guys still here a chance to show what they can do -- they have a lot of pride .
Probably no ticket increases next year .
We know we have to win and we 're doing our best to make that take place .
The one year we made the playoffs the crowds were good , right now only hard core fans coming , we think 4,000 disaffected former STH who still watch and come now and then .
Rest of Atlanta will only come if we grab their attention .
[ That last part sounded almost like quote from a blog somewhere . ]
I 'm going to pause here and say that it seemed to me that Waddell had mentally prepared for all sorts of Kovy related questions and was really caught flat - footed on this one , it was his worst answer of the night in my opinion .
As a fan here 's what I would have liked to hear Don Waddell say to that person : " We have a PLAN to compete and win .
Here is our plan .
Improve our ability identify talent -- which we did by adding Rick Dudley and canning our Q scout .
Get younger and avoid declining veterans -- which we did with this Kovalchuk trade .
Get players that fit our identity ( young , fast and puck skills ) and our coach -- which we have done over the last year .
Make hard choices and trade away players who do n't fit our identity -- which we did with Exelby .
We have a plan , but it will not turn around the ship immediately .
We have learned from past mistakes and here is the route we have mapped out to win in the future . "
I think an answer like that would have sold some renewal packages .
Next another tough question " Where are our owners , we see Arthur Blank all the time , where are these guys ?
We only hear about them suing each other .
And why did n't you give Kovy an ultimatum this summer ? "
Waddell : " The one regret I have is that we did n't get know they would not budge from a cap max back in July .
This could have happened a lot faster .
I really thought he wanted to stay and that was wrong . "
Waddell :
As for the owners , being seen is not what it is all about .
They take a lot of heat from fans .
We ask for support for the team and staff and they do that .
They are involved in every decision .
People complain about their support for the hockey side , but we just offered more money to Kovalchuk than than they are paying to any NBA player .
They are committed to building the team -- for example the year we made the playoffs they agreed to add some expensive players .
Our DC owners probably attend as many Thrasher games as I do .
And then he turned mic over to owner Bruce Levenson .
Bruce Levenson : I 'm not Arthur Blank you will not see me down on the bench but I spend almost every 3rd period in Don 's box .
We have worked together for 6 years .
In business you have to work with people you trust and we have have that with him .
On the NBA side we changed the GM , we would do that on the hockey side if we felt it was necessary .
I 've received many requests to fire Don from current and former STH .
We could perhaps make some money if we fired him but we trust him .
As owners we have made some good decisions and bad decisions .
I probably talk to Don 3 - 4 times a day .
I 'm not a GM and I 'm not a coach , I 'm an owner , but I 'm not afraid to make a change .
On the NBA side we changed the GM but kept our coach and he is now the longest tenure in the East .
Our NBA team has improved for six straight seasons .
We want sustained success on the hockey side , but we have made more mistakes .
But we want to win -- otherwise we would not have made an offer for $ 101 million to a player .
You do n't do that if you plan on quitting on hockey .
Q Who will lead , who will be captain ?
Waddell :
We have four players with an " A " stick with that for the moment and see who steps up .
They have 11 guys on the roster who were captain before in college or in junior hockey .
" A lot of potential there . "
Tossed out that Kubina has been a real " take charge " guy for this team .
Q What about other UFAs on the roster ?
Waddell :
We 're been pretty busy with Kovalchuk thing and have possible goalie trade coming up .
Kubina -- we plan to begin talks with his agent during Olympic break .
[ After session was over I asked Waddell if they would re-sign Kubina if it meant having 5 quality D who make all make some $ ?
He said yes and he was hopeful that an extension could be worked out . ]
Waddell said he and Colby had " an interesting conversation " this week and they would talk again over the break -- which sounded decidedly less hopeful than his Kubina comments .
As for Max , he praised his hard work and willingness to prove himself to the NHL when he could have gotten more money in the KHL .
" We will really need his goal scoring down the stretch . "
[ My interpretation : do n't invest in a Max jersey folks . ]
A final question about ownership and rumors of Thrashers relocation .
owner Bruce Levenson took this one : " Everyone wrote the obituary of hockey in Atlanta during the lockout -- and here we are 5 years later .
We are committed to building a team here .
This is one of the largest markets in the USA , I 'd rather own a team here than a number of other NHL cities .
We would n't have made a $ 101 million offer to Kovalchuk if we planned on bailing on hockey .
I live in DC and I remember a game when the Thrashers traveled up to play the Caps .
We beat them in their building and Kovy had two goals that night .
[ Waddell : " Who was the coach that night ? " -- it was Waddell as coach ]
It was a Monday night and there was nobody in the building -- just a few thousand people .
And now the Caps are the hottest ticket in DC .
That 's what winning can do .
I 'm good friends with the Caps owner and we talk about this all the time .
Just look at the Hawks .
When we bought them they were the laughing stock of the NBA .
We 've turned them around .
And now we 're trying our hardest to do that on the hockey side .
Final Observations .
I was impressed that the hostile questions were pretty rational and on point .
Often when people are really angry logic gives way to insults or shouting .
The hostile questions were much more civil than I expected .
The other thing that really shocked me is just how many people thought Kovalchuk had asked for too much money .
I heard a lot of people muttering that they liked him , but he was asking for too much .
I thought there would be more " Kovy at any price " people there tonight .
Bruce Levenson was much better this time , I would have liked to hear something about the budget for next season when he mentioned that they were committed to competing .
I hope you enjoyed reading this summary .
Please forgive whatever mistakes .
It 's 2 a.m. and I 'm totally worn out after putting the rest of my life on " pause " during Kovy Trade Week .
Don Waddell looked pretty tired too , at one point he called Evander Kane " Patrick Kane " which caused a few chuckles .

LEGALIZING POT LEGALIZING POT LOS ANGELES  James
Gray once saw himself as a drug warrior , a former federal prosecutor and county judge who sent people to prison for dealing pot and other drug offenses .
Gradually , though , he became convinced that the ban on marijuana was making it more accessible to young people , not less .
" I ask kids all the time , and they 'll tell you it is easier to get marijuana than a six - pack of beer because that is controlled by the government , " he said , noting that drug dealers do n't ask for IDs or honor minimum age requirements .
So Gray — who spent two decades as a superior court judge in Orange County , Calif . , and once ran for Congress as a Republican — switched sides in the war on drugs , becoming an advocate for legalizing marijuana .
" Let 's face reality , " he says .
" Taxing and regulating marijuana will make it less available to children than it is today . "
MARIJUANA FARM : Researchers focuses on limiting abuse BUST : Smell leads cops to 200 pot plants ATTITUDES SHIFT : Marijuana classes role POT CONTEST : Organizers cancel Michigan game Gray is part of a growing national movement to rethink pot laws .
From California , where lawmakers may outright legalize marijuana , to New Jersey , which implemented a medical use law Jan. 19 , states are taking unprecedented steps to loosen marijuana restrictions .
Advocates of legalizing marijuana say generational , political and cultural shifts have taken the USA to a unique moment in its history of drug prohibition that could topple 40 years of tough restrictions on both medicinal and recreational marijuana use .
A Gallup Poll last October found 44 % favor making marijuana legal , an eight - point jump since the question was asked in 2005 .
An ABC News - Washington Post poll in January found 81 % favor making marijuana legal for medical use .
Attorney General Eric
Holder last fall announced that raiding medical marijuana facilities would be the lowest priority for U.S. law enforcement agents — a major shift that is spurring many states to re-examine their policies .
The American Medical Association recommended in November that Congress reclassify marijuana as a drug with possible medicinal benefit .
OREGON CAFE : Medical marijuana users socialize , smoke 14TH STATE : N.J. approves medical marijuana bill
At least 14 states this year — some deeply conservative and Republican - leaning , such as Kansas — will consider legalizing pot for medical purposes or lessening the penalties for possessing small amounts for personal use .
Fourteen other states and the District of Columbia already have liberalized their marijuana laws .
" We are absolutely in an important new era in which increasing majorities of Americans are not just questioning the wisdom and efficacy of marijuana prohibition but are demanding alternatives , " says Stephen Gutwillig , California director for the Drug Policy Alliance , which favors legalizing marijuana .
Kurt Gardinier , spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project , which promotes marijuana for medical use , calls Holder 's shift " one of the most significant changes in federal drug policy in the last 30 years .
It puts states at ease that they wo n't be in conflict with the federal government . "
The Obama administration still opposes smoking marijuana for its medicinal benefit , says Tom McLellan , deputy director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy .
He says more research is needed to deliver the medically useful ingredients in a non-smokable form .
" We have the safest medications in the world and it's not a coincidence .
We have an enviable process by which we approve medications , and that 's through the ( Food and Drug Administration ) , " he says .
" It 's a bad idea to approve medication by popular vote . "
Yet even a few prominent opponents admit it 's getting harder for them to persuade lawmakers to continue tough restrictions on marijuana , though they vow to continue fighting against legalization and warn of dire long - term consequences .
" The momentum is not with us , and we understand that , " says Michael Carroll , president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the police chief of West Goshen Township in Chester County , Pa .
The 20,000 - member police chiefs association opposes legalizing medical marijuana and decreasing penalties for possession because it fears abusers will cause drugged - driving accidents and other societal and health problems that come with drug abuse .
The National Institute on Drug Abuse says marijuana can cause heart irregularities , lung problems and addiction .
" We 're going to multiply the problems we have with alcohol abuse , " Carroll says .
" Things are not going our way , but that 's not stopping us for speaking out about it . "
Among the states considering marijuana bills this year : • Alabama , Delaware , New York , North Carolina and Pennsylvania , are debating allowing medicinal use of marijuana for people with certain illnesses ; • Hawaii and Rhode Island , are considering bills to reduce the penalties for marijuana possession to fines rather than jail time ; • Vermont is weighing whether to allow state - licensed liquor stores to sell medical marijuana .
California leads the way California became the first state to allow marijuana for medical use when voters approved a statewide ballot issue in 1996 , and its provisions are so broad that tens of thousands of people have obtained a doctor 's recommendation to use marijuana for ailments from cancer to arthritis .
Now California 's Legislature is considering a bill that would make it the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use as well .
It is unlikely to pass this year , but Gray and other advocates hope to have a proposition on the November ballot that would legalize marijuana use for anyone 21 or older .
California would levy taxes that the state tax board says could raise $ 1.3 billion or more a year for the deficit - plagued state , while saving tens of millions in prison and law - enforcement costs .
Sponsors of the ballot issue have turned in 690,161 signatures on petitions for verification , far more than the 433,971 valid signatures required to get on the ballot .
A 2009 statewide Field Poll found 56 % support pot making pot legal for recreational use and taxing it .
The economics argument may be the clincher , proponents hope .
They call the proposition a matter of " tax and regulate " rather than " legalize , " saying state control will take marijuana out of criminals ' hands while generating badly needed revenue .
" It 's history repeating itself , with ( the ) alcohol prohibition repeal during the Great Depression , " says Richard Lee , an Oakland marijuana entrepreneur and president of Oaksterdam University , which trains people to work in the medical marijuana industry .
Lee , who is pushing the ballot issue , says , " Now we have the Great Recession .
That will be on people 's minds . "
Yet as changing attitudes and economic forces propel the legal pot movement in California , some wrinkles have emerged as the medical marijuana industry expands .
After some complaints from neighbors , municipalities and prosecutors are moving to regulate the industry more closely to limit the growth of pot dispensaries and prevent sales for recreational use .
Prosecutors in Los Angeles and San Diego contend that while the law allows marijuana for medical uses , it does not specifically permit the sale of marijuana .
They have launched a series of raids aimed at closing some of the hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries now operating out of storefronts .
" I call it the slippery slope , " says Dennis Zine , an Los Angeles city councilman .
" Now we have it for medical purposes .
Now let 's expand it to anyone who wants to get high ?
I do n't support that .
...
Do we then legalize cocaine , legalize heroin ? "
Tehama County , Calif. , Sheriff Clay Parker said the state 's current medical marijuana law is filled with gray areas that make enforcement uneven and difficult .
He says he opposes further relaxation of state laws but would welcome a federal change that would drop marijuana 's status as a Schedule 1 controlled substance , the most tightly restricted , to a lower level that would place marijuana in a category with prescription drugs that pharmacies could dispense .
Gray , who retired as a judge in 2009 , says many judges agree with him that sending marijuana users to jail places a costly burden on the state and clogs the justice system , ultimately taking police and court resources from pursuing violent criminals .
Most judges , he says , fear saying so .
" Probably half of my colleagues talk privately the same way I do , but publicly they 're concerned about standing out , " he says .
Jeff Studdard , 46 , is another one - time drug warrior who has changed his thinking .
A former school police officer and Los Angeles County sheriff 's deputy , Studdard tried marijuana to ease pain and restore his appetite after a broken back forced him out of law enforcement .
" I have stopped all my ( other ) pain meds now and I 've gained weight .
It 's almost like a wonder drug , " he says .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , a Democrat from San Francisco who introduced the tax and regulate bill , predicts California eventually will legalize marijuana and other states will follow .
" It 's inevitable that there will be some kind of legalization of recreational marijuana , " Ammiano says .
" How and where it 's going to happen I think is an open question , but I think a lot sooner than later . "
Support not politically risky Despite growing popular acceptance of marijuana , battles are still fought in state legislatures when such bills are introduced , and many of the bills still fail .
Yet advocates say politicians are more willing to take on what only a few years ago was a politically risky cause .
" Politicians are finally catching up with the American public , " Gardinier says .
Most of the changes have come on the West Coast and Northeast , but lawmakers in a few Southern and Central states also are proposing bills , in part because they see marijuana as a potential money - maker , says Gutwillig of the Drug Policy Alliance .
Rhode Island is among the states considering legislation that would regulate and tax marijuana or reduce penalties for personal use to a misdemeanor and fine .
Rhode Island 's Legislature adopted medical marijuana last year , setting up dispensaries and a registration system .
A decriminalization bill introduced in the 75 - member House has 35 co-signers , including three of the six Republican lawmakers .
Sen. Joshua Miller , a Democrat from Cranston , R.I. , leads a Senate commission that is studying whether to drop tough penalties for marijuana use .
He says statewide polls show 80 % of Rhode Islanders favor decriminalization .
Rhode Island borders Massachusetts , which decriminalized marijuana last year .
The debate , he says , has been framed by the state 's poor financial condition .
" We 'd rather spend our resources on violent crime , " he says .
" I 'd also argue that the best way to get to people who abuse drugs is treatment over incarceration . "
That argument is being reinforced at the federal level by President Obama 's drug czar Gil Kerlikowske , a former Seattle police chief who favors a treatment - driven approach to drug abuse .
Even in conservative Kansas , where the Legislature recently voted to outlaw a synthetic drug that mimics marijuana , backers of looser marijuana laws say they have hope .
Rep. Gail Finney , a first - term Democrat , has proposed legalizing marijuana for use by the critically ill .
The bill is unlikely to pass this year , Finney says , but she wants to use the hearings to educate fellow lawmakers and plans to reintroduce it until it passes .
" It 's time for Kansas to have an open , honest debate about this , " she says .
She thinks many of her House colleagues would support the bill if they did n't fear backlash in an election year — a fear she says is unfounded .
A Feb. 2 poll of 500 Kansans by KWCH - TV in Wichita found 58 % supported medical marijuana .
" If they were in touch and in tune with their constituents , " Finney says , " they would know that this is what they want . "
Leinwand reported from Washington .

Senate leaders Tuesday night resolved an impasse over emergency aid to the jobless that had driven a wedge into Republican ranks and given Democrats a political weapon .
The deal overcame the continued objections of a single senator , Republican Jim Bunning of Kentucky , who for days had held up short - term extensions of unemployment and COBRA benefits over concerns that the bill would increase the federal deficit .
To pacify Bunning , Senate Democrats agreed to allow a floor vote on an amendment to offset the cost of the bill .
The amendment did not survive a procedural objection .
The 30 - day extension then passed on a 78 - 19 vote .
For at least the next month , hundreds of thousands of people can continue to receive jobless benefits and the federal government can continue to assume a greater share of their COBRA health insurance costs .
The bill also delays a threatened 20 % cut in fees for doctors who treat Medicare patients .
And it temporarily replenishes the depleted Highway Trust Fund , which will allow suspended construction projects to resume and 2,000 furloughed federal employees to return to work .
Bunning began his one - man blockade Thursday , when he refused to accede to a plan endorsed by both Democratic and Republican Senate leaders that , by unanimous consent , would have approved a short - term extension of several federal programs set to expire Monday .
He argued that because the Senate had adopted pay - as - you - go rules , the bill had to identify how its cost would be offset .
“ If we ca n’t find $ 10 billion to pay for something that all 100 senators support , we ’re in deep trouble , ” he said Tuesday night .
“ We are on an unsustainable path , as far as the budget . ”
The standoff mushroomed into a significant distraction for Senate Republicans , many of whom were torn between supporting Bunning on principle and being viewed as denying aid to the jobless .
Democrats , for their part , gleefully cast Bunning as the poster child for gridlock .
“ It ’s wrong for one senator to prevent people from getting the help they deserve , ” Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) said Tuesday .
The agreement to pass the bill may have been driven in part by a Republican moderate , Sen. Susan Collins of Maine .
Early Tuesday , she called on Bunning to stand down .
He refused .
“ The present stalemate is unacceptable , ” Collins said in an interview .
“ This has real - life consequences for people in this country . ”
But Bunning drew support from fiscal conservatives nationwide , and some colleagues cheered him on from the sidelines .
“ I respect him for the courage he showed , ” Sen . Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) said Monday .
Bunning , 78 , had little to lose .
The Hall of Fame pitcher had already decided to retire when his term expired early next year , after it became clear that the GOP establishment would not back him for reelection .
Late Tuesday , as the vote approached , Bunning conceded like an athlete , saying he had , in a sense , left it all on the field .

Anatomy of a Planeswalker Card
Planeswalker cards differ from most other cards .
Taking a look at a card , you 'll see :
As with other cards , the name appears at the top of the card , next to …
The mana cost , what you pay to cast the spell from your hand .
The type line .
All planeswalkers are also legendary .
This means you ca n’t have control of two planeswalkers with the same full name at the same time .
On older planeswalkers , the word “ legendary ” may not be printed on the type line , but all planeswalkers fall under this rule .
For example , if you control Jace , Ingenious Mind Mage and cast Jace , Cunning Castaway , nothing happens .
You can keep both planeswalkers as they have different full names .
But if you cast a second Jace , Ingenious Mind Mage , you ’ll put one of them into your graveyard ..
Each Planeswalker has a number of activated abilities on it .
You can use one of these abilities whenever you could play a sorcery , and only if none of that Planeswalker 's abilities have been played yet that turn .
On this card :
+ 1 means “ Add one loyalty counter to this Planeswalker . ”
If that ’s the one ability you activate during your turn , you ’ll draw a card .
- 9 means “ Remove nine loyalty counters from this Planeswalker . ”
If that ’s the one ability you activate during your turn , you ’ll gain control of up three target creatures .
You ca n’t activate an ability with a negative loyalty cost unless that Planeswalker has at least that many loyalty counters on it .
BlackBerry users may be ready to move on to other smartphone platforms , suggesting that RIM is n't keeping up with consumer demand in its efforts to combat growing encroachment from the likes of iPhone and Android .
In fact , two in five BlackBerry owners plan to swap their current device for an iPhone when it's time to upgrade , according to market researcher firm Crowd Science .
The iPhone has had a lasting effect on the smartphone market , changing the conception of what a smartphone should be almost overnight after the launch of the original iPhone in 2007 .
Despite RIM 's entrenchment among business users , however , the iPhone platform has grown at a faster rate than the BlackBerry over the last year .
Perhaps the trend can be explained by Crowd Science 's findings that many are using their smartphones for both personal and business use .
Nearly a third of iPhone owners use their device for strictly personal use , versus just 16 percent for BlackBerry users .
Just one percent of iPhone owners use their device for business only — no surprise there — so two - thirds are using an iPhone for business and personal use .
And , while the BlackBerry has a reputation as the best enterprise mobile device , a scant seven percent of BlackBerrys users dedicate the device to business use only .
That leaves over three - quarters of BlackBerry owners using their device for dual purposes .
The iPhone is n't the only platform attracting the attention of BlackBerry users , though .
Interest in Android - based devices has grown since the introduction of Google 's Nexus One , with 32 percent of BlackBerry users surveyed saying they would swap their current device for a Nexus One .
" These results show that the restlessness of BlackBerry users with their current brand has n't just been driven by the allure of iPhone , " John Martin , CEO of Crowd Science , said in a statement .
" Rather , BlackBerry as a brand just is n't garnering the loyalty seen with other mobile operating systems . "
About 90 percent of current iPhone and Android users plan to stick with their current platform for their next phone upgrade .
ACAPULCO
Los organizadores manifestaron que el evento es exclusivamente para los turistas internacionales y que para los nacionales no habrá acceso .

ACAPULCO , Gro. —
Autoridades del estado impidieron al turismo nacional presenciar el concierto que se realizó en la playa , para promover el puerto , luego de la jornada violenta que se vivió el fin de semana largo .
El gobierno del estado contrató a la cadena televisiva MTV Latinoamérica por aproximadamente 20 millones de pesos para ofrecer dos espectáculos denominados Guerrero Brilla .
Ayer se presentó el primer evento y los organizadores advirtieron que es “ exclusivamente para los turistas internacionales que vienen en el fenómeno conocido como spring breakers ” .
El gran escenario de la cadena televisiva MTV fue colocado en el área federal donde se ubica el hotel Crown Plaza y el único acceso a la zona de bañistas fue bloqueado al inició de las transmisiones para América Latina .
La secretaria de Turismo en Acapulco , Jessica García Rojas , justificó la actitud de los organizadores , pero dijo que cualquier persona que pase por la playa “ puede escuchar el espectáculo ” .
Dijo que para los turistas nacionales que se espera arribarán durante las vacaciones de Semana Santa , el gobierno municipal también les otorgará espectáculos gratuitos en la playa con conciertos de músicos locales .
Al inaugurar el concierto de MTV en este puerto por parte del secretario de Fomento Turístico ( Sefotur ) y del alcalde Manuel Añorve Baños , se registró un conato de violencia y agresión por personal de seguridad del evento contra los medios de comunicación , ya que no permitieron tomar imágenes de los funcionarios en el escenario principal .
El alcalde se solidarizó con la prensa y les hizo saber a los organizadores que si no entraban los comunicadores , entonces él se retiraría , solicitud que fue aceptada y los fotógrafos y camarógrafos hicieron su trabajo durante sólo tres minutos
No será otro Ciudad Juárez El pasado fin de semana Guerrero , y en especial Acapulco vivieron una jornada sangrienta con más de 40 ejecutados .
El encargado de la Procuraduría de Justicia , Albertico Guinto Sierra , dijo que Acapulco no se convertirá en una copia de Ciudad Juárez en cuanto al número de asesinatos por la pelea de bandas del crimen organizado .
Afirmó que el ataque contra policías de Chilpancingo no tiene relación con los hechos ocurridos en el puerto .
Los 40 muertos fue un hecho extraordinario .
Dr. Sharon L. Vanderlip has been performing debarking surgeries for more than 30 years as a small part of her veterinary practice in San Diego County .
She calls herself a “ big , big , big proponent ” of the procedure if it is done the right way , for the right reasons .
“ They recover immediately and they do n’t ever seem to notice any difference , ” she said .
“ I think that in certain cases it can certainly save a dog from ending up being euthanized .
If properly done , they behave totally the same afterwards and do n’t seem to have any health problems . ”
The surgery can be relatively simple .
The doctor anesthetizes the dog before cutting its vocal cords , either through the mouth or through an incision in the larynx .
Dogs generally recover quickly , veterinarians say , and while they usually can still make sounds , their barks become muffled and raspy .
Image Truffle , left , may well face the same procedure , Dr. Marder said .

Dr. Gary W. Ellison , of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida , cautioned that the procedure can lead to complications .
He said he has had to operate on debarked dogs after excess scar tissue built up in the throat , making it difficult for the dog to breathe .
“ I think it ’s probably going to be a procedure that ’s done by fewer and fewer veterinarians ” in the coming years , said Dr. Ellison , the curriculum director at the University of Florida ’s veterinary school .
He said professors there do not teach the surgery , and that he has not come across recent veterinary school graduates who have studied the procedure .
Banfield , the Pet Hospital , which has more than 750 veterinary practices across the country , formally banned the surgery last summer , though Jeffrey S. Klausner , the hospital ’s senior vice president and chief medical officer , said it was rarely , if ever , practiced before that .
You know what they say about people with big brains …
Or , actually , maybe you do n't .
Despite being a major concept underlying of the neurobiology of intelligence for the last 150 years or so , the connection between brain size and smarts is n't well - understood by Joe and Jane Average .
Does it mean smaller people — including women — are less intelligent ?
What about animals , like elephants , that have much larger brains than ours ?
Are our academic destinies really written in our hat size ?
It 's complicated .
We know that brain size and intelligence are correlated , but that simple fact is only a starting point for a much more intricate story — one that science is only beginning to understand .
First off , yes , bigger brains really do seem to be smarter brains .
That correlation has been pretty solidly proven , experts say , and the connection gets stronger when you calculate total brain volume via MRI technology or post - mortem analysis , rather than simply running a tape measure around somebody 's head .
Basically , the more accurate and precise the brain measurement , the more size and smarts are connected .
How connected varies a bit , depending on the methodology , but an analysis of previous research , published in 2005 in the journal Intelligence , found a .33 correlation at the population level .
Which means , if you look at humans as a whole , a little more than 10 % of the difference in intelligence from person to person can be accounted for by brain size .
That 's statistically significant .
But it also means overall brain size is n't the only thing affecting intelligence .
Case in point : Gender .
" It is true that women have smaller brains than men , " said Sandra Witelson , Ph.D , professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University in Canada .
" But numerous studies have shown that women are n't any less intelligent overall than men . "
That works because male and female brains are built differently , according to Witelson and other researchers .
" If you look at the brain areas related to intelligence in men , they 're different than the brain areas associated with intelligence in women .
It implies at least two different brain architectures that lead to the same level of intelligence , " said Richard Haier , Ph.D. , a neuroscience consultant and professor emeritus at the University of California , Irvine .
Something about the way women 's brains are built allows us to do the same thinking in a smaller space .
This difference helped tip researchers off to other factors that we now know are also correlated with variations in overall intelligence — and with variations in particular types of intelligence , such as verbal and spatial .
Small differences in the placement and size of patches of grey matter ( the stuff that does the thinking ) and white matter ( the stuff that helps the thinking get done more efficiently ) can make a big difference in IQ .
Take Einstein .
In 1999 , Witelson 's laboratory studied the great thinker 's preserved brain .
" His brain was smack within normal brain size for his age , " she said .
" But he had a region in the parietal lobe that is crucial for visual imagery and mathematical thinking that was exceptionally large in his case .
We suggest that it was the expansion of that region that gave him this extraordinary ability . "
This also might help explain why some animals with larger brains are less intelligent than animals with smaller brains — the inner architecture and wiring of their brains are different .
Basically , " bigger brain = smarter " is a good rule of thumb , but it comes with a lot of " buts " .
Brain size can give you a general idea , but to make a really accurate prediction of any individual 's intelligence , you 'd need to look at multiple factors — from whether the person was right - or left - handed , to their gender , to their grey matter .
Some answers are there , researchers say , but they do n't fit easily into a sound byte .
Lars Chittka , Ph.D. , professor of sensory and behavioral ecology at Queen Mary , University of London , and Jeremy Gray , Ph.D. , associate professor in the department of psychology at Yale University , were also interviewed for this story .
Their help was invaluable in piecing together the big picture of brain size and intelligence .
We 've just launched an exciting new project which , as you can see from the screenshot above , looks ( and behaves ) a bit differently from most other things on the Guardian site .
Zeitgeist is a visual record of what people are currently finding interesting on guardian .
co.uk at the moment .
While other bits of the site are curated by editors ( like the front page , or individual sections ) or metadata ( like blogs , which display in reverse - chronological order ) , Zeitgeist is dynamic , powered by the attention of users , which is why we 've put this into the Community section .
The combination of content objects changes throughout the day , sometimes by the minute , as activity shifts around the site , stories get linked to or talked about , new stories are published and become widely - read and so on .
You can also explore what was attracting attention on a given day in history ( 2010 only , for the time being ) via the " previous " and " next " navigation links .
As well as being a different way to display and explore content , it 's also a bit of an experiment .
It 's not finished yet , and indeed may never be totally finished , but will continue to evolve and change over coming days , weeks , months ... and beyond .
What you see today is functional , but be warned : it may break now and then , or look odd in various browsers as we continue to tweak and modify the code and design .
We wanted to get it out there and live so you can see a bit of what we 're up to and offer advice , feedback and comments ( constructive please ) .
To make it easy to see what 's hot at a glance , we 've colour - coded each content block in line with the section it belongs to on the site ( these are the same colours used in the navigation bar at the top of each page ) .
A side - effect of using section colours is that you can see sections ebb and flow throughout the week .
In the course of building this app , we 've noticed that it looks like more " News " articles become prominent on Mondays , while more " Lifestyle " articles get attention at the weekend .
But humans are very good to spotting / inventing patterns where there are none : maybe over time there 'll be enough data to analyse it properly .
We hope that this makes for an interesting alternative springboard into the content on this site , and those who have been playing with it behind the scenes can confirm that it's a great starting point when you 've got a few minutes spare and just want something to read but you 're not sure where to start .
So how does a story end up in the Zeitgeist ?
Time , as the shampoo adverts say , for the science bit .
To start with we wanted to look at how people use the site .
A very blunt way to do this is page views , which has its place but is n't that helpful in this context .
Instead we 're analysing and combining all sorts of things ; where people come from , where they go to next , how long they stay on a particular page , if the page is getting passed round twitter and other social websites , number ( and rate ) of comments and so on .
We 're taking a range of these variables - enough that a single datapoint does n't skew the results - and mushing ( that 's the technical term ) them all together to get a value of " Zeitgeistiness " ( another technical term ) for each content object .
But - and this is the important bit - each content object only gets compared to other items in the same section , which in real terms means that Football articles only get compared to other Football articles , Technology blogposts against other Technology blogposts and so on .
In fact , we go one step further , and take the type of article and day of week into consideration : an Environment gallery on a Monday only gets compared to others of the same type / section also published on Mondays .
Because we 've been storing and analysing this data overnight for a while now , we 've got a good baseline to work from .
So when something appears on the Zeitgeist page , it 's because it performed better ( got more attention ) than the norm for that content type / section / day .
This makes Zeitgeist significantly different from " most read " and " most commented on " lists which appear on this site and others , which often contain a particular columnist or section which routinely gets more attention than other sections .
For example , Charlie Brooker ( who regularly gets lots of attention on and off our site in the form of comments , visits and references / links all over the social web whenever he writes something for The Guardian ) will only appear in Zeitgest when a particular column is being significantly more Zeitgeisty than usual .
Sometimes the items shown on the Zeitgeist page move around quite a bit , other - times they seem quite steady with one story taking up the main slot for the whole day .
At around midnight the Zeitgeistiness for the whole day is calculated , with the most attention - attracting stories of the day frozen in time and placed into the archive .
More news will emerge in time as we continue developing and tweaking .
In the meantime , why not take a quick peek , come back a few times during the day , maybe use it to dive into the site for a while and let us know what you think - and how you 'd like to see it evolve - in the comments .
Update : Friday 5 February ( am )
Thanks for all the comments and feedback below and on Twitter / other blogs .
Lots to chew over .
A few people have been asking where we get the various metrics which make up the Zeitgeist algorithm .
In the post above , we 've highlighted some of the kinds of metrics , but in terms of sources , there are three main ones :
1. Visits , bounce rate , dwell , search terms and so on are provided by querying our site traffic metrics
2. " Social signals " ( mentions on Twitter , etc. ) come from site - specific search results powered by OneRiot 's nifty API
3 . Number , recency and rate of comments on content objects are calculated from the commenting platform used across guardian .co.uk
Some people have also asked about the name Zeitgeist and wondered why we 're using it .
Zeitgeist is a German word which means " spirit of the times " and is commonly used to capture the cultural / intellectual mood and interests or sociocultural direction of a particular nation or group of people at a particular time - in our case , Guardian readers and site users .
We have n't created Zeitgeist to replace the front page , or more traditional navigation on the site ( which some people seem to have assumed ) , but rather as an alternative filter , for those who occasionally want to explore what others have been finding interesting recently .
It 's a mirror of attention , not an active promotion of particular kinds of content .
As such , the contents will vary in tone , section and reason for inclusion .
As we said in the blogpost above , this is a work in progress and will continue to develop and change .
In fact , we 're doing a bit of tinkering with the algorithm ( and the design ) today , so do keep checking the Zeitgeist page for updates and changes .
Another update : Friday 5 February ( pm )
Quite a few people have noted that some of the section colours can be difficult to read .
In fact , the section colours are already in use throughout the site as headers and in the navigation , for example , but presented as solid blocks here , which means that if certain combinations of sections appear in zeitgeist the visual impact can be a little jarring .
Since we unveiled the current " design " , we 've heard people refer to the news disco , Elmer the elephant and Piet Mondriaan .
Some people seem to love the colours , others not so much .
So in response to these comments , we 've just made it possible to see the Zeitgeist blocks in high contrast , if you so desire .
To switch on this view , just click the little " high contrast " link ( next to the previous / next navigation links ) .
In high contrast view , the blocks appear in shades of grey , which correspond to sections , though we 've now added the section names to the blocks to make it even easier to recognise the source .
We have n't made the images black and white - there 's only one image included in the high contrast version - but do let us know what you think : does this make it easier to read , if you were concerned about colour ?
Please bear in mind that this is n't a final design , as we said in the original post - we 're going to keep changing and tweaking it in line with your feedback and other things we 're already working on .
The story , still sometimes repeated in creationist circles , goes like this : it is the 1960s , at Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland , and a team of astronomers is using cutting - edge computers to recreate the orbits of the planets , thousands of years in the past .
Suddenly , an error message flashes up .
There 's a problem : way back in history , one whole day appears to be missing .
The scientists are baffled , until a Christian member of the team dimly recalls something and rushes to fetch a Bible .
He thumbs through it until he reaches the Book of Joshua , chapter 10 , in which Joshua asks God to stop the world for . . . " about a full day ! "
Uproar in the computer lab .
The astronomers have happened upon proof that God controls the universe on a day - to - day basis , that the Bible is literally true , and that by extension the " myth " of creation is , in fact , a reality .
Darwin was wrong – according to another creationist rumour , he 'd recanted on his deathbed , anyway – and here , at last , is scientific evidence !
Inevitably , those of us who are n't professional scientists have to take a lot of science on trust .
And one of the things that makes it so easy to trust the standard view of evolution , in particular , is amply illustrated by the legend of the Nasa astronomers : the doubters are so deluded or dishonest that one need n't waste time with them .
Unfortunately , that also makes it embarrassingly awkward to ask a question that seems , in the light of recent studies and several popular books , to be growing ever more pertinent .
What if Darwin 's theory of evolution – or , at least , Darwin 's theory of evolution as most of us learned it at school and believe we understand it – is , in crucial respects , not entirely accurate ?
Such talk , naturally , is liable to drive evolutionary biologists into a rage , or , in the case of Richard Dawkins , into even more of a rage than usual .
They have a point : nobody wants to provide ammunition to the proponents of creationism or " intelligent design " , and it 's true that few of the studies now coming to public prominence are all that revolutionary to the experts .
But in the culture at large , we may be on the brink of a major shift in perspective , with enormous implications for how most of us think about how life came to be the way it is .
As the science writer David Shenk puts it in his new book , The Genius in All of Us , " This is big , big stuff – perhaps the most important [ discoveries ] in the science of heredity since the gene . "
Take , to begin with , the Swedish chickens .
Three years ago , researchers led by a professor at the university of Linköping in Sweden created a henhouse that was specially designed to make its chicken occupants feel stressed .
The lighting was manipulated to make the rhythms of night and day unpredictable , so the chickens lost track of when to eat or roost .
Unsurprisingly , perhaps , they showed a significant decrease in their ability to learn how to find food hidden in a maze .
The surprising part is what happened next : the chickens were moved back to a non-stressful environment , where they conceived and hatched chicks who were raised without stress – and yet these chicks , too , demonstrated unexpectedly poor skills at finding food in a maze .
They appeared to have inherited a problem that had been induced in their mothers through the environment .
Further research established that the inherited change had altered the chicks ' " gene expression " – the way certain genes are turned " on " or " off " , bestowing any given animal with specific traits .
The stress had affected the mother hens on a genetic level , and they had passed it on to their offspring .
The Swedish chicken study was one of several recent breakthroughs in the youthful field of epigenetics , which primarily studies the epigenome , the protective package of proteins around which genetic material – strands of DNA – is wrapped .
The epigenome plays a crucial role in determining which genes actually express themselves in a creature 's traits : in effect , it switches certain genes on or off , or turns them up or down in intensity .
It is n't news that the environment can alter the epigenome ; what 's news is that those changes can be inherited .
And this does n't , of course , apply only to chickens : some of the most striking findings come from research involving humans .
One study , again from Sweden , looked at lifespans in Norrbotten , the country 's northernmost province , where harvests are usually sparse but occasionally overflowing , meaning that , historically , children sometimes grew up with wildly varying food intake from one year to the next .
A single period of extreme overeating in the midst of the usual short supply , researchers found , could cause a man 's grandsons to die an average of 32 years earlier than if his childhood food intake had been steadier .
Your own eating patterns , this implies , may affect your grandchildren 's lifespans , years before your grandchildren – or even your children – are a twinkle in anybody 's eye .
It might not be immediately obvious why this has such profound implications for evolution .
In the way it 's generally understood , the whole point of natural selection – the so - called " modern synthesis " of Darwin 's theories with subsequent discoveries about genes – is its beautiful , breathtaking , devastating simplicity .
In each generation , genes undergo random mutations , making offspring subtly different from their parents ; those mutations that enhance an organism 's abilities to thrive and reproduce in its own particular environment will tend to spread through populations , while those that make successful breeding less likely will eventually peter out .
As years of bestselling books by Dawkins , Daniel Dennett and others have seeped into the culture , we 've come to understand that the awesome power of natural selection – frequently referred to as the best idea in the history of science – lies in the sheer elegance of the way such simple principles have generated the unbelievable complexities of life .
From two elementary notions – random mutation , and the filtering power of the environment – have emerged , over millennia , such marvels as eyes , the wings of birds and the human brain .
Yet epigenetics suggests this is n't the whole story .
If what happens to you during your lifetime – living in a stress - inducing henhouse , say , or overeating in northern Sweden – can affect how your genes express themselves in future generations , the absolutely simple version of natural selection begins to look questionable .
Rather than genes simply " offering up " a random smorgasbord of traits in each new generation , which then either prove suited or unsuited to the environment , it seems that the environment plays a role in creating those traits in future generations , if only in a short - term and reversible way .
You begin to feel slightly sorry for the much - mocked pre-Darwinian zoologist Jean - Baptiste Lamarck , whose own version of evolution held , most famously , that giraffes have long necks because their ancestors were " obliged to browse on the leaves of trees and to make constant efforts to reach them " .
As a matter of natural history , he probably was n't right about how giraffes ' necks came to be so long .
But Lamarck was scorned for a much more general apparent mistake : the idea that lifestyle might be able to influence heredity .
" Today , " notes David Shenk , " any high school student knows that genes are passed on unchanged from parent to child , and to the next generation and the next .
Lifestyle cannot alter heredity .
Except now it turns out that it can . . . "
Epigenetics is the most vivid reason why the popular understanding of evolution might need revising , but it 's not the only one .
We 've learned that huge proportions of the human genome consist of viruses , or virus - like materials , raising the notion that they got there through infection – meaning that natural selection acts not just on random mutations , but on new stuff that 's introduced from elsewhere .
Relatedly , there is growing evidence , at the level of microbes , of genes being transferred not just vertically , from ancestors to parents to offspring , but also horizontally , between organisms .
The researchers Carl Woese and Nigel Goldenfield conclude that , on average , a bacterium may have obtained 10 % of its genes from other organisms in its environment .
To an outsider , this is mind - blowing : since most of the history of life on earth has been the history of micro-organisms , the evidence for horizontal transfer suggests that a mainly Darwinian account of evolution may be only the latest version , applicable to the most recent , much more complex forms of life .
Perhaps , before that , most evolution was based on horizontal exchange .
Which gives rise to a compelling philosophical puzzle : if a genome is what defines an organism , yet those organisms can swap genes freely , what does it even mean to draw a clear line between one organism and another ?
" It 's natural to wonder , " Goldenfield told New Scientist recently , " if the very concept of an organism in isolation is still valid at this level . "
In natural selection , we all know , the fittest win out over their rivals .
But what if you can't establish clear boundaries between rivals in the first place ?
It is a decade since the biologist Randy Thornhill and the anthropologist Craig Palmer published The Natural History of Rape .
In the book , they made an argument that – however obnoxious at first glance – seemed , to many , to follow straightforwardly from the logic of natural selection .
Evolution tells us that the traits that flourish down the generations are the ones that help organisms reproduce .
Evolutionary psychology argues that there 's no reason to exclude psychological traits .
And since rape is indeed a trait that occurs all too frequently in human society , it follows that a desire to commit rape must be adaptive .
There must be a genetic basis for it – a " rape gene " , in the words of some media stories following the book 's publication – because , in prehistoric times , those men who possessed the tendency would reproduce more successfully than those who did n't .
Therefore , the authors concluded , rape was – to use a loaded term that has been getting Darwinians in trouble since Darwin – " natural " .
Understandably , the book was hugely controversial .
But by the time it was published , there was nothing all that radical about the idea that natural selection might be able to illuminate any and every aspect of human behaviour .
Evolutionary psychology , in the hands of various practitioners , sought to explain why militarism is so prevalent in human societies , or why men tend to dominate women in so many hierarchical organisations .
If the field seems less politically charged these days , that is only because it has permeated our consciousness so deeply that it has become less questioned .
For much of the late Noughties , a week never seemed to pass without one new book or news story attributing some facet of modern - day life to the evolutionary past : men were more prone to sexual jealousy than women because a woman who conceives becomes unavailable for imminent future acts of reproduction ; men preferred women with waist - to - hip ratios of 0.7 because of natural selection .
It explained music and art and why we reward senior executives with top - floor corner offices ( because we evolved to want a clear view of our enemies approaching across the savannah ) .
Leftwing and feminist critics did frequently misinterpret evolutionary psychology , imagining that when scholars described some trait as adaptive , they meant it was morally justifiable .
But that was how many such findings – often better described as speculations – came to be believed .
We 're not exactly saying it 's right for , say , men to sleep around , evolutionary psychologists would observe with a knowing sigh , but . . . well , good luck trying to change millennia of evolved behaviour .
Far more than biologists , evolutionary psychologists bought in to the ultra - simple version of natural selection , and so they stand to lose far more from advances in our understanding of what 's really been going on .
They were always prone to telling " just - so stories " – spinning plausible tales about why some trait might be adaptive , instead of demonstrating that it was – and numerous recent studies have begun to chip away at what evidence there was .
( That waist - to - hip ratio finding , for example , does n't seem to hold up in the face of international and historical research . )
And now , if epigenetics and other developments are coming to suggest that environment can alter heredity , the very terms of the debate – of nature versus nurture – suddenly become shaky .
It 's not even a matter of settling on a compromise , a " mixture " of nature and nurture .
Rather , the concepts of " nature " and " nurture " seem to be growing meaningless .
What does " nature " even mean if you can nurture the nature of your descendants ?
This is one central argument of Shenk 's new book , subheaded Why Everything You 've Been Told About Genetics , Talent and IQ is Wrong .
All our popular notions about talent and " genetic gifts " , he points out , start to collapse if the eating habits of Tiger Woods 's ancestors , for example , might have played a role in Woods 's golfing abilities .
( Woods always crops up in discussions on the origins of genius ; more recently , he has started cropping up in evolutionary psychology discussions about whether promiscuity is inevitable . )
" What all this evidence shows is that we need a much more subtle and nuanced understanding of Darwinism and natural selection , " Shenk says .
" I think that 's inevitably going to happen among scientists .
The question is how much nuance will carry over into the public sphere . . . it 's really funny how difficult it is to have this conversation , even with a lot of people who understand the science .
We 're stuck with a pretty limited way of viewing all this , and I think part of that comes from the terms " – such as nature and nurture – " that we have . "
Among the arsenal of studies at Shenk 's disposal is one published last year in the Journal of Neuroscience , involving mice bred to possess genetically inherited memory problems .
As small recompense for having been bred to be scatterbrained , they were kept in an environment full of stimulating mouse fun : plenty of toys , exercise and attention .
Key aspects of their memory skills were shown to improve , and crucially so did those of their offspring , even though the offspring had never experienced the stimulating environment , even as foetuses .
" If a geneticist had suggested as recently as the 1990s that a 12 - year - old kid could improve the intellectual nimbleness of his or her future children by studying harder now , " writes Shenk , " that scientist would have been laughed right out of the hall . "
Not so now .
And then there is Jerry Fodor , the American philosopher .
I started reading What Darwin Got Wrong , the new book he has co-authored with the cognitive scientist Massimo Piattelli - Palmarini , one morning , along with that day 's first coffee .
A few pages later , as the coffee kicked in , I grasped with astonishment what Fodor had done .
He had n't just identified evidence that natural selection was more complicated than previously thought – he'd uncovered a glaring flaw in the whole notion !
Natural selection , he explains , simply " cannot be the primary engine of evolution " .
I got up and refilled my cup .
But by the time I returned , his argument had slipped from my grasp .
Suddenly , he seemed obviously wrong , tied up in philosophical knots of his own creation .
I alternated between these two convictions .
Was Fodor 's critique so devastatingly correct that his critics – Dawkins , Dennett , the Cambridge philosopher Simon Blackburn , and many others – simply could n't see it ?
Had he actually managed to . .
. but then it slipped away again , vanishing into mental fog .
I called Fodor and asked him to explain his point in language an infant school pupil could understand .
" Ca n't be done , " he shot back .
" These issues really are complicated .
If we 're right that Darwin and Darwinists have missed the point we 've been making for 150 years , that 's not because it 's a simple point and Darwin was stupid .
It 's a really complicated issue . "
Fodor 's objection is a distant cousin of one that rears its head every few years : does n't " survival of the fittest " just mean " survival of those that survive " , since the only criterion of fitness is that a creature does , indeed , survive and reproduce ?
The American rightwing noisemaker Ann Coulter makes the point in her 2006 pro-creationist tirade Godless : The Church of American Liberalism .
" Through the process of natural selection , the ' fittest ' survive , [ but ] who are the ' fittest ' ?
The ones who survive ! " she sneers .
" Why , look – it happens every time !
The ' survival of the fittest ' would be a joke if it were n't part of the belief system of a fanatical cult infesting the Scientific Community . "
This argument , perhaps uniquely among all arguments ever made by Coulter , feels persuasive , not least because it is a reasonable criticism of some pop-Darwinism .
In fact , though , it 's entirely possible for scientists to measure fitness using criteria other than survival , and thus to avoid circular logic .
For example , you might hypothesise that speed is a helpful thing to have if you 're an antelope , then hypothesise the kind of leg structure you 'd want to have , as an antelope , in order to run fast ; then you 'd examine antelopes to see if they do indeed have something approximating this kind of leg structure , and you 'd examine the fossil record , to see if other kinds of leg died out .
Fodor 's point is more complex than this , although it 's also possible that it is not really a point at all : several reviews of the book by professional evolutionary theorists and philosophers have concluded that it is , indeed , nonsense .
As far as I can make out , it can be summarised in three steps .
Step one : Fodor notes – undeniably correctly – that not every trait a creature possesses is necessarily adaptive .
Some just come along for the ride : for example , genes that express as tameness in domesticated foxes and dogs also seem to express as floppy ears , for no evident reason .
Other traits are , as logicians say , " coextensive " : a polar bear , for example , has the trait of " whiteness " and also the trait of " being the same colour as its environment " .
( Yes , that 's a brain - stretching , possibly insanity - inducing statement .
Take a deep breath . )
Step two : natural selection , according to its theorists , is a force that " selects for " certain traits .
( Floppy ears appear to serve no purpose , so while they may have been " selected " , as a matter of fact , they were n't " selected for " .
And polar bears , we 'd surely all agree , were " selected for " being the same colour as their environment , not for being white per se : being white is no use as camouflage if snow is , say , orange . )
Step three is Fodor 's coup de grace : how , he says , can that possibly be ?
The whole point of Darwinian evolution is that it has no mind , no intelligence .
But to " select for " certain traits – as opposed to just " selecting " them by not having them die out – would n't natural selection have to have some kind of mind ?
It might be obvious to you that being the same colour as your environment is more important than being white , if you 're a polar bear , but that 's because you just ran a thought - experiment about a hypothetical situation involving orange snow .
Evolution can't run thought experiments , because it can't think .
" Darwin has a theory that centrally turns on the notion of ' selection - for ' , " says Fodor .
" And yet he can't give an account – nobody could give an account – of how natural selection could distinguish between correlated traits .
He waffles . "
Those of us baffled by this argument can take solace in the fact that we 're not alone .
The general response to Fodor among evolutionary thinkers has been a mixture of derision and awkwardness , as if one of their previously esteemed colleagues had entered the senior common room naked .
Says Dennett , via email : " Jerry Fodor 's book is a stunning demonstration of how abhorrence of an idea ( Jerry 's visceral dislike of evolutionary thinking ) can derange an otherwise clever thinker . . . a responsible academic is supposed to be able to control irrational impulses , [ but ]
Fodor has simply collapsed in the face of his dread and composed some dreadfully bad arguments . "
What Darwin Got Wrong , Dennett concludes , is " a book that so transparently misconstrues its target that it would be laughable were it not such dangerous mischief " .
It would be jawdroppingly surprising , to say the least , were Fodor to be right .
A safer , if mealy - mouthed , conclusion to draw is that his work acts as an important warning to those of us who think we understand natural selection .
It 's probably not a bankrupt concept , as Fodor claims .
But nor should laypeople assume that it 's self - evidently simple and exhaustively true .
The irony in all this is that Darwin himself never claimed that it was .
He went to his deathbed protesting that he'd been misinterpreted : there was no reason , he said , to assume that natural selection was the only imaginable mechanism of evolution .
Darwin , writing before the discovery of DNA , knew very well that his work heralded the beginning of a journey to understand the origins and development of life .
All we may be discovering now is that we remain closer to the beginning of that journey than we 've come to think .

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Dubai Mall , one of the world ’s largest shopping centers and a symbol of Dubai ’s grandeur , was partly closed on Thursday after an aquarium containing thousands of fish and sea animals started leaking , police and witnesses said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Footage posted on the Internet showed water gushing from the aquarium as passers - by scrambled to get out of the way .
“ There was a small problem , a simple crack , and the water leaked , ” a police official said , declining to be named .
A Reuters witness said the mall had been partly evacuated and dozens of emergency vehicles were outside .
Six divers entered the tank and appeared to be coordinating with workers outside the glass .
Workers mopped up water from the floor .
“ A leakage was noticed at one of the panel joints of the Dubai Aquarium at The Dubai Mall and was immediately fixed by the aquarium ’s maintenance team , ” said a spokeswoman for Emaar Properties , which operates the mall .
“ The leakage did not impact the aquarium environment or the safety of the aquatic animals , ” she added in a statement .
Emaar ’s chairman Mohammed Alabbar had earlier been quoted as denying there was a leak in the aquarium , saying there was a “ technical fault in the operating device ” , according to a statement carried on the official news agency WAM .
Emaar Properties , the Arab world ’s largest developer , came under scrutiny this month when it closed the observation deck at Burj Khalifa , the world ’s tallest tower and the firm ’s flagship project , just a month after its fanfare opening .
Dubai Mall ’s aquarium was designed to hold 33,000 living creatures , representing more than 85 species including over 400 sharks and rays combined , according to the mall ’s website .
A witness said water had been leaking from a crack in the aquarium glass .
“ I saw a small crack in the aquarium glass and there was a little water coming out and a lot of water on the floor , ” said Ranjin , a 27 - year old corporate secretary .
“ The police came and evacuated the area around the aquarium . ”
Posted by John , March 24th , 2010 - under Marx , Marxism .
This article , by Ben Hillier , appeared in Socialist Alternative online on 19 March 2010 .
As we enter the second decade of the 21st century , the world is still reeling from the greatest economic crisis in generations : 1.1 billion people do n’t have access to clean drinking water , 1 billion endure hunger on a daily basis , every hour 1,200 children die from preventable diseases and we are marching headlong into what may be environmental catastrophe .
Karl Marx ’s famous call to action – “ Up until now , philosophers have only interpreted the world … the point is to change it ” – still rings true 150 years after it was written .
Marx spent the best part of his life fighting for the revolutionary transformation of society .
He argued that the working class – the mass of the population who need to sell their labour to someone else in order to survive – could smash capitalism and replace it with a socialist society based on production for human need rather than profit .
“ The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles ”
– The Communist Manifesto
Marxism is a theory which puts material forces and the struggle between different social classes for control of those forces at the centre of its analysis .
Marxism takes as its starting point a basic fact : before human beings can engage in politics , art , sport religion etc .
we first have to eat , drink and have shelter .
That is , we have to be alive .
Without labouring activity , humanity would cease to exist in a matter of weeks .
So the relationships that people enter into with one another in the process of satisfying our basic needs – the production and reproduction of human existence – forms the foundation of any society .
For the last several thousand years , these production relationships have been class relationships in most parts of the world – slaves and slave owners , peasants and nobles , workers and bosses .
In each pair , the latter does not produce , but lives off the labour of the former , who are exploited and oppressed .
Marx argued that a number of things follow from this basic fact .
Firstly , the different social institutions , norms , legal codes , etc. of different societies have their foundations in the different ways production is organised .
The purpose of the norms , institutions , legal codes and the like is to protect and maintain the existing organisation of production .
So understanding any given society begins with understanding a society ’s class structure .
Secondly , the starting point for understanding human history is understanding the conflict between the different social classes over those things which are produced .
On one level it ’s simply the conflict over who gets what .
That conflict is expressed in different ways – the big arguments over social spending versus tax cuts , the content of industrial relations legislation , and from mass strikes right down to the act of a worker taking an extra five minutes on a lunch break or nicking a pen from the office .
Finally , over time there is the general development of technology and knowledge which allows more things to be produced in less time using less labour .
This general development is , at certain historical moments , thwarted by the particular class structure of society .
At that moment , the class struggle can lead to a revolution – a complete transformation of how production is organised and the ushering in of a new form of society .
“ Capital comes dripping from head to foot , from every pore , with blood and dirt . ”
– Capital Vol. 1
To understand Marx ’s theory of revolution we have to look at his specific analysis of capitalism in light of these insights into history .
Capitalism is promoted as the best of all possible worlds , where freedom and democracy are the highest expressions of human advancement .
Yet the system itself was established through mass violence , theft , enslavement and the denial of basic rights .
Six million African slaves , the dispossession of millions of peasants , the slaughter of indigenous communities , complete social upheaval across the world and bloody revolutionary transformation .
All of this requiring a legal code to sanction every act of butchery .
Given the violence required to establish the system , Marx argued that there is nothing “ natural ” about it .
Class society has existed for only a fraction of human existence , so there is clearly nothing about human nature that compels human beings to organise ourselves as we do in this or any other class system .
In fact , throughout history the way society has been organised has changed , and exactly what human behaviours people consider “ natural ” have also changed .
The point here is that capitalism , like all systems that came before it , is transitory .
That another world is possible has been confirmed by history .
However , Marxism is not just the dream of a future that overcomes the decay of the present .
In all previous societies there were problems of scarcity which created barriers to a world based on cooperation and equal access to resources .
Capitalism has created a world of abundance which overcomes that obstacle .
There is now more than enough food and other material goods to satisfy the needs of everyone .
So the material basis for socialism now exists .
Further to this , Marx ’s analysis locates the real force within society that can make socialism a reality .
“ What the capitalists therefore produce , above all , are their own grave - diggers . ”
– The Communist Manifesto
Marxism argues that socialism is capable of emerging out of capitalism precisely because the system itself creates the conditions for its own abolition .
The driving force of capitalism is competition .
This competition between businesses for profits drives increases in productivity and gives the system an amazing dynamism .
The contradiction though , is that the thing that actually gives the system such tremendous power – the power to create skyscrapers , aeroplanes , computers , mountains of food – is the cooperation of workers .
As individuals we are forced to compete for jobs , forced to sell ourselves and outdo those around us .
As workers , however , we are forced to cooperate .
The scale of this cooperation is immense .
For example , every time a mobile phone is answered , the labour of countless workers is brought to life – programmers , technicians , truck drivers , pilots , mechanics , miners , electricians , factory hands , retail workers , power station workers …
An endless list of workers from around the globe have all contributed to the call , either through their collective role in the production of the phone or their maintenance of the telecommunications system .
In fact , examine any item – a pen , a book , a loaf of bread – and you can quickly see that its existence required a chain of cooperation stretching into hundreds of thousands of workers .
This is the reason why the working class has the potential to create a world based on cooperation – on one level the world is already based on the cooperation of the working class .
Not only this , though .
The very conditions of existence of workers push them towards fighting for a world based not just on cooperative labour , but on democratic control of the entire process of production .
Why ?
In their relentless pursuit of profits , capitalists ( the bosses ) have to ensure that the goods or services that are produced are produced more cheaply than those produced by their competitors .
So they have to constantly get workers to work longer , or for less , or cut conditions etc .
This means that workers have to cooperate on a different level .
Cooperation becomes an organised force to protect livelihoods as workers form unions and associations dedicated to sticking together against attacks .
So it is because of the competition between businesses that the cooperation of workers for the system turns into cooperation against the system .
It is at the point of production where the profits , along with the goods and services which keep us alive , are created .
Workplaces are therefore the site of social power .
Here , the working class ’s greatest power lies in the collective capacity to not work .
When the working class stops working , the lights literally go out , the water stops running and the food does n’t appear on the supermarket shelf .
The system grinds to a stop .
Yet getting to this level of class struggle is not an automatic process .
If it were , capitalism would be long gone .
Workers not only have to struggle collectively ( you ca n’t go on strike by yourself ) , they have to choose to struggle , to fight back against the bosses .
Unlike the ( sometimes ) unconscious cooperation of the global supply chain , the cooperation of workers in the struggle against the system is by necessity a conscious and democratic process .
So workers ’ struggle has both a negative and a positive aspect .
Negative in the sense that they can paralyse the existing order by simply doing nothing .
Positive in that in order to do this , through doing this , they create the conditions for a new society based on democratic control of the workplace .
This is why the working class is central to Marxist theory .
Only the working class can wrest economic power away from the capitalist class .
No other social force has this capacity .
Yet the capitalists will never cede power voluntarily , so Marx argued that it is hopelessly utopian to believe that this system can be fundamentally changed through parliament .
Getting left - wing people into office or having nicer people in charge does n’t alter the system itself .
It does n’t alter the fundamental contradiction that is at the root of class conflict – collective production by the majority versus the private ownership of the few .
Only world wide revolution led by the working class can overcome this contradiction .
Only then can capitalism be replaced by a system where our lives are spent fulfilling the needs of everyone , not the wants of a few .
“ The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas . ”
– The German Ideology
So capitalism is violent and unjust , it is not the logical outcome of human nature , it can be done away with through revolution and the people who can make that happen are workers .
They have an interest in doing it , they have the power to do it , and on one level the system compels them to do it .
So why have n’t they done it ?
There are a number of reasons , but one of the most significant is that the ruling class ( those who control society ’s productive assets ) use those social institutions , norms , legal codes , etc. to resist any challenge to their rule .
They have immense means to disseminate their own ideas and ideology through the mass media and the education system .
The key ideological prop of the system – the idea that nothing can change – is continually pounded into our heads .
The pressure we face day in and day out is to accept the social order as it stands .
Further , a raft of ideas are used to divide workers .
You do n’t have to look very far to find out how “ dole bludgers ” , immigrants and terrorists are all grave threats to society ’s well being .
These ideas gain a hearing not because workers are stupid , or naturally duped .
Despite the fact that as a class we wield immense power , as individuals we have no control over the world .
Workers produce everything , but everything we create is taken away from us .
We are left with a sense of powerlessness .
The real functioning of the world becomes distorted to us because our lives are dominated by the working of the market .
One result of this is that people often hold a mixture of confused ideas about the world .
There is an uneven development of political consciousness .
While some workers are militant and always looking to fight the system , others passively accept their situation or even side with the rich and powerful .
Others move between , sometimes convinced to fight , at other moments drawn the other way .
Even when most can see through the lies of the capitalist press – like when we were told about “ weapons of mass destruction ” in Iraq , when it was clear that the invasion was about oil – the idea that we ca n’t change anything can be all - pervasive .
Only at moments of social crisis might most move in the direction of fighting for a better world .
“ Our primary and imperative practical task [ is ] to establish an organisation of revolutionaries . ”
– V.I. Lenin ,
What is to be Done ?
This reality of contradictory ideas meant a theory of revolutionary organisation evolved out of working - class struggles .
It was born out of the recognition that workers ’ struggles do n’t just happen .
There is always the conscious intervention of the most politically engaged workers against reactionary ideas .
There are always people who lead and who have the capacity to convince others to fight as well .
One of the great misconceptions about Marx himself is that he was simply a theorist .
In fact Marx was also a political leader .
He argued that revolutionaries should meet to discuss their ideas .
He was involved in founding the first communist party in the world and wrote its program – The Communist Manifesto .
He was also involved in founding the International Workingmen ’s Association , the first international working - class organisation .
As a member of its general council Marx no only fought for ideological leadership but also expended time on a range of organisational tasks .
So Marxism is a theory of action .
The practical task of building a revolutionary organisation was carried through most successfully by the Bolshevik party of Vladimir Lenin , which led the Russian revolution of 1917 .
Lenin ’s idea of the party was to group together the most politically conscious workers in an organisation that could win arguments with other workers and lead the fight against capitalism .
The revolutionary organisation , Lenin argued , must involve itself in the practical struggles and campaigns of the day .
It must also wage an ideological struggle to win people to revolutionary politics .
By grouping together in an organisation those who are most prepared to fight against the system , political ideas can be turned into action and political action can change reality .
So while the working class as a whole has the power to overthrow the system , socialism becomes a reality only through the process of the most political workers winning over other sections of the class .
The revolutionary organisation , then , is a practical expression of Marx ’s call to action – “ The point is to change it ! ”
“ The workers have nothing to lose but their chains .
They have a world to win . ”
– The Communist Manifesto
Today , the fundamental features of capitalism remain as they were in Marx ’s time – class domination , exploitation , oppression .
Capitalism has spread form a small pocket of Europe to encompass the globe .
Further to this we now have industrial warfare of a scale unimaginable to those living 150 years ago .
But with the spread of the system has come the growth of the working class .
It is bigger and potentially more powerful than ever .
Every day , the struggle continues .
Sometimes it hums quietly , at other moments its roar echoes across oceans .
When the struggle against capitalism reaches its crescendo , the self - emancipation of the working class will lay the basis for the liberation of all humanity .
This is Marxism .
Pediatricians have declared that the trusty ol ' hot dog is in need of a makeover , setting the stage for one of the biggest engineering challenges known to man and causing some to worry , " Is it the end of the hot dog as we know it ? "
The cylindrical sausage has been deemed a choking hazard by the American Academy of Pediatrics , which published an official statement on choking risks in the journal Pediatrics that included concerns about the snack clogging a child 's wind pipe .
The pediatricians pointed out that 17 percent of all food - related asphyxiations among children are caused by hot dogs .
Talking about the proposal for a choke - proof hot dog , a doctor explains to USA Today :
" If you were to take the best engineers in the world and try to design the perfect plug for a child 's airway , it would be a hot dog , " says statement author Gary Smith , director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children 's Hospital in Columbus , Ohio .
" I 'm a pediatric emergency doctor , and to try to get them out once they 're wedged in , it 's almost impossible . "
But Smith admitted that he does n't know how the sausage could be redesigned to be safer , adding somewhat lamely that he 's " certain that some savvy inventor will find a way . "
The doctors did n't just suggest that the wiener needs a design re-think , they also asked that the snack come with a warning label .
But the hot dog redesign debate got , uh , hotter when the president of the National Hot Dog & Sausage Council , Janet Riley , retorted that most of the sausage packages sold in stores already come with some sort of a warning label , advising parents to cut the hot dogs into small pieces before feeding them to their kids .
And then pediatrician Alan Greene , author of Feeding Baby Green , found a bigger fault with the pediatricians ' concerns over the high - fat , high - sodium , preservative - packed food item .
He told USA Today : " The last thing we need is to redesign candy and junk food with cool shapes , so we can give them to kids even younger . "
So , no star - shaped mini hot dogs anytime soon ?
Damn .

Recently I added a remote start to my car .
All is good in the world .
Unfortunately , I work at an airport and my car is about a 15 minute shuttle ride from my office .
There is not much opportunity to ‘ stand at the door and wait for warm car ’ there .
But cruising the web , I happened upon the Viper website , where I read about a new system where you can start your car via an iPhone from virtually anywhere .
After looking into the system , I soon stumbled onto the fact that the system is ridiculously expensive , as is everything that has to do with the Godforsaken iPhone newer technology .
Further research on the subject yielded little hope , as all other systems were out of my budget ( cheap as heck ) .
My co-worker and I started daydreaming on the subject ( what goes on at an airport that we would need to pay attention ? )
When I stumbled on an idea .
My remote start has a wire called the Remote Start Activation Input .
Now the job of the RSAI is , from the manual : “ This wire will start the vehicle when it sees two negative pulses .
Only used when incorporating into existing alarm or FOR TESTING PURPOSES . ”
That last part I capped and bolded , as that is what is most important for me .
“ Testing ” consists of simply grounding that wire for two pulses in order to start the car .
Two more pulses shuts it down , exactly like using the remote .
Bingo , I had my way in !
Here is what I came up with :
I hope you can tell what is going on there .
If not , here is a synopsis , and a little bit of method behind my madness …
The remote start requires 2 pulses within 3 ? seconds to initiate the remote start sequence .
So how to send those 2 pulses ?
Easy , I remove the vibrate motor from a cell phone or pager and use that circuit to initiate the remote start by setting the phone to vibrate .
But wait …the RSAI only works when put to ground , that circuit has ( after testing ) a 1.35 v current .
I guess I have to use a relay !
Oh no …The remote start turns off after 2 MORE pulses .
How do I get the cell phone to STOP sending rings ?
Hrm …
The answer came from beegbie over at the 12volt.com .
The remote start start up sequence goes like this .
Sense Input > Turn on Accessories > Try to Crank Engine .
If I put a normally closed relay on the vibrate circuit triggered by the vehicle accessory circuit , then once the remote start sequence kicks off , any subsequent rings by the phone wo n’t be ‘ heard ’ by the remote start .
Whew !
Here are some pictures of the tear down and modification of the cell phone :
Purchased this phone for $ 10 from CVS Pharmacy along with $ 20 worth of prepaid minutes .
Phone came with a battery and wall wart charger .
Removed the 6 tri-wing ( fail ) screws holding the inner bezel on .
Once off , all the goodies are revealed .
You can remove the PCB fairly easily , but for the most part it is single sided .
Here I have already removed the vibrate motor and soldered wired back into it ’s place .
I wanted an easy way to remove the phone if I needed to make any modifications to it or add minutes , or hell , even make an emergency phone call .
I decided on desoldering the headphone jack from and isolating it with that paper stuff I got from another board .
I glued the paper down , then glued the jack to it .
Then I soldered the pins that correlate to the 2nd & 3rd pins on the headphone jack to the wires coming off the vibrate motor resistors .
I chose ( had no choice ) to solder the wires to the resistors due to me tearing out the traces on the pcb when removing the motor .
I was a little skittish applying the amount of heat required to remove that bish , thinking I might desolder some of the tiny little components around it .
Also of interest to some would be my choice of wire .
That is two strands from a IDE connector .
One is marked to denote it ’s polarity .
( It helped , really . )
Here is a picture of the headphone jack lookin’ all normal and stuff .
I like a nice clean install .
This way the phone loses only the functionality of vibrate and using a headset .
I can still set the ringer , make calls , etc .
Here is the modified headphone jack for the hookup .
This is a 2.5 mm ( mini ) headphone jack that I had from a cheap headset from another phone .
The wires were those damned coated wires , and quite puny at that , so I cut apart the boot and desoldered them at the source .
I then removed 2 wires from a 10ft piece of cat5e and soldered them in place , shrink wrapped and Bob ’s yer uncle .
Why , you should ask , did I use Ethernet cable .
Several reasons :
It is sturdy , it was solid not stranded , I could pick my length and I have about 300 feet in a box behind me .
All in all I think the thing may actually work .
I need to source some cheap solid state relays that initiate below 1.5 volts .
I am also thinking about maybe using an optoisolator , as I have 2 in a scavenged pcb beside me that are in the correct voltage range .
I will still need a 30A auto fuse for the other relay , though .
I have a breadboard on order from Sparkfun that should come in handy for testing .
The best part of this project are the possibilities .
Not only can I remote start my car from afar , I can also use the other features of the phone to automate the remote start .
I can set up to 4 alarms on this phone , and set them to vibrate .
Since I work 4×10 shift , that is perfect for starting my car everyday before work .
Also , that phone has a timer on it that can also trigger the vibrate function .
Have n’t figgered out a practical use for that yet .
But the Pièce de résistance is the Calendar .
I can set nearly unlimited events into the calendar , and set an alarm to trigger the vibrate at or before the event in 15 minute intervals .
I can also set the as ‘ recurring events ’ , too .
I could program in mine and my wife ’s work schedules , upcoming doctors appointments , ANYTHING !
Not bad for a $ 10 phone .
I am glad that I decided to make the phone easily connect / disconnectable .
Check out Part 2 to see if I can actually pull it off .
In 1977 , Scott Weaver decided to replicate the Golden Gate Bridge with toothpicks and Elmer ’s glue .
When the 17 - year - old finished that structure , he just kept going .
What started as a pastime became an all - consuming quest to , as he puts it , “ blow people ’s minds ” with toothpicks .
Mission accomplished .
The Rohnert Park , California , resident , a surfer and competitive freestyle Frisbee player — who also likes to transform his house into a castle for Christmas — has poured 3,000 hours into his 9 - foot - tall , 20 - pound simulacrum of San Francisco .
Ripley ’s Believe
It or Not offered Weaver $ 40,000 for his 100,000 - toothpick town , but he turned it down without hesitation .
“ Other than my wife and my son , this is the most important thing in my life , ” he says .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : Updates and a new member of the Monadic Regions family
Hello , I released updates of all the members of the Monadic Regions family : * http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regions-0.3 - Export the ' Dup ' and ' ParentOf ' classes from ' Control.Monad.Trans.Region '. - Add : ' mapInternalHandle ∷ ( Handle resource1 → Handle resource2 ) → ( RegionalHandle resource1 r → RegionalHandle resource2 r ) '. - Internal refactoring .
* http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regions-monadsfd-0.3 * http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regions-monadstf-0.3 * http://hackage.haskell.org/package/usb-safe-0.5.1 -
No major changes in these packages just internal refactoring and support for regions - 0.3 .*. * http://hackage.haskell.org/package/safer-file-handles-0.3 - ' File ' is turned into a GADT , it 's parameterized with the IOMode and its constructors are exported .
- Added support for bytestring IO .
- Internal refactoring .
* http://hackage.haskell.org/package/explicit-iomodes-0.2
This package is not a member of the family but it is required for ' safer - file - handles ' .
I released an update which : - Added support for bytestring IO .
- Internal refactoring .
Additionally I would like to announce a new member of the family : * http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regional-pointers-0.1 to quote the description : " The library allows you to allocate memory in a region yielding a regional pointer to it .
When the region terminates all pointers are automatically freed .
Most importantly , a pointer can't be returned from the region .
So it 's impossible to reference unallocated memory . "
This package need some more work ( primarily documentation and testing ) so I consider it a beta release .
Note that the darcs repositories for all packages are not updated because I can't seem to get a SSH connection with code.haskell.org :-( Happy Haskell Hacking , Bas
Usability researcher Jakob Nielsen ’s recent column advocates a fundamental change to password field design on the web .
He believes that the time has come “ to show most passwords in clear text as users type them , ” abandoning the traditional approach that displays a series of asterisks or bullets in place of the actual password .
Article Continues Below
Nielsen ’s controversial proposal demonstrates the principle that most design decisions require trade - offs .
User goals and business objectives do not always intersect .
Security , usability , and aesthetic concerns often compete .
We must set priorities and balance these interests to achieve the best results in each situation .
Security issues are particularly difficult to deal with because they ’re an annoyance .
We just want to let people get at the great tool we ’ve created , but instead we have to build barriers between the user and the application .
Users must prove their identities .
We ca n’t trust any data they provide unless it ’s been thoroughly sanitized .
Unfortunately , this is reality .
A great deal of web traffic really is malicious , and sensitive data gets stolen .
Typically , we ask users to supply a username ( often an e-mail address ) along with a password to sign in to an application .
The username identifies the person , while the password proves that the person submitting the username is indeed the one who created the account .
That ’s the theory , based on two assumptions :
A password will never be visible outside the mind of the person who created it .
Both the username and password can be recalled from memory when needed .
This approach places a significant cognitive burden on people who use websites that require authentication .
In general , we get by remarkably well , but it ’s easy to see the weaknesses in the system .
Passwords that are easy to remember are also easy to guess .
When people are forced to choose strong passwords , they ’re more likely to either write them down or forget them .
The usual response is a password reset mechanism , which naturally undermines the strength of the entire system .
It does n’t matter that my password is encrypted with the strongest ciphers known to man when it can simply be reset by anyone who knows which high school I attended .
This is one of the reasons that Nielsen suggests abandoning password masking .
People get frustrated and often reset passwords that they have n’t actually forgotten simply because they ’ve mistyped .
Providing clear feedback with unobscured letters will reduce errors , improve the user experience , and lessen the need for insecure alternatives .
However , making such a sweeping change to a fundamental user interaction could present serious problems .
Consider some contexts in which a password might need to be entered in front of a large group of people , such as while using a conference room projector .
And many years of web experience have set user expectations on how form elements should work .
People understood that password masking was invented for their security .
Failing to meet that expectation might undermine confidence , and we cannot afford to lose our users ’ trust .
Is there a middle path — a way to provide feedback and reduce password errors that does n’t sacrifice the user experience ?
At least two design patterns address this issue in offline applications , and with a little JavaScript , we can bring them to the web .
Now you see it , now you don’t#section2
The simplest solution is to mask the password by default while giving users a way to switch the field to clear text .
Nielsen even mentions this in passing .
This approach allows the person to confirm that the password was entered correctly , but it also places control firmly in the user ’s grasp .
Such toggle controls are often seen on WiFi preference panels , but they ’re rarely implemented elsewhere .
( Note : at least one blog has advocated a similar technique while this article was in production . )
It should be simple to write a control that switches the type attribute of an HTML input element between password and text .
Unfortunately , it ’s not .
Internet Explorer does not allow this particular attribute to be set by JavaScript , so we have to be slightly more creative .
The following two functions should do the trick :
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
window.onload = function ( ) { if ( document.getElementsByTagName ) { var inputs = document.getElementsByTagName( ' input ' ) ; for ( var i in inputs ) { var input = inputs [ i ] ; if ( input.type == ' password ' ) { toggle_control = document.createElement ( ' label ' ) ; toggle_control.innerHTML
= " < input type= \" checkbox \ » " " + " onclick=\" toggle_password ( ' " + input.id+ " ' , this » .checked ) \ " /> " + "
Show password " ; input.parentNode.insertBefore(toggle_control , input » .nextSibling ) ; } } } } function toggle_password( element_id , show_text ) { if ( document.getElementById ) { var password_input = document.getElementById(element_id ) ; var new_input = document.createElement ( ' input ' ) ; with ( new_input ) { id = password_input.id ; name = password_input.name ; value = password_input.value ; size = password_input.size ; className = password_input.className ; type = show_text ?
' text ' : ' password ' ; } password_input.parentNode.replaceChild(new_input , » password_input ) ; } }
The first function scans the document for all input elements and collects those of the password type .
Note that this code is only intended to demonstrate the concept , and the process might be improved by using a JavaScript framework such as Prototype .
After each input , the function inserts a labeled checkbox to toggle the field between masked and clear text .
The second function controls the toggle behavior itself .
When the user clicks the toggle control , the function creates a new input and swaps it for the existing one , juggling the value and other properties between them .
An alternative approach is to create the text input only once and toggle the display property to show or hide the appropriate field .
One drawback to this method , though , is that an element ’s id must be unique .
Since the parallel text input would have its own id , it would n’t inherit any CSS rules that referenced the original element by ID .
Take a look at example one to see it in action .
This solution is easy to implement , and it follows the principle of progressive enhancement :
In the absence of JavaScript , password fields will retain their usual behavior .
The toggle control empowers the user with a choice as to whether to show or hide a password in a particular circumstance .
The main drawback is that it could still undermine a user ’s concept of the password field as a “ black box . ”
We ’re so completely accustomed to thinking of our passwords as a secret that merely offering the option to display it in clear text could be unsettling .
A second alternative #section3
Typing errors are especially common on touchscreen devices such as the iPhone , where fingers can’t locate the edges of keys by feel .
Anticipating that password inputs without visual feedback would cause problems , Apple adopted an interesting approach .
The last letter typed into the field remains visible for a couple of seconds before turning into a dot .
This creates an opportunity to catch errors without showing the entire password at once .
We can reproduce this progressive masking behavior with HTML and JavaScript , although it will take a bit more code than the previous example .
Consider the following :
window.onload = function ( ) { if ( document.getElementsByTagName ) { var inputs = document.getElementsByTagName( ' input ' ) ; var password_inputs = Array ( ) ; for ( var i in inputs ) { if ( inputs [ i ] . type == ' password ' ) { password_inputs.push ( inputs [ i ] ) ; } } for ( var i in password_inputs ) { var input = inputs [ i ] ; var masking_element = document.createElement (' input ' ) ; with ( masking_element ) { style .
position = ' absolute ' ; id = input.name + ' _mask ' ; type = ' text ' ; size = input.size ; className = input.className ; } masking_element.onfocus = function ( ) {this.nextSibling » .focus ( ) } ; input.parentNode.insertBefore(masking_element , input ) ; input.onchange = function ( ) { if ( this. timer ) { clearTimeout ( this .timer ) ; } var mask_character = " \u2022 " ; var last_character = this.value.charAt( this » .value.length -1 ) ; var masked_text = this.previousSibling.value ; var password_text = this.value ; if ( masked_text.length < password_text.length ) { this.previousSibling.value = password_text.substr(0 , password_text.length-1).replace(/./g , mask_character ) + last_character ; } else { this.previousSibling.value = password_text » .replace(/./g , mask_character ) ; } this .timer = setTimeout ( " with(document.getElement » ById ('" +masking_element.id+ " ' ) ) {value=value » .replace (/./g , '" +mask_character + " ' ) } " ,2000 ) ; } input.onkeyup = input.onchange ; input.onchange ( ) ; } } }
This time , we create a second text input to sit directly on top of each password input ( the caveat about CSS inheritance from the previous example applies ) .
By manipulating its value as the original field changes , we can control what the user sees .
Let ’s break down each step of the script :
window.onload = function ( ) { if ( document.getElementsByTagName ) { var inputs = document.getElementsByTagName( ' input ' ) ; var password_inputs = Array ( ) ; for ( var i in inputs ) { if ( inputs [ i ] . type == ' password ' ) { password_inputs.push ( inputs [ i ] ) ; } } for ( var i in password_inputs ) { var input = inputs [ i ] ; ... } } }
Again , our first task scans the page for password inputs so that we can modify their behavior .
However , there ’s a critical difference between this function and the first example .
In Internet Explorer , document.getElementsByTagName( ) does n’t return a simple list of matching elements at the moment the script is run .
Rather , it returns a reference to the collection of matching elements .
If we create a new input element while looping over the results , we will increase the size of that collection on each pass , and the loop will continue indefinitely .
This instantly crashes Internet Explorer ( and not gracefully ) .
So , instead , we need to copy the initial results of the function into an array and loop over that .
var masking_element = document.createElement (' input ' ) ; with ( masking_element ) { style .
position = ' absolute ' ; id = input.name + ' _mask ' ; type = ' text ' ; size = input.size ; className = input.className ; } masking_element.onfocus = function ( ) {this.nextSibling.focus( )} ; input.parentNode.insertBefore(masking_element , input ) ;
With the new input inserted directly before the existing one , setting its position to absolute should place it directly on top .
This should work in most layouts , but there may be exceptions where additional CSS is required to position it correctly .
Of course , now that we ’re covering the input with another element , we also need to make sure that clicking on the mask activates the input .
Adding an onfocus handler takes care of this .
We have to assign this handler outside the with statement for it to function correctly in Firefox 2 .
input.onchange = function ( ) { ... } input.onkeyup = input.onchange ;
With the new element in place , we ’ll build a function to display the text of the progressively masked password .
We ’ll need this text to respond to changes in the contents of the password field .
Usually , this will mean that a user is typing on the keyboard , but that may not always be the case .
Someone might paste text into the field using a context menu , for example .
Attaching our code to both the change and keyup events should cover all the bases .
var mask_character = " \u2022 " ; var last_character = this.value.charAt(this.value.length-1 ) ;
We can define any character we like to mask the passwords .
Traditionally , most systems use asterisks or dots , so in this example we define the Unicode entity 2022 , which is the bullet character .
On the second line , we identify the last character of the current password value so that we can render it in clear text .
var masked_text = this.previousSibling.value ; var password_text = this.value ; if ( masked_text.length < password_text.length ) { this.previousSibling.value = password_text.substr(0 , password_text.length-1).replace(/./g , » mask_character ) + last_character ; } else { this.previousSibling.value = password_text.replace(/./g , mask_character ) ; }
Now we can take the value of the password field , replace every character except the last one with a bullet , and put that text into the field that we ’re using as a mask .
However , we should only do this while the person is typing forward .
In other words , if the user presses the backspace key , we do n’t want to reveal the previous character again .
After it ’s been hidden , it should stay hidden .
So before performing the replacement , we first check to see if the password value is longer than the masked text .
The replacement itself can be done using a simple regular expression .
The expression /./ matches any character in the password field .
Adding the letter g to the end , ( /./g ) means that it scans the entire string of text instead of stopping at the first match .
this.timer = setTimeout ( " with( document.getElementById (' " + masking_element.id+ " ') ) {value=value.replace(/./g , ' " + mask_character + " ' ) } " ,2000 ) ;
After a two - second delay , we want to mask the full password .
However , our users probably wo n’t pause for two seconds after typing each letter .
So we only want the behavior to take effect when the password field has n’t changed at all for that length of time .
Every time we call the setTimeout function in JavaScript , it returns an ID that we can use to reference that particular timer .
if ( this.timer ) { clearTimeout ( this .timer ) ; }
By storing the timer ID in a variable and adding the above code at the beginning of our function , we can cancel the countdown as long as we observe that the field is still changing .
input.onchange ( ) ;
Our last step is to run the function we just defined .
This ensures that the mask will show the correct text if the password field was pre-filled before the page was loaded .
To see the full script in action , take a look at example two .
It ’s been tested in Internet Explorer 6 - 8 , Firefox , Safari , and Chrome .
Again , in the absence of JavaScript , this technique will degrade well — password fields will simply function normally .
Proceed with caution #section4
When dealing with such a fundamental area of the web experience , we need to be careful because we ’re dealing with deeply conditioned expectations .
The username / password method of securing web applications is n’t perfect , but there are few good alternatives and it ’s become the standard approach .
We can best address the usability concerns of password fields by testing incremental changes like these to extend default behavior — without compromising the basic experience and losing the trust of our users .

Team Amarok is proud to announce Amarok 2.3.0 .
It contains many improvements and bugfixes over Amarok 2.2.2 as well as many new features .
Areas such as podcast support and saved playlists have seen huge improvements , as has the support for USB mass storage devices ( including generic MP3 players ) .
With large parts of Amarok 2 becoming quite mature , it was also time to start looking forward again .
Therefore , this release also contains a number of new features of a slightly more experimental nature .
These include a new main toolbar and a rewritten and much simpler file browser .
These parts are brand new and based on user feedback , and they will change and improve over the next few releases .
The old slim toolbar is still available should you prefer that , but we encourage you to try out the new toolbar and tell us what you think .
The file browser 's look and feel now aligns more closely with the rest of Amarok with improvements such as breadcrumb navigation , and it is now focused on being a way to find and play music instead of being a multi- purpose file manager .
The context menu of tracks in your playlist now offers a " show in media sources " option , making it easier to find the same track again in the collection browser for editing , moving or deleting the file .
Podcasts have received a configuration dialog allowing you to change the update interval as well as the location to store new downloaded episodes .
Podcasts and saved playlists are now also grouped by source , and a merged view is available just like in your local collection - perfect for those that do n't care where their music is coming from but simply want to listen to it .
Now , when a new source of playlists or podcasts becomes available , Amarok will switch off merged view and show a collapsible list of your new listening sources .
The Wikipedia applet now looks better and links have been fixed .
Internal links to other pages on Wikipedia will display in the applet , and external links open a browser window .
In short , Team Amarok has been focusing hard on furthering our long - term goal : making Amarok the best tool for immersing yourself in music , no matter where it comes from .
Pretty much since the inauguration of the franchise , the Ottawa Senators have dealt with flux in the crease .
Although there have been streaks where goaltenders have played well , there has n't been any significant measure of consistency , whether within a season or , especially , over the course of a few seasons .
Given this fact , you 've got to think the Senators have identified goaltending as a key area for improvement , and used the most basic method for improving a given area -- the Entry Draft -- to address it .
But you'd be wrong , because of the course of the last decade , the Senators have drafted a total of five goaltenders : Robin Lehner ( 2009 ) , Ryan Daniels ( 2006 ) , Jeff Glass ( 2004 ) , Brian Elliott ( 2003 ) , and Ray Emery ( 2001 ) .
With five goalies selected since 2000 , the Senators have drafted the second - fewest netminders , ahead only of the New Jersey Devils -- and the Devils have kind of had that position pretty well settled for the decade .
The rest of the top ten are all over the map , in terms of steady goaltending :
Team No. of goalies drafted Devils 4 Senators 5 Blue Jackets 6 Bruins 7 Red Wings 7 Oilers 7 Canadiens 7 Rangers 7 Ducks 8 Stars 8
Four more tied at ... 8
On average , teams have drafted more than nine goalies in the last decade , but the Senators have drafted about half that many .
So why have the Senators not tried to use the draft in order to address what has been their primary weakness for that whole time ?
And would doing so even necessarily mean they 'll solve the problem ?
( Read more ... )
At the other end of the spectrum , we see a similar range of teams who've had solid goaltending ( the San Jose Sharks ) , teams who are just beginning to have solid goaltending ( the Pittsburgh Penguins ) , and teams who -- despite drafting so many goaltenders -- continue to struggle filling that position ( the Philadelphia Flyers ) :
Team No. of goalies drafted Flyers 16 Kings 14 Predators 14 Lightning 14 Penguins 12 Sharks 12 Avalanche 11 Blackhawks 10 Islanders 10 Thrashers 9
Six more tied at ... 9
Drafting goaltenders does n't necessarily mean you 're going to get good ones .
Take the Flyers , for instance , who 've drafted more goaltenders than any other team , but have only really had one -- Roman Cechmanek - - offer them anything in the way of goaltending .
The four ' tenders they drafted in 2008 and 2009 are skewing their number upwards , but there 's perhaps another reason they have n't had success :
No goaltender has been drafted before the third round , and their average round drafted is 5.3 .
So it 's one thing to keep drafting goalies , but you have to be willing to use higher - round draft picks in order to find a good one .
However , drafting a highly - ranked goaltender does n't mean you 're going to get a good one , either .
Of the 15 goaltenders drafted in a first - round since 2000 , three are now unquestionable starters for their teams : Cam Ward and Marc - Andre Fleury .
On the other hand , the Rangers have wasted two first - round picks on busted goalies ( Al Montoya and Dan Blackburn ) , while a seventh - round pick of theirs has become their franchise keeper .
Conclusion : Conventional wisdom is that drafting goaltenders is largely a crapshoot , and that seems to hold true :
There is n't a significant direct relationship between the number of goaltenders your team drafts and whether or not there is any measure of steady goaltending .
Still , drafting more goaltenders will increase your chances of finding one who will work out .
Nor are there guarantees if you 're willing to use high draft choices to select goaltenders , because there is so much uncertainty with a goaltender 's development .
The trick , obviously , is good scouting , and good goalie development .
If your scouts are able to identify the right factors that an NHL goaltender needs , and your personnel department and coaching staff are able to build on those factors to improve the player 's chances , it seems not to matter where he 's drafted .
Although the Senators need to be concerned with filling out their forward ranks for the future of the team , they also need to have goaltending scouts pay serious attention to goalies out there , and not be afraid to pick some , as they appear to have been for much of the past decade .
Democrats have taken issue with the methodology used in polls commissioned by Jane Hamsher 's blog Firedoglake .
Dems rip new Hamsher polls
Frustrated by a series of polls detailing the electoral jeopardy faced by a handful of House Democrats , the party establishment in Washington is pushing back against liberal blogger Jane Hamsher , whose prominent blog Firedoglake commissioned the surveys .
This month , at the request of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz issued a memo slamming the design and composition of the Hamsher - commissioned polls , which reported that four vulnerable House Democrats were in serious trouble .
Advertisement
In late January , a prominent Democratic polling firm , Global Strategy Group — which has conducted extensive work for the DCCC — put out its own memo questioning the accuracy of the automated polling firm , SurveyUSA , that produced the results .
Establishment Democrats , including the incumbents who were the subject of the polls and party committee charged with reelecting them , have sharply criticized the SurveyUSA polls .
“ Let me just say that with respect to those polls , they are totally off , ” Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , told POLITICO .
“ We had the opportunity to compare those polls with polls that have been done in a professional manner , [ and ] the others are very different .
So they ’re not credible . ”
The methodology is not the only issue Democrats have with the polls .
By surveying and then reporting on the fortunes of members targeted by the GOP , Washington Democrats believe , Firedoglake ’s outspoken founder , Jane Hamsher , is advancing a debilitating narrative about the party ’s November prospects that will only exacerbate the problem .
“ I think it , in some ways , gives momentum to the challengers and contributes to this narrative that Democrats are in disarray or in trouble , ” Rep. Tim Bishop ( D - N.Y. ) , one of the polled Democrats , told POLITICO .
“ And , by the way , that may be true in some districts , but I do n’t think that ’s true in mine or others . ”
In any case , the GOP is reveling in the Democratic recriminations : The National Republican Congressional Committee has gleefully promoted the polls in news releases , including one titled “ Bishop Gets Firedogged . ”
Hamsher , for her part , has responded forcefully to the Democratic criticism , publishing on her website several memos from SurveyUSA President Jay Leve that defend the polls ’ methodology .
In an interview , Hamsher said she conducted the polls in order to test support in swing districts for an individual mandate in a health care reform bill .
With the future of health care reform now unclear , Hamsher said she is not planning any further polling on candidates .
She disputed the notion that somehow the polling advances a negative story line about Democrats and accused the party of shooting the messenger by engaging in a concerted campaign to taint the polling her site commissioned .
“ We commissioned the polls prior to the Massachusetts election .
So they actually were the ‘ canary in a coal mine ’ and preceded that piece of collective wisdom , ” Hamsher said .
“ I think it ’s pretty plain .
[ Democrats ] do n’t like the results of the surveys .
They ’re interested in discounting the accuracy of the poll for political purposes . ”
“ If they do n’t like the poll , why do n’t they release the polling of their own ? ” Hamsher asked .
A DCCC official turned down Hamsher ’s challenge , saying the committee would n’t release its internal polling .
One House Democratic aide said the party decided to engage in a concerted pushback on the polls because , “ in some cases , people had the perception the sky was falling , ” and the questions about the surveys “ needed to be told . ”
A big part of the problem is that Hamsher ’s polls have been covered extensively in the media — not just in national outlets , including POLITICO , but also in local news outlets that are more important to a member ’s local political standing .
One of them , the Cincinnati Enquirer , published the mid-January survey showing freshman Rep. Steve Driehaus trailing former GOP Rep .
Steve Chabot by a steep 17 - point margin .
“ You ’ve got to quit writing about these crazy - ass polls , ” Driehaus told POLITICO .
“ They ’re horrible . ”
“ I think it feeds a story line the press is looking for , ” Driehaus said .
“ The fact of the matter is that what ’s so disturbing is so many organizations pick up and run with it without looking at what ’s behind the polling .
I mean , not all polling is the same .
Some is more scientific than others .
And this , at least when I looked at it , was n’t at all scientific . ”
Bishop , a fourth - term Democrat from Long Island , reiterated that point , calling the Firedoglake poll that showed him narrowly leading prospective GOP opponent Randy Altschuler “ flawed ” and adding that his own polling showed him “ way ahead . ”
Indiana Democratic Rep. Baron
Hill called the survey showing former GOP Rep .
Mike Sodrel within 2 percentage points of him “ just not accurate . ”
Global Strategy Group and Emory University ’s Abramowitz both argue that the polling underrepresented voters ages 18 to 34 , and Abramowitz said the wording of the questions about health care was “ clearly biased and loaded . ”
SurveyUSA President Jay Leve fired back to POLITICO , challenging Abramowitz to “ send over poll questions that are not ‘ clearly biased and loaded ’ ” and promising to use them in a survey .
Leve also argued that the sampling of younger voters made sense because voters who participate in midterm elections are typically older .
“ There is nothing wrong with the poll .
Polls were great .
Tough times for Democrats , ” Leve said .
Leve pointed out that he had designed the wording of the questions on his own without Hamsher ’s input .
For House Democrats , the challenge of swatting down troubling survey data is a relatively new development .
“ Even as recently as four years ago , there was relatively little polling in congressional districts until summer or fall of election year , ” said Charles Franklin , a University of Wisconsin political scientist who studies polling .
“ The party has less control over this information .
That ’s an important change . ”
And it ’s not just Hamsher commissioning and releasing polls on individual House members .
Public Policy Polling , a prolific Raleigh , N.C. - based outfit , has published surveys testing the reelection chances of endangered Democratic incumbents , including Reps.
Larry Kissell of North Carolina and Thomas Perriello of Virginia and vulnerable Republicans , such as Reps. Joe Wilson of North Carolina and Michele Bachmann of Minnesota .
The trend is part of a broader proliferation of political surveying in recent years that has expanded the universe of available polling data beyond the numbers released by established firms such as Gallup and media organizations like NBC News and The Wall Street Journal .
A host of organizations , websites and interest groups — many using less - expensive automated polling — now commission surveys testing issues or elections of interest to them .
Mark Blumenthal , a polling analyst and the editor and publisher of Pollster.com , said he counted a multitude of pollsters and organizations surveying January ’s closely watched Massachusetts Senate race that had not previously registered on his radar screen .
“ We ’re just getting more and more data by more platforms than we ’ve ever had — and it ’s becoming part of the debate , ” Blumenthal said .
“ Anybody can be a pollster . ”
Pollster Tom Jensen of Public Policy
Polling said there is little question the wave of new surveys from organizations such as Firedoglake is shaping media coverage of the electoral landscape and reinforcing the oft - repeated view that Democrats in marginal House districts face political peril in 2010 .
“ The polls are definitely reinforcing the conventional wisdom that those swing - district Democrats are really going to have to fight , ” Jensen said .
Much of the concern in Democratic circles is that Hamsher ’s polls , in particular — and the ensuing media coverage of them — could play a role in pushing wavering swing - district Democrats who face tough reelection battles toward retirement .
Jensen said that Arkansas Democratic Rep. Vic Snyder , already the subject of several PPP surveys , announced his retirement on the same day that a Firedoglake - commissioned poll showed him trailing potential GOP opponent Tim Griffin by 17 percentage points .
Bishop and Indiana Rep. Baron Hill , another Hamsher polling subject , are also widely mentioned as potential Democratic retirees — though both insist that they are running for reelection and that Hamsher ’s polling had no impact on their plans .
“ In the case of myself , who has been an athlete for most of my life , it ’s just the opposite .
It backfires , ” Hill told POLITICO .
After writing the preforking echo server example in Pure I wanted to try something a bit more complex .
I 've written Ogg players in various languages before so I decided to do one in Pure to compare .
Here 's some of the ones I 've written in the past :
I wrapped the libogg and libvorbis libraries using the Pure FFI .
A program ' pure - gen ' is included with Pure that will generate FFI wrappers given a C include file .
I ran this against libogg and libvorbis .
The generated Pure wrappers look like :
extern int ogg_page_version ( ogg_page* ) ; extern int ogg_page_continued ( ogg_page* ) ; extern int ogg_page_bos ( ogg_page * ) ;
As you can see Pure FFI definitions look very much like the C definitions .
I decided to model an Ogg file as a list of physical pages .
This is esentially a list containing elements of the libogg ogg_page object .
I have a Pure function that will take this list of pages and return a list of packets for each logical bitstream in the file .
For vorbis playback I take this list of packets for the vorbis bitstream and produce a list of decoded PCM data .
Pure is a strict language by default but provides an '& ' special form to perform lazy evaluation .
I use this to make sure all the returned lists mentioned above are lazy .
Playing the lazy list of decoded PCM data never loads the entire file in memory .
The file is read , converted into packets and decoded as each element of the PCM data list is requested .
For audio playback I use OpenAL .
I queue the PCM data to an OpenAL source up to a limit of 50 queued items , removing them as they get processed and adding new ones when room becomes available .
Here 's what some of the API to process the Ogg files looks like in Pure .
First load the player code .
This will also load the Ogg , Vorbis and OpenAL wrappers :
$ pure - i player .
pure
From the Pure REPL , play a vorbis file :
> play_vorbis ( sources!0 ) " test.ogg " ;
Load an Ogg file getting a lazy list of all pages in the file :
> using namespace ogg ; > let p = file_pages " test.ogg " ; > p ; ogg_page ( #< pointer 0x9e61cc8 > , [... ] ) :#< thunk 0xb7259b38 >
Get a list of all packets and the serial number of the first logical bitstream in the list of pages :
> let ( stream1 , serialno ) = packets p ; > serialno ; 1426627898 > stream1 ; ogg_packet ( # < pointer 0x9dd98f0 > , [... ] ) :#< thunk 0xb725bce0 >
Get the next logical bitstream :
> let p2 = filter ( \x->ogg_page_serialno x ~= serialno ) p ; > p2 ; #< thunk 0xb725dc30 > > let ( stream2, serialno2 ) = packets p2 ; > serialno2 ; 629367739 > stream2 ; ogg_packet ( # < pointer 0x9cfcf08 > , [... ] ) :#< thunk 0xb725c988 >
Note that all these results are lazily evaluated so the entire file is not loaded into memory .
If we look at the original list of pages you 'll see what has been read so far ( two pages ) :
> p ; ogg_page (...) : ogg_page (... ) :#< thunk 0xb725dd98 >
Get all the streams in the file :
> let s = all_streams p ;
Get all the vorbis streams :
> let v = vorbis_streams s ;
Get the first vorbis stream .
I ignore the serial number here ( this is what the _ does ) :
> let ( v1 , _ ) = v!0 ;
Decode the vorbis header packets and intialize a vorbis decoder for the first vorbis stream :
> let decoder = vorbis_header v1 ;
Get a lazy list of all the decoded PCM data from the vorbis stream :
> let pcm = pcm_data decoder ;
The mechanics of getting the decoding floating point data from libvorbis into Pure and then back to the OpenAL C API is made easier due to it being possible to easily convert to and from raw C pointers and Pure matrix objects .
For example , the data returned from the vorbis call to decode the data is an array of pointers pointing to an array of floats .
To convert this to a Pure matrix with dimensions ( c , n ) where ' c ' is the number of channels and ' n ' is the number of samples :
vorbis_synthesis_read dsp samples $ $ matrix m when f0 = get_pointer data ; floats = [ get_pointer ( f0 +( x * 4 ) ) |x=0 ..( channels - 1 ) ] ; m = map ( float_matrix samples ) floats ; end ;
This code uses a list comprehension to return a list of ' pointer to array of floats ' .
One pointer for each channel in the audio data .
It then maps over this list producing a new list containing a matrix of float's .
This is list of matrices each of which contains the audio data for a channel .
The ' matrix m' call converts this to a single matrix of dimensions ( c , n ) .
OpenAL expects the data as a pointer to a contiguous matrix of floats with dimensions ( n , c ) so when writing to OpenAL the matrix needs to be transposed :
play_pcm source rate pcm@( x:xs ) = .... queue_sample source rate ( transpose x ) $ $ play source $ $ play_pcm source rate xs ;
This transposed matrix is later converted from floats to 16 bit integers and ' packed ' so it is contiguous in memory , and a pointer to the raw memory passed to OpenAL :
buffer16 s = pack ( map clamp s ) ; ... data = buffer 16 ... pcmdata ... ; alBufferData ... ( cooked ( short_pointer NULL data ) ) ( ( #data ) * ( sizeof sshort_t ) ) ...;
The ' cooked ' call means the C memory has ' free ' called on it when nothing in Pure is holding onto it anymore .
One downside with lazy lists is it can be easy to accidently read the entire file and decode everything before playing .
This will cause issues with large Ogg files .
I managed to avoid that and files play in constant memory .
An iteratee style approach might be interesting to try as an alternative to lazy lists .
I 'd like to try decoding Theora files and doing a / v sync in Pure at some point as well .
I have n't used Pure much but it seemed to be fairly simple to put this together .
I 'd be interested in feedback on the approach ( using lazy lists ) and Pure style issues in the code .

What is Dedicated server ?
How to use cPanel in Dedicated server
Preyasing2
what is a dedicated server
A dedicated hosting service , dedicated server , or managed hosting service is a type of Internet hosting in which the client leases an entire server not shared with anyone else .
This is more flexible than shared hosting , as organizations have full control over the server (s ) , including choice of operating system , hardware , etc .
There is also another level of dedicated or managed hosting commonly referred to as complex managed hosting .
Complex Managed Hosting applies to both physical dedicated servers , Hybrid server , and virtual servers , with many companies choosing a hybrid ( combination of physical and virtual ) hosting solution .
There are many similarities between standard and complex managed hosting but the key difference is the level of administrative and engineering support that the customer pays for – owing to both the increased size and complexity of the infrastructure deployment .
The provider steps in to take over most of the management , including security , memory , storage and IT support .
The service is primarily proactive in nature .
Server administration can usually be provided by the hosting company as an add - on service .
In some cases , a dedicated server can offer less overhead and a larger return on investment .
Dedicated servers are most often housed in data centers , similar to colocation facilities , providing redundant power sources and HVAC systems .
In contrast to colocation , the server hardware is owned by the provider and in some cases , they will provide support for operating systems or applications .
Using a dedicated hosting service offers the benefits of high performance , security , email stability , and control .
Due to the relatively high price of dedicated hosting , it is mostly used by websites that receive a large volume of traffic .
Using a dedicated server with cPanel ?
We will see below how to use a dedicated server with cPanel and install in just 5 steps to ensure that it can effectively accommodate all your web sites , then you can determine how to use a dedicated server with cPanel and that fully list the initial installation of your operating system and configuration of network interfaces , you must still take steps before your cPanel dedicated server is ready .
1. Complete the initial setup of the cPanel server .
This should take place when you log in for the first time , most people tend to browse only those options that are provided by default in many cases that ’s fine , however doing so will find useful options which over time will make your work much easier .
Check that the hostname and the primary and secondary nameservers are correct , cPanel will try to configure most of these elements , based on the name of the host that are located in your initial configuration , then you must ensure that you have set up an email address Contact for your cPanel dedicated server , this will be useful to find out how to use a dedicated server with cPanel avoiding the inconvenience that may arise .
Using a dedicated server with cPanel
2. Executes updating Apache .
This step is essential to set up a cPanel dedicated server , since there are the types of PHP scripts and commands you can use in your web page , learning how to use a dedicated with cPanel server is pretty easy , all you have to do is check or uncheck the boxes corresponding to the PHP version , you should not close the browser window while carrying out the process .
3. Prepares packages for your server accounts .
Carried out this work as a quick and easy way to ensure that your sites will not consume all the resources of cPanel dedicated server , you can do it from the “ Package Manager ” in WHM , and leave the resources available to other sites .
4. know the WHM Security Center .
This is carried out infrequently , however , I realize it will allow you to maintain a higher level of security for your dedicated server cPanel login there through section go to “ Security – Security Center ” , usually dedicated servers bring disabled all your options , so you know them and review them that can help you to enable or disable various functions as you need it .
5 . Sets backups of your dedicated server .
Developing a good backup is vital for everyone , be sure to create them on your own dedicated server , fortunately , discover how to use a dedicated server with cPanel for this purpose is very easy , you just log into WHM and go to section “ Backup – Configure Backup ” and check the Enabled or Enable checkbox .
By Robert Samuelson - February 12 , 2010
WASHINGTON -- Paul Ryan , a six - term Republican congressman from Wisconsin who is the ranking minority member of the House Budget Committee , has yanked himself from obscurity by doing something no one else in Congress or apparently the White House has done : design a specific plan to control long - term government spending and budget deficits .
That he stands virtually alone is a damning commentary on our politics .
Many public policy problems are genuinely hard .
How to guarantee job creation ?
Provide financial stability ?
Improve inner-city schools ?
There are no panaceas .
By contrast , solutions to the long - term budget imbalance are obvious : cut spending or raise taxes .
Given the predictable retirement of baby boomers , it was no secret that promised government benefits would overwhelm the existing tax base .
This problem could have been fixed .
It has n't because our political culture is so wedded to public opinion that it can't ( or wo n't ) govern .
To govern is to choose , and our leaders recoil from unpopular choices .
Americans want generous benefits and low taxes , so that 's what the system -- led by either Democrats or Republicans -- provides .
President Obama continues this tradition .
His administration 's long - term budget projections show skyrocketing debt .
In 2008 , federal debt held by the public equaled 40 percent of the economy ( gross domestic product ) .
The administration has it rising to 77 percent of GDP in 2020 , 99 percent in 2030 and 218 percent in 2050 .
In reality , not choosing is a choice : to govern by crisis .
Someday , the debt and associated interest payments ( projected at $ 840 billion in 2020 , a seventh of federal spending ) may trigger a financial backlash .
Lenders wo n't lend or will demand much higher rates .
Congress would then be forced to cut benefits or raise taxes .
The unstated hope is that the crisis occurs on someone else 's watch .
Ryan rejects this consensus .
He would make choices now .
Here are some features of his plan :
-- Social Security : For those 55 or older today , the program would remain unchanged .
For those younger , benefits would be reduced -- with no cuts for the poorest workers .
Workers 55 or younger in 2011 could establish individual investment accounts that would be funded with part of their payroll taxes .
Government would guarantee a return equal to inflation .
-- Medicare : Current recipients and those enrolling in the next decade would continue under today 's program , though wealthier recipients would pay somewhat higher premiums .
In 2021 , Medicare would become a voucher program for new recipients ( those today 54 or younger ) .
With vouchers , recipients would buy Medicare - certified private insurance .
In today 's dollars , the vouchers would ultimately grow to $ 11,000 .
Eligibility ages for Medicare and Social Security would slowly increase toward 69 and 70 , respectively .
-- Spending Freeze : From 2010 to 2019 , " non-defense discretionary spending " -- about a sixth of the federal budget , including everything from housing to parks to education -- would be frozen at 2009 levels .
-- Simpler Taxes : Taxpayers could choose between today 's system or a streamlined replacement with no deductions and virtually no special tax breaks .
Above a tax - free amount ( $ 39,000 for a family of four ) , taxpayers would pay only two rates : 10 percent up to $ 100,000 for joint filers and 25 percent on income more than that .
Parts of Ryan 's plan I like .
It acknowledges the necessity of controlling Social Security and Medicare benefits .
Eligibility ages should rise , reflecting longer life expectancy .
Medicare vouchers might force a restructuring of the health care delivery system so that networks of hospitals , doctors and clinics compete on the basis of cost and quality .
Simpler taxes would be desirable .
Other parts I dislike .
Individual Social Security accounts are a confusing mix of government welfare and private investment .
Medicare reforms should start sooner .
The discretionary spending freeze would probably result in across - the - board cuts when we should eliminate bad programs .
Ryan limits taxes to 19 percent of GDP , slightly above their 1970 - 2009 average of 18 percent .
As a result , Ryan 's plan -- though producing much less debt than Obama 's budgets -- still does n't work .
It would n't balance the budget until 2063 , estimates the Congressional Budget Office .
Yikes -- that 's far too distant .
Any sound proposal would include greater tax increases than conservatives like and greater spending cuts than liberals like .
But the larger point is that Ryan is trying to start a conversation on the desirable role and limits of government .
He 's trying to make it possible to talk about sensitive issues -- mainly Social Security and Medicare -- without being vilified .
President Obama recognized that when he called Ryan 's plan a " serious proposal . "
But since then , Democrats have resorted to ritualistic denunciations of him as pillaging Social Security and Medicare .
Legitimate debate becomes impossible .
If Democrats do n't like Ryan 's vision , the proper response is to design and defend their own plan .
The fact that they do n't have one is a national embarrassment .
Welcome to Washington , Scott Walker
( John McDonnell / The Washington Post )
Newly acquired winger Scott Walker , above , scored twice in a three - minute span in the third period to propel the Caps to a win over Tampa Bay :
Soon after the Washington Capitals traded for Scott Walker at Wednesday 's deadline , Coach Bruce Boudreau noted how the gritty winger had a knack for scoring important goals .
Well , it took Walker exactly one game to prove Boudreau 's point .
The 36 - year - old scored twice in the third period , including the winner just 41 seconds after the Tampa Bay Lightning had tied the score , as the Capitals escaped with 5 - 4 victory at Verizon Center .
" His history , " Coach Bruce Boudreau said , " has been that he 's in the right place at the right time . " |

In the middle of one of America 's poorer cities , residents are about to get an unexpected gift : one gigabit per second Internet access over fiber optic cables courtesy of Cleveland 's Case Western Reserve University .
According to the school 's vice president for Information Technology Services , Lev Gonick , 72 percent of the homes around campus have no Internet access of any kind ; 60 percent are on food stamps .
" On a national scale , neighbors of the University have as much Internet access as Panamanians or Vietnamese , " he wrote last year in a blog entry announcing the school 's new project .
That 's slowly changing as the university embarks on an ambitious research project to roll out 1 G bps Internet access to the immediate neighborhood , possibly extending this testbed network to 25,000 total Cleveland residents in total .
While most of the US has to live without any fiber at all , residents near University Circle are getting two strands apiece .
How much will it cost the residents ?
Nothing .
The project is a research - driven attempt to find out if broadband can deliver more than e-mail and Web browsing .
Can it provide what the community truly needs — public safety , more educational opportunities , and better medicine ?
Case Western Reserve does n't yet know , but within a year , it plans to find out .
Fiber : can it make a neighborhood safe ?
The school has a long history of working with fiber internally .
Back in networking 's Dark Ages — 1989 — the school had gone so far as to wire fiber to every outlet , offering 10 M bps Ethernet connections at a time when Cat3 was still the main twisted pair standard .
In 2001 , Gonick became CIO and the university decided that the future was 1 Gbps .
It set about upgrading every outlet on campus to that speed .
By 2009 , it realized that this bandwidth bounty could be pushed into the surrounding community and used as a testbed to find out just how a transformative truly high speed broadband might ( or might not ) be .
Given the school 's location , public safety was the first priority for the deployment .
No less than six separate public safety communities exist right in University Circle , and a fast broadband network could make it easier for them to share video feeds , share dispatching technology , and improve their coordination .
In the neighborhoods around the school , a fat broadband pipe could make it easy to do remote video monitoring — in fact , two local apartment building owners have already told Gonick that they plan to use the new fiber build to help monitor each other 's buildings .
( See a video tour of the neighborhoods around the school below . )
A million - dollar prize for solving one of toughest problems in mathematics has been awarded to a Russian mathematician , but the real puzzle is whether he ’ll accept it .
The reclusive Grigori Perelman has been recognised for his proof of the Poincaré conjecture , one of seven Millennium prize problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute ( CMI ) in 2000 as the most important unsolved problems in mathematics .
The conjecture , proposed by Henri Poincaré in 1904 , deals with the properties of spheres in three dimensions .
If we tie a loop around a two - dimensional sphere , such as the skin of an orange , it ’s always possible to shrink it down to a point .
The same is n’t true of a doughnut , as a loop passing through the central hole cannot be shrunk .
Poincaré asserted this was also true in three dimensions for a sphere .
Perelman published a proof in 2002 , but since became disillusioned with mathematics and withdrew from the mathematical community .
In 2006 he refused to accept a Fields medal for his work , an award often described as the Nobel prize of mathematics .
The president of CMI , James Carlson , is waiting to see if Perelman will do the same for the Millennium prize .
“ It may be a while before he makes his decision , ” he says .
The Poincaré conjecture is the only one of the seven Millennium problems that has been solved to date , and the fate of the prize money is uncertain if Perelman rejects .

Eagle - eyed experts spotted this gorilla in one of the pictures sent back by the Spirit Rover .
Of course , NASA 's trying to cover it up .
But it 's not the weirdest Martian we 've found so far .

Not only do some observers believe that 's a gorilla running around on the red planet , but they believe the dark shape to its left is a second gorilla , as you 'll see over at the Mars Anomalies web site .
Enthusiasts have even gone so far as to create a Youtube video about gorillas fighting in the Martian mist :
The Emo music is really what makes it .
Those gorillas really feel , you know ?
But they 're also latecomers .
There have already been lots of others on Mars before them .
Here 's a list :

The Face On Mars :
Pretty self explanatory .
The 1976 Viking orbiter found this one , and since then NASA has spent a lot of time and energy trying to prove it's not a real face , by coming up with more detail images of this phenomenon , including 3 - D views .
But it 's still a face , as any expert will tell you .

She 's a more recent arrival , discovered by Spirit in 2008 .
She could be waiting for a bus , as one newspaper puts it .
She might be waiting a while — they do n't really have buses on Mars .
Silly woman .

Trees On Mars :
Discovered this past January by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , these " trees " are actually just trails of dislodged sand .

Also found in 2008 , this block of timber is a major mystery .
There are no forests on Mars — unless NASA was lying about those trees in the previous item .
Things that make you go hmmm .
Also , the wooden block looks like it was carried there by water , within the past few decades .

Maggie Gallagher : ' I 'm in favor of marriage equality '
by Jeremy Hooper
Point :
" I 'm against discrimination , I ’m against hatred , I ’m in favor of marriage equality , but I do n’t think same - sex marriage is marriage .
Therefore I think it is wrong for the government to insist , through the use of law , that we all believe that same - sex unions are marriages .
” - Maggie Gallagher , as quoted by the Catholic News Agency
Counterpoint :
" So you 're against discrimination as you define it , not the way that it 's defined by the tax - paying citizens whose loving bonds are being denied in ways dissimilar from their heterosexual peers ?
Why , exactly , should the stakes of this debate be defined by they who are driving a stake in the peaceful , principled progress as it's almost universally defined by the community that 's directly affected ?
It 's kind of like a schoolyard bully justifying his ' right ' to take the smaller kid's lunch money simply because the mashed potatoes taste good to his personal palate !
I actually believe you , Maggie , that you think your stance is non-discriminatory .
Sincerely .
But the operative words there are ' you ' and ' think . '
Because the fact is :
It does n't matter how you , a Catholic , personally view marriage .
It does n't matter whether you will or will not ever recognize same - sex unions in your own life .
And on that same token : it does n't even matter how I , a legally married gay man , view marriage .
What matters is policy , and whether certain policies jibe with the promises of this nation 's governing documents .
Right now , America 's marriage laws fail in this area .
Gay couples have more than ably made their case , which is why we have been winning in the courts of law .
These courts of law DO matter more than Maggie Gallagher 's personal opinion , regardless of how fully activists like yourself might want to place the ' activist ' label on the independent judiciary . "
- Jeremy Hooper , as quoted while looking over his and his husband 's taxes , which are demonstrably ( and sickeningly ) higher than they would be if their state - recognized marriage was fully recognized under federal law
Your thoughts
I 'm in favor of dogs , but I just do n't think that Pekingese are dogs , therefore I just think it 's unfair that the government insist that we all treat Pekingese as dogs .
( I actually do believe this . )

" I ’m in favor of marriage equality , but I do n’t think same - sex marriage is marriage . "
Then , you 're not for marriage equality .

FABULOUS analogy , Evan ! :o )
Posted by : Wade MacMorrighan | Jan 27 , 2010 11:16:05 AM
One interesting point about Maggie :
She never , ever , EVER weighs in on matters like DADT , ENDA .
hate crimes leg. , etc .
That 's an odd disconnect for someone who is * so* focused on the LGBT community .
So I 've posed that question to her .
If she truly does believe in equality , what are her views on these other issues ?
One would think that if she was supportive of our non-discrimination in other areas , she'd be shouting that fact from the rooftops .
But she has n't done so .
I 'm now giving her that opportunity .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Jan 27 , 2010 11:38:43 AM
I ’m in favor of marriage equality too , but I do n’t think a Catholic / Hindu marriage is marriage - especially when the Catholic " wife " keeps her Hindu " married " name hidden from the public so she can be accepted and funded by them in order to conduct a massive campaign of persecution against certain other people who want to marry the person they love .
Posted by : Richard Rush | Jan 27 , 2010 11:41:18 AM
This is what Ted Olsen says of Pugno's Blankenhorn 's comments about the " de-/institutionalization " of marriage , and his comments are actually quite appropriate for all of the empty rhetoric coming from the lying liars : " It ’s a game .
It ’s a tautology .
They ’re saying , ' this is the definition .
You ’re going to change the definition by allowing people access that do n't have it now , and that would change it so that people who currently have access wo n't want it any more because it 's changed . '
This is all nonsense .
They are not proving that .
This is a syllogism that falls apart .
The major premise , minor premise and conclusion are empty . "
Posted by : Dick Mills | Jan 27 , 2010 11:56:11 AM
Another thing , I 've noticed about Maggie ....
Based on debates I 've heard her be a part of at various places around the country , I am under the impression that love is less important to her than a heterosexual couple being married .
I heard her say in one of these debates ( I 'm sorry I ca n't remember which , but it was very recent ) that our society embraces " soul - mate marriage " and she was looking at " soul - mate " marriage like it's a bad thing !
Also , after hearing about a gay couple and their loving committed long term partnerships , she has said things like it sounds better than HER OWN marriage !
Given the fact the she and her husband rarely ever appear in public together and her refusal to use her married name , it seems to me that she thinks that it does n't even matter if the married couple is happy or even love ( or like ) each other , just the fact that a piece of paper says they 're married makes for a good well - adjusted kids .
That I just do n't get , especially if the parents are miserable together .

I love how you weave the issues into your personal life ( i.e. taxes , etc ) .

TORONTO : The Canadian Taxpayers Federation ( CTF ) responded to the Ontario budget today decrying the McGuinty government ’s plans to run nine years of deficits .
CTF Federal Director , Kevin Gaudet said “ this is a never - ending deficit nightmare .
Premier McGuinty is just closing his eyes and hoping it will go away .
Instead , he should be taking meaningful action to get spending under control . ”
Nine Years of Deficit Spending adds $ 116.6 billion to debt – borrowing at $ 675 per second
The government is projecting a deficit of $ 21.3 billion for 2009 - 10 , the largest deficit in the history of Ontario .
Deficits are projected through 2017 - 18 .
In nine years of deficits , Premier McGuinty will add $ 116.6 billion more to Ontario ’s debt .
That amount is $ 9,328 for each man , woman and child in Ontario .
The government is borrowing at a rate of $ 58.4 million per day .
“ If , during the last six years , the government had held the line on spending , Ontario would n’t be suffering through this nightmare .
There would be no deficit at all ” , said Gaudet .
Spending - Blowing Past the $ 100 - Billion Mark – climbs 11 per cent per year
Government program spending under Mr. McGuinty was $ 64.3 billion in 2003 / 04 .
Spending in 2010 - 2011 is projected to explode to $ 115.9 billion .
This is an increase of $ 51.6 billion in seven years – an increase of over 80 per cent – above 11 per cent for each year of the McGuinty government .
Spending restraint measures include a three year freeze on MPP pay , a measure the CTF has been calling for and applauds .
However , “ freezing the pay of non-unionized public sector employees while refusing to do anything to reduce the lucrative compensation of unionized public sector employees is a meaningless gesture that will only serve to create internal job hostility ” said Gaudet .
HST
Hikes taxes by 8 per cent July 1st , Revenue to Climb $ 1.7 billion
The CTF called on the McGuinty government to reduce the blended rate down to 10 per cent from the proposed 13 per cent .
Instead , there is a new credit for northern resident of up to $ 200 per family .
The HST for gasoline alone will increase costs by over $ 800 per year ” Gaudet said .
Equalization Climbs to $ 972 million
This is an increase of $ 625 million from 2009 - 10 and provide further evidence of a need to reduce the program .
Gaudet concluded , “ this budget offers a do - nothing approach to financial security for which Ontarians will have to pay a large price for years to come . ”
Bill Gates talks about
vaccines to reduce population 
By F. William Engdahl , 4 March 2010
Microsoft founder and one of the worlds wealthiest men , Bill Gates , projects an image of a benign philanthropist using his billions via his ( tax exempt ) Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , to tackle diseases , solve food shortages in Africa and alleviate poverty .
In a recent conference in California , Gates reveals a less public agenda of his philanthropy ―population reduction , otherwise known as eugenics .
Gates made his remarks to the invitation - only Long Beach , California TED2010 Conference , in a speech titled ,  Innovating to Zero !.
Along with the scientifically absurd proposition of reducing manmade CO2 emissions worldwide to zero by 2050 , approximately four and a half minutes into the talk , Gates declares , " First we got population .
The world today has 6.8 billion people .
That 's headed up to about 9 billion .
Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent .
" 1 ( authors emphasis ) .
In plain English , one of the most powerful men in the world states clearly that he expects vaccines to be used to reduce population growth .
When Bill Gates speaks about vaccines , he speaks with authority .
In January 2010 at the elite Davos World Economic Forum , Gates announced his foundation would give $ 10 billion ( circa € 7.5 billion ) over the next decade to develop and deliver new vaccines to children in the developing world .
The primary focus of his multi-billion dollar Gates Foundation is vaccinations , especially in Africa and other underdeveloped countries .
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a founding member of the GAVI Alliance ( Global Alliance for Vaccinations and Immunization ) in partnership with the World Bank , WHO and the vaccine industry .
The goal of GAVI is to vaccinate every newborn child in the developing world .
2
Now that sounds like noble philanthropic work .
The problem is that the vaccine industry has been repeatedly caught dumping dangerous ―meaning unsafe because untested or proven harmful ―vaccines onto unwitting Third World populations when they cannot get rid of the vaccines in the West .3
Some organizations have suggested that the true aim of the vaccinations is to make people sicker and even more susceptible to disease and premature death .
4
Dumping toxins on the Third World
In the aftermath of the most recent unnecessary Pandemic declaration of a global H1N1 swine flu emergency , industrial countries were left sitting on hundreds of millions of doses of untested vaccines .
They decided to get rid of the embarrassing leftover drugs by handing them over to the WHO which in turn plans to dump them for free on select poor countries .
France has given 91 million of the 94 million doses the Sarkozy government bought from the pharma giants ; Britain gave 55 million of its 60 million doses .
The story for Germany and Norway is similar .
5
As Dr. Thomas Jefferson , an epidemiologist with the Cochrane Research Center in Rome noted ,  Why do they give the vaccines to the developing countries at all ?
The pandemic has been called off in most parts of the world .
The greatest threat in poor countries right now is heart and circulatory diseases while the virus figures at the bottom of the list .
What is the medical reason for donating 180 million doses ?6
As well , flu is a minor problem in countries with abundant sunshine , and it turned out that the feared H1N1 Pandemic new great plague was the mildest flu on record .
The pharmaceutical vaccine makers do not speak about the enormous health damage from infant vaccination including autism and numerous neuro - muscular deformities that have been traced back to the toxic adjuvants and preservatives used in most vaccines .
Many vaccines , especially multi- dose vaccines that are made more cheaply for sale to the Third World , contain something called Thimerosal ( Thiomersol in the EU ) , a compound ( sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate ) , containing some 50 % mercury , used as a preservative .
In July 1999 the US  National Vaccine Information Center declared in a press release that , " The cumulative effects of ingesting mercury can cause brain damage . "
The same month , the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) alerted the public about the possible health effects associated with thimerosal - containing vaccines .
They strongly recommended that thimerosal be removed from vaccines as soon as possible .
Under the directive of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 , the Food and Drug Administration also determined that infants who received several thimerosal - containing vaccines may be receiving mercury exposure over and above the recommended federal guidelines .

A new form of eugenics ?
Gates interest in inducing population reduction among black and other minority populations is not new unfortunately .
As I document in my book , Seeds of Destruction8 , since the 1920s the Rockefeller Foundation had funded the eugenics research in Germany through the Kaiser - Wilhelm Institutes in Berlin and Munich , including well into the Third Reich .
They praised the forced sterilization of people by Hirtler Germany , and the Nazi ideas on race purity .
It was John D. Rockefeller III , a life - long advocate of eugenics , who used his tax free foundation money to initiate the population reduction neo-Malthusian movement through his private Population Council in New York beginning in the 1950s .
The idea of using vaccines to covertly reduce births in the Third World is also not new .
Bill Gates good friend , David Rockefeller and his Rockefeller Foundation were involved as early as 1972 in a major project together with WHO and others to perfect another new vaccine . 
The results of the WHO - Rockefeller project were put into mass application on human guinea pigs in the early 1990's .
The WHO oversaw massive vaccination campaigns against tetanus in Nicaragua , Mexico and the Philippines .
Comite Pro Vida de Mexico , a Roman Catholic lay organization , became suspicious of the motives behind the WHO program and decided to test numerous vials of the vaccine and found them to contain human Chorionic Gonadotrophin , or hCG .
That was a curious component for a vaccine designed to protect people against lock - jaw arising from infection with rusty nail wounds or other contact with certain bacteria found in soil .
The tetanus disease was indeed , also rather rare .
It was also curious because hCG was a natural hormone needed to maintain a pregnancy .
However , when combined with a tetanus toxoid carrier , it stimulated formation of antibodies against hCG , rendering a woman incapable of maintaining a pregnancy , a form of concealed abortion .
Similar reports of vaccines laced with hCG hormones came from the Philippines and Nicaragua.9
Gates  Gene Revolution in Africa
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , along with David Rockefellers Rockefeller Foundation , the creators of the GMO biotechnology , are also financing a project called The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) headed by former UN chief , Kofi Annan .
Accepting the role as AGRA head in June 2007 Annan expressed his gratitude to the Rockefeller Foundation , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , and all others who support our African campaign . 
The AGRA board is dominated by people from both the Gates and Rockefeller foundations .10
Monsanto , DuPont , Dow , Syngenta and other major GMO agribusiness giants are reported at the heart of AGRA , using it as a back - door to spread their patented GMO seeds across Africa under the deceptive label , bio - technology ,  a euphemism for genetically engineered patented seeds .
The person from the Gates Foundation responsible for its work with AGRA is Dr. Robert Horsch , a 25 - year Monsanto GMO veteran who was on the team that developed Monsantos RoundUp Ready GMO technologies .
His job is reportedly to use Gates money to introduce GMO into Africa .11
To date South Africa is the only African country permitting legal planting of GMO crops .
In 2003 Burkina Faso authorized GMO trials .
In 2005 Kofi Annans Ghana drafted bio-safety legislation and key officials expressed their intentions to pursue research into GMO crops .
AGRA is being used to create networks of agro - dealers  across Africa , at first with no mention of GMO seeds or herbicides , in order to have the infrastructure in place to massively introduce GMO.12
GMO , glyphosate and population reduction
GMO crops have never been proven safe for human or animal consumption .
Moreover , they are inherently genetically unstable  as they are an unnatural product of introducing a foreign bacteria such as Bacillus Thuringiensis ( Bt ) or other material into the DNA of a given seed to change its traits .
Perhaps equally dangerous are the paired  chemical herbicides sold as a mandatory part of a GMO contract , such as Monsantos Roundup , the most widely used such herbicide in the world .
It contains highly toxic glyphosate compounds that have been independently tested and proven to exist in toxic concentrations in GMO applications far above that safe for humans or animals .
Tests show that tiny amounts of glyphosate compounds would do damage to a human umbilical , embryonic and placental cells in a pregnant woman drinking the ground water near a GMO field .13
One long - standing project of the US Government has been to perfect a genetically - modified variety of corn , the diet staple in Mexico and many other Latin American countries .
The corn has been field tested in tests financed by the US Department of Agriculture along with a small California bio - tech company named Epicyte .
Announcing his success at a 2001 press conference , the president of Epicyte , Mitch Hein , pointing to his GMO corn plants , announced ,  We have a hothouse filled with corn plants that make anti-sperm antibodies .
14
Hein explained that they had taken antibodies from women with a rare condition known as immune infertility , isolated the genes that regulated the manufacture of those infertility antibodies , and , using genetic engineering techniques , had inserted the genes into ordinary corn seeds used to produce corn plants .
In this manner , in reality they produced a concealed contraceptive embedded in corn meant for human consumption .
 Essentially , the antibodies are attracted to surface receptors on the sperm ,  said Hein .
 They latch on and make each sperm so heavy it cannot move forward .
It just shakes about as if it was doing the lambada .
15 Hein claimed it was a possible solution to world over - population .
The moral and ethical issues of feeding it to humans in Third World poor countries without their knowing it countries he left out of his remarks .
Spermicides hidden in GMO corn provided to starving Third World populations through the generosity of the Gates foundation , Rockefeller Foundation and Kofi Annans AGRA or vaccines that contain undisclosed sterilization agents are just two documented cases of using vaccines or GMO seeds to reduce population . 
And the  Good Club 
Gates  TED2010 speech on zero emissions and population reduction is consistent with a report that appeared in New York Citys ethnic media , Irish .
Central.com in May 2009 .
According to the report , a secret meeting took place on May 5 , 2009 at the home of Sir Paul Nurse , President of Rockefeller University , among some of the wealthiest people in America .
Investment guru Warren Buffett who in 2006 decided to pool his $ 30 billion Buffett Foundation into the Gates foundation to create the worlds largest private foundation with some $ 60 billions of tax - free dollars was present .
Banker David Rockefeller was the host .
The exclusive letter of invitation was signed by Gates , Rockefeller and Buffett .
They decided to call themselves the  Good Club . 
Also present was media czar Ted Turner , billionaire founder of CNN who stated in a 1996 interview for the Audubon nature magazine , where he said that a 95 % reduction of world population to between 225-300 million would be ideal .
In a 2008 interview at Philadelphias Temple University , Turner fine - tuned the number to 2 billion , a cut of more than 70 % from todays population .
Even less elegantly than Gates , Turner stated , we have too many people .
That s why we have global warming .
We need less people using less stuff ( sic ) .16
Others attending this first meeting of the Good Club reportedly were : Eli Broad real estate billionaire , New Yorks billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Wall Street billionaire and Council on Foreign Relations former head , Peter G. Peterson .
In addition , Julian H. Robertson , Jr. , hedge - fund billionaire who worked with Soros attacking the currencies of Thailand , Indonesia , South Korea and the Asian Tigen economies , precipitating the 1997 - 98 Asia Crisis .
Also present at the first session of the Good Club was Patty Stonesifer , former chief executive of the Gates foundation , and John Morgridge of Cisco Systems .
The group represented a combined fortune of more than $ 125 billion .17
According to reports apparently leaked by one of the attendees , the meeting was held in response to the global economic downturn and the numerous health and environmental crises that are plaguing the globe .
But the central theme and purpose of the secret Good Club meeting of the plutocrats was the priority concern posed by Bill Gates , namely , how to advance more effectively their agenda of birth control and global population reduction .
In the talks a consensus reportedly emerged that they would back a strategy in which population growth would be tackled as a potentially disastrous environmental , social and industrial threat .
18
Global Eugenics agenda
Gates and Buffett are major funders of global population reduction programs , as is Turner , whose UN Foundation was created to funnel $ 1 billion of his tax - free stock option earnings in AOL - Time - Warner into various birth reduction programs in the developing world .
19
The programs in Africa and elsewhere are masked as philanthropy and providing health services for poor Africans .
In reality they involve involuntary population sterilization via vaccination and other medicines that make women of child - bearing age infertile .
The Gates Foundation , where Buffett deposited the bulk of his wealth two years ago , is also backing introduction of GMO seeds into Africa under the cloak of the Kofi Annan - led  Second Green Revolution in Africa .
The introduction of GMO patented seeds in Africa to date has met with enormous indigenous resistance .
Health experts point out that were the intent of Gates really to improve the health and well - being of black Africans , the same hundreds of millions of dollars the Gates Foundation has invested in untested and unsafe vaccines could be used in providing minimal sanitary water and sewage systems .
Vaccinating a child who then goes to drink feces - polluted river water is hardly healthy in any respect .
But of course cleaning up the water and sewage systems of Africa would revolutionize the health conditions of the Continent .
Gates  TED2010 comments about having new vaccines to reduce global population were obviously no off - the - cuff remark .
For those who doubt , the presentation Gates made at the TED2009 annual gathering said almost exactly the same thing about reducing population to cut global warming .
For the mighty and powerful of the Good Club , human beings seem to be a form of pollution equal to CO2 .

sorry wrong pic
J.D. Hayworth , the tebaggers favourite who is challenging Senator John McCain in the Arizona Republican primary , has revealed he has some very questionable thought processes .
He told a Florida radio interview that he was in support of a Constitutional ban on same Sex marriage because otherwise , men may be persuaded to marry horses .
I blame the horses , they are such flirts .
Men after all you just ca n’t trust ’em .
Here he is on radio explaining that when it comes to horses , men really can not help themselves .
You see , the Massachusetts Supreme Court , when it started this move toward same - sex marriage , actually defined marriage — now get this — it defined marriage as simply , ‘ the establishment of intimacy , ’ ” Hayworth said .
“ Now how dangerous is that ?
I mean , I do n’t mean to be absurd about it , but I guess I can make the point of absurdity with an absurd point — I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse , I guess you could marry your horse .
It ’s just the wrong way to go , and the only way to protect the institution of marriage is with that federal marriage amendment that I support . ”
I ’m not sure what films Mr Hayworth has been watching , but I could see why he may be disturbed if he picked up a wrong copy of animal farm .
He has indeed got a very very strange attitude .
If he ever did get elected , I ’d apply the Glenn Beck rule to him – watch this one , he could end up with a dead intern or a live horse .
Altogether now
I Love Horses .
Best of all the animals .
I love horses .
They ’re my friends .
I Love Horses .
Best of all the animals .
I hear the unfortunately named Neal Horsley is getting excited .
9 Update – he went on Rachel Maddow to defend his position and did not do too well ]
Apologies that this is a few days late .
The review code we received had a big old crazy bug in it , completely fixed in the released version .
But never mind , because finally you can find out Wot I Think about Just Cause 2 – a game that I ’ve been unquestionably looking forward to thanks to one of the best trailer campaigns we ’ve seen .
But can it live up to that hype ?
Will it have heeded my constant plea : “ please do n’t let the game get in the way of the fun ” ?
“ How was your day ? ” someone asked me on Sunday evening .
“ I found a hot - air balloon in the mountains , landed it on top of a skyscraper where there was a helicopter , which I used to pull over a statue .
Then I stole a passenger plane from an airport and flew it into the ground , ” I replied .
Just Cause 2 gives you conversation topics .
There ’s a purpose here .
You , Rico , are trying to find out of a colleague has gone rogue , then to attempt to overthrow a fascist dictator , and to do so your task is to cause as much Chaos as possible .
Which is a great premise .
You ’re just there to cause trouble , make a mess , and it ’s rarely more sophisticated than that .
There ’s the odd escort mission , perhaps you ’ll have to get a car to a destination .
But it ’s primarily about blowing stuff up .
There ’s then lots of story wormed in to attempt to dignify this , but it ’s completely superfluous .
And the voice acting is so atrocious ( and occasionally downright offensive ) that it becomes laughable .
Ignore all that .
It ’s about blowing shit up .
That ’s enough .
What else have I done of late ?
There was that time I drove a car off a cliff , free - fell then parachuted , grappled my way onto a boat , threw the driver into the sea , and then rammed the boat into building .
Oh , I liberated about 15 towns yesterday afternoon by the radical process of blowing everything up , and stealing all their supplies .
It was helping !
I helped some militant factions take territory from the despotic leader of the group of islands , Panau , mostly by blowing other stuff up .
I shot helicopters out of the sky with a rocket launcher , and then amused myself enormously by tying an enemy to a gas canister , then shot the canister sending the man flying through the air like a deflating balloon .
And I stood on top of a plane taking off from an airport to find out where it went , then when I got bored , threw the pilot out at about 20,000 feet and flew it into a mountain .
( A quick pro-tip : Do n’t discuss playing Just Cause 2 in public places within earshot of authorities .
This is especially true for airports . )
The grapple / tether deserves attention here .
Forget the one from the first game – this is something else entirely .
The grapple can attach to almost anything , from the ground to mountain - sides , walls to vehicles .
Combined with the infinite parachutes that mark both Just Cause games as so bloody brilliant in their attitude , this means you can now fly yourself around at decent speeds , grappling the ground beneath you to tug yourself forward .
It takes a while to get used to , then becomes magnificent .
In battle situations it becomes so common to grapple a distant roof , pull yourself in , then launch your chute to fly over the roof and attack from above .
Or grapple an enemy to tug him off a rooftop to fall to his death .
And it ’s no longer a separate weapon .
Mounted on Rico ’s wrist , it can be used at any time .
Also , now you can fire the other end of the grapple out to tether two items together .
Anything you fancy .
Go crazy , see what works , see what hurts others .
That car that ’s chasing you ?
Jump on the roof of the car you ’re driving , tether the car behind you to that tree .
Bye , car !
This is Just Cause 2 at its best .
A playground of idiocy , with astonishing capacity for letting you have maniac fun .
It is so enormous , so densely packed with minute detail , littered with hidden surprises , and just there to be played with .
If you see a vehicle you can drive / sail / fly it .
The most work involved will be hitting a few number keys in time to remove the current occupant , then it ’s yours to do with as you will .
In a way familiar to those who have fallen for Burnout : Paradise or Red Faction : Guerrilla , it ’s almost impossible to travel any distance to a particular target without getting distracted along the way .
Perhaps you ’ll be flying a chopper over a mountain to reach a faction quest on the other side , but what ’s that nestled in the peak ?
A military base ?
With some sort of rocket deep into the mountain ?
Well that will surely need blowing up .
That ’s Just Cause 2 at its best .
Tethering cars to helicopters , using triggered explosives to take out half a town at once , firing a rocket at a vast radio mast to watch it collapse .
But Just Cause 2 has some worst as well .
If you were to play this game for ten hours – a generous length for your average mainstream game – then the resulting review would be jubilant .
The achievement is absolutely extraordinary .
The scale is mind - blowing .
As you liberate yet another town , 100 % ing it by destroying every destructible and collecting every collectable , it tells you , “ 34/368 ” .
Three hundred and sixty - eight ?!
The number of unique vehicles , the fun of so many of the weapons , the inventive ways you can use your grappling hook and tether .
All of it is utterly remarkable .
And then it gets carried away .
I was playing on Casual .
When reviewing a game it ’s normal to play on Normal .
That ’s the setting by which a game should usually be judged .
But almost immediately on Normal I was finding the game was curtailing my opportunities for fun by killing me .
As troops were dispatched to deal with my naughty ways , I found that I was all too easily taken out .
I restarted in Casual and found everything a great deal more fun .
This is n’t a stealth game , this is n’t a survival action , this is a lunatic ’s playground .
To have to play cautiously feels like a bastardisation of the point .
But get to hour 15 and something starts to change .
When you cause unrest you attract Heat .
With this you might attract the attention of reinforcements , Jeeps and bikes showing up with extra soldiers .
Increase the level of Heat and it will ramp up the response , until eventually you ’ll have four Heat segments lighting up very quickly , being attacked from all sides .
Now , if you were equally levelled up to match this would be just more opportunities for fun .
As it is , you just die a lot more quickly .
If you ’re being attacked by sixteen men at once ( a likely scenario ) , there ’s a strong chance one of them will use their supernatural aiming skills to empty a few rounds in your back .
At the start of the game , on Casual , this is n’t an issue .
Rico ’s a resilient fellow .
But by this stage their weapons are far more powerful .
Should someone in the near - invisible distance have a rocket launcher , then you ’re dead in one unpredictable moment .
If this happens halfway through an extended mission with only a checkpoint a significant drive away , it ’s only tedious .
Now throw in a couple of helicopters above you , both firing missiles .
You may have the coolest grappling hook in the universe , you may be armed with a rocket launcher , but you simply are n’t going to be able to get on with collecting items in that situation .
The game loses focus .
And let me stress once more : this is on Casual .
So this creates an interesting situation .
What is Just Cause 2 for ?
Is my criticism of it here simply because I want to play it differently than is intended ?
Am I supposed to be using a different set of tactics , managing things in a whole other way ?
Is this a challenge I ’m simply unwilling to accept ?
If so , then Just Cause 2 ’s biggest mistake is to trick me into thinking I can play my way for its first 10 hours .
The other mistake is ammunition .
There simply is n’t enough of it for the weapons that are the most fun to use .
You end up stuck with the basic machine guns , which are effective , but not nearly as much fun as a rocket launcher .
Again , it does n’t make sense for a game with infinite parachutes to put such a restriction in place .
To have as much fun as possible , you should have as many rockets as possible .
Oddly , occasionally the game understands this .
Get in a chopper with rockets and it has infinite ammo .
Rip one of the mounted guns from its stand and stagger about with it , and again you ’ve got infinite bullets that cause awesome destruction .
So why not the rest ?
There is , as it happens , a solution for all this .
There ’s a trainer , and for the first time in eleven years of doing this job I used a cheat when reviewing .
I was having fun .
I wanted to carry on having fun .
I suspect you might too .
I got it to strengthen the tether – something I suspect Avalanche may do themselves in a patch soon enough .
And then I saw the tick box for infinite ammo .
And I ticked it .
And oh my goodness , did I start having a lot more fun .
Rocket launcher go !
Most of the time such cheats will ruin a game .
It ruins the balance , makes it too easy , lets you bypass the challenge .
This one just makes JC2 a lot more entertaining , for me at least .
If you run the cheat you ’ll see there ’s also a box for infinite health .
That will ruin the game .
Do n’t tick that one .
The missions you ’re given vary in quality .
You can help out three key factions to create civil unrest , with the aim of eventually overthrowing the islands ’ leader .
Some of these have a decent amount of plot to them , multiple stages , various characters playing a part .
Others are very ordinary assaults on bases , that you ’ll have been doing anyway as you explore in your own time .
There are escort missions , but thankfully they ’re mostly reasonable – I only had to restart one once due to my escortee getting himself killed , and it was entirely my fault .
Then there ’s the major plot , the Agency missions .
These are large - scale , plot heavy , and often involve massive destruction .
It also needs to be mentioned how incredibly beautiful this game is .
Just gasp - inducingly stunning .
Watching a sunrise , seeing the clouds roll in and the rain start falling , seeing the snow glistening on the mountains , it ’s breathtaking .
Flying a small plane to any destination becomes enormously difficult , as I find myself just enjoying the journey , doing some loop - the - loops , flying upside down , soaking in the view .
The weather patterns are like nothing I ’ve seen before , the cloud layers modelled realistically , the weather not appearing from nowhere .
In so very many ways , Just Cause 2 is absolutely stunning .
It ’s incomprehensibly enormous .
There ’s so much to do , and so much fun to be had doing it .
But then it gets too caught up in a need to be a Game , like other games are a Game .
There ’s no need for that .
I said it every time I posted one of the stunning trailers – please , please do n’t let the game get in the way .
They do let the game get in the way .
Not to the point that it ruins it .
Not at all .
I absolutely emphatically suggest you get this , because there is nothing like it , and the fun I ’ve had in the last few days has been just bloody brilliant .
My concern is whether I ’ll be able to continue having that much fun now that the moment I show up in a town it ’s suddenly level 4 Heat and I ’m being assaulted by an entire army .
And there ’s still literally hundreds of them for me to attack .
My ideal cheat would be one that limits the Heat level to 3 .
Oh my goodness , the fun I ’d be having if that were the case .
That ’s the rub of it .
Avalanche did n’t quite have the confidence to entirely embrace what they ’d created .
They came so astonishingly close , and the result is compelling and hilarious .
But in the end it gets overwhelmed by a need to control you , stop you from being completely free .
And yet there was no need .
Get it .
Get it because it ’s Red Faction : Guerilla x 10 ( a game that similarly became overwhelmed with difficulty in the face of fun ) .
Get it because you can steal planes from airports and ditch them into the sea .
Get it because you can fly a helicopter up to unimaginable heights and then freefall for minutes .
Get it because you can tether an enemy to the back of your boat and then drag him behind you .
Get it because you can watch the sun set behind the mountains , as you fire a rocket into a water tower and see it cascade over the town below .
PS .
I strongly recommend reading Tom Francis ’s tips before playing the game .
I did n’t know it until just now , but I had been waiting all my life to watch a short film featuring Werner Herzog voicing a plastic shopping bag .
Struggling with its immortality , a discarded plastic bag ventures through the environmentally barren remains of America as it searches for its maker .

Bangkok , Thailand ( CNN ) --
For many , tattoos can be a sign of rebellion , individuality or fashion ; but in Thailand , tattoos have a whole different meaning .
Devotees of Yan tattoos have been gathering outside Bangkok for an annual festival , where believers demonstrate the supposed super - human powers radiated from the designs .
Men covered in ornate ink depictions of tigers , Buddhas and ancient scripts rant and rave , scream , laugh and charge around as if they are possessed .
They claim the chanting of the monks brings out the power of their tattoos .
Wat Bang Phra resembles a lunatic asylum , as hundreds of apparently insane tattooed men demonstrate their special powers .
" You can't control it , sometimes it controls your body , but it is a good thing , it 's a good thing for the spirit to come to the body , it 's a blessing , " says Akilon Krishnan , who traveled to the event from Malaysia .
Yan tattoos are becoming ever more popular in this mainly Buddhist country .
It 's an ancient belief dating back hundreds of years .
Some think their tattoos provide protection at a time when there is such political turbulence and division in the country .
" I managed to escape from my enemies , because of the special powers of the tattoo , " says Noom Korat .
Ajarn Noo is perhaps the most famous tattoo mystic in Thailand -- people pay hundreds of dollars for his designs .
" It brings great luck , success , and attracts money .
The tattoo represents the birth , death and enlightenment of Lord Buddha , " says Noo at his Bangkok tattoo parlour .
It actually appears more like a temple with incense , Buddhist statues and scores of eager Yan fans .
But it 's not just Thais who are going crazy for Yan tattoos .
Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie came to Bangkok for a huge Yan tattoo of a tiger in 2004 .
Her photo adorns the walls of Ajarn Noo 's tattoo parlour -- he 's keen for potential customers to see that he 's inked one of the most famous and desirable women in the world .
He claims his tattoos can attract the opposite sex , as well as money .
They also help to ward off enemies and bad luck .
And it seems the tattoos are n't doing him any harm either -- customers are queuing all day long .

Last week , McDonald ’s introduced free wi-fi in 11,500 of its 14,000 US stores .
It had previously cost $ 3.00 for 2 hours , but AT&T ’s changed all that – you can now check your gmail while you drink your McFlurry while you get fatter .
Much , much fatter .

Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII have been big hits on the PSN since receiving digital releases , and now according to a Square Enix statement , FFIX could be next in the long running series to make it onto Playstation 3′s digital distribution network .
Square producer Shinji Hashimoto has been collecting opinions on whether people would like to see the last PS1 title on the Playstation Store .
It did n’t take long to get a response , and apparently it was so ‘ passionate ’ Hasimoto plans to propose it next week .
Hasimoto posted on the Square Enix Japanese Members Twitter account ( in Japanese ) :
“ Thanks to everyone for your opinions on FF9 .
Regarding an FF9 download release , everyone is so passionate about it that I ’ll be proposing it at the next board meeting .
Look forward to next week ! ”

Beat the rush hour with first commercial jetpack for £ 50,000
It is the perfect way for city high - fliers to miss the morning rush hour .
A company is set to produce the first commercial JETPACKS - and one could be yours for just £ 50,000 .
The traffic jam - beating packs will be manufactured after a multi-million pound deal was signed with an international aircraft company this week .
Martin Aircraft Company , in Christchurch , New Zealand , aims to make 500 packs a year allowing first - person propulsion through the skies for commuters .
[ caption ]
The 200 horsepower dual - propeller packs can travel at 60 mph for up to 30 miles on a full tank of fuel .
They have been reached heights of 7,800 ft in tests .
At 250 lbs when empty , the jet pack is not heavy enough to require a pilot 's licence , although users will take part in a Martin Jetpack training programme .
However , the gadget is not environmentally friendly burning 10 gallons of fuel per hour - five times as much as the average car .
The 5ft by 5.5 ft device is the brainchild of Kiwi inventor Glenn Martin who unveiled his machine for the first time in July last year .
While jetpacks are traditionally powered by jets of escaping gases , the new device uses a gas engine with two ducted fans to provide lift .
Pitch and roll are controlled by one hand , yaw and the throttle by the other .
Martin Aircraft Company chief executive Richard Lauder said the pack could be perfect for the emergency services , private users and even the military .
[ caption ]
Mr Lauder said : ' This could be life - saving stuff .
For us this is an excellent commercial step . '
The device has safety features to combat the inherent dangers of flying through the air .
It has both an internal roll cage to protect the pilot from side impact and a a ballistic parachute system that works at low altitudes .
Jetpacks first emerged in science fiction in the 1920s and were tested by the U.S military by the 1960s , but have never ' taken - off ' commercially .
Astronauts on the International Space Station wear rocket packs during space walks called a ' Safer . '
This can be used in emergencies should they become detached from the station .
Watch the jetpack in action ...

It would have been a lot more instructive for him to answer that question in terms of the double - standard the press uses in judging adultery committed by people in the 2 different parties .
But that would require actual thought .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The United States and Russia have reached " the most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly two decades , " President Obama said Friday .
The agreement cuts by about one - third " the nuclear weapons that the United States and Russia will deploy , " the president said .
The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) will last 10 years , and builds on the previous agreement that expired in December .
" It significantly reduces missiles and launchers , " Obama told reporters at the White House .
" It puts in place a strong and effective verification regime .
And it maintains the flexibility that we need to protect and advance our national security , and to guarantee our unwavering commitment to the security of our allies . "
Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev will sign the agreement April 8 in Prague , Czech Republic , Obama said , calling arms control " one of his administration 's top national security priorities . "
Information released by the White House says the new treaty limits both nations to " significantly fewer strategic arms within seven years " of its signing .
One of the limits : 1,550 warheads .
" Warheads on deployed ICBMs ( Intercontinental ballistic missiles ) and deployed SLBMs ( submarine - launched ballistic missiles ) count toward this limit and each deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments counts as one warhead toward this limit , " the White House said .
There are also limits on launchers .
The treaty lays out a " verification regime " that includes on - site inspections , data exchanges and notifications , the White House said .
" The Treaty does not contain any constraints on testing , development or deployment of current or planned U.S. missile defense programs or current or planned United States long - range conventional strike capabilities , " the White House said .
Obama said the agreement is part of the U.S. effort to " reset " the U.S. relationship with Russia .
" With this agreement , the United States and Russia -- the two largest nuclear powers in the world -- also send a clear signal that we intend to lead , " the president said .
" By upholding our own commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons , and to ensure that other nations meet their own responsibilities . "
President Obama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the changes will not hamper the U.S. ability to protect itself and its allies .
Negotiators have been working since April 2009 to wrap up the " follow - on " to the 1991 agreement .
Talks were difficult , with disagreements over verification , including on - site inspection of missiles that carry nuclear warheads .
A U.S. official with knowledge of the talks earlier told CNN that negotiators had found " innovative " ways to verify what each side has .
Verification will be a top issue politically because the U.S. Senate and the Russian parliament will each have to ratify any agreement .
Russian officials at one point objected to the Obama administration 's plans to build a missile - defense system in Eastern Europe .
Specifically , they were angered by news leaks from Romania that it had agreed to allow missile interceptors to be installed in that country .
The issue , according to arms control experts , was resolved by including non-binding language in the START treaty 's preamble stating that there is a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons ; however , the treaty itself deals only with limits on offensive weapons systems .
This resolution could help placate U.S. critics who want no link in the treaty between offensive and defensive weapons , arguing that it might be used to try to limit a U.S. missile - defense plan .
The new START would be the first treaty related to arms control since the end of the Cold War , experts have said , setting the stage for further arms reductions that will tackle thorny issues like what to do with non-deployed warheads that are kept in storage , tactical nuclear weapons and further cuts in missiles and launch vehicles .

Toshiba America announced today that it will be adding two models to its line of 2.5 - inch , 5,400rpm hard drives for use in mobile PCs , all - in - ones , set - top boxes , and similar units .
The MK7559GSXP will have a capacity of 750GB , and is a standard 9.5 mm , two - platter design .
It has an areal density of 541.4 Gb per square inch ( GB / in2 ) , which Toshiba says is the industry 's highest ; 8 MB of buffer memory ; and an estimated average seek time of 12 ms .
The MKxx59GSM series will also have an 8 MB buffer , but its areal density of 482 GB / in2 will result in a slightly larger size ( 12.5 mm ) to accommodate its 750GB and 1TB storage capacities .
Both drives use Toshiba 's " silent seek " technology and energy efficiency techniques to keep the drives both quiet and cheap to run .
In addition , the two drives use the that is rapidly being introduced into hard drives at all levels of manufacturer .

General Motors Co. could make a profit this year following years of massive losses , according to a tempered prediction by Edward J. Whitacre Jr. , the automaker ’s chairman and interim chief executive .
Speaking to reporters Wednesday , Whitacre said he was “ pretty pleased ” with how the restructured GM was operating after its emergence from bankruptcy in July .
But he noted there was much more work to do -- primarily in persuading consumers that GM makes “ quality ” vehicles that are “ cool to drive . ”
A profit , after five years of losses , would be important to GM ’s ability to float a stock offering to repay some of the $ 52 - billion investment and loans the federal government has poured into the company over the last year .
The government has converted much of that into a 61 % stake in GM and received a $ 1 - billion payment last month from the company on its remaining $ 6.7 billion in loans .
“ If it is in 2010 , it is going to be late in the year , ” said Whitacre , former chairman of AT&T Inc .
“ Things have to be right before we can do it .
. . .
We have to show our financial viability .
People have to see us perform . ”
The key to making a profit is “ selling more stuff , ” Whitacre said .
GM has made large gains in reducing the cost of building autos and now has to focus on growing revenue , something Whitacre said should be possible as the economy improves .
Whitacre said he agreed with the industry estimates that auto sales would grow about 10 % this year to about 11.5 million vehicles .
But he cautioned that there were many risks that could upend that forecast as well as GM ’s ability to crawl back into the black .
“ It is an unsettled economy with a lot going on , ” he said .
In a wide - ranging discussion , Whitacre also said that GM could restore “ hundreds ” of 1,350 dealers that it planned to close over time as part of its restructuring .
The plan met with an angry backlash from lawmakers and residents in the communities in which the dealerships were located .
Before its bankruptcy filing , the company had 6,200 dealerships .
In December , Whitacre , 68 , became temporary chief executive after the board pushed out Fritz Henderson and launched a search for a permanent replacement .
One possible successor would be Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell , who was hired from Microsoft Corp. last month .
“ Chris could be a candidate .
That will be up to the board and his performance and how things go in the upcoming months , ” Whitacre said .

Sen. Christopher S. Bond regularly railed against President Obama ’s economic stimulus plan as irresponsible spending that would drive up the national debt .
But behind the scenes , the Missouri Republican quietly sought more than $ 50 million from a federal agency for two projects in his state .
Mr. Bond was not alone .
More than a dozen Republican lawmakers , while denouncing the stimulus to the media and their constituents , privately sent letters to just one of the federal government ’s many agencies seeking stimulus money for home - state pork projects .
The letters to the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , obtained through the Freedom of Information Act , expose the gulf between lawmakers ’ public criticism of the overall stimulus package and their private lobbying for projects close to home .
“ It ’s not illegal to talk out of both sides of your mouth , but it does seem to be a level of dishonesty troubling to the American public , ” said Melanie Sloan , executive director of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , Mr. Bond noted that one project applying to the USDA for stimulus money would “ create jobs and ultimately spur economic opportunities . ”
He and other lawmakers make no apologies for privately seeking stimulus money after they voted against it and continue to criticize the plan : “ I strongly opposed the stimulus , but the only thing that could make it worse would be if none of it returned to the taxpayers of Missouri , ” said Mr. Bond , who is retiring .
But watchdog groups say the lawmakers ’ public talk and private letters do n’t square , highlighting a side of government spending largely overshadowed by the “ earmarking ” process .
While members of Congress must disclose their earmarks — or pet projects they slip into broader spending bills — the private funding requests they make in letters to agencies fall outside of the public ’s view .
“ There is a definite disconnect between the public statements and the private letters , ” said Thomas A. Schatz , president of the nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste .
“ It does seem inconsistent to say you ’re against the bill but then you want some little piece of it . ”
At a televised meeting with the House Republican caucus late last month , Mr. Obama chided GOP lawmakers who , he said , took credit for projects funded by the same stimulus bill they voted against — adding that some were even attending ribbon - cutting ceremonies .
But the USDA letters also reveal a more discreet way for lawmakers to try to steer money to home - state projects .
‘ Misguided spending bill ’
Several Republicans who sent letters to the USDA for home - state projects seeking an infusion of stimulus cash are facing competitive re-election races .
Rep. Joe Wilson , South Carolina Republican who became famous after yelling , “ You lie , ” during Mr. Obama ’s addresses to Congress in September , voted against the stimulus .
Nonetheless , Mr. Wilson elbowed his way into the rush for federal stimulus cash in a letter he sent to Mr. Vilsack on behalf of a foundation seeking funding .
“ We know their endeavor will provide jobs and investment in one of the poorer sections of the Congressional District , ” he wrote to Mr. Vilsack in the Aug. 26 , 2009 , letter .
“ Congressman Wilson ’s position on the stimulus bill is consistent , ” said spokeswoman Pepper Pennington .
She said Mr. Wilson opposed the stimulus as a “ misguided spending bill , ” but once it passed , he wanted to make sure South Carolina residents “ receive their share of the pie . ”
On Feb. 13 , 2009 , Sen. Robert F. Bennett , Utah Republican , issued a statement criticizing the stimulus — but two days earlier , he privately forwarded to Mr. Vilsack a list of projects seeking stimulus money .
“ I believe the addition of federal funds to these projects would maximize the stimulative effect of these projects on the local economy , ” he wrote .
Mr. Bennett is up for re-election and facing several Republican challengers .
Last month , the conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth announced that it was opposing his nomination for a fourth term .
“ It is absurd to require Utah taxpayers to foot their portion of the bill associated with stimulus spending and then ask them to forgo competing for those funds without the input of their congressional representatives , ” said Bennett spokeswoman Tara Hendershott DiJulio .
Also facing a competitive race , Rep. Pat Tiberi , Ohio Republican , in October called the final Democratic stimulus bill “ loaded with [ House Speaker ] Nancy Pelosi ’s grab bag of big spending wishes ” and that it “ saddles future generations with mountains of debt . ”
He struck a different tone in a letter to Mr. Vilsack .
“ While this project is intended to expand rural broadband in Alaska , I understand that the project could support businesses and jobs in communities across the country , ” Mr. Tiberi wrote , citing one such company in his district .
A spokeswoman for Mr. Tiberi said he is just fighting for jobs in his district .
“ Congressman Tiberi did n’t support the stimulus bill , but when it comes down to parts of the bill that are actually going to support jobs , he ’s going to come down on the side of supporting businesses and Ohio jobs , ” Tiberi spokeswoman Breann Gonzalez said .
Job creation ?
Other Republican lawmakers who wrote on behalf of projects applying for stimulus money do n’t have any re-election worries anytime soon .
Before his vote against the stimulus , Sen . Mike Johanns , who took office last year from Nebraska , predicted that “ the money would simply never reach the economy . ”
A secretary of agriculture under President George W. Bush , Mr. Johanns later told the Grand Island , Neb. , Independent newspaper that “ it would be hard for me to imagine that we are going to be creating many jobs here . ”
Yet he saw the prospect of at least a few dozen jobs in a letter he later sent to Mr. Vilsack for a home - state project , records show .
“ The proposed project would create 38 new jobs and bring broadband to eight hospitals , five colleges , 16 libraries and 161 K - 12 schools , ” Mr. Johanns wrote .
E-mails and calls to Mr. Johanns ’ office were not returned .
Sen. Lamar Alexander , Tennessee Republican , who easily won re-election in 2008 , said of the stimulus , “ This is spending , not stimulus . ”
In a letter to Mr. Vilsack for a project applying for stimulus money , Mr. Alexander noted , “ It is anticipated that the project will create over 200 jobs in the first year and at least another 40 new jobs in the following years . ”
Jim Jeffries , a spokesman for Mr. Alexander , said the senator believes his constituents have a right to apply for stimulus funds .
“ Sen .
Alexander voted against the stimulus because it was too much spending and too much debt for too little benefit to the economy , ” Mr. Jeffries said .
“ Republicans lost that fight and the money will be spent , and because Tennessee taxpayers will end up footing part of the bill , they have a right to apply for the funds . ”
Pete Sepp , vice president of the National Taxpayers Union , called that philosophy troubling .
“ It ’s hard to expect lawmakers to behave like angels when this much money is being airdropped all over the country , ” Mr. Sepp said .
“ But the more strident the rhetoric , the worse it looks .
For me , with these grants where they ’re saying a project is going to create a certain number of jobs , it makes you wonder :
Do they really believe that ?
Or is it just part of a cynical cash grab ? ”
Getting their ‘ fair share ’
Ranked among the most conservative members of the House by the American Conservative Union ( ACU ) , Rep. John Linder , Georgia Republican , posted a blog item on his Web site on Oct. 21 , stating that recent unemployment figures “ only reinforce the fact that the $ 787 billion ‘ stimulus ’ signed into law eight months ago has done nothing for job growth in this country . ”
Two weeks earlier , Mr. Linder had sent a letter to Mr. Vilsack backing an application for stimulus money by the Elauwit Community Foundation , records show .
With unemployment in Georgia topping 10 percent , “ the employment opportunities created by this program would be quickly utilized , ” Mr. Linder wrote .
Mr. Linder said the letter does n’t change his staunch opposition to the stimulus .
“ I have opposed every stimulus plan that has come before Congress because it is simply bad policy , but if they pass , the communities in my district which are paying for them deserve to be equally considered in their benefits , ” Mr. Linder said .
Another House member who has scored high ACU rankings , Rep. Robert B. Aderholt , Alabama Republican , also voted against and criticized the stimulus .
“ Rather than create jobs or stimulate the economy , this massive spending bill was a laundry list of programs that focused on states with big - city urban communities , ” he wrote in the Oct. 4 edition of the Daily Mountain Eagle newspaper .
Three days later , Mr. Aderholt sent a letter to Mr. Vilsack on behalf of a foundation seeking stimulus money to expand broadband services in his district .
“ Congressman Aderholt supported some of the ideas in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , but disagreed with much of it and that ’s why he voted against it , ” Aderholt spokesman D.J. Jordan said .
“ Since the bill was passed and became law , the congressman wanted to help a local foundation receive some of the broadband money that otherwise would go to another state . ”
Sen . Lisa Murkowski , Alaska Republican , called the stimulus “ excessive ” and voted against it , though she noted that money in the legislation would benefit her state .
She , too , wrote to the USDA to support Alaska projects seeking stimulus funds .
“ I opposed the stimulus bill as did most of my colleagues in the Republican caucus , but it was passed in Congress and signed into law , ” she said , when asked about her support for project seeking stimulus funds .
“ When constituents come to me asking for support in a competitive application process for funding for broadband expansion , I am happy to support their request .
I will always fight to make sure my state gets its fair share of available federal dollars , ” she added .
Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , was yet another lawmaker who voted against the stimulus and later backed applications for stimulus money in two letters to the Agriculture Department .
“ If the funds are there , Senator Grassleys going to help Iowa , rather than some other state , get its share , ” spokeswoman Jill Kozeny said .
According to records , at least eight other Republicans lawmakers who voted against the stimulus later sent letters to the USDA backing various projects ’ stimulus applications .

Soon , every internet - connected device will make " phone calls " — Xbox , iPhone , laptop , whatever .
Data is data , be it voice , text or video .
Carriers should charge for data — more even — but leave off the dumb premiums for voice and SMS .

Every month my phone sends and receives a certain amount of megabytes to carry out everything I do .
For all I know , it 's a fairly predictable amount .
I would be able to study it , only it 's split into three incongruous measurements : minutes , messages and megabytes .
Two of these no longer make sense , except to the carriers who want profiteer on their mystery .
I want more transparency .
Follow me here : Back about 15 years ago , it suddenly became weird to have a computer that did n't have internet access , right ?
By 2000 , everyone 's grandma was on AOL .
Ten years later , it 's starting to be increasingly weird when a handheld digital device does n't have some kind of wireless data connection .
Wi - Fi handles most of our needs — even when we 're out and about — but more and more hot gadgets are going cellular .

The flipside is that voice is less and less of a priority .
We joke now about how little we use voicemail , that is , how little we rely on the human voice to get messages to friends , reserving it mostly for ( older ) members of the family .
Our phones are increasingly communicators and computers , as Chen observed , yet we still buy a " phone " with a voice plan , and then tack on data service .
Do You Still Use Voicemail ?
In recent years , it seems that the number of people using voicemail is dwindling .
Maybe I 'm… Read more

Whenever reporters would bring up data issues or handset shortcomings with carriers , they all used to say the same thing : " Delivering voice calls is our No. 1 priority . "
The iPhone — you know , the topselling AT&T handset whose owners joke is good for " everything but making calls " — proves that this is no longer true .
So , if more and more devices are connected to the world through cellular data plans , and even the " phones " in our hands are used more for sending messages — and locating restaurants and flirting and catching up on news — why does 60 % of our phone bill still go to these so - called voice plans ?

You 're not actually paying for the minutes themselves .
If you did , the difference between 450 minutes and infinite minutes would be greater than $ 30 .
I pay $ 200 a month for two phones on AT&T , and I discovered the other day that I had 11,000 rollover minutes .
Now that the new pricing plans are out , I can dial down my minutes to offset this , bringing it down to around $ 180 including all the services and taxes .

If I were to dial down my minutes to offset this , I could bring my bill down to $ 180 .
Look over your carrier 's plan and you will see that the " cheapest " voice plan is already quite high , possibly higher than the amount you pay for your data services — up to $ 40 in most cases .
I argue that $ 40 is a surcharge for using the phone , not a fee for making voice calls .

I am not saying that the money I pay for service is a waste .
I am saying that carriers need to be more honest about why they charge me what they do .
Voice is not the No. 1 priority anymore , certainly not for carriers with their eyes on the horizon .
We will all need their higher - speed 3G and 4G services , to juice up all our crazy gear .
Whether we transmit our voices through those devices seems increasingly arbitrary .
It should and will be our choice to do it , once VOIP technologies merge with services such as Google Voice .
Android is surely to gain this advantage first , maybe it 's already in the plans for Nexus Two .
If Google goes , Apple will have to follow , and Microsoft will too .

Maybe you 'd say that voice service is special , that it 's not just packets blowing to and fro on the internet , but calls that make use of the telco infrastructure .
Well , my only answer is that if it 's so precious , why do cable companies give it away for free ?
Ever notice it 's actually cheaper to get broadband with phone service than to go without ?
And why should n't it be ?
You 're paying plenty for huge amounts of bandwidth , for an increasingly legitimate array of fun stuff .
Who 's even going to notice a few voice packets floating back and forth ?
If there 's a bigger scam than the voice service surcharge , it 's text messaging .
That 's gotta be a cash cow , since the 160 - character strings flying back and forth can't possibly be a burden on a system increasingly built for delivering stutter - free video .
Hell , this is decade - old pager tech .
Each message is 1/10th of a kilobyte , according to some educated guesstimations .
So that $ 5 plan that gives you 200 messages ?
That 's the equivalent of paying $ 250 a megabyte .

But it 's not money .
It 's that we 're constantly sending Twitter and Facebook messages , using the same network but without paying the penalty money .
With Boxcar using push alerts on an iPhone , I can get an experience that 's richer than typical SMS , and does n't require anything more than the basic , mandatory data plan .
Sprint deserves props for having the guts to admit voice is n't king , and sell a reasonably priced " everything " plan .
They have always been open to testing out new , more fair pricing strategies .
But as the underdog — scrambling along with T - Mobile for the last people who have n't been sucked in by the AT&T and Verizon megaliths — they have to try something .
Meanwhile , though Verizon and AT&T have both admitted there 's a limit to how much you can charge for talk , text messages are still over priced , and the ratio of specialized talk and SMS service to raw data is still cartoonishly lopsided .

I know carriers fear becoming anonymous conduits for other people 's cool content and services , but it 's happening already , and in exchange for that , we 're willing to enrich our beloved providers in other ways .
We are already putting more devices on wireless networks — the iPad is at the break of a tidal wave of secondary machines that 'll all need cell service .
And we 're already getting used to the fact that " unlimited " data plans will soon give way to some kind of tiered pricing .

In return , we ask for more transparency .
Charge me $ 100 a month each for my " phones , " but at least have the decency to tell me what I 'm really paying for .
Former Congressman J.D. Hayworth says the only way to keep a man from marrying a horse is through a federal marriage amendment .
Naturally , we can think of several other snafus that might keep a man from marrying a horse -- namely a horse 's inability to speak or sign a marriage license ( basic anatomy coming in second ) .
But Hayworth feels that a same - sex marriage decision handed down by the Massachusetts Supreme Court is so loosely written that it could allow a man to marry a clydesdale .
Hayworth expressed his concerns about inter-species romance on a Florida talk show over the weekend .
Check the video out below .
Hayworth sent us a statement in response to the comments , where he claims " the liberal media , intent on defending the ultra - leftist , progressive politicians in Massachusetts , are attacking me for standing up once again for family values . "
What the " liberal media " has to do with making an honest horse out of the likes of Mr. Ed , we 're not sure .
We can confirm one thing , though : comparing same - sex marriage to bestiality makes J.D. look like a real horse 's ass .
Badop - ching !
This afternoon , Julian Falconer gave a talk at the Empire Club of Canada titled “ The Politics of Punishment : Depoliticizing Justice Reform . ”
He focused primarily on the Harper government ’s “ tough on crime ” agenda , and made some most interesting observations .
Canada spends $ 3.5 billion per year on crime .
It costs $ 108,000 per year to incarcerate one inmate .
Stephen Harper is proposing $ 5 billion in “ tough on crime ” spending , with none of the increase earmarked for crime prevention .
There is a systemic dilemma : in politics , proponents of judicial reform are forcibly grouped into one of two camps ; Falconer referred to this division as “ hug - a - thug vs. Law and Order . ”
If a politician questions the “ tough on crime ” approach , they are instantly categorized as weak , as someone who would embrace the criminal threatening your family .
Falconer compared Harper ’s agenda to similar “ tough on crime ” agendas implemented decades ago in both California and New York State ( largely part of the War on Drugs ) .
Incarceration rates were dramatically increased , and today California houses 170,000 prisoners .
The American experiment has failed .
While incarceration rates increased dramatically in the US compared to Canada , the crime rates of both countries remained similar .
The US now has a financially unsustainable prison population , and nothing to show for it .
Arnold Schwarzenegger has abandoned the “ tough on crime ” approach in favour of funding schools .
Studies have shown that incarceration raises an individual ’s disposition toward crime .
Incarceration disproportionately affects native communities , the poor , the mentally ill , and other disadvantaged groups .
Yet instead of seeking to remedy the causes of crime , instead of seeking to ameliorate the conditions of these groups , we have the newly - minted Senator Bob Runciman crowing ,
This despite the fact that crime rates have been dropping for years .
This despite empirical evidence that tough - on - crime has failed in the US .
The politicization of dialogue creates the false illusion of irreconcilable extremes .
The reality should not be “ hug - a - thug vs. Law and Order ” â€ “ there is a solution that rests without the extremes .
Fans of Red Bull or just anyone who likes to be creative and maybe make a fool of themselves will be getting that shot this Labor Day weekend in Philly .
The Red Bull Flugtag is finally coming to the Delaware River Waterfront .
OK you probably know what Red Bull is ( it gives you wings , according to their ads ) and that they like to put on amusing marketing events , but what ’s a Flugtag ?
It ’s a human - powered flying machine .
Teams build the winged creations then “ fly ” them off a 30 - foot drop into the Delaware River ( yes people will be willing jumping into the Delaware ) .
The energy drink makers are challenging the City of Brotherly Love to build their best man-powered flying machines .
“ If you 've got the guts , want the glory , or just know someone you 'd like to push off a 30 - foot - high ramp , do n't miss what could be the flight of your life , ” said a Red Bull release .
The goal is to fly the farthest -- the current U.S. record is 155 feet ( set in Nashville in 2007 ) .
But , it 's not just about flying -- especially since many Flugtags almost immediately crash -- judges pick winners based on distance , creativity and showmanship .
Red Bull is returning to Philly after the success of their 2008 Soap Box Derby , which saw everyone from NBCPhiladelphia ’s Tim Furlong to Mayor Michael Nutter take to the Manayunk Wall in little box cars .
The Flugtag will take flight Saturday on the Camden Waterfront .
Gates open at 11 a.m. with the first flight at 1 p.m .
Check out some of the past Flugtags from places like Cleveland , Baltimore , Nashville and San Francisco .

The government of Denmark has released a 326 - page report affirming that endocrine disrupting chemicals are probably continuing to the birth of fewer males and the " feminization " of existing ones .
The report centers on chemicals like PVC , flame retardants , phthalates , dioxins , PCBs and bisphenol - A , all of which mimic the action of estrogen in the body .
The researchers concluded that due to the prevalence of these chemicals , children could easily be exposed to high enough levels to place them at " critical risk " of harm .
The chemicals have been blamed for falling sperm counts among men worldwide , and their full effects remain unknown .
A study by researchers at Erasmus University in Rotterdam , Netherlands , found that male children who had been exposed to PCBs and dioxins while in the womb were more likely to dress up in female clothes and play with dolls than boys who had not been .
Other research has documented a connection between prenatal phthalate exposure and " feminization " of male genitals , including smaller penises .
Evidence is increasingly emerging that estrogen mimics might also be responsible for a puzzling phenomenon : fewer boys are being born than ever before .
Typically , 106 male children are born for every 100 females in most populations .
In recent years , however , this distribution has been shifting in favor of females , with endocrine disruptors a likely culprit .
For example , a Canadian Inuit community living on Lake Huron and surrounded by chemical factories produces two girls for every boy born .
Similar phenomena have been observed in contaminated communities in Brazil , Israel , Italy , Taiwan and the Arctic Circle , as well as among workers in Russian pesticide factories .
Many hormone - mimicking chemicals build up in the body and resist environmental degradation , meaning that they are now widely distributed across the planet .
" There is very little , if anything , individuals can do to prevent contamination of themselves and their families , " the environmental group WWF said .

Well , it ’s been a busy few months , and clearly this blog has suffered ( not so much my drinking - time , just my writing - time .
Gotta have priorities , kids ) .
But now I ’m back on track , and this will be the first of [ hopefully ] many more regular articles .
So , here goes …
Unless you ’ve been living under a rock ( or in Utah ) , you ’ve probably noticed Sam Adams has a new spring seasonal beer : Noble Pils .
I was hesitant , especially in light of some of their other more recent introductions , but I figured Sam Adams has impressed me before and deserved another chance .
So , I took some time out from cursing Jim Koch for taking White Ale off the market , and bought myself a pack .
The History
Sam Adams dates back to the Civil War era , when Louis Koch began selling his eponymous lager .
His operation lasted until Prohibition ( and then again briefly in the 1950’s ) .
Then , like almost every other American brewery at the time , things sort of died out .
Then , in the mid-80’s , Jim Koch , with the somewhat ironic help of Joseph Owades , reintroduced the recipe as Samuel Adams Boston Lager .
It was almost immediately awarded the title of “ Best Beer in America ” at the ‘ 85 GABF and exploded into the mainstream ( well , as far as craft brewing goes ) .
Growth continued until the point where the term ‘ craft brew ’ basically had to be invented because ‘ micro brew ’ just was n’t accurate anymore .
Currently , Sam Adams - more officially known as The Boston Beer Company - is the largest American - owned brewery ( since the Belgian InBev takeover of Anheuser - Busch ) .
How ’s that for the Great American Dream Story ?
The Style
Noble Pils is a German - style Pilsner .
Originating from the town of Pilsen in what is now Czech Bohemia ( hence the name ) , pilsners are pale lagers typically valued for their crisp and refreshing qualities .
Real pilsners are effervescent and well - hopped ( unlike their American bastard cousins , the light lagers , who so often and so wrongly appropriate the pilsner name ) , with spicy or herbal aroma & flavor .
Specifically , the name ‘ Noble Pils ’ comes from the fact that all five varieties of Noble Hops are used in the recipe .
The Five Noble Hops - Hallertau , Tettnanger , Spalt , Polish Lublin and Saaz - all come from Central Europe ( primarily Bavaria & Bohemia ) and are generally prized for their subtle bitterness and high aroma .
The ‘ Five ’ are somewhat debated .
In my extensive research ( italics for emphasis , not sarcasm ) , I ’ve yet to find out why , but Lublin is n’t always on the Noble Bill .
Also , English varieties Fuggles and Kent Goldings hops might also be arguably considered Noble .
If you ’re interested ( I ca n’t imagine that many of you are , but … ) , read more about the great Nobility debate here , or here .
For the rest of you , it ’s beer time …
The Tasting
Noble Pils pours a crystal clear hay with a pillowy white head .
Enormous bubbles evaporate with a disappointing quickness leaving only a few isolated islands of carbonation behind .
Scent is a zesty , grassy hop with a tiny lemon citrus ( also hop ) .
Quite aromatic , and it ’s nearly all hops , yet more subtle than an IPA .
There ’s a grainy malt smell , but it takes a big backseat to the hops .
Biscuity malts quickly give way to the herbal onslaught .
Flavor is in lock - step with the smell .
Earthy , grassy , almost spicy bitterness washes over the palate .
The flavor is somehow both strong and pungent without being overwhelming .
Pils finishes fairly clean with a brief puckery dryness .
Fairly easy on the mouth .
Not exactly light bodied - maybe a 3 - 4 out of 10 on the Beer Thickness Scale I just made up - but in concert with the brew ’s excellent carbonation and crisp finish , Noble Pils turns out a nice refreshing feel .
The Verdict
A solid Pilsner .
Very easily accessible to the average American Bud Light swiller ( which seems to be Boston Beer Co. ’s recent marketing strategy ) , yet just authentic enough to appeal to the beer - snob crowd .
I ’m not sure if it ’s quite as good as the still - mourned White Ale , but it ’s definitely a good release and a win-win for Samuel Adams .

The importance of constraint is one well known to those who embark on creative endeavors .
Tell someone , " you can do anything you want : anything at all , " and they will blank , paralyzed by the infinite possibility .
Artists welcome constraint .
Writers like the constraint of a sonnet because it imposes form and gives a place to start ; roleplaying groups like the constraint of a campaign setting because it imposes rules and sets the scene for the story to be told ; jazz musicians like the constraint of the chords underlying an improvisation because it keeps the soloist anchored to the source tune and suggests ideas for the melody .
However , many programmers do n't the like the constraint of a type system .
" The static type system does n't let me do what I want to . "
" I needed to write four classes for what would have been two lines of Python ! "
" What ?
I can't do that ?
Why not ? "
For them , it 's like a straightjacket .
How does anyone ever get anything done when constraint ties you up ?
I beg to differ .
Accept the straightjacket .
The things it will let you do ... are surprising .
The straitjacket was historically used as an implement to prevent dangerous individuals from harming themselves and others .
Programmers are not quite mental asylum inmates , though at a glance it may seem that we 've been trying to reduce the ways for us to hurt ourselves .
But such changes have often brought with them benefits , and many have eagerly traded away pointers and manual memory management for increased expressiveness .
Static types , however , are still a pain point for many people , and Haskell is an unusually constrained language due to its type system .
An overenthusiastic user of Haskell 's type system might exclaim , " after I made it typecheck , it just worked ! "
Of course , this statement is not actually true ; there is a certain essential complexity to classes of algorithms that mean the type system wo n't catch the fact that you seeded your hash function with the wrong magic number .
But not all code is like this .
A lot of code is just plain boring .
It 's the code that generates your website , or logs your errors ; it 's the code that serves as the glue for your build infrastructure , or it shuffles data from a file into an in -memory representation into a database .
It 's the code is foundational ; it is the code that lets you express simple ideas simply .
When you look at the development of this code , the errors being made are very simple mental typos , they 're the ones that take a total of fifteen seconds to track down and fix once they manifest , but if rolled up in the time it takes to run your test suite or , dare I say it , manually test , quickly ticks to the minutes .
A fast static type checker saves you so much pain , whether or not it is a Haskell compiler or pylint -e .
The difference is that pylint -e is optional ; there is no guarantee that any given Python project will play nicely with it , and it is frequently wrong .
The Haskell compiler is not .
This is a specific manifestation of a more general phenomenon : types reduce the number of ways things can go wrong .
This applies for complicated code too ; ( a -> r ) ->
r may not illuminate the meaning of the continuation to you , but it certainly puts a lot of restrictions on how you might go about implementing them .
This makes it possible to look at the types without any understanding of what they mean , and mechanically derive half of the solution you 're looking for .
This is precisely how types increase expressiveness : it 's really hard for people to understand dense , highly abstracted code .
Types prevent us from wading too far off into the weeds and make handling even more powerful forms of abstractions feasible .
You would n't rely on this in Python ( do n't write Haskell in Python ! ) , and in the few cases I 've written higher - order functions in this language , I 've been sure to also supply Haskell style type signatures .
As Simon Peyton Jones has said , the type offers a " crisp " succinct definition of what a function does .
Even more striking is Haskell 's solution to the null pointer problem .
The exception that strikes terror in the hearts of the Java programmer is the NullPointerException : it 's a runtime exception , which means that it does n't need to be explicitly declared in the throws specification of a method ; a testament to the fact that basically any dereference could trigger this exception .
Even in Java , a language of static typing , the type system fails to encode so basic a fact as " am I guaranteed to get a value here ? "
Haskell 's answer to this problem is the Maybe type , which explicitly states in the type of a function that the value could be Nothing ( null ) or Just a ( the value ) .
Programmers are forced to recognize that there might not be anything , and explicitly handle the failure case ( with maybe ) or ignore it ( with fromJust , perhaps more appropriately named unsafeFromJust ) .
There 's nothing really special about the data type itself ; I could have written a Java generic that had the same form .
The key is the higher order functions that come along with the Functor , Applicative , Monad , MonadPlus , Monoid and other instances of this type .
I 'd run straight into a wall if I wanted to write this in Java :
pureOperation <$> maybeVal
<$ > , a higher order function also known as fmap , is critical to this piece of code .
The equivalent Java would have to unpack the value from the generic , perform the operation on it , and the pack it up again ( with conditionals for the case that it was empty ) .
I could add a method that implements this to the Maybe interface , but then I would n't have an elegant way of passing pureOperation to these method without using anonymous classes ... and you 've quickly just exploded into several ( long ) lines of Java .
It becomes dreadfully obvious why the designers did n't opt for this approach : an already verbose language would get even more verbose .
Other languages are n't quite as bad , but they just do n't get close to the conciseness that a language that celebrates higher order operators can give you .
In summary , while it may seem odd to say this about a language that has ( perhaps undeservedly ) earned a reputation for being hard to understand , but the constraint of Haskell 's type system increases the tolerance of both writer and reader for abstraction that ultimately increases expressiveness .
Problems that people just shrugged and claimed , " if you want to fix that , you 'll have to add tons of boilerplate , " suddenly become tractable .
That 's powerful .
One final note for the escape artists out there : if you need the dynamic typing ( and I wo n't claim that there are n't times when it is necessary ) , you can wriggle out of the static type system completely !
Just do it with caution , and not by default .
Not to sound like a broken record , but with the exception of OCZ's Vertex LE , not much has changed in the SSD market over the past couple of years .
Intel still seems like the safest bet , and these days they 're even offering a pretty compelling value .
The 80GB X25 - M G2 is finally selling for reasonable prices and earlier this month Intel launched its first value SSD : the X25 - V. Priced at $ 125 , the X25 - V gives you much of the performance of the X25 - M but at a lower cost and capacity point .
It 's a great way to safely transition to an SSD .
Intel 's X25 - V uses the same controller as the X25 - M G2 , but with half the NAND and thus half the channels
For months now you all have been asking me to tackle the topic of RAIDing SSDs .
I 've been cautious about doing so for a number of reasons :
1 ) There is currently no way to pass the TRIM instruction to a drive that is a member of a RAID array .
Intel 's latest RAID drivers allow you to TRIM non-member RAID disks , but not an SSD in a RAID array .
2 ) Giving up TRIM support means that you need a fairly resilient SSD , one whose performance will not degrade tremendously over time .
On the bright side , with the exception of the newer SandForce controllers , I 'm not sure we 've seen a controller as resilient as Intel's .
A couple of weeks ago I published some early results of Intel 's X25 - V SSD .
But I was holding out on you , I actually had two :
Using the same Intel X58 testbed I 've been using for all of my SSD tests , I created a 74.5 GB RAID - 0 array out of the two drives and quickly ran them through almost all of our benchmarks .
At a total cost of $ 250 , a pair of X25 - Vs will set you back more than a single 80 GB X25 - M and you do give up TRIM , but is the performance worth it ?
The Test
The federal government is investigating dozens of death threats to IRS employees that have been posted online since the House passed the health care bill , FoxNews.com has learned .
The health care law has sparked protests on radical anti-tax and anti-government Web sites and within their private , password - protected e-mail lists and message boards .
Some writers have labeled March 21 -- the day the House passed the bill – " Bloody Sunday , " and they see it as a call to violent action against IRS workers .
In the days following the House vote , animosity toward the IRS intensified , and many heated online protests included specific discussions about the best way to go about killing tax agents .
Hundreds of comments were posted in response to an incendiary story on infowars.com , the radical far - right Web site owned by radio host Alex Jones .
The story , entitled , " The Cost Of Defying Obamacare : $ 2,250 a Month And IRS Goons Pointing Guns At Your Family , " focused on the “ increasing militarization of the IRS ” and its expansion of powers under the new health care law .
One commenter wrote : " If they actually try to do this , there is going to be a whole lot of thugs start vanishing .
This is the last line in the sand .
Those fools have just signed their death warrants !!! "
" theres gonna be alot of IRS agents needing healthcare if they try to terrorize us Americans , " another comment read .
Yet another wrote , " Come and take them ……. they will have to hire so many IRS agents because … well when 10 a day get killed …. you do the math . "
A federal probe has been launched into the comments .
" We are actively investigating all threats made against IRS employees , " J. Russell George , treasury inspector general for tax administration , said in a statement to FoxNews.com Tuesday morning .
Threats to IRS agents have increased steadily in recent years ; more than 1,200 threat and assault cases between 2001 and 2008 were investigated .
In February , a small plane pilot named Joseph Stack published an anti-tax manifesto before he crashed his aircraft into a building in Austin , Texas , that housed an IRS office .
Stack , who died in the attack along with an IRS worker , became a hero to many in the anti-tax and anti-government extremist movements ; the inspector general launched investigations into at least 70 online comments made in support of Stack ’s attack .
Now the agency ’s expanded role under the health care law has sparked a new wave of animosity toward its employees , which experts say has contributed to an unprecedentedly volatile atmosphere .
" The anger and resentment within the anti-tax movement towards the new health care is overwhelming , " said insurance analyst J.J. MacNab , who 's testified before Congress about the anti-tax movement .
" Combine this legislation with the census arriving in everyone ’s mailboxes and the fact that we 're heading into tax season , and this could be a really problematic month ahead . "
The IRS is now working to beef up security across the country .
It will be spending over $ 100 million in 2010 alone on office security , IRS Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement Steven Miller told Congress earlier this month .
There are 755 IRS facilities in the U.S. — and 64 percent of the facilities have no security presence , according to recent congressional testimony by Colleen Kelley , the president of the National Treasury Employees Union .
Union member have expressed concerns about the lack of security , she said , citing walk - in centers with no security other than a lock on the door .
One day after the House passed the health care bill , contract postings appeared on government employment Web sites requesting bids for round - the - clock armed guard security services for a half dozen facilities — including storage facilities and IRS grounds with child care centers .
The IRS posted a request for quotes for 60 Remington Model 12 gauge pump-action shotguns for the Criminal Investigation Division , which was first reported on the Drudge Report last month .
According to an IRS office memorandum outlining policy for the use of armed guards during the current tax season , the inspector general will provide armed escorts under the following conditions in April :
- " When an IRS employee has contact with a taxpayer who is the subject of an open TIGTA - OI assault or threat investigation ; or
" When an IRS employee has contact with a taxpayer who has been designated as a Potentially Dangerous Taxpayer ( PDT ) by the IRS Office of Employee Protection . "
The IRS ’s office of criminal investigations will provide armed escort assistance in other situations , the memo said .
But this has served only to further rile anti-tax extremists , who view themselves as patriots and pledge to confront any armed IRS agent with guns of their own .
" WE , I repeat , WE , are armed to the teeth .
They need those pumps just to feel safe , " one commenter wrote .
" POINT OF ORDER : I dont shoot BACK ; I shoot FIRST ………. BUY MORE AMMO , " said another .
In a particularly heinous reply that was praised by dozens of other commenters , someone suggested – in graphic terms – that tax opponents should rape an attractive agent before killing her .
" Or vice versa … do n’t have a problem with that either . "
Other online discussions delved into specific tactics — what weapons , what bullets , what bait — to employ in the killing of IRS agents .
Someone calling himself , " rEvolutionary " wrote , " I think it would take a different kind of bait .
Humans are as predictable as any animal .
What kind of bait would draw an IRS pirate ..? "
" NOT LMAO " replied , " SITTING IN THE WOODS CRYING BECAUSE THEIR HOUSES ARE GONE SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO DRAW THEM IN ….. "
While these threats are being investigated , experts doubt there is much that law enforcement can do to predict if any of these commenters actually plan on taking action .
The only thing certain is that the online community of anti-government extremists is growing , and it is increasingly being viewed by law enforcement as a threat .
" I 've never seen anything like this before , " said MacNab .
“ The health care bill could very well be the tipping point . "
THEY say bad luck comes in threes and for the owners of these flooded cars the old adage seems to have come true .
The cars , which were parked up on the riverbank at Queen ’s Staith , in York , fell victim not only to the rapidly rising river water over the weekend , but also a zealous parking inspector .
A taxi driver called The Press to say he had seen the cars being ticketed at about 9.15 am yesterday morning after the floodwater from the Ouse had subsided .
Shaun Binns , landlord of The Lowther pub which is on the opposite bank of the river on Cumberland Street , said his staff had a good view of the incident .
Mr Binns said : “ Normally you get people parking on there , but they move them in time to avoid flooding , but in this case I think the river ’s come up quickly and they must have got caught out .
There are double yellow lines down there and I suppose you could say that if you are not allowed to park there you should n’t , but the inspector must have seen the cars had been flooded and to be truthful , you ’d think they ’d have had a bit of compassion . ”
A council spokeswoman said parking attendants had been unaware that some cars had been flooded when issuing the tickets .
She said that if people provided evidence that their vehicle had been submerged , they would succeed in an appeal against their ticket .
Police say Jarrett met more than 60 women who responded to the ads and that he had sex with at least two of them .
Jarrett is well known to police , having first come to their attention in September 1997 when he was arrested at Crown Casino after an assault ( not by him ) on the driver of a limousine he had hired while pretending to be Daniel Depp , Johnny Depp 's brother .
Jarrett and his driver had tried to gain entry to a party at Crown Towers in the suite of basketballer Shaquille O'Neal .
The next day , Jarrett pleaded guilty to 10 charges of obtaining a financial advantage by deception related to the Depp scam , which dated back more than a year to June 1996 .
The next year , Jarrett surfaced in Adelaide pretending to be American actor Skeet Ulrich , star of Scream .
He bore enough resemblance to Ulrich that he was interviewed by Foxtel entertainment reporter Peter Ford , who took him for the real thing until his accent began to slip after a few drinks .
In April 2001 , Jarrett was sentenced to a maximum of two years ' jail over fraud charges stemming from the collapse of a Bendigo nightclub , Nocturnal Insomnia , that left creditors $ 139,000 out of pocket .
Since then he has made a return appearance as Skeet Ulrich .
He also pretended to be Jai Hanlyn , a representative of Johnny Depp scouting holiday locations in NSW for the star , Josh Jarrett , a Las Vegas - based nightclub owner looking to set up a base in Geelong , and Joshua Hitchcock .
The ads placed by Hitchcock Media International , or HMI , first appeared in late November .
The Age repeatedly tried to contact the company throughDecember , at first in the belief that a local production of Cheers might have been in the offing .
Calls to the office number on the HMI website were taken by an answering service .
Eventually The Age received an email and a press release from a Kate Sellick on behalf of the company .
Joshua Hitchcock was said to be '' overseas ' ' , and the company was on the brink of launching '' on what we believe is a large scale ' ' .
Mr Hitchcock would , the email said , '' be more than happy to meet with you if you are interested ' ' .
Loading
While waiting for the meeting that never came , The Age tried to check HMI 's credentials .
Geoff Brown , executive director of the Screen Producers Association of Australia , said he had never heard of Joshua Hitchcock or HMI , '' and I thought I pretty much knew everybody in this industry ' ' .
Neither federal funding agency Screen Australia nor state funding body Film Victoria had heard of Hitchcock or HMI , and management at the Docklands film studio - the most likely site for a set - based production - confirmed to The Age that they had not been approached by HMI and had heard nothing of a local version of Cheers .
[ From the extended “ Re : [ p2p - research ] Repurposing Profit for User Freedom ” available in P2P Research list ’s February archives ]
[ Last Updated 2/22/10 .
This is the last update , since we seem to have reached the point of simply restating our positions .
And anyway , trying to nest all these layers of comments is a pain in the ass . ]
KEVIN CARSON : [ The term “ intellectual property ” ] fits patents because patents restrict one ’s right to configure material elements in a particular pattern .
RICHARD STALLMAN :
That description of patents will mislead , because the patent is not defined in terms of any physical pattern .
It is defined in terms of an idea .
Whatever implements the idea(s ) stated in the patent claims is forbidden .
KEVIN CARSON : So it ’s a restriction on the implementation of an idea in physical reality , using the implementer ’s own tangible property , based on the idea “ owner ’s ” monopoly .
RICHARD STALLMAN : That ’s true .
KEVIN CARSON :
The ownership of an idea to the extent of controlling replication and interfering with tangible property rights is the patent ’s area of commonality with other forms of IP .
RICHARD STALLMAN :
It is still not vague enough to fit all these dozen or more laws .
For instance , trademark law only concerns how products are marketed , not what they do .
In order to fit them all , you have to make this “ area of commonality ” extremely abstract .
Experts have succeeded in doing that , but why bother ?
It is the details of each law that make it good or bad .
Focusing on this abstract “ area of commonality ” is just a distraction from everything that matters .
Thus , the deep harm in the term “ intellectual property ” is that it leads people to focus on an abstract generalization instead of the concrete requirements and effects of patent law , the concrete requirements and effects of copyright law , and the concrete requirements and effects of a dozen other laws .
KEVIN CARSON : See below .
KEVIN CARSON :
And the main area of trademark law it does n’t fit is the one area with some arguably legitimate basis ( preventing outright identity theft or fraud ) .
RICHARD STALLMAN : Enabling buyers to tell what they are buying is the nominal purpose of trademark law .
It covers how things are marketed , not what they are .
KEVIN CARSON : Key word “ nominal . ”
It also prohibits marketing identical products minus the trademark or with an anti-trademark .
RICHARD STALLMAN : I am not sure what you mean by “ identical ” .
Do you mean , same logo on the side of the glass ?
Identical packaging ?
Same shape or color of the bottle ?
That is not the product , that is how it is marketed .
So I stand by what I said .
KEVIN CARSON : I may be wrong about the effect of trademark law in constraining freedom of physical production .
If it ’s only patent law , and not trademark law , that makes it illegal to sell sneakers identical to Nike ’s ( I mean identical in the sense that the shoes are physically identical in design and materials , but minus the Swoosh ) , then I stand corrected .
RICHARD STALLMAN : I do n’t know whether the precise form and coloring of a shoe is covered by trademark law .
It would be interesting to find out for certain .
But I am sure that you could make a sneaker that is very similar in structure and manufacturing that would not infringe the trademark .
KEVIN CARSON : Thanks for the clarification .
I wonder if it would be possible to make a shoe with identical structure and materials , and specifically market it as an anti-Nike at ( say ) 25 % the price .
KEVIN CARSON : Ownership of trademark prevents job - shop owners in Asia from marketing goods identical to those they produce for Western TNCs , minus the 400 % brand name markup , and with the original logo in a circle - and - slashbar ( which would obviously create no genuine misapprehension as to the producer ’s identity ) .
RICHARD STALLMAN :
You are grasping at the meager shreds of commonality among these laws , but why try ?
Whatever commonality you might find is irrelevant to understanding what any of these laws does or judging whether it is good or bad .
KEVIN CARSON : I guess we ’ll have to agree to disagree on this .
See below .
KEVIN CARSON : I like to use IP in the converse way : turning the enemy ’s self - description into a pejorative ( “ decuperation ” ? ) .
RICHARD STALLMAN :
These unrelated laws do totally different things .
To oppose them all is a snap judgment .
KEVIN CARSON :
They all create artificial scarcity by restricting people ’s freedom to replicate / implement an idea / information / pattern in the material realm .
RICHARD STALLMAN : Not all of them .
Trademarks do n’t create an artificial scarcity of anything that matters .
( Is a scarcity of images of Mickey Mouse a problem for society ?
I do n’t think so . )
KEVIN CARSON : I think there ’s some harm to society , even if relatively minimal , in restricting mashup use of imagery ( all the trademark “ dilution ” crap ) .
RICHARD STALLMAN : A logo is an image , not an idea .
KEVIN CARSON : I ’m using “ idea ” in a sense of “ pattern of information , ” which includes images .
RICHARD STALLMAN : A definition is not very helpful if it gives the terms a nonstandard meaning .
However , the worse problem is that you have stated a criterion so broad that it does not say much .
RICHARD STALLMAN :
And trademark law only concerns marketing , not the contents of artistic works .
So trademark law does not involve “ owning an idea ” .
Neither does copyright law .
Copyright law explicitly excludes ideas .
To find a generalization to cover all these laws ( and a dozen more ) is not going to be easy .
You will have to drop the “ owning an idea ” approach , and find another .
You might be able to make it work — I once saw a definition which was written by experts and took several lines — but it serves no useful purpose .
These laws are very different from each other .
What they have in common is so meager and abstract that it is not important .
To generalize about them is a bad habit , so why struggle to continue it .
If we want to think about good policies , we have to think at the level of specific laws .
KEVIN CARSON : I guess our mileage just differs .
For some reason , the whole idea that ideas / patterns of information can be owned just seems to click intuitively as the misconceived idea at the root of all ideas of IP , and I feel driven to combat them by attacking that root assumption .
But again , “ let a thousand flowers bloom ” and all that .
RICHARD STALLMAN : That is a simplistic blanket position .
One of the drawbacks of the term “ intellectual property ” is that it suggests choosing among some simplistic blanket positions .
KEVIN CARSON :
It still falls under the heading of ownership of an idea .
IMO trademark law is only valid to the extent that it prohibits outright fraud or identity theft , in cases where there really is an attempt to pass one ’s product off as that of another company and there ’s a genuine risk of confusion .
That would rule out the vast majority of trademark litigation in which it ’s used for bullying , pure and simple .
There ’s an important tradition of defacing trademarks as a form of Alinsky ’s political jiujitsu , turning the trademark ’s strength around and using it against a symbolic corporate target .
RICHARD STALLMAN : I am not quite sure what this means in concrete terms .
Could you give me a concrete example of something like this which is prohibited by trademark law ?
KEVIN CARSON : Well , I ’m not sure myself how much of the “ political jiujitsu ” I describe is prohibited by the letter of trademark law , and how much of it is simply de facto prohibited by the willingness of corporations to use SLAPP lawsuits as a weapon even in cases where the courts would probably rule against them , simply because the defendant does n’t have deep enough pockets to fight the issue .
But what I ’m thinking of is the kinds of parody uses of trademarked corporate imagery , the cultural monkey wrenching , that Naomi Klein describes in No Logo .
RICHARD STALLMAN : I thought that lots of that still goes on .
We do it to Microsoft .
KEVIN CARSON : If opposing them is a snap judgment , it ’s one I ’ve formed over many years .
RICHARD STALLMAN : I retract saying its was a snap judgment .
Please forgive me .
I should have said , “ an overgeneralization , based on giving an abstract point more importance than practical effects . ”
RICHARD STALLMAN :
The term “ intellectual property ” encourages people to focus on the abstract little they have in common .
Further , it encourages people to consider this abstract little , rather than on what really matters : the effects of each law .
This is how that term skews one ’s thinking .
KEVIN CARSON : The term “ intellectual property ” points to a common fallacy used to justify all its different forms : ownership of ideas , patterns , and information .
My goal is to encourage people to consider the wrongness of the ownership of ideas and to reject “ intellectual property ” in all its forms .
“ Intellectual property ” points to the common fallacy that the intellect can be property , and thereby lays out a framework for attacking it on the ground that intellect cannot be property .
RICHARD STALLMAN : Historically , these laws were established for various specific reasons .
It is the term “ intellectual property ” that encourages people to believe in a single , abstract invalid justification for them .
I agree we should reject this supposed justification .
If we want our rejection to have influence , we should reject the term ” intellectual property ” that spreads and encourages that supposed justification .
KEVIN CARSON : IMO it ’s useful to strike at the root .
RICHARD STALLMAN :
The laws never had a common root .
They are not based on any common idea .
They are totally different .
KEVIN CARSON : But I oppose them even as separate issues , so I find some value in taking the falsification as a handy target presented to me by the enemy .
RICHARD STALLMAN :
The term “ IP ” was chosen to falsify their history , to invent a fictional common root for them , which misleads people about all of them .
The way to strike at this falsificatoin is to reject the term “ intellectual property ” , and explain that these laws are separate issues .
KEVIN CARSON :
If the advocacy of IP is based on the assertion of a general principle that ideas can be owned , it ’s useful to attack the core ideological principle behind such advocacy .
It ’s useful to make a case that ideas cannot be owned , and that the rationale behind such ownership claims , in all their forms , is therefore invalid .
As you put it in the GNU Manifesto , “ ‘ Control over the use of one ’s ideas ’ really constitutes control over other people ’s lives … ”
Advocates of property in ideas have created the term “ intellectual property ” as a commonality to serve them as a weapon , but in so doing they ’ve also made it into a single , almighty big target .
IMO it would be a mistake not to take advantage of it .
But IMO all this just reflects a difference in opinion over strategic approach .
“ Let a hundred flowers bloom , ” and all that .
RICHARD STALLMAN : Rejecting that general supposed justification does not mean that all these laws are bad .
Rather , it means we judge each one specifically based on other criteria .
Some of these laws are good , at least in part , for the same specific reasons that motivated them in the first place .
KEVIN CARSON : Which of them do you consider good , and why ?
RICHARD STALLMAN : Copyright law for works of art and opinion may beneficial if some of the restrictions of today ’s copyright law are eased .
Patent law may be beneficial outside of certain specific fields where it causes specific problems .
These specific fields include software , agricultural plants and animals grown for food , and medicine in poor countries .
Trademark law seems mostly ok to me , but I am interested to see specific information about the abuses you mentioned regarding Alinsky - style logo manipulation .
KEVIN CARSON : I guess we disagree on this .
I consider copyrights and patents to be universally illegitimate , and trademarks to be illegitimate beyond prohibitions on outright fraud or identity theft .
RICHARD STALLMAN : I think we should to judge each of these laws based on its effects .
And each has different effects .
KEVIN CARSON : Each has the effect of creating artificial scarcity , and IMO artificial scarcity resulting from artificial property rights is the central evil of corporate capitalism .
In a moment sure to inspire conflicted feelings of aesthetic revulsion and geeky fascination in any goggles - wearing would - be mad scientist , this local TV news segment demonstrates how superheating steam turns a warm fog into a powerful , invisible force capable of lighting a match .

The Times , March 15 , 2010
Jerome Starkey , Afghanistan
A family whose members were killed in a botched night raid in eastern Afghanistan have rejected “ blood money ” from the Government and vowed to carry out suicide attacks unless the perpetrators are brought to justice .
Two pregnant women , a teenage girl , a policeman and his brother were shot dead on February 12 by unidentified gunmen .
Eight men were arrested in the raid on the village of Khataba in Paktia province .
They have all been released .

No one has claimed responsibility for the killings .
A US official in Kabul refused to identify the force involved , citing “ utmost national and strategic security interests ” .
The United Nations has criticised intelligence agencies in Afghanistan in the past for using paramilitary groups to carry out “ extrajudicial killings ” .
If the force was controlled by the CIA or Afghanistan ’s domestic intelligence service it would be exempt from new Nato guidelines designed to limit night raids , which came into force on January 23 .
Local elders delivered $ 2,000 ( £ 1,300 ) in compensation for each of the five victims to the head of the family , Haji Sharabuddin , after protests brought Gardez , the capital of Paktia , to a halt .
“ I do n’t want money .
I want justice , ” he said .
“ All our family , we now do n’t care about our lives .
We will all do suicide attacks and [ the whole province ] will support us . ”
Nato had claimed that the assault force found the women ’s bodies “ tied up , gagged and killed ” .
In its initial statement it also said : “ Several insurgents engaged the joint force in a fire fight and were killed . ”
An investigation by The Times at and around the scene found both those statements to be untrue .
Although the family ’s claims that they did not shoot back could not be independently verified , none of the dead was an insurgent .
Relatives say that the women were killed during , not before , the raid .
Nato officials continued to brief journalists in Kabul yesterday that the women were victims of an “ honour ” killing .
However , they did not explain why the bodies would have been kept in the house overnight , against Islamic custom , nor why the family had invited 25 guests to celebrate the naming of a newborn child the same evening .
Nato denies accusations of a cover-up .
An undated document seen by The Times that was presented by US forces to Commander Dawood , the dead policeman , praised him for his work and “ dedication and willingness to serve the people of Afghanistan ” .
It said he would “ ensure the stability of your country for many years ” .
Commander Dawood ’s brother , Saranwal Zahir , was a district attorney in Ahmadabad district , also in Paktia .
The two married women were four and five months pregnant .
The teenage girl , Gulalai , was engaged to be married this summer .
“ Before , when I heard reports of raids like this and elders said [ foreign troops ] only came to colonise Afghanistan , I told them they are here to help us , ” said Sayed Mohammed Mal , the vice - chancellor of Gardez University , whose son Mansoor was Gulalai ’s fiancé .
“ But when I witnessed this in my family ’s home , I realised I was wrong .
Now I accept the things those people told me .
I hate [ foreign forces ] .
I hate the Government . ”
Afghan officials insist that the raid was a mistake .
None of the people reached by The Times said that the family had links with the Taleban .
“ My father was friends with the Americans and they killed him . , ” said Commander Dawood ’s son , Abdul Ghafar , as he held a dog - eared photograph showing the policeman with three US soldiers .
One of the Americans had his arm around Mr Dawood .
“ They killed my father .
I want to kill them .
I want the killers brought to justice . ”
The family suspect that a spy may have deliberately misled the assault force and the relatives have appealed to President Karzai to hand him over .
“ If the Government do n’t give us the spy I will carry a holy Koran to the presidential palace and ask , why do n’t you help us ?
Why do you let the Americans carry out these operations ? ”
Mr Dawood ’s mother , Bibi Sabsparie , said .
Haji Sharabuddin , her husband , said that he wanted the spy shot , hanged and burnt .
“ The foreigners are always talking about human rights .
But they do n’t care about human rights , ” said Gulalai ’s father , Mohammed Tahir .
“ They teach us human rights then they kill a load of civilians .
They did n’t come here to end terrorism .
They are terrorists . ”
Mohammed Sabir , whose wife , Bibi Shirin , was killed , suggested vengeance : “ If the Americans do n’t give us the spy , bring us seven Americans and we will kill them . ”
The family count seven deaths , not five , because the two women were pregnant .
Reporting from Los Angeles and Washington Ken Bensinger -- Momentum is building for a rule requiring automakers to install brake override systems so drivers can stop their cars during incidents of sudden acceleration , which has been blamed in the deaths of more than 50 people in accidents involving Toyota vehicles nationwide .
At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on Toyota ’s sudden - acceleration problem Tuesday , Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) said “ strong legislative action , ” including mandates for brake overrides , is needed to protect motorists .
Rockefeller , the committee chairman , also called for requiring senior company executives to personally certify that information provided to regulators is “ 100 % correct and accurate . ”
The Department of Transportation is also considering a rule to mandate an override system .
“ We think it is a good safety device , and we ’re trying to figure out if we should be recommending that , ” Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told members of the committee .

At the hearing , senators slammed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- overseen by LaHood ’s department -- for not identifying serious safety problems with Toyota vehicles earlier , saying that the agency does not have enough technical expertise to handle increasingly complex auto electronics systems and questioning whether government officials are too cozy with the industry they oversee .
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) and three other senators questioned whether two former NHTSA officials who went to work for Toyota influenced the government ’s slow response .
LaHood said they complied with legal prohibitions on contacting the agency on issues they had worked on at the agency , but said he would welcome a rule preventing NHTSA employees from going to work for automakers until at least two years after leaving the agency .
Sen. Olympia J. Snowe ( R - Maine ) called the agency ’s response to the safety issues “ lethargic ” and “ outdated . ”

Senators also publicly chastised three Toyota executives who testified later for not responding more aggressively to the sudden - acceleration complaints .
But even with another round of apologies from company executives , Shinichi Sasaki , Toyota Motor Corp .'s executive vice president in charge of quality assurance and customer service , suggested that sudden acceleration was caused by driver error , such as improperly placed floor mats .
“ We need to do more to consider customer expectations and real - world usage of our vehicles , even irregular use , ” he said .
“ We need to reduce the number of things we ask our customers to do correctly . ”
Takeshi Uchiyamada , the company ’s chief engineer , told senators that the company had done extensive testing on the electronic system in its vehicles and was confident it is not the cause of the sudden acceleration , which also has led to Toyota ’s issuing nearly 10 million recall notices worldwide .

“ I want to be absolutely clear :
As a result of our extensive testing , we do not believe sudden unintended acceleration because of a defect in our [ electronic throttle control system ] has ever happened , ” he said .
“ However , we will continue to search for any event in which such a failure could occur . ”
Toyota has sold 40 million vehicles with such a system , he said , but “ there was not a single case ” in which they could identify the electronic throttle control system as the cause of the unintended acceleration .
Uchiyamada and the other executives stressed the changes Toyota is making to improve vehicle safety and consumer confidence .
They announced that a Toyota official from North America now will have a formal role on recall decisions , which previously had been made exclusively in Japan , and that former U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater would head a blue - ribbon panel of independent experts to review the company ’s “ enhanced quality controls . ”
Separately , the Los Angeles city attorney ’s office is opening a preliminary criminal investigation of Toyota , examining a range of potentially illegal behavior , including false advertising and making unsupported assurances to Toyota owners about the safety of their vehicles .
Advertisement
The city became concerned about its own liability because it owns about 750 Toyota vehicles in its fleet , said Jeffrey Isaacs , deputy chief of the special operations and litigation division .
And the city pension fund owns Toyota stock , he said .
The city can bring misdemeanor , but not felony , charges .
Last week , Toyota disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney ’s office in New York , indicating federal authorities are conducting a criminal investigation .
The company also said it received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission office in Los Angeles .
In Washington , Rockefeller said Toyota and NHTSA failed to respond properly to a flood of complaints beginning in 2003 about sudden unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles .
One reason for the government ’s failure , he said , was that agency employees lacked the expertise and desire to investigate whether the problems were caused by the electronic throttle control system rather than improperly installed floor mats .
Advertisement
“ I think that NHTSA investigators . . . would rather focus on floor mats than microchips because they understand floor mats , ” Rockefeller said .
The head of NHTSA said Tuesday it had five electrical engineers out of 125 total engineers on staff .
Last week , LaHood told a different congressional panel that the agency had only two electrical engineers on staff .
LaHood did not dispute the contention about the agency , but said it was now fully investigating the electronics .
“ I do n’t know if NHTSA turned a blind eye because they did n’t understand chips or the electronics , ” said LaHood , who has been in his position since early 2009 .
“ I know this :
We ’re going to get to the bottom of the electronics . ”
Toyota ’s top U.S. official , Yoshimi Inaba , told the Senate panel that the automaker would install a brake override system on all new cars starting late this year .
Advertisement
In addition , he said , Toyota would put the safeguard on seven existing models as part of its recalls .
It also is considering extending the fail - safe feature to other models in the recalls but has not yet determined which vehicles can receive the upgrade .
“ Toyota will be one of the first full - line automakers to make brake override systems standard , ” Inaba said .
He did not discuss whether the feature would be added to all Toyota models already on the road that have electronic throttles , millions of which are not included in the recalls .
The brake override feature , called a “ smart pedal , ” is not new technology .
Advertisement
Mercedes - Benz started using it more than six years ago .
Since then Nissan , Volkswagen , Porsche and Chrysler have adopted the fail safe in most , if not all , of their vehicles .
BMW is already implementing the second generation of brake override software .
Ford and General Motors also have it on some models , but until the current crisis Toyota did not use it on any of its Scion , Toyota or Lexus vehicles .
NHTSA told the committee it had now received 52 complaints of fatalities involving sudden unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles since 2000 .
A Times review Sunday of public records and interviews with authorities found at least 56 deaths blamed on sudden acceleration in Toyota and Lexus vehicles .
Among the fatalities reported to NHTSA , 41 of the deaths were reported in vehicles with electronic throttle control systems .

About 60 % of the incidents have been reported since Toyota issued a recall in January for vehicles in which the gas pedal could stick .

Last night , as promised , a self - described “ very nervous Anthony Bourdain ” took to the airwaves with “ master of the culinary universe ” Eric Ripert .
Bourdain played bad cop ( “ I lost , like , eight pounds and ten years of my life in those 26 minutes , ” he said of their appearance on Martha Stewart ’s show ) while Ripert was good cop ( “ I think she ’s shy so she comes out looking tough , but she ’s not ” ) , and it went on like that , with the Frenchman getting ribbed for drinking only Bordeaux ( “ It ’s your fault if you drink garbage wine , ” he said ) as well as refusing to admit that he ’d prefer a street taco over a fancy meal at one of Alain Ducasse ’s restaurants ( “ He ’s been beaten up so much — I ’m loyal to my friends ” ) .
The show ’s guest , Mario Batali , also poked fun at him for seemingly cooking endangered bluefin tuna on Letterman ( Ripert said it was farm - raised ) , but nothing could crack the Ripper ’s cool .
He even admitted to liking Guy Fieri , to Bourdain ’s disbelief .
Here ’s what else the superfriends opined on .
On the Closing of El Bulli
Batali : “ They never ever make money .
I do n’t know how that works , because in a kitchen of 46 there were only three paid people . ”
Bourdain : “ When people look back on El Bulli , it ’s going to be like , well , you either saw Jimi Hendrix live or you did n’t … I think Ferran just got tired of being Ferran … Ferran always told me it was never a profitable venture for them & # 133 ;
He said [ he was losing ] 500,000 euros per year …
Ferran told me that for six months of the year he was an artist , and for the other six months he was a prostitute . ”
Batali : “ Maybe he just wants to live on the coast of Italy , like all the Italian movie stars do , eating linguine and clams . ”
On the Pinot Noir Wine Scandal
Batali : “ Is it a crime to sell bad wine to Gallo ?
They ’ve been selling bad wine for years . ”
Batali said that as punishment , the defrauders “ should probably have to drink Gallo ’s wine for ten years , ” but later backpedaled and said , “ I actually like Gallo ’s wines these days , they ’re actually not bad . ”
On Jersey Shore
Bourdain is “ completely obsessed ” with the show , and Ripert revealed that one of the castmembers ( he does n’t know which ) came into Le Bernardin last week .
On Ruth Reichl
During a segment called “ The Tao of Ruth , ” Bourdain observed that “ she ’s living inside an M.F.K. Fisher novel ” as he read her recent tweets over zen music .
“ What kind of life does this woman live ?
I do n’t live a life anything like this , and I travel all over the world . ”
On Bone Marrow
Bourdain : “ If God made butter it would taste exactly like bone marrow . ”
On Selling Out
Bourdain : “ Before you opened Babbo you were anointed — you were adorable Mario from the Food Network .
You could ’ve opened up Mario ’s Old Spaghetti Factory across America , serving overcooked spaghetti with tomato sauce … ”
Ripert : “ That was Rocco . ”
On Future Food Trends
Bourdain : “ I ’m thinking tongue is the next big thing , the next trendy food . ”
Batali : “ I ’d like to see the lower fifth of the exit canal being something that ’s interesting , in terms of chitterling or the dirty sausages that the French make . ”
On Le Bernardin ’s Least Popular Item
Ripert : “ Fresh sardines .
They were not grilled but they were good … seared skin - side down , super - crunchy and very rare , and we were serving them with a tomato sauce , actually .
[ Everyone laughs , because Ripert had previously said he only uses tomato sauce in staff meals . ]
We call it compote . ”
On a Cage Match Between Sandra Lee and Martha Stewart
Batali : “ It ’ll be a Sandra Lee Kwanzaa cake bloodbath .
Sandra
Lee would go down in a second . ”
Ripert : “ I actually have a vision of Martha throwing a can of Campbell ’s soup in her head and getting her down immediately . ”
On the Best Thing They ’ve Eaten Recently
Ripert : 80 - pound spit - roasted lechon .
Bourdain :
The uni and lardo sandwich at Marea : “ You shove that into your face and your eyes just roll up into your skull and you want to black out . ”
Batali : Woodcock , “ the brain of which was served inside the brain itself , inside the head , ” at London restaurant St. John .

In 1868 , the developer William A. Engeman purchased , for twenty thousand dollars , several hundred acres between Manhattan Beach and Coney Island .
He built a bathing pavilion , and named the area Brighton Beach , for the English seaside resort .
A visitor could bet on horse races , gawk at albinos , or attend ragtime shows at “ the handsomest seaside theater in the world . ”
By the nineteen - seventies , the neighborhood had become heavily Russian , and , like Chinatown and Curry Hill , “ Little Odessa ” was as much a sentimental construct as a place .
“ Fuck the Russians in Brighton Beach , mobster thugs sitting in cafés , sipping tea in little glasses , sugar cubes between their teeth , ” Edward Norton ’s character says in Spike Lee ’s film “ 25th Hour . ”
A couple of weeks ago , the producers of “ Brighton Beach , ” a reality show in the making , posted on their Facebook page a picture of a klatsch of fur - clad women .
“ Classic BB — babushkas chillin’ on skameyechkas , ” the caption read .
One of the prospective show ’s 3,954 fans wrote , “ Blyat , I ’m SO EXCITED for this . ”
The model here , you will have guessed , is MTV’s “ Jersey Shore . ”
The way the producers — Elina Miller , a Minsk - born twenty - five - year - old , and Alina Dizik , a twenty - six - year - old from Kharkov , Ukraine — tell it , they were at dinner a few months ago when it occurred to them “ how great Russians would be for a show like this . ”
Miller came to the United States in 1989 ; Dizik in 1990 .
They met as teen - agers in Chicago .
( Miller knows Christine Mahin , a third producer , from working with her on the A&E show “ Paranormal State . ” )
To find their Kuklas and Maxims , the producers have been holding casting calls : at Club Passion in Ocean Parkway , at Petergof restaurant in Chicago .
They are looking for certain archetypes : “ a very straightforward ethnic Russian who ’s proud of the motherland , ” a Russian Jew , someone from the Caucasus .
“ We want to , in some way , create a microcosm of the former Soviet Union in the house , ” Miller said the other day at Tatiana , a Russian restaurant on the Brighton Beach boardwalk .
Gorbachev may not have anticipated the glasnost of the confessional booth .
The producers do not yet have a deal to make the show , but , so far , they have received hundreds of audition videos .
“ Yesterday someone posted a twenty - two - minute - long tape , ” Dizik said .
“ He was showing off his Russian motorcycle , and his mom kept interrupting .
He went downstairs to show us his dad , and his dad ’s like , ‘ Get the fuck out of here . ’
Then he drove to his grandparents ’ house , and they tried to sneak candy into his pockets . ”
Vodka and weight lifting will remain important themes in “ Brighton Beach , ” but , according to the producers , the show will differ from “ Jersey Shore ” in significant ways .
“ First of all , there ’s Rushlish , ” Miller said .
“ For example , in Russia , there ’s no word for ‘ parking . ’
So you just conjugate it in Russian — ‘ Gde ti zaparkoval machinu ? ’ ” She continued , “ Then there ’s ‘ Vassya , ’ the diminutive of Vassily , which guys call each other instead of ‘ bro ’ or ‘ dude . ’ ” Russians , the producers said , put a lot of stickers on their cars .
They bring cash to weddings , not blenders .
“ A lot of the people we ’ve seen have two unrelated jobs , like an optometrist and a d.j. , ” Dizik said .
A waitress arrived with pelmeni and a salad of tomatoes , radishes , and dill .
Miller ’s iPhone , protected by a Burberry - patterned plaid case , rang .
Miller answered it and hit the speakerphone button , which seemed a very reality - TV thing to do .
It was Christine Mahin , the show ’s other producer .
“ You have to get the pickled watermelon , ” Mahin , who was stuck at her day job , said .
“ Elina , what was the word you taught me yesterday ? ”
“ Russki , ” Miller replied .
“ That ’s the Russian equivalent of ‘ guido . ’ ”
The waitress returned to the table .
“ Who are you talking to ? ” she said , in Russian .
“ Get off the phone and eat . ”
Miller and Dizik heeded her instructions , and started talking about how to decorate the house in “ Brighton Beach . ”
“ A lot of Russian homes are very modern — not , like , Design Within Reach modern but Euro - does n’t - really - go - well - together modern , ” Dizik said .
“ In my mom ’s house there ’s a circular couch . ”
The family - planning policies of the former Soviet Union , Dizik pointed out , promised a high - drama environment : “ Put a bunch of only children together in a room , and everyone thinks they ’re the most important . ”
After sharing khachapuri , a Georgian cheese pie , the producers left the restaurant through a long hall decorated with pictures of celebrities and dignitaries .
Miller turned to Dizik and said , “ Someday they ’re going to have pictures of us . ” ♦
Valve 's poster for Left 4 Dead 2's
The Passing downloadable content finally gets a tagline : Nobody Survives Forever .
And while the original survivors will be showing up at the beginning of The Passing , only three make it to the end .

The news comes by way of Valve 's Chet Faliszek , speaking to Geoff Keighley at GDC , as shown in the most recent episode of GameTrailers TV .
As reported previously , The Passing DLC for Left 4 Dead 2 would be followed by downloadable content for the first game , and now we know how that 's going to work .
While the original survivor 's death will be readily apparent in the Left 4 Dead 2 DLC , the Left 4 Dead 1 downloadable content will have players working through the events leading up to the death , which will require someone on your four - player team make the ultimate sacrifice .

The comic released between the two sets of DLC will feature an idealized version of the events , while player choice figures into how it all plays out in the game proper .
Are you noble enough to die for your teammates ?
Check out the latest episode of GameTrailers TV for more on The Passing .
Marie - Claire has been seeing these movie posters for Valentine ’s Day all over Toronto and decided to send them in .
She writes :
… Hollywood manages to keep a firm grip on the roles men and women play in society ( working vs being worshiped ) , how they spend their time ( being social , doing active / productive thing vs passive consumption and adorning themselves ) , and how they feel about Valentine ’s Day ( what day is it ?
The best day of the year ! )
When I got my cast iron skillet a few weeks ago , one of the things I was most excited about was to make fajitas .
I ’ve tried in the past , but with a non stick pan you just ca n’t get any good sear on the vegetables or the meat , and it comes out soupy and yucky .
Not so last night .
They came out blackened , charred , full of flavor and crunch .
Something about the cast iron just makes them perfect !
Here ’s my recipe for chicken fajitas ( you could easily swap out the chicken for more vegetables or another kind of meat if you want –mushrooms and red bell peppers would be good ) .
You could also do this in a non-cast iron pan , but it wo n’t come out as well … trust me , I ’ve tried many times .
Two good size chicken breasts
3 green bell peppers
1/2 white onion , the ones with the big rings
Tortillas
Can of refried beans
Shredded cheese
Salsa if you have it
First , make your marinade .
Here ’s what you need :
Honey
Soy sauce
Lemon / lime juice
Olive oil
Worchestershire sauce
Hot sauce
Combine all ingredients in the marinade into a plastic bag –you ’re using about half a tablespoon of honey and hot sauce , a few drops of soy sauce and the worchestershire , and a tablespoon of lemon juice and olive oil .
Add lots of garlic powder and cumin , salt and pepper .
Slice the chicken into thin strips and add to the bag with the marinade .
Let sit in the fridge for anywhere from 1 - 4 hours .
In the meantime , slice your peppers and onions into big strips .
I like them very chunky .
Seperate the rings of the onions so they ’re not stuck to each other .
I recommend saving some of your marinade from the chicken and letting the veggies marinate for about half an hour ; mine needed some flavor , and I think that would help .
Preheat your cast iron skillet , get it very hot .
Add a good amount of olive oil and start cooking your chicken .
Be sure to shake off as much of the marinade as possible – you want the meat dry before it goes in the pan , otherwise it wo n’t sear right .
The tip is to not crowd the pan ; you want each piece to have a nice char on it , and they need plenty of room for that to happen .
As each piece cooks , take it out and add another .
Set cooked chicken aside for now .
Keep your skillet on the heat , and add your veggies .
If you marinated them , shake off the excess moisture but keep the marinade .
Stir them as they cook , and each piece will absorb the chicken goodness that ’s left in the pan and also get a good char on it .
When they ’re almost finished ( about 6 - 8 mins , depending on how crunchy you want them ) , add the chicken back to the pan and add a few tablespoons of the marinade , not too much .
Warm up your tortillas , add some beans and cheese , and top with your delicious chicken veggie mixture .
Add salsa if you ’re not as lazy as me and actually have it .
Enjoy !
Applications Faster , cheaper chips from space technology
24/03/2010 1087 views 2 likes
Our world is full of integrated semiconductor circuits , commonly known as microchips .
Today you find them in computers , cars , mobile phones and in almost every electrical device .
Technology from ESA ’s XMM - Newton space telescope will make these chips much smaller , faster and cheaper .
The circuits are etched into today ’s microchips by ultraviolet light .
The demand for faster and more powerful chips requires the use of extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) .
Much smaller semiconductor circuits can be produced , leading to microchips up to 100 times faster and to memory chips with up to 100 times more storage capacity .
XMM -Newton
However , conventional lenses cannot focus EUV rays .
Instead , special ‘ grazing - incidence mirrors ’ must be used , and it is here that space technology comes in .
Italian company Media Lario Technologies has developed grazing - incidence mirrors to make chips by extending the technology originally used for producing the advanced telescope mirrors for Europe ’s XMM - Newton X -ray observatory .
Space telescope produced by highly accurate electroforming technology XMM - Newton image of spiral galaxy MB1 Since 1999 , XMM - Newton ’s telescope has been delivering stunning X - ray images of our Universe .
This is above all due to its exceptional mirrors – the most sensitive ever developed – which total 200 sq m covered by ultra -smooth gold .
Statistically , no gold atoms stick out from the surface by more than their own size .
XMM -Newton mirror module Media Lario was selected in 1995 to develop these remarkable mirrors .
They had to optimise and improve their electroforming and production technology to deliver the mirror modules with the outstanding performance required by ESA .
By completing this “ almost impossible mission ” in 1998 , as the then ESA Director of Science , Prof .
Roger Bonnet , described it some years earlier , Media Lario was recognised worldwide for the company ’s leading - edge nickel electroforming replication technology .
XMM Newton technology spinoff produces faster chips Media Lario's EUV lithography collector “ After the successful production of the X - ray telescope for ESA ’s XMM - Newton spacecraft , Media Lario continued to extend the technology and searched for advanced applications and markets for this unique capability , ” explains Giovanni Nocerino , Media Lario President and CEO .
“ Advanced EUV lithography for chip production needed an efficient mechanism for collecting and transporting the EUV light .
A unique Media Lario design , which is the ‘ microscope ’ configuration of the space telescope , turned out to be an ideal solution for the EUV collector problem for lithography . ”
Semiconductor circuits
“ The great news is that the semiconductor equipment industry , and consequently semiconductor devices , are making a significant transition to EUV lithography and Media Lario 's gracing incidence collector mirror is a key - enabling subsystem of this transition . ”
The EUV collector mirrors for semiconductor lithography are based on the original investment in the technologies and competences needed for XMM - Newton .
Highly reflective thin optical mirrors ( 0.4 mm to 1 mm ) can now be produced , with ultra -smooth surfaces having a roughness of less than 0.4 nm which is like a 250 - thousandth the width of an average human hair .
Faster processors with XMM - Newton space technology spin- off
Within the next year , equipment with Media Lario ’s EUV mirrors is planned to enter pre-production , prior to being used in mass chip manufacturing .
“ Media Lario is now the principal developer of such EUV collector mirrors and we are working with Nikon , Canon and ASML , the world ’s leading providers of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry , ” says Giovanni Nocerino .
According to Frank M. Salzgeber , Head of ESA 's Technology Transfer Programme Office , “ this is a great example of how a science mission generates leading - edge technology , which is then used for the benefit of daily applications on Earth . ”
The European space industry has built up an impressive portfolio of technologies and knowhow .
Since 1991 , ESA ’s Technology Transfer Programme , with its European - wide network of technology brokers , has promoted the use of these technologies beyond space systems .
This has provided many innovative solutions for non-space products and services that improve our daily lives .
ESA ’s Technology Transfer Programme Office ( TTPO )
The main mission of the TTPO is to facilitate the use of space technology and space systems for non-space applications and to demonstrate the benefit of the European space programme to European citizens .
The office is responsible for defining the overall approach and strategy for the transfer of space technologies , including the incubation of start - up companies and their funding .

I was presenting some designs to a client a couple of weeks ago when this question came up :
Will you be building this site with HTML 5 in mind ?
Naturally , I was happy to answer that one !
It went a little like this :
Me :
We ’ll build the whole thing with HTML 5 if that ’s okay with you guys .
One question though : do you know what percentage of your visitors use Internet Explorer without JavaScript to view your site ?
Client :
Erm , I do n’t really know , and I would n’t want to lose those visitors .
Maybe we ’d better not build it in HTML 5 after all .
Me :
Whoa there !
No need to be so hasty .
We do n’t have to use HTML 5 exclusively , but we can still use it to develop specific parts of the site .
How does that sound ?
order viagra in canada
Client :
Great !
Let ’s do it !
After telling Remy about this conversation , he proposed that we cover this subject in an article , so here we are !
We ’re treating this article a bit differently , like a Q & A with the authors , so let us know if you like this new style .
Which bits of HTML 5 can I use right now ?
Rich : Lots of them !
Here ’s a short list of cross - browser ( including IE ) compatible techniques that you can use today :
For a clearer idea of what is or is n’t cross - browser compatible , check out these sites from Molly Holzschlag and Alex Deveria .
Remy : Assess the technology and fit it to your project .
If I have a lot of IE 6 users , I avoid using PNG s .
If I have a lot of IE users with JavaScript disabled , I give them reduced markup as Rich pointed out earlier ( e.g. , simplified doctype , < script > , and < style > elements ) but avoid using new block - level elements like < section > .
If they have a very interactive product that relies on JavaScript anyway , I do n’t have any qualms using JavaScript to help IE style the new elements .
Also , I ’m going to detect Web Forms 2.0 and other HTML 5 - type support using something like Modernizr , and then fall back on “ traditional ” JavaScript for things like date pickers if they ’re not available natively .
What are the benefits of using HTML 5 now ?
Rich :
Here are several , in no particular order :
Cleaner markup
Additional semantics of new elements like < header > , < nav > , and < time >
, , and New form input types and attributes that will ( and in Opera ’s case , do ) take the hassle out of scripting forms
Staying ahead of the curve before HTML 5 becomes the mainstream markup language .
Use this as a selling point when talking with your clients
What are the downsides to using HTML 5 now ?
Rich : Obviously , you make some trade - offs when using HTML 5 :
The spec is n’t finished and is likely to change
Not everything works in every browser ( but you could say the same about CSS , right ? )
Should I tell my clients I ’m using HTML 5 ?
Remy : No .
When I go to buy a car , I do n’t ask about the parts in the engine .
I just want to know what it looks like , how much it costs , its level of quality , features , etc .
Sure , some people are mechanics , but most are n’t .
Clients are n’t developers , so they should n’t influence your decision on what technology to use .
When they ask What technology are you going to use ? or Should we be using HTML5 ? , we , as developers , should tell them :
It depends on your product and your audience .
Do you have any usage statistics that I can see ?
Rich : Yes , you should .
If a client does n’t want to use HTML 5 for a project , simply explain the benefits mentioned above .
Point out that their site will be built using an up - to - date markup language , so it ’s less likely to need updating in a few years .
It ’s “ future - proofed ” , and it will save them money in the long run .
What if my client mentions that “ HTML5 wo n’t be finished until 2022 ” ?
Rich : Politely inform them that it ’ll be closer to 2012 ( and some might argue even sooner ) .
Tell them you ’re building this site with an eye on the future and that it will help them in the long run .
In my opinion , it ’s only fair to inform your client that you ’re using HTML 5 ( depending on their position and level of understanding ) , though in some cases it wo n’t matter because they ’re only concerned with how the site looks in the browser they use .
Remy :
My opinion is that you should n’t be discussing with the client which technology to use — only ( perhaps ) providing justification as to why you ’ve used a particular technology .
You can assure them that SEO and compatibility wo n’t suffer , but just as you do n’t offer accessibility as an optional item on the menu ( well , I certainly hope you do n’t ) , you should n’t offer HTML 4 , XHTML , or HTML 5 as a menu item either .
Will using HTML 5 negatively affect my clients ’ search engine rankings ?
Rich : No. Google is properly indexing sites built with HTML 5 .
Take our site for example — it ’s doing just fine . ;)
Have you built any client sites with HTML 5 ?
Rich & Remy :
We ’ve both started using things like the simplified doctype and reduced markup in our client work .
We ’ve also used HTML 5 on a lot of professional projects where we ’re our own clients , such as Speak the Web and the 2009 Full Frontal JavaScript Conference .
We have n’t used it as much for full - fledged HTML 5 apps that use all the new markup and new API s – but rest assured , there is work in the pipeline . :)
Rich : I ’ve also recently released an events site for the agency I work for that uses new HTML 5 elements .
So should I be using HTML 5 in my projects right now ?
Well , as with all projects , it depends on the client ( are they marketing directors or IT directors ?
internal or external ? ) , the budget , and the timescale , among many other things .
To wrap up , we ’ll leave you with our checklist for building client sites with HTML 5 :
Use the HTML 5 doctype and character set .

Use the simplified < script > and < style > elements .

Use semantic class names that are representative of the new HTML 5 elements .

Use block level links .

Plug the gaps with something like Modernizr .
Luke Macken and I had a little mini hackfest today on improving collaboration in Fedora .
This is an idea we came up with this afternoon and I mocked up most of it on the bus ride home tonight .
( A 2 - hour bus ride home as the post -Boston - flood road conditions and traffic during rush hour were really bad tonight . )
Luke already has a working prototype 🙂
What do you think ?
The Inkscape source is of course available so please feel free to try out your own ideas and play away and bounce them back !
These are some random , off - the - cuff points about some of the ideas behind the mockups to help give some context .
I ’m likely missing a lot of good points here so I apologize in advance for my sloppiness :
threads are flattened to one level to make it simpler to follow
both the number of participants and number of comments are noted
posts have ratings to discourage one - liner “ me toos ” replies and also to make quality discussions more visible .
not sure though which scheme is best , what do you think ?
showing a single number which is the positives and negatives added together ( digg style ) showing two numbers , one for the number of positive comments , one for the number of negative comments having a up - to - 5 - star rating system , and displaying the average number of stars ( like rhythmbox does for songs
aggregate statisics provide more insight on the topics and people involved in a list
threads are categorized and taggable
you can favorite threads to keep them in a favorites list ( maybe across different mailing lists )
it ’s hard to know a person ’s signal - to - noise ratio on a mailing list .
maybe the number of positive comments a user ’s posts have received could contribute to a karma level which could elevate that person to some list of people affiliated with the list who are respected .
( maybe have a troll bucket too ?
but i do n’t like accentuating the negative )
would be nice to have a historical archive of the most interesting / popular / etc threads of all time .
right now if it ’s old enough it ’s basically lost forever , because it ’s too much effort to dig through the archives .
there ’s a lot of interesting data / stas about mailing lists we do n’t make use of … how many people are listening when i write a post to say Fedora ’s devel list ?
( CNN ) -- Colombian Sgt. Pablo Emilio Moncayo , held by Colombian FARC rebels as a hostage for more than 12 years , was reunited with his family after being released by his captors .
The young soldier arrived in the city of Florencia in a Brazilian military helicopter that transported him from the jungle , and he walked out wearing a military uniform and into his waiting father 's arms .
He had been held captive longer than any other hostage held by the rebels .
Moncayo was accompanied by Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba , who helped negotiate his release .
He had been captured as a 19 - year - old corporal when Marxist guerrillas attacked his unit , killing 22 of his colleagues and capturing him and 18 others on December 21 , 1997 .
" How amazing it is to see civilization again , " Moncayo told reporters shortly after his return .
The advances in technology fascinated him the most , he said .
" I survived everything , all of these years of captivity because of my love for Colombia , " Moncayo said .
Moncayo thanked Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa for asking for his release , and presidents Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil , but he did not mention Colombian President Alvaro Uribe during his remarks .
Another source of tension during the rescue came after the Venezuelan - based network Telesur broadcast images of Moncayo and those involved in the handover .
The Colombian government issued a terse statement calling the broadcast a violation of the protocols of the rescue .
The television station denied any wrongdoing , and Cordoba said that the humanitarian party had not noticed that the network had someone in the jungle filming .
During the handover , the FARC also gave Senator Cordoba the coordinates of the remains of a third hostage who died in captivity in 2006 .
Colombian authorities could retrieve the remains of Maj. Julian Guevara as soon as Thursday .
The FARC has said that Moncayo's was the last unilateral hostage release it would make .
It is asking for a prisoner swap for the remaining hostages they hold .
If his experience was like that of other freed hostages , Moncayo likely spent the years chained to trees and marching from one jungle hideout to another every few days .
Other captives have talked about enduring rain , cold and a blistering sun , and eating mostly beans and rice and weak soup -- when fortunate enough to get a meal .
It 's a reality that changed Tuesday for Moncayo when the rebels released him .
The rebels had said they would release Moncayo , who was promoted to the rank of sergeant while in captivity , nearly a year ago .
The FARC already released a hostage Sunday .
Josue Daniel Calvo , who had been held for 11 months , was reunited with his family Sunday on a tarmac in the city of Villavicencio , where the helicopter that retrieved him touched down .
The humanitarian mission to release the captives has been led by Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba , who has obtained freedom for previous hostages .
The Red Cross also has been involved .
Brazil , which is trusted by both sides , has picked up and ferried the hostages aboard its helicopters .
The FARC released six hostages last year but have said Moncayo would be the last set free unilaterally .
From now on , the FARC said , the rebels will demand that guerrillas held by the Colombian government be swapped for the remaining police and soldiers under rebel captivity , many for more than a decade .
Moncayo was among the best - known hostages still in FARC captivity , due mostly to the efforts of his father , who walked across Colombia to garner attention and press for his son's release .
Gustavo Guillermo Moncayo Rincon set out on June 17 , 2007 , Father 's Day in Colombia , on a 700 - mile ( 1,100 - kilometer ) trek from his hometown of Sandona to the capital , Bogota .
The teacher became known as " el caminante por la paz " ( " the walker for peace " ) .
He was received by a governor and a mayor on his walk , which drew nationwide attention .
Thousands of people cheered him when he arrived at the Plaza de Bolivar in Bogota in August 2007 .
The walk put pressure on Colombian President Alvaro Uribe to negotiate with the rebels , which he has steadfastly declined to do .
The FARC announced on April 16 , 2009 , that it would release Moncayo in the hopes of starting peace talks with the government .
Uribe responded that the rebels first had to stop " bombing , kidnapping and drug smuggling . "
Any chance for an immediate release seemed to fall apart in December , when 10 armed men killed a state governor and Uribe blamed the FARC .
The hostage release came alive again this month when Brazil announced it was moving helicopters to the border near Colombia to use in the operation .
Calvo was released Sunday and Moncayo was set free Tuesday .
Calvo became dizzy and sick on the helicopter ride , but he was in better health than family and others expected , intermediary Cordoba said at a news conference .
The soldier walked from the helicopter with his family and the aid of a walking stick .
One of the best - known incidents involving FARC hostages occurred in July 2008 , when a rescue operation freed former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt along with three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members .
Betancourt had been held hostage since 2002 .
Colombia has previously said the rebels are holding hundreds of captives , but the government group Freedom Foundation said this month that FARC was holding about 50 people .
The group attributed the revision to " cleaning up databases . "
Independent anti-kidnap organizations accused the government of minimizing the problem to try to demonstrate political gains .
No independent estimate of FARC 's guerrilla strength exists , though its military force has been severely compromised recently .
Government estimates say the FARC fighting force could have dropped to below 7,000 from highs of around 18,000 in 2000 .
Security analysts have said FARC guerrillas , who are accused of trafficking in cocaine to finance their insurgency , have thousands of supporters , mostly in rural areas .
The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion , kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela , Panama and Ecuador , analysts say .
Exceptional Warmth
It ’s been a while since I last posted an interesting chart .
Here ’s another one .
I first came across it in a lecture I attended titled “ Ocean Circulation and Climate ” given by Helen Johnson last year .
The chart was produced by Stefan Rahmstorf , a version is included in the following paper , available on his website :
Rahmstorf , S. and A. Ganopolski , 1999 : Long - term global warming scenarios computed with an efficient coupled climate model .
Climatic Change , 43 , 353-367 .
The provided caption reads :
Deviation of the annual - mean surface air temperature from its zonal average , computed from the NCAR air temperature climatology .
Anomalously cold areas are found over some continental regions , anomalously warm areas over ocean deep water formation regions .
The term “ zonal average ” means the average along a line of latitude .
Meridional refers to longitude ( think Greenwich Meridian ) .
The chart shows that the average air temperature off Scandinavia is some 10 °C warmer than the average temperature at the latitude ( 60 to 70 degrees North ) .
NCAR refers to The National Center for Atmospheric Research .
Rahmstorf explains in his paper how this temperature deviation is the result of heat being transported by ocean currents , currents that do vary over time and could be impacted by future climate change .
This warming is the result of the thermohaline circulation ( THC ) , driven by global density gradients created by surface heat ( thermo ) and freshwater fluxes ( haline ) .
Variation in the THC could have a dramatic cooling influence in the North Atlantic as climate change impacts both heat and freshwater flux .
As far as I am aware though it is not currently possible to measure and model the interactions accurately enough to make confident predictions about the likelihood of the THC being significantly impacted as a result of climate change .
I think this is an interesting chart as it illustrates just how exceptionally warm the North Atlantic and northwestern Europe are for their latitude .
The UK for example sits between 50 and 60 degrees North .
Within that band we also find the southern tip of Greenland , Vancouver ( home of the 2010 winter Olympics ) , Moscow and the chilly waters of Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Alaska .

I remember how infuriating I found Cameron ’s assertion last autumn about poverty , and how bad for poverty reduction Brown et al have been .
Now they are at it again , in their latest increasingly negative poster campaign .
The one that really drives me nuts is the first – “ I increased the gap between rich and poor , vote for me ” .
Brown did not increase this gap .
The gap increased .
There is a difference .
Brown took steps to try to reduce it , as the non-partisan IFS made clear in a presentation this week , which has this slide :
The Opposition on both sides – and you get this from the Left such as Polly Toynbee too – shamelessly ignore the counterfactual .
How much worse would inequality be without Brown ?
I blame some of the attitudes taken on the Left , who were so wound up by Mandelson saying he was intensely relaxed by the rich so long as they paid their taxes that they have ignored or failed to notice how many good redistributive things have happened with those taxes .
The Oppositon claim that Brown made inequality worse would have the same logical validity as claiming a Green Government ruled by Porrit and staffed by NEF had made the world hotter , if by cratering the world economy they somehow managed to restrict temperature increases to just 1 degrees celsius .
Grrr !

Update - September 28 , 2020 : With regards to recent developments in the Province of Quebec :
A US soldier has been charged with assault after allegedly punishing his four - year - old daughter with water , police in Washington state have said .
Sgt Joshua
Tabor dunked the girl 's head in a sink full of water for not reciting the alphabet , police in the town of Yelm said .
Yelm police chief Todd Stancil said Sgt Tabor was arrested on 31 January .
The girl was then found hiding in a locked bathroom in the soldier 's home , Mr Stancil said on Monday .
" From what I understand it is very similar to waterboarding , " Mr Stancil said of the alleged offence , according to the AFP news agency .
" And to make it only worse , the daughter is afraid of water , " the police chief told AFP .
Waterboarding is an interrogation technique that simulates drowning and has been banned as torture by the US .
Officers were called after Sgt Tabor was seen walking around his neighbourhood holding a Kevlar helmet and threatening to break windows , the police chief added .
Sgt Tabor posted bail of $ 10,000 ( £ 6,400 ) on Monday and has been confined to barracks at his base in Washington state .
Sgt Tabor is a helicopter repairer who served in Iraq from 2007 - 08 .

IF you ask my daughter , Isabel , what autism means to her , she wo n’t say that it is a condition marked by impaired social communication and repetitive behaviors .
She will say that her autism makes her a good artist , helps her to relate to animals and gives her perfect pitch .
The stigma of autism is fading fast .
One reason is that we now understand that autism is a spectrum with an enormous range .
Some people with autism are nonverbal with profound cognitive disabilities , while others are accomplished professionals .
Many people with milder symptoms of autism have , for the past 20 years or so , received a diagnosis of Asperger ’s disorder .
Some autistic adults call themselves “ Aspies ” to celebrate their talents and differences .
And many parents have embraced the label because they have found it less stigmatizing , and so it has eased their sense of loss .
This may soon change , however .
The American Psychiatric Association , with its release this week of proposed revisions to its authoritative Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , is recommending that Asperger ’s be dropped .
If this revision is adopted , the condition will be folded into the category of “ autism spectrum disorder , ” which will no longer contain any categories for distinct subtypes of autism like Asperger ’s and “ pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ” ( a category for children with some traits of autism but not enough to warrant a diagnosis ) .
WASHINGTON — Experts on Pakistan doubt that a U.S. plan to triple aid to the country will help domestic conditions , and are extremely concerned the money could be spent on unauthorized pursuits like strengthening defenses against India — perhaps even winding up in the hands of American enemies–rather than helping the U.S. win the war on terror .

President Obama recently signed the “ Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan ” Act , which gives Pakistan $ 1.5 billion in aid a year over the next five years .
Lawmakers say they hope the $ 7.5 billion in funding will reduce anti-American sentiment and help bring stability to the region .
The money is supposed to go toward Pakistan ’s social and economic development , funding things like schools , roads and water purification , but Pakistan could ultimately also receive military aid from the legislation .
The measure , however , comes on the heels of media and academic reports that the U.S. has been unable to account for how Pakistan has spent the vast majority of recent military aid funding .
Harvard scholar Azeem Ibrahim notes in his academic report entitled “ How America is Funding Corruption in Pakistan ” that the Army spent most U.S. aid money “ on types of military equipment that are practically useless against terrorists . ”
“ It bought an air defense radar system costing $ 200 million , for example , even though the terrorists in the frontier region have no air capability , ” Ibrahim pointed out in his study .
“ The military bought F - 16 fighter jets , aircraft - mounted armaments , and anti-ship defense systems .
And the U.S. Department of Defense signed off on it . ”
Ibrahim concludes that “ U.S. taxpayers have funded Pakistani corruption and undermined the fight against terrorism and militancy . ”

The Associated Press reported in early October that only $ 500 million of the $ 6.6 billion in American aid intended for the military given to the country between 2002 and 2008 actually made it to the Pakistani military .
The article noted that Pervez Musharraf served as both chief of staff and president of Pakistan during the time the aid was misused , “ making it easier to divert money intended for the military to bolster his sagging image at home through economic subsidies . ”
Musharraf himself suggested in a mid-September televised interview that he may have violated the terms of earlier U.S. aid deals because he believes it is not possible for the country to separate arms funded by the U.S. to assist in the war on terror from other weapons it may have purchased to defend itself from India .

“ There is nothing like equipment having been given to us which will only be used against Taliban , ” Musharraf said .
“ This is not a physical possibility , we are not organized that way .
The units and the regiments will carry that equipment wherever they go , whether it is on the western front or the eastern front .
And as far as Pakistan is concerned , when our security is threatened , whether it is from Taliban we will use it against them , and if it is from the East , from India , we will certainly use all our equipment , all our resources –whatever the source–against that threat . ”
Even with Musharraf out of power , experts do not think the U.S. has any means of evaluating how Pakistan will spend the billions of dollars in aid .

“ They ’ll do it again .
They ’ve cheated us before and now they ’re asking for a higher price , ” Boston University Professor Thomas Barfield told Raw Story .
“ This money is supposed to go to help people of Pakistan , but we have no way of tracking that and even if they do get it , they never say its from us so it does n’t win us a lot of friends .
It ’s an awful lot of money but we ’ve given Pakistan an awful lot of money before and the track record has not been very good . ”
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service Professor Christine Fair agreed .
“ We have no way of knowing what they will use the money for , ” Fair told Raw Story .
“ There is no transparency in Pakistan ’s budget , especially on nuclear issues .
That has been the ongoing saga for years .
I do n’t know how we would have any visibility or means of accounting for how that money is spent . ”

Although the bill prevents Pakistan from using either the aid money , or money saved because of US funding , to bolster Pakistan ’s nuclear program , presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar has dodged media questions about those terms of the agreement .
The Dawn , a major English language newspaper in Pakistan , quoted Babar as saying about the nuclear conditions : “ We will cross the bridge when we come to it . ”
Former New York Times reporter Stephen Kinzer , who spent years covering the Afghanistan / Pakistan region , said in a phone interview with Raw Story that even if the U.S. dollars themselves are n’t used to bolster nuclear programs or aid American enemies , the dramatic increase in assistance gives Pakistan more space in its own budget to spend money on potentially controversial items .
“ Any time you give a country aid for one purpose , you are freeing its money to be used for another purpose , ” Kinzer told Raw Story .
“ It would be foolish for us not to believe that Pakistan will ask for all the aid it can from the US to do whatever we want it to do , and then use whatever money it can raise on its own to do what it wants to do , and one of those things is funding its nuclear program . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But U.S. lawmakers continue to champion the bill as “ landmark legislation . ”
Andy Fisher , spokesman for Indiana Republican Sen. Dick Lugar who co-sponsored the measure in the Senate with Sen. John Kerry , told Raw Story that Lugar is not concerned about misuse of funding in the aid bill .
“ There are substantial oversight provisions that actually kept getting strengthened over the past 1.5 years , ” Fisher said .
“ In fact the bill has been criticized as being too restrictive and having too much oversight by some people in Pakistan . ”
Kerry ’s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment from Raw Story over the past month .
ADVERTISEMENT
Even as experts and Indian officials express concerns over the aid bill , Pakistani officials have called the $ 7.5 billion in American aid “ peanuts ” and people throughout the country have said it amounts to U.S. intervention into Pakistan ’s affairs .
Pakistan could also eventually receive money for military assistance from the legislation , if they pass reviews on whether Pakistan is helping fight terrorism and cease the spread of nuclear weapons first .
The measure is full of waivers , however , that allow the U.S. Secretary of State to exempt Pakistan from some of the conditions .
Some Pakistani publications have mentioned “ the bill is far less prescriptive and stringent in its language than the original version ” and “ the language related to nuclear proliferation is markedly toned down , ” as American lawmakers struggled to make the package palatable to Pakistani officials .
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service Professor Christine Fair noted the aid conditions are so lax it does n’t even spell out how Pakistan will be judged on whether it is helping to fight terrorism and cease nuclear proliferation before the country can get access to military funding ,
“ There ’s no metric of what satisfactory progress may be , ” Fair said during an interview with Raw Story .
“ Basically the secretary of state just has to say it ’s fine . ”
Lugar ’s spokesman maintains the measure is vital to the future of relations between the U.S. and Pakistan .

“ The stability of Pakistan is extraordinarily important in terms of the region and U.S. security in terms of trying to reduce the possibility of terrorist elements to recruit people and continue to operate in Pakistan and on the Afghan / Pakistan border , ” Fisher said in a phone interview with Raw Story .
“ The view we heard in the hearings over the past few years is the investment in trying to develop civil institutions in Pakistan is far cheaper than military operations in Afghanistan or elsewhere that are essentially trying to get at the same goals of stability . ”
In early October , though , The Washington Post reported that U.S. officials still have serious concerns about the Taliban ’s presence in Pakistan .
The article noted that fundraising and recruitment posters had appeared on walls across Quetta “ asking people to contribute their money , vehicles and son to ‘ fight against occupying forces ’ across the border in Afghanistan . ”
Bill Roggio , the managing editor of The Long War Journal , says reports exist that at times Pakistan has “ paid off the Taliban . ”
“ Sometimes those reports said the money came directly from US funds that were allocated to help in the war on terror , ” Roggio told Raw Story .
“ But , it does n’t really matter .
If Pakistan is paying the Taliban to do or not do something , then in some way the aid money is directly going to our enemies . ”

Sanjay Puri , executive director of the U.S. Indian Political Action Committee , said he supports help for domestic needs in Pakistan but has similar concerns about the lack of accountability for how the country ’s leaders spend U.S. taxpayer dollars .
“ If there is no accountability , there is no transparency , and money has a way to going to wherever the most powerful ideology is in Pakistan , ” Sanjay Puri told Raw Story .
“ There are people in the Army or [ military intelligence agency ] who have an ideological sympathy towards activities of the Taliban and extremists .
It is a very thin line in Pakistan at this point . ”
In my current D&D game my players are exploring a sprawling wilderness full of strange creatures and adventures .
Populating this place with stuff for my characters to do has been a real challenge but one of the tricks I use is theft .
I steal cool ideas from just about everywhere .
Here are a few examples :
- I mentioned a book called The Name of the Wind a while ago and it ’s a great story with a lot of cool ideas .
I pulled out the concept of a polite group of bandits as well as a “ Tinker ” and dropped them right into my game .
The first one was pretty standard .
The party was robbed , but rather than the usual gruff bandits these guys were calm , polite and efficient .
Giving a distinct personality to this group of bandits and their leader really helped them stand out in the world .
Beyond that , having read this character in the book let me role play him much easier and even gave me some cool quotes to drop .
The second idea that I used was the concept of a “ Tinker ” or traveling merchant .
I liked this character in the book but gave it a little twist in my game that my players really liked .
This character had a wagon full of cool items but he was not interested in money .
He would only trade for other items .
So my players were digging through their gear looking for things they could part with and haggling with me to get a better trade .
The Tinker had a few items that would push the story along , a couple that were just cool wondrous items or artifacts , some mundane stuff like rope and candles and also a few items that I thought might be fun from an RP perspective .
Things like a bottle of fruit wine and a deck of cards .
I was happy to see that my players were interested in these trinkets just as much as the magical artifacts .
- This huge wilderness needs to have a lot of little miniature adventures and self contained stories for the party to discover .
I think it ’s a good idea to have a fun goofy night every so often and so I pulled one of these stories right out of Pokemon .
The party met an old Eladrin named Doctor Elim who believes the wilderness is full of strange creatures he calls Jahori and he has tasked himself with their capture and study .
When they met the doctor he explained his story like this
“ I assure you the Jahori are very real .
Technically their full name is Jahori Paelor or little devils in the common tongue .
I believe them to be a type of demon or faye creature , somewhere between and imp and a fairy perhaps .
They come in many shapes but share a reclusive nature and a propensity for viciousness when discovered .
They fight like the spawn of orcus until caught and then they seem to calm down and accept their fate .
These capture spheres are my own design .
Once a Jahori has been discovered and sufficiently weakened in battle it can be captured with one of these .
The sphere must be thrown out near the wounded creature at which point its own magic will attempt to absorb the beast locking it away in a sort of temporal cage .
I am then able to study them in this state and even release them if necessary , although that has not proved wise in the past . ”
By this point most of the players at the table were either laughing out loud or rolling their eyes .
They wanted some information from the doctor but before he would give it he asked them to complete a small quest
“ I would like you to take a few of my spheres down to the Samekin River .
I believe there is a type of Jahori that makes its home in the rushing waters there .
I spotted it once many years ago and have had no luck finding it again .
The creature is small perhaps the size of a dog but blue and covered in leathery skin .
In walks on four squat bent legs like a lizard but has no tail rather it drags a finned tail like a fish .
Its head is wide and flat with a gaping mouth full of round teeth resembling river stones .
A tall crest like a sail sits upon the crown of its head and a mass of orange scales sprout from either side of its head at the edges of its mouth .
It is a Jahori to be certain but I have named this particular one Ter Thor . ”
The party walked around in the tall grass around the river for a bit before discovering a group of these monsters .
Having to wound and capture the animals made for a fun mechanic .
Once the target was bloodied they could toss out a capture sphere .
Then they had to roll a d20 and hit a target DC of 25 in order to successfully capture it .
Depending on the remaining health of the creature I gave them a corresponding bonus from + 6 if it was just barely bloodied up to +23 if it had less than five HP left .
Trying to guess just how many hits to deliver after the creature was bloodied was a cool change from just murdering everything they see as fast as they can .
Beyond these examples I also pull ideas from games like World of Warcraft , and anything else I happen to be playing at the time .
I also steal from movies , books and board games .
I find that as a DM now I really consume all media thinking “ how can I use this in my game ? ”
So my advice to other new DM ’s out there is , do n’t feel like you are stuck with the official materials .
The books that WOTC puts out are incredible but they are n’t the only place to get inspiration .

Social workers ' kicked over case '
The mother of a seven - year - old girl who starved to death at her Birmingham home has been sentenced to 15 years and the girl 's stepfather jailed indefinitely .
Angela Gordon , 35 , was cleared last month of murdering Khyra Ishaq but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
She will be jailed for seven - and - a - half years and spend the rest on licence .
Gordon 's partner , Junaid Abuhamza , 31 , also had a manslaughter plea accepted after a report about his mental health .
He must serve a minimum of seven - and - half years , the judge at Birmingham Crown Court said .
Abuhamza broke down in court during sentencing .
Khyra weighed 2st 9lb ( 16.5 kg ) when she was found severely emaciated at a house in Handsworth in 2008 .
' Chilling cruelty '
She was taken to Birmingham Children 's Hospital where she was confirmed dead .
Khyra Ishaq was declared dead after being taken to hospital in May 2008 Mr Justice Roderick Evans told the pair their behaviour was " chilling in its harshness and cruelty " .
During the retrial , which was ordered after the first trial collapsed , jurors heard Khyra had been killed by an infection that been caused by months of deliberate starvation .
The court heard how the house was well - stocked with food , but this was kept locked away out of the reach of Khyra and five other children in the care of the defendants .
They were also starved , two of them suffering from dangerous malnutrition when they were rescued .
The pair earlier admitted five charges of child cruelty relating to those children .
The judge said the sentences were also given for those charges .
ANALYSIS Peter Wilson , Midlands Today Home Affairs correspondent Junaid Abuhamza has schizophrenia and although he was fit to appear in court it was agreed by three psychiatrists that he will require lifelong support and monitoring .
It is also agreed he could suffer a relapse in the future which would mean he would pose a risk to the public .
It was because of this risk that an indeterminate sentence , called Imprisonment for Public Protection ( IPP ) , was imposed .
This means the judge set a minimum tariff that he has to serve in prison .
But because of the IPP he will not be released until he is able to show he is fit and does not pose a threat to the community .
He will undergo classes and intensive supervision and it is likely doctors consulted during this trial will be approached to decide if he can be released in the future .
Birmingham 's social services department has been criticised for not intervening in the case .
But Tony Howell , strategic director for Children and Young People in Birmingham , said they cannot guarantee every child 's safety .
After Gordon admitted a charge of manslaughter in court last month , a High Court ruling was made public stating that " in all probability " Khyra would be alive if there had been " an adequate initial assessment by educational welfare services " .
In the ruling Mrs Justice King said : " It is beyond belief that , in 2008 , in a bustling , energetic and modern city like Birmingham , a child of seven was withdrawn from school and thereafter kept in squalid conditions for a period of five months before finally dying of starvation . "
A serious case review into Khyra 's death by the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board is under way .
In court on Friday , Gordon was told by the judge her cruelty was " horrific " and made worse because she was the girl 's mother .
The court had been told Khyra , who was removed from school in December 2007 , was forced to stand outside in the cold or in front of a fan for long periods .
She had cold water poured over her and was beaten with a cane .
At mealtime , she and the other children were given a bowl containing carrots , beans , eggs and rice , or unsweetened porridge , to share .
' Caring mother ' " It is not right to say that these children suffered from neglect , " the judge said .
" Neglect is an inadequate and inappropriate description of the way they were treated .
" Rather , they were subjected to a domestic regime of punishment which was chilling in its harshness and cruelty .
" A regime introduced by you , Abuhamza , as it had its origins in your own upbringing , but a regime to which you , Gordon , became a party . "
He added that he was satisfied that when Abuhamza became well enough to realise what he had done , he " felt and expressed genuine remorse " .
Gordon was told that she was a " caring mother " up until the end of 2007 .
Mr Justice Roderick
Evans said he accepted she had grieved for her daughter but had only " very recently " experienced genuine remorse after being in a state of denial .
Speaking after the pair were sentenced , Khyra 's father , Ishaq Abu Zaire , said he acknowledged the difficulties associated with child protection but felt more could have been done to save his daughter .

Putin ’s Parliamentary Circus
If you ’re a Russian government official leading a press conference , you know it ’s a bad sign when your otherwise loyally self - censoring press corps is in such disbelief at your announcement that reporters keep asking if it ’s true .
The nightmare came true on Wednesday for the election chair of the ruling United Russia party , who had to explain — and explain again — that yes , pop singer Nikolai Rastorguev was going to be a United Russia deputy in the Russian parliament .
Rastorguev is the close - cropped and slightly bloated frontman of Russian pop group Lyubé , which became popular in perestroika days for its gruff , hoodlum - with - a - heart - of - gold quality ( the band members came from the working - class Moscow suburb of Lyubertsy , thus the name ) , its clever lyrics , and its nonchalance toward authority .
For nearly 21 years , the band has performed in army tunics and sung jokey songs like , " Stop Fooling Around , America , " a half - serious call for the United States to give back Alaska , the video for which is a random soup of Soviet kitsch with Photoshop graphics .
( Did Sarah Palin see that one coming from her window ? )
Now riddled with liver and kidney problems , Rastorguev has been drifting into the Kremlin ’s lucrative embrace for years .
In 2002 , then - president Vladimir Putin mentioned that Rastorguev was his favorite performer and invited the band for an earnest political discussion at his dacha .
Then , in 2006 , Rastorguev joined Putin ’s United Russia party , proclaiming , perceptively , that it was the " the only serious political force in the country . "
The following year , he joined the United Russia ticket for the parliamentary elections in the southern Stavropol region , mostly as a performer at party rallies .
Then , a few weeks ago , a Duma seat opened up and Rastorguev , who in 2008 gave Putin a vial of Lyubé cologne , was asked to step in — partly , observers say , as a " thank you " for all those rally concerts .
But the craziest part of all is that it has ceased to feel unusual .
When Rastorguev takes his seat in a few weeks , left vacant by a parliamentarian sent east to Yekaterinburg , he will join a long list of celebrities who have served for United Russia in the parliament during the Putin era .
First , there was the raspy strummer Alexander Rozenbaum , who served briefly and with little distinction , followed by the more active , Barry Manilow - esque Iosif Kobzon .
The two singers are gone , but over the last three years Putin has replaced them with a bevy of beauties — a ballerina , a boxer , two gymnasts , and a speed skater — in a move that ’s oddly reminiscent of his buddy Silvio Berlusconi ’s tactic of naming famous busty women , or outright porn stars , to head up Italian ministries .
( Notably , the speed skater is now a vice speaker , and one of the gymnasts is Alina Kabaeva , the rhythmic gymnast rumored to be Putin ’s mistress who recently gave birth to a son she named Dmitry , a name he shares with the current Russian president . )
Now , with Rastorguev ’s ascendance , the existence of celebrities in the Duma seems to be creating an insane perpetual - motion machine : Responding to stunned journalists at the Wednesday press conference , the United Russia election chair said , " What sensation ?
Is it so rare for various athletes and artists to become deputies ? "
Responding in turn to such circular logic , one political scientist joked that the members of Deep Purple — another Putin favorite — might be Russia ’s next parliamentarians .
It is crazy , yes , but it is also brazen .
Padding his parliament with inexperienced celebrities — celebumentarians ? — is perhaps Putin ’s most blatant admission that the Duma is little more than a rubber stamp , a gesture at the democracy Russia says it has .
" Do n’t you understand ? " says opposition politician Boris Nemtsov .
" United Russia is not a political party .
These people are just the hired help .
You know , at the king ’s court , there were jokers and singers and clowns , and the king was their master .
Their job is just to raise their hands on command and then put them down again . "
In talking about Rastorguev ’s bizarre appointment , some members of United Russia seemed grudgingly willing to defend the increasingly outlandish party line : " A singer can do government and civil service , " United Russia deputy Boris Resnik says .
" It does n’t strike me as at all odd . "
Others are trying to play a more subtle card .
Gleb Pavlovsky , a top Kremlin advisor , was quite honest about the fact that Rastorguev was less than experienced , though , he added , it is " unlikely that they ’ll demand any extraordinary activity of him .
He will be a cultural voice . "
Pavlovsky also conceded that , " of course , they " — athletes and artists — " give a somewhat non political character to the party , but I do n’t think it ’s a big problem . "
And , taking the by - now - familiar Kremlin line of invoking Russian exceptionalism as a salve for all wrongs , Pavlovsky maintained that this was simply a phase .
" It is not something to be proud of in our political life , " he said .
" It is our inheritance from the late Soviet period when film directors and academics were political figures .
I would prefer more lawyers , but it ’s a slow process . "
Moreover , according to Pavlovsky , naming celebrities to the state Duma was " a correct tactic in forming the United Russia party as the party of the majority , a catchall party .
It ’s quite normal … there are athletes and artists in the parliament of every country in Europe . "
Pavlovsky declined to list any examples , but he suggested that including popular figures in party lists was a way to fight chronic public skepticism .
" It ’s totally normal , " he says .
" People have felt a lot of distrust toward the government since Soviet times , so to attract them , it ’s important to have leaders of public opinion in the party . "
It ’s a strategy that , paradoxically , seems to be working .
On the one hand , according to a recent poll by the Levada polling center , Russians have not really had the wool pulled over their eyes :
Only 9 percent of Russians believe that their current form of government can be called " a democracy . "
( Two years ago , it was 15 percent . )
" People see that state bureaucrats are getting more and more power and that the people get less and less ; they see the highly personalized rule , the rigged elections , " says Levada sociologist Oleg Savelev .
Russians , in other words , are not stupid .
United Russia , on the other hand , is smarter .
Levada polling — widely seen as the country ’s most reliable — shows that Russians have largely bought into five years of rhetoric of " sovereign democracy , " the theory propagated by the Kremlin , and seen as an excuse for creeping authoritarianism , that the Western model of democracy would be inappropriate for Russia .
Nearly half of respondents say that Russia needs a form of democracy that is " completely unique , corresponding to the national traditions and specifics of Russia . "
And , strangely , in the few years since Putin started granting election - list slots and Duma seats as favors to his favorite celebrities , Pavlovsky ’s cynical tactics seem to be paying off .
( And let ’s be clear here :
In a country where opposition figures are routinely plucked off ballots on absurd technicalities , there can be no question that someone has to be allowed to run . )
Russian opinion of the Duma — inefficient and obstreperous in Boris Yeltsin ’s days ; a rubber stamp now — has always been low .
But , since 2007 , it has received a significant boost ( relatively ) , with 13 percent approving of the Duma , up from 9 percent .
Which is also nearly the same spread as in the democracy poll .
Pavlovsky ’s " leaders of public opinion " appear to be actually overcoming the Russian skepticism toward government , never mind that the government itself is now run , almost literally , by circus performers .
To fix such a brain - scrambling non sequitur , one can only turn to someone like Victor Shenderovich , a keen political satirist whose political comedy puppet show Kukly was yanked off the air in 2002 for needling Putin a bit too hard .
" You know , this is a problem for a professional satirist , when events are funnier than any commentary you can provide , " he says .
" Any joke would be gratuitous because the events are already a joke . "
Their numbers and influence may be declining , but American nuns demonstrated Wednesday what generations of schoolchildren already knew :
They are a force to be reckoned with .
By sending a letter to Congress in support of the Senate healthcare bill , a wide coalition of nuns took sides against not only the Republican minority but against their own church hierarchy , as represented by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , which opposes the bill .
The nuns ’ letter contributed to the momentum in favor of the legislation , despite opposition that is partially rooted in a disagreement over abortion funding .
“ We agree that there should n’t be any federal funding of abortion , ” said Sister Simone Campbell , the executive director of Network , a national Catholic social justice advocacy organization that spearheaded the effort .
“ From our reading of the bill , there is n’t any federal funding of abortion . ”
Moreover , she said , the reverence for life that underpins Catholic opposition to abortion also argues for passage of healthcare reform .
“ For us , first of all , tens of thousands of people are dying each year because they do n’t have access to healthcare , so that is a life issue , ” said Campbell , who is affiliated with an Encino - based order , the Sisters of Social Service .
She said Network , which has long supported healthcare reform , drafted the letter within hours of hearing that the Catholic Health Assn. , which represents about 600 hospitals , had come out in favor of the bill last week .
The letter was signed by the leaders of more than 50 Catholic women ’s orders and organizations , including the Leadership Conference of Women Religious , which says it represents more than 90 % of the 59,000 American Catholic nuns .
The Catholic bishops issued a statement Monday opposing the legislation , while stressing their support for healthcare reform in general .
The bishops ’ statement , signed by Cardinal Francis George of Chicago , said the bill , as currently written , was flawed because it would subsidize the purchase of health insurance plans that cover abortion .
George said the bishops disagreed with a Catholic Health Assn. argument that the bill was acceptable so long as it was “ corrected ” in follow - up legislation .
He said that was “ a little like asking us . . . to buy a pig in a poke . ”
Catherine Mooney , a professor of church history at Boston College who has written widely about Catholic women ’s orders , said it was n’t surprising that the nuns would take a different position from the bishops .
“ I think they ’ve shown over the years that they ’re not afraid to take a stand , ” she said .
“ They ’re speaking out for something that they think is a point of justice , and speaks for Gospel values . ”
Clyde Wilcox , a professor of government at Georgetown University who studies religion and politics , said the nuns ’ letter reflected a debate among American Catholics “ between those who urge no cooperation with any government programs that support same - sex couples or abortion in any way . . . and others who favor policies that enhance social justice and provide benefits to the poor , even if this may mean some compromise on these issues . ”
Campbell said the nuns ’ disagreement with the bishops was one of interpretation , not substance .
“ We agree on the moral principles , ” she said .
“ It ’s just whether the politics of this meet our moral principles .
So we ’re not having a fight -- I hope . ”

Rick Hayberg of Sarasota , Florida , has worked in the auto industry for thirty years .
And like a lot of riders , he was drawn back to a bike he ’d seen many years ago .
“ I was fortunate enough to ride a brand new Honda CBX back in 1980 , purchased by a good friend .
Between the looks and sound that the CBX made , the bike remained stuck in my mind for many years .
I bought my own CBX in 2008 , and started my quest to create a classic old bike with the modern innovations found in the sportbikes of today . ”
Suspension , brakes , tires , and many upgrades followed .
“ My build was supposed to be a ‘ budget ’ build , but soon got out of hand . ”
Parts were recycled from Hondas , Suzukis , Yamahas and Kawasakis , with a few bits thrown in from Ducati .
Even more amazingly , Rick did the entire build himself , in his garage at home .
And that includes fabrication , welding , machining , electrical , paint and carbon fiber work .

Last summer , archaeologists unearthed this 1,000 - pound lead coffin buried on the outskirts of Rome .
Researchers do n't want to crack open the sarcophagus , lest they harm whomever 's inside .
But should n't we be more concerned about its mysterious tenant harming us ?

In the ancient ruins of Gabii 11 miles outside of Rome , a dig team found this massive lead corpse box .
According to project leader Nicola Terrenato of the University of Michigan , this giant coffin is a rare and enigmatic discovery :
We 're very excited about this find [...]
Romans as a rule were not buried in coffins to begin with and when they did use coffins , they were mostly wooden .
There are only a handful of other examples from Italy of lead coffins from this age - the second , third or fourth century A.D.
We know of virtually no others in this region [...]
A thousand pounds of metal is an enormous amount of wealth in this era .
To waste so much of it in a burial is pretty unusual .

Ominous !
The coffin could contain a Roman military or religious official , but Terrenato is n't certain .
This lead behemoth will soon reside at the American Academy in Rome , where researchers will attempt to divine its contents using thermography and endoscopic cameras .
If neither of these methods work , the coffin may be subjected to an MRI of cyclopean proportions .
So what exactly is in this mysterious half - ton pine - erm - lead box ?
Here are some totally implausible possibilities :
- Cthulhu Jr .
- Cthulhu Jr.'s lunch .
- Some poor sap who turned the frozen donkey wheel with a little too much gusto .
- The groaning dregs of the first Roman zombie outbreak .
- All the wickedness of the world ( with a dollop of hope ) .
- Apparitions who get their rocks off melting Nazis ' faces .
- A bored demon who has nothing better to do other than go to Washington D.C. and make little girls drop the F - bomb .
- Candy .
Just a mind - blowing , shit - ton of candy .

David Cameron says 2010 should be ' year for change '
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Conservative leader David Cameron has said the UK needs a change of direction and new leadership in 2010 .
" We can't go on in these difficult times with a weak prime minister and a divided government , " he insisted in a speech at Woodstock , Oxfordshire .
He said a Tory government would invite main opposition leaders to regularly attend " war cabinet " meetings .
But Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw said the speech lacked specific policy details and was " full of platitudes " .
Similarly , Liberal Democrat frontbencher Danny Alexander said Mr Cameron " needs to be honest with people about his real priorities rather than simply parroting lines from spin doctors " .
He said the Tory leader would be judged by " his actions " and the electorate " will see that he only offers phoney change , not the real thing " .
Meanwhile , Mr Bradshaw said voters would be faced with the choice of whether to " change back to a party that favours the privileged over the mainstream majority or a party in government that has helped the country through the downturn and will make sure that everybody benefits from the upturn in a fair way " .
We will send out the loudest signal that this country is back open for business and ready for investment
David Cameron
Conservative leader
On his " war cabinet " plan , Mr Cameron said opposition leaders would be able to " offer their advice and insights " .
" When a nation is at war , it needs to pull together .
I am determined that with a Conservative government , it will , " he said .
But Mr Bradshaw said there was nothing new in this idea since opposition leaders are already consulted on privy council [ confidential ] terms on security matters .
He labelled Mr Cameron 's plan " a bit of a gimmick " .
Mr Cameron used his speech at the Oxford School of Drama to call for economic , social and political change .
" The next general election is no more than 153 days away and I do n't think it can come soon enough , " he said .
" Let 's make this the year for change - the year when the positive defeats the negative , " the Conservative leader said .

Laying out his priorities , the Tory leader said he aimed " to create a fairer , safer , green country where opportunity is more equal " .
He pledged to protect the NHS and strengthen the economy by instigating " responsible economic policies " .
Speaking against a backdrop of a picture of the Houses of Parliament with the slogan " Year for Change " , he said a new year and decade brought " a sense of hope " .
Mr Cameron said the UK would be " under new economic management " if his party won the next general election .
He revealed he intended to cut public spending through a one - year freeze on public sector pay and bring forward the planned increase in the state pension age .
' New tone '
The Tory leader also said he intended to support businesses through a cut in the main rate of corporation tax , the creation of 100,000 apprenticeships and a new high - speed rail network .
He went on : " We will send out the loudest signal that this country is back open for business and ready for investment .
" Decline is not inevitable .
Confidence can return .
If we take action now , to get a grip on the public finances and unleash enterprise , Britain can have a bright economic future . "
BBC political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue identified a new , " more optimistic " , tone in the Conservative leader 's speech , with its references to " hope " , " progressiveness " and " confidence " .
" That is a stark change from what we have had over the last few months .
David Cameron and his party have talked a lot about a new austerity , " said our correspondent .
" I think there is a feeling among Conservatives that perhaps it was too negative a message - that it was not working well with the electorate .
And now that the election really is in sight , they have to have a more upbeat message - a much more positive message - to make people come on board . "

Nobody expects the Democratic Party to actually gain seats in November .
So let 's set the bar lower : is this shaping up to be an OK year for Democrats ?
I still do n't think so .
But here 's Dan Gross in a very interesting Slate piece :
" Assuming recent trends continue , the U.S. economy will be in its sixth quarter of GDP growth , and the rancor of the health - care debate will be a distant memory .
While not producing nearly enough jobs , the economy will be producing a sufficient number to bring the unemployment rate down .
Should the stock market simply move sideways , it 'll still be 70 percent higher than its March 2009 nadir .
Is this a setup for an electoral wipeout ? "
It seems to me that the Democrats are going to lose , and most indications from both history and the economy suggest they will lose significantly .
This is partly a matter of political equilibrium and partly a matter of economics .
Presidents lose congressional seats in midterm elections .
This is basically a law of nature on par with gravity .
It happened to LBJ in 1966 ( - 4 Senators / - 47 Representatives ) , Nixon in 1974 ( - 5/-48 ) , Carter in 1978 , Reagan , Bush , Clinton and Bush .
The midterms of 1998 and 2002 are the only years to see presidents see net gains in Congress , and you can basically chalk those up the best economy of the century and worst terrorist attack in history .
Now let 's turn to the economics .
Gross ' paragraph is totally accurate , but you could also write another totally accurate paragraph that goes like this :
Assuming administration projections hold , Democrats could be going into the November facing the highest unemployment rate in an midterm election year in the last half century .
The Council of Economic Advisers projects that joblessness wo n't dip below 9 percent by November .
The last time unemployment was around 9 percent in a midterm election year was in 1982 , and Reagan lost 26 seats in the House .
What 's more , as political scientist Seth Masket found , there is a statistically significant relationship between rising disposable income and House seat gains .
So file this story under Bad News for Incumbents : personal income fell in 42 states in 2009 .
Add the horrific housing market , whose pain is concentrated in primetime states like California and Florida , and you 've got the makings of a tough summer for Democrats .
To be clear , there is no way to know if Dan is wrong .
He 's been a torchbearer of optimism throughout the recession , and he 's been right more than a lot of prognosticators .
I just wanted to rain on the parade a bit .
Team US F1 backer Chad Hurley is the man who has the best chance of saving the outfit from its current troubles , claims a senior staff member at the American operation .
With the team 's car development plans weeks behind schedule , while it bids to try and skip the opening four races , there are mounting fears that the outfit could lose its place on the grid entirely if matters are not turned around .
A senior member of the US F1 operation , who wishes to remain anonymous , thinks that it is Hurley - and not team co-founders Ken Anderson and Peter Windsor - who must now move to turn things around .
Speculation in recent weeks has suggested that Hurley himself is making moves independently of Windsor and Anderson to secure the team 's future - either through a link - up with Campos , Dallara or Stefan Grand Prix .
Speaking to AUTOSPORT on condition of anonymity , the US F1 staff member said : " We feel Hurley and Parris Mullins [ adviser to Hurley ] have our best interest [ at heart ] and also feel Hurley has no intention of abandoning us even though the media has said he 's gone with Campos .
" With all this talk about where US F1 is at , it 's been missed that there are 60 + people who have had to suffer through this for the last two months .
All of us left jobs and many of us travelled cross-country for this opportunity .
" But having said that , throughout the turmoil , the team has really come together and we 're all committed to the project ; precious few have left in spite of the uncertainty of whether we 'll be paid this Friday .
I 've never seen such dedication .
The US can field a F1 team , in fact easily so after what I 've seen . "
The staff member says Hurley became aware of the troubles the team is in earlier this year when he toured the Charlotte facility on January 15 .
He also claims that personnel were enticed to the team on promises that funding was in place for three years - but says a series of delays in the design process were a catalyst for its failure to get out on track .
" Going back to early December , it was pretty evident that something was up , in as much as we kept expecting a big push in production starting some time in mid-December , but it never materialised , " continued the staff member .
" Figure [ that ] we 're all pretty experienced in various aspects of car design and build , and we all know what it takes from a time - line standpoint .
So when it became apparent the drawing office was n't releasing drawings at the rate we expected , it started to become clear we could be in trouble .
" All engineering decisions were having to be funneled through [ Ken ] Anderson before anything could be signed off .
And that 's where the hold up was .
" Tooling for the tub was completed in early December , but then it sat for nearly a month before the laminate schedules for the outer skin were approved .
" Now Anderson himself was n't designing the laminate schedule , but he was in the wings ... as early as last October the production manager was collared about the lack of resources , but the managers were put off by saying : ' Well , Ken has a plan ' .
" The irony of all this is that there has been precious little in the way of formal planning and documentation .
No production schedules , simply very little in the way of planning . "
He added : " Our January 15 pay cheque was late .
It was paid by the 20th or so , but it certainly caused commotion and people started asking questions .
" That 's when all the company 's issues came to a head , and the conclusion was ... yes , we had been lied to about the long - term budget , and indeed the company had a cash flow issue .
But as mentioned , that really was a secondary issue .
" Think of it this way , ignoring the fact that we were lied to about the budget , if you do n't have a car or can't show serious progress in that direction , potential sponsors are n't going to have a tendency to give you money .
" At the moment there are still 60 people working in Charlotte , but 10 have already left . "
The delays in the design process are also claimed to have played their part in the sponsorship troubles - and limited Windsor 's ability to help .
" Having failed to put out a car , sponsorship money did n't materialise , " continued the staff member .
" That was n't for Windsor 's lack of trying .
" I do know that Windsor was told of our progress on a number of occasions off the record in informal settings , but it took a very contentious shop meeting in late January / early February for him to twig [ that ] indeed we had an issue .
" In a meeting between the employees , Windsor and Anderson , Windsor put the question up to the employees : ' Who here does n't think we 'll make Bahrain ? '
I think Windsor might have meant it somewhat rhetorically , but he was answered nonetheless , and 100 per cent of the staff raised their hands .
He was visibly shocked . "
When contacted about the claims from the senior staff member , team principal Anderson declined to respond to the specifics - but did suggest the comments painted a biased picture of the situation at the team .
" The story that the employee tells is certainly twisted and one - sided , " said Anderson .
" There are also contradictions .
Everybody that signed up here knew exactly what they were getting into , i.e. to have two cars on the track in Bahrain .
" Given the late start due to the FIA / FOTA situation of 2009 , I asked everybody to keep the car simple , strong and reliable .
The comment that the chassis moulds sat for a month while waiting for a lay - up schedule is exactly the sort of thing that hurt us .
Way too complex and time consuming .
I did question why it was so complex if it was not necessary .
" I do n't want to retaliate point by point as they are entitled to their opinion . "
Windsor himself said he would continue to work hard to help keep US F1 alive .
" I have given this project - and will continue to give - all the love and passion I have ever had for our sport , " he said .
" Some obstacles I wo n't be able to overcome but I 'm not giving up . "
Drug
War fuels violence , Obama officials fail to say
So I ’m browsing the news about all these high - level officials going to Mexico to solve the violence problem there …
AP headline : Obama officials say US drug demand fuels violence
Hmmm … Must be a mistake by the headline writer .
Surely he meant to say that the drug war fuels violence .
It ’s probably clarified in the article .
Let ’s see what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had to say .
Clinton said the administration is “ looking at everything that can work ” to combat the drug cartels .
Excellent .
But when asked by a reporter whether that included considering decriminalizing narcotics in the United States , she replied with a single word : “ No . ”
Well , of course .
And then I ’m sure she went on to say …
“ No .
Decriminalization is not a proper solution , because it leaves the cartels in charge .
The only real solution is full legalization and regulation , so we can re-claim the controls from the criminal element . ”
But apparently , if she did say that , if failed to get reported .
Instead we got …
A cast of senior U.S. security officials pledged long - term support for Mexico ’s drug war while acknowledging Tuesday that an insatiable U.S. appetite for illegal narcotics , coupled with a flow of U.S. arms into Mexico , is at the core of the problem .
And the solution ?
Clinton said the administration would make public very shortly a new drug policy and that it would include strategies for reducing drug demand .
Ah , a new policy .
Well , maybe not a new policy .
It ’ll still be prohibition .
But maybe with some lipstick .
Could she be referring to the new National Drug Control Strategy , which was supposed to be unveiled today by Vice President Biden and Drug Czar Kerlikowske ?
They were sending out press advisories about it yesterday .
WASHINGTON – Tomorrow , Tuesday , March 23 , at 2:00 PM ET , Vice President Biden and Drug Control Director Gil Kerlikowske , along with several Cabinet Secretaries , will lay out the Administration ’s inaugural National Drug Control Strategy , which establishes five - year goals for reducing drug use and its consequences through a balanced policy of prevention , treatment , and international cooperation .
This event will take place in the Roosevelt Room .
The Vice President and Director Kerlikowske will deliver remarks .
These remarks will be pooled press .
And yet , that oddly got changed to : ** THIS EVENT HAS BEEN POSTPONED TO A LATER DATE .
Do n’t know why .
Could it be that they did n’t have it quite together ?
Or could it be the lipstick was showing ?
Curious .
( Yes , of course , it was because the health care bill is a big f**king deal .
Kerlikowske is actually in Mexico with Clinton . )

On July 30 , 1965 , President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare into law .
In public memory , what ensued was the smooth establishment of a popular program , but in fact Medicare faced a year of nearly crippling rearguard attacks .
The American Medical Association had waged war to try to stop the program , and doctors were n’t about to abandon the fight against “ socialized medicine ” simply because it had passed into law .
The Ohio Medical Association , with ten thousand physician members , declared that it would boycott Medicare , and a nationwide movement began .
Race proved an even more explosive issue .
Many hospitals , especially in the South , were segregated , and the law required them to integrate in order to receive Medicare dollars .
Alabama ’s Governor George Wallace was among those who encouraged resistance ; just two months before coverage was to begin , half the hospitals in a dozen Southern states had still refused to meet Medicare certification .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Either boycott could have destroyed the program .
Hundreds of thousands of elderly and black patients would have found their hospitals and doctors ’ offices closed to them .
But , as David Blumenthal and James A. Morone recount in “ The Heart of Power , ” their riveting history of health - care politics , Johnson recognized the threat and outmaneuvered his opponents .
With the doctors , he cajoled and compromised , giving the A.M.A. a seat on an advisory council that oversaw the rules and regulations , and working with it on a series of thirty “ improving ” amendments to the legislation .
With hospitals , however , the President brooked no compromise .
He convened a battle council of top advisers ; set Vice - President Hubert Humphrey phoning mayors to pressure resistant hospitals ; and deployed hundreds of inspectors to make sure that participating hospitals integrated their wards .
There was fury and acrimony .
In the final weeks before Medicare ’s start , though , the hospitals decided to abandon segregation rather than lose federal dollars .
Only then was Medicare possible .
The health - reform bill that President Obama signed into law last week — the unmemorably named Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — could prove as momentous as Medicare .
Yet , because most of its provisions phase in more slowly than Medicare did , they are even more vulnerable to attack .
The context , of course , is different .
As Robert Blendon , of the Harvard School of Public Health , points out , the war against health reform in 2010 has not been an interest - group battle .
The A.M.A. endorsed the legislation ; hospital associations were supportive .
Once the public option was dropped , most insurers favored the bill .
The medical world will wage no civil resistance .
This time , the threat comes from party politics .
Conservatives are casting the November midterm elections as a vote on repealing the health - reform law .
If they regain power , they are unlikely to repeal the whole thing .
( No one is going to force children with preëxisting conditions back off their parents ’ health plans . )
Instead , they will try to strip out the critical but less straightforwardly appealing elements of reform — the requirement that larger employers provide health benefits and that uncovered individuals buy at least a basic policy ; the subsidies to make sure that they can afford those policies ; the significant new taxes on household incomes over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars — and thereby gut coverage for the uninsured .
Opponents may also exploit the administrative difficulties of creating state insurance exchanges .
The states have four years to prepare , and creating an exchange is , in theory , no more complicated than what states do in providing health - benefit options to public employees .
Massachusetts , which has achieved near - universal coverage this way , had its exchange working in six months .
Still , with fourteen state attorneys general already suing to stop parts of the reform , some states may refuse to coöperate , forcing a showdown .
The major engine of opposition , however , remains the insistence that health - care reform is unaffordable .
The best way to protect reform , in turn , is to prove the skeptics wrong .
In 1965 , health care consumed just six per cent of U.S. economic output ; today , the figure is eighteen per cent .
Nearly all the gains that wage earners made over the past three decades have gone to paying for health care .
Its costs are curtailing all other investments in the economy , and , if they continue to rise as they have been doing — twice as fast as inflation — the reform ’s subsidies , not to mention America ’s prosperity , will indeed prove unsustainable .
But the reform package emerged with a clear recognition of what is driving costs up : a system that pays for the quantity of care rather than the value of it .
This ca n’t continue .
Recently , clinicians at Children ’s Hospital Boston adopted a more systematic approach for managing inner-city children who suffer severe asthma attacks , by introducing a bundle of preventive measures .
Insurance would cover just one : prescribing an inhaler .
The hospital agreed to pay for the rest , which included nurses who would visit parents after discharge and make sure that they had their child ’s medicine , knew how to administer it , and had a follow - up appointment with a pediatrician ; home inspections for mold and pests ; and vacuum cleaners for families without one ( which is cheaper than medication ) .
After a year , the hospital readmission rate for these patients dropped by more than eighty per cent , and costs plunged .
But an empty hospital bed is a revenue loss , and asthma is Children ’s Hospital ’s leading source of admissions .
Under the current system , this sensible program could threaten to bankrupt it .
So far , neither the government nor the insurance companies have figured out a solution .
The most interesting , under - discussed , and potentially revolutionary aspect of the law is that it does n’t pretend to have the answers .
Instead , through a new Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation , it offers to free communities and local health systems from existing payment rules , and let them experiment with ways to deliver better care at lower costs .
In large part , it entrusts the task of devising cost - saving health - care innovation to communities like Boise and Boston and Buffalo , rather than to the drug and device companies and the public and private insurers that have failed to do so .
This is the way costs will come down — or not .
That ’s the one truly scary thing about health reform : far from being a government takeover , it counts on local communities and clinicians for success .
We are the ones to determine whether costs are controlled and health care improves — which is to say , whether reform survives and resistance is defeated .
The voting is over , and the country has many other issues that clamor for attention .
But , as L.B.J. would have recognized , the battle for health - care reform has only begun . ♦
CBO : $ 10 trillion jump in debt under Obama budget
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If President Obama 's 2011 budget were put into effect as proposed , the U.S. federal government would add an estimated $ 9.8 trillion to the country 's accrued debt over the next decade , according to a preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office .
Of that amount , an estimated $ 5.6 trillion will be in interest alone .
By 2020 , the agency estimates debt held by the public would reach $ 20.3 trillion , or 90 % of GDP .
That 's up from 53 % of GDP in 2009 .
Research done by economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart has shown that such high levels of debt can cause a drag on economic growth .
The CBO cited two big contributors to the jump in debt .
One is the president 's proposal to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the majority of Americans .
The other is the proposal to protect middle - and upper - middle - income families from having to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) .
Together those proposals would cost $ 3 trillion between 2011 and 2020 .
" It points out the unwillingness of the administration to raise the revenues to pay for the size of government being proposed , " said Robert Bixby , executive director of the Concord Coalition , a deficit watchdog group .
If Congress does n't act , all of the Bush tax cuts are slated to expire at the end of this year and there will be no protection from the AMT .
But current law is not politically realistic , many say .
That 's why the administration prefers to compare the cost of its proposals to what lawmakers are likely to do -- namely , extend tax cuts and fix the AMT .
Hence , the White House Budget Office estimates that under the president 's proposals , $ 8.5 trillion would be added to the country 's accrued debt over the next decade , or $ 1.3 trillion less than the CBO estimate .
Either scenario is unsustainable , Bixby said .
The administration has also called the budget trajectory unsustainable and the president has created a fiscal advisory commission to recommend ways lawmakers can get annual deficits down to 3 % of GDP by 2015 .
That 's well below where it would be under the president 's budget , according to estimates from both the CBO and the White House .
And while his proposals would chip away at deficits in the next few years , they start to climb again thereafter .
By 2020 , the annual deficit as a percentage of GDP will be 5.6 % , according to the CBO .
The White House estimates it will be 4.2 % .
But there is no guarantee the fiscal commission 's recommendations will be adopted by lawmakers .
The CBO notes that its estimates incorporate the Administration 's revenue and spending assumptions for policies such as health reform and climate change , because the agency did n't have sufficient details from the White House about those policies to do its own analysis .
A full analysis of the president 's budget will be published later in the month , the CBO said .
End of era for old Nimrods marked at RAF Kinloss
The deaths of 14 servicemen in an explosion led to an inquiry
Final air miles for ' spy in the sky ' crews Commemorations have been taking place at RAF Kinloss to mark the retirement of the current Nimrod aircraft .
The Nimrod has been in service for about 40 years , but the deaths of 14 servicemen in 2006 after an explosion over Afghanistan led to a safety probe .
Squadron Leader Nigel " Buster " Edwards said the planes would be missed .
A senior RAF officer has told BBC Scotland he fears lives could be put " at risk " by the MoD 's decision to withdraw Nimrods from operations .
The new Nimrod MRA4 is due to arrive at RAF Kinloss in July for training purposes - but will not be in operational service until autumn 2012 .
Marking the last flights of the current Nimrod , Squadron Leader Edwards told BBC Scotland : " The job it 's done has been very important .
It 's had a long and distinguished history .
" We do understand why she is going but we will miss her . "
' Rescue priority '
Dozens of jobs have been lost at RAF Kinloss due to the withdrawal of the present Nimrod , a year earlier than originally planned .
The base is a major local employer and generates millions of pounds for the Moray economy .
RAF Kinloss is a major local employer in the Moray area Local SNP MP Angus Robertson praised the service personnel at the Moray base .
But he explained : " I am concerned that search and rescue operations may now not have the same capabilities until the replacement Nimrod MRA4 aircraft are introduced at RAF Kinloss .
" The Ministry of Defence must introduce the new Nimrods as a priority and ensure the appropriate capabilities are available to search and rescue as well as military operations . "
Some experts claim that the MoD proposals to fill the gap do not stand up to scrutiny .
They say the C130 Hercules transport plane which may be used to carry out some of the Nimrod 's maritime missions does not have the capability .
' Tasked as appropriate ' Aviation journalist and Nimrod expert Jon Lake said the withdrawal of the Nimrod this month was " ridiculous " .
He said : " It is grossly irresponsible of the MoD .
There is plainly not going to be just a capability gap but a capability chasm .
" The C130 can only do a fraction of what the Nimrod can do , and it is a cynical cost - cutting measure which will undoubtedly risk lives . "
A spokeswoman for the MoD said that the work of the Nimrod would be carried out " by a variety of different aircraft , fixed wing and helicopters , which carry out the role that the Nimrod currently does " .
She added : " They will be tasked as appropriate . "

Aboriginal communities are deeply divided about plans for tribal lands Aboriginal groups have held a public meeting to debate controversial plans to build Australia 's first nuclear waste dump on tribal land .
The federal government has identified a remote cattle station north of Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory as a likely site .
The proposal has caused deep divisions within the indigenous community .
Ministers have indicated that the nuclear dump would not be built if landowners opposed it .
In the next six years , nuclear waste that Australia sent to Europe for reprocessing will be returned .
Divisive
But officials in Canberra have yet to decide where to put it .
Muckaty Station , an isolated property 120 km ( 75 miles ) from Tennant Creek , has been chosen as a possible site .
Local Aborigines have offered to sell the land for $ 11 m ( £ 7.3 m ) , a move that has infuriated other indigenous groups in the area , who worry about the health and environmental implications .
Some also object on cultural grounds that something some see as odious could be inflicted on sacred tribal country .
These conflicting views are expected to collide at a public meeting in Tennant Creek , an old gold - mining town south of Darwin .
Australian Greens Senator Scott Ludlam says the plan to build a radioactive waste dump in the region has become extremely divisive .
" It already risks setting families against families and the government has not bothered to try to and bring the whole community along .

" We have had a small 10 MW research reactor operating in Australia since the late fifties .
The industry and the government never bothered to investigate waste storage scenarios .
" So , now in 2010 they are now desperately casting around for an Aboriginal community who will take that legacy waste from the last few decades , " he said .
Australia 's federal government said that Muckaty Station would be subject to thorough scientific and environmental assessments .
Critics believe that recent earthquakes in that part of the Northern Territory have raised questions about the safety of the site .

One of the most common complaints among healthy older adults relates to a decline in memory performance .
This decline has been linked to an inability to ignore irrelevant information when forming memories .
In order to ignore distracting information , the brain should act to suppress its responses to distractions , but it has been shown that in older adults there is in fact an increase in brain activity at those times .
In a new study published in the April 2010 issue of Elsevier 's Cortex researchers at the University of California San Francisco have shown that even prior knowledge of an impending distraction does not help to improve the working memory performance of older adults .
Drs. Theodore Zanto and Adam Gazzaley studied 21 adults aged between 60 and 80 years while they performed a working memory task in which they were shown random sequences of pictures containing faces and scenes .
From a given sequence , participants were asked to remember either only the faces ( ignoring scenes ) or only the scenes ( ignoring faces ) .
In a second round of testing , the participants were given prior information about which specific pictures in the sequence would be relevant and which to ignore .
The participants ' brain activity during the tasks was recorded using electroencephalograms ( EEGs ) .
Previous research from this laboratory has indicated that the increase in brain activity in response to distractions occurs very soon ( within 200 milliseconds ) after the distraction appears .
Since there is only a very short amount of time allotted for the brain to identify an item as irrelevant and suppress any further neural processing , it was suggested that older adults might benefit from prior knowledge of the impending distraction .
However , results from the new study have proved that this is not the case .
Interestingly , the researchers found that later stages of neural processing ( 500 - 650 milliseconds after item presentation ) do show signs of suppression , confirming that the " suppression deficit " is related to early stages of neural processing .
The findings suggest that a working memory decline in older adults is indeed due to an inability to ignore distracting information , which furthermore cannot be improved with preparedness .
Yet another update from Oklahoma City as the Oilers and Prodigal Hockey move closer to announcing a new team in the OKC and new AHL affiliation .
Yesterday we learned that Prodigal Hockey has registered the following domains
http://www.okcoilers.com
http://www.okcoilkings.com
http://www.okcoilbarons.com
A bit of fun with Google and some help from the OKC Slackers led us to three more domains that have been purchased and parked by Prodigal Hockey :
http://www.okc89ers.com
http://www.okchawks.com
And finally , to bring it all back together :
http://www.okcroadrunners.com
Bob Funk Jr. is confident that approvals are coming .
The AHL Board of Directors is meeting on the 18th and 19th .
According to Jason Chaimovitch , Vice President of Communications of the American Hockey League :
As part of the initial AHL membership application a potential owner must have an NHL affiliation in place ...
Though lips are sealed from both Prodigal Hockey and the Edmonton Oilers , the affiliation agreement is already in place and has been for some time .
The Oilers ' will dust off the Roadrunners franchise , move their AHL affiliate from Springfield to Oklahoma City next season , and unless the proximity of the Tulsa Oilers and the backlash from Blazers fan is too much , they 'll be named after an oil theme .
And Cody Wild 's wish to be further away has been granted .
The question of control and ownership still remains .
Did Edmonton sell the Roadrunners to Prodigal Hockey ?
Did Prodigal
Hockey take a partial stake in the team or will they be more of a management firm for the team ?
And as commenter B.C.B. asks , why did n't the Oilers just make this move on their own ?

For months , in his travels around the country , Gov. Tim Pawlenty has loudly denounced the massive federal stimulus package as " misdirected " and " largely wasted . "
But back home , one of his highest priorities -- the state 's controversial sex offender treatment program -- has been quietly relying on those temporary funds for its very existence .
More than 40 percent of the program's $ 65 million budget this year comes from President Obama 's economic stimulus initiative , with the money paying the salaries of 392 of the program 's 700 employees .
Sen. Linda Berglin , the DFL lead on the committee overseeing the treatment program , said Pawlenty 's Department of Human Services called last year and asked to have stimulus money steered to it .
State officials , she said , had discovered they could not use the federal funds where they had hoped , but found that they could apply them to the sex offender program .
" They did call us and ask us about rearranging it , " Berglin said .
Brian McClung , Pawlenty 's spokesman , said that if federal stimulus money had not come , cuts would have been made elsewhere to prevent the sex offender program from facing reductions .
" Gov. Pawlenty has made it very clear that public safety is among our highest priorities , " McClung said .
Some DFLers say the diversion of stimulus money to shore up the finances of the treatment program is an example of how Pawlenty is attempting to have things both ways : Criticizing Obama 's stimulus program for political purposes -- he once termed it " a meandering spending buffet " -- but hoping few notice that the funds have helped mask the impact of his spending cuts .
" I find it kind of strange that the governor would have ever said a bad thing about [ stimulus money ] , and then built his budget around [ it ] , " Berglin said .
A quiet redirection of funds
At almost the time state officials shifted the stimulus money , the sex offender program was facing a $ 16 million shortfall that threatened its ability to meet payroll or pay vendors .
In March 2009 , DHS Commissioner Cal Ludeman went to legislators pleading for stopgap funding .
His request was granted , with no public discussion of stimulus funding .
The move to shove stimulus money into the program redirected $ 26.5 million of the $ 2 billion that flowed to DHS as part of the federal effort to help Minnesota through its economic crisis .
As recently as a week ago , House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher , DFL - Minneapolis , said she was unaware that stimulus money was propping up the sex offender program .
So was Rep. Tom Huntley , DFL - Duluth , who chairs the House Health Care and Human Services Finance panel .
Huntley said Pawlenty 's " negative " view of stimulus money was difficult to understand given where the money had gone .
Dennis Benson , executive director for the sex offender program , declined to be interviewed for this story .
Bonnie Martin , the program 's spokesperson , would not address how the program came to be so dependent on stimulus , but said that when that money runs out , the program will revert to using state general fund money .
" Nothing has changed due to the stimulus funds , " Martin said .
Berglin agreed , adding it was unlikely that the program , which has faced recurring funding difficulties , would otherwise have faced drastic cuts .
" We used the money [ where we could ] to help us balance our budget , essentially , " she said .
A signal for overall budget Management and Budget Commissioner Tom Hanson , who is overseeing Minnesota 's stimulus spending , said the shaky financial footing of the sex offender program is symbolic of what lies ahead for the overall state budget .
The key question , he said , is what happens when the stimulus money " goes away , and the expenses stay . "
" We 're going to have to replace all of that , " Hanson said .
Berglin said Pawlenty has been politically handcuffed ever since the infamous case of Dru Sjodin , the woman who was abducted and murdered by a convicted sex offender early in the governor 's first term .
The incident led Pawlenty to reject any changes to the state 's sex offender program , she said , even though it cannot be financially sustained .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : HaskellTorrent v0.0
Hello , I am happy to announce HaskellTorrent v0.0 , a concurrent bittorrent client .
The current release is a rather early preview release : it can download torrents and seed them , but currently there are many optimizations and tweaks needed before it is ready for day - to - day use .
In particular , we are not yet fully compliant with the bittorrent specification and need proper clients to connect to in order to operate .
Basically , you install the cabal package and then run HaskellTorrent foo. torrent and it will then download the contents of the torrent to the current directory .
We would like to hear about any kind of problems you might encounter .
Send them to jesper.louis.andersen at gmail.com for now .
We have only tested the software on GHC 6.10.4 and 6.12.1 , mostly on Unix platforms .
It is known to work on Debian / Unstable with GHC610 and GHC612 .
If you want to hack code , get in touch with me .
There are something for any level of skill to do .
*** HaskellTorrent is using the CML library to get concurrency .
It easily runs some 200-300 processes when it operates and its process model is somewhat loosely inspired by the model of Erlang .
Looking forward , the next goal is to optimize concurrency , memory usage and CPU usage in the client .
It currently hogs resources due to naive data structure choices and some expensive correctness assertions .

Taking a stick to the GOP ’s ‘ transparency ’ crusade .
When the Democrats announced that they would be forgoing conference committee proceedings and negotiating a final health care reform bill informally , critics pounced on President Barack Obama for violating his promise of greater transparency in government .
And I , for one , had no great urge to defend him .
As a presidential candidate , Obama had not merely promised to introduce more transparency to government .
He had very specifically , and very repeatedly , promised to conduct deliberations over health care “ in front of the cameras on C - SPAN . ”
Although I never took the pledge literally - - clearly , you ca n’t negotiate an entire bill in public view - - plenty of voters did .
Now Obama was paying a political price for the boast .
I figured it was punishment for rhetorical hubris .
But then , on Wednesday , a press release from the Republican National Committee came across my desk .
It contained a statement by Rep. Tom Price , Ga. , chairman of the Republican Study Committee .
“ If the Democrats are n’t engaging in more nefarious backroom deal - making , why do they refuse to pull back the curtains and let the public see what ’s going on ? ”
Price said .
“ What are they doing that they do n’t want us to see ? ”
To call that statement priceless is not just a bad pun .
It ’s a gross understatement .
As you may recall , the previous administration -- that is , the very Republican George W. Bush administration -- had its own problems with transparency .
Perhaps most famously , Vice President Richard Cheney convened a task force to help the administration design energy policy .
People were naturally curious about what this task force was doing , particularly given the administration ’s close ties to the petroleum industry , but Cheney would n’t even reveal who was on the task force , let alone open its proceedings to the public .
If Republican leadership was in high dudgeon then , I must have missed it .
This animation shows Greenland ’s ice mass loss over 2003 to 2009 , estimated by combining data from NASA ’s GRACE satellites with high precision GPS measurements of “ rebound ” in the underlying rock as the weight of ice is removed .
The lightest blue shows low levels of mass loss , black the highest .
From the University of Colorado press release :
“ Our results show that the ice loss , which has been well documented over southern portions of Greenland , is now spreading up along the northwest coast , ” said Shfaqat Abbas Khan , lead author on a paper that will appear in Geophysical Research Letters .
Khan goes on to suggest what this might imply for the future :
If this activity in northwest Greenland continues and really accelerates some of the major glaciers in the area — like the Humboldt Glacier and the Peterman Glacier — Greenland ’s total ice loss could easily be increased by an additional 50 to 100 cubic kilometers ( 12 to 24 cubic miles ) within a few years .
Another good reason to keep an eye on the Arctic this summer .
Climate Progress has a very good overview of recent work on Greenland ice loss and its implications for sea level rise .
Well worth a read , if not exactly comforting .

Peter Graves , the rugged actor who starred in the hit TV series “ Mission : Impossible ” and whose career took a comic turn in the disaster spoof “ Airplane ! ” has died .
He was 83 .
Graves was found dead Sunday afternoon in front of his Pacific Palisades home from apparent natural causes , said Officer Karen Rayner of the Los Angeles Police Department .
FOR THE RECORD :
Peter Graves obituary :
The obituary of actor Peter Graves in the March 15 LATExtra section said the television series “ Mission : Impossible , ” in which he played intelligence agent James Phelps , ran from 1967 to 1973 on CBS and from 1988 to 1990 on ABC .
The show debuted in 1966 ; Graves joined the cast in 1967 . —
Graves had just returned from brunch with his family to celebrate his upcoming 84th birthday .
He collapsed on the driveway before he could reach his house , said Sandy Brokaw , his publicist .
One of Graves ’ daughters administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation but was unable to revive him , Brokaw said .
Graves starred in more than 70 television series and feature films , typically playing the straight - laced hero .
One of his first major roles was in the 1953 classic , “ Stalag 17 , ” in which he played an undercover Nazi spy placed among American POWs in a German camp .
His most memorable role was in “ Mission : Impossible , ” the 1960s CBS series in which he played intelligence agent James Phelps , leader of the elite Impossible Missions Force .
The show ran from 1967 to 1973 on CBS and 1988 to 1990 on ABC .

Every week , Graves could be seen listening to a tape of instructions for carrying out his team ’s secret missions .
He won a Golden Globe in 1971 for his role .
“ Mission : Impossible , ” along with other Western , military and action parts in the 1970s , branded Graves as an actor who could deliver solid , straight - shooting roles .
But that changed in 1980 , when he became the star of the comedy “ Airplane ! , ” in which he played Capt .
Clarence
Oveur , the bumbling pilot whose one - liners included , “ Joey , do you like movies about gladiators ? ”
Graves initially turned down the role .
“ I read it and thought , ‘ Gee , this is dangerous , ’ ” Graves told The Times in late 2009 .
“ It was in terrible taste . ”
But the film ’s producer , Howard Koch , urged him to meet with the young filmmakers , David Zucker , Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker , who told him that they wanted somebody of stature and dignity to play the role “ absolutely straight , ” Graves recalled .

“ They say you are supposed to stretch as an actor , so let ’s go stretch it , ” he said .
He joined other actors known for serious roles , Robert Stack , Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Nielsen , in the film .
Graves was born Peter Aurness in 1926 in Minneapolis , the son of a journalist and a businessman .
Graves ’ older brother , James Arness , would later play Marshal Matt Dillon on “ Gunsmoke . ”
Graves adopted his grandfather ’s last name to avoid confusion with his brother .
He studied drama at the University of Minnesota until arriving in Hollywood 60 years ago .
He married his college sweetheart , Joan Endress , that same year .

One year later , he landed his first movie role in 1951 ’s “ Rogue River . ”
He later starred in the TV show “ Fury , ” playing a horse rancher who befriends an orphan .
The contemporary Western series became a hit and ran on NBC between 1955 and 1960 .
“ I wanted Peter Graves to be my dad , ” Jerry Zucker , who directed “ Airplane ! ” told the New Orleans Times - Picayune in 1997 .
During the 1990s , Graves hosted the documentary series “ Biography ” on A&E .
In an interview with The Times in December , Graves said he was n’t ready to retire .
“ There has got to be some good parts around for guys my age , ” he said .

Recent roles included a guest part on “ House ” and 11 episodes on “ 7th Heaven . ”
He recently read for a part on a TV series as a grandfather , Brokaw said .
In addition to his wife , Graves is survived by three daughters and six grandchildren .

Is Hillary Clinton Beating The Drums Of War Against Iran ?
United States - Israel : A Glimpse At The “ Special Relationship ”
Most Americans , and especially American politicians , value the “ special relationship ” that the United States has with Israel .
Not only it a a constant political feature of US foreign policies ever since the creation of the Jewish state in 1948 , but it has some deep implications for policy makers domestically .
While it is easy to understand such an intimate alliance from an historical perspective , the quasi symbiotic nature of the relationship implies a codependency which is not necessarily healthy for either part on a geopolitical stand point .
But can the , sometime , dysfunctional “ marriage ” be put in question or are the two states going to be tied to the hips “ for better or for worse ; ’ til death do them apart ” ?
A key factor at play in the dynamic of this marriage is , of course , the very powerful Jewish American lobby in Washington .
In the American racial “ melting pot ” , American Jews are a very small minority compared to other religions or ethnic groups , yet the “ chosen people ” are extremely influential in politics , the financial world and of course the media .
If you are an American politician , and become - ever so slightly - critical of Israel ’s policies during your term in office ; it is very likely that when you try to be reelected the funding of your political campaign will suffer as well as the media coverage .
AIPAC And The Power Of The Jewish Lobby
Among recent American political “ dynasties ” , the Clintons are probably the closest ones to Israel .
Recently , the power house at the core of the Jewish American lobby , AIPAC , is talking a lot about Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , and appreciates her new bellicose tone and stand on Iran .
AIPAC ’s positions on Israeli foreign policies reflect closely the ones held by Prime Minister Netanyahu , which are echoed in return by the right leaning Israeli media such as The Jerusalem Post .
The Obama administration and the US media have being very quiet about what appears to be a Mossad operation in Dubai resulting in the assassination of a Senior Hamas leader .
AIPAC is not mentioning a word of it in its sophisticated and frequently updated web site , instead they would rather talk about Iran and Hillary Clinton ’s new heated rhetoric .
“ Secretary Of State Hillary Clinton , on Tuesday , reiterated concerns about Iran ’s nuclear intention suggesting that evidence pointed to Iran seeking nuclear weapons , ” wrote AIPAC on their web site .
AIPAC also quoted Hillary Clinton ’s “ headliner ” from last week : “ Iran is becoming a military dictatorship ” .
This line , in conjunction with the other quote from Clinton : “ Evidence says Iran wants a nuclear bomb ” is of course a deadly combination , which basically shut down a diplomatic solution and set us up on an inevitable coalition course with the Islamic Republic , and shortly down the line for a military confrontation with Iran , even if it is by proxy of Israel .
The timing of Clinton ’s rhetoric could not be worse .
The Netanyahu administration has being beating on the very same drums of war with Iran as soon as it took office .
What they need from the United States top diplomat is to be calmed down not to have their war path message amplified by a transatlantic loud speaker .
Hillary Clinton is pouring gasoline on a flame which could consume the entire Middle - East .
Especially considering that the Iranian regime of Ahmadinejad is shaky , paranoiac and not only assaulted from inside in the aftermath of the June 12 elections but also literally cornered by US troops in Iraq and US troops in Afghanistan .
Overall , this has all the components of being a disaster in the making .
The Geopolitical And Monetary Cost of The Special Relationship
Since the war in Gaza , last year , most European countries have taken some distance from Israeli government ’s officials .
To the extent that if some former top officials came to Europe they would be arrested for war crimes .
The grave new incident in Dubai could result in extending the list to most top official of the current Israeli administration , including PM Netanyahu himself .
Of course , and once again because of the special relationship , the United States will not join the growing chorus and will stand by Israel “ for better or for worse ” .
Lately , the US Congress can not get anything voted or done .
However , they are a few notable exceptions ; one is the military budget , the other is the annual aid package to Israel .
On December 13 , 2009 Congress passed and the President signed into law - without fanfare and much media exposure - the annual foreign aid bill for fiscal year 2010 , which includes $ 2.22 Billion in “ security assistance ” to Israel .
When combined with the $ 555 Million of aid in a previous bill , the legislation brings the total amount of aid to Israel in fiscal year 2010 to $ 2.775 Billion or a $ 225 Million increase from last year .
The US Congress has now fully founded the 2 ND year of the 10 - year , $ 30 Billion US - Israel Memorandum of Understanding .
In that agreement , signed in 2007 , Israel is slated to receive gradual increases in aid for the first 4 years before leveling off at $ 3.1 Billion per year for the remaining 6 years .
After all the years the “ marriage ” is still going strong .
For Better Or For Worse , ‘ Till Death Do Us Part
But the deadly part of “ for better or for worse ’ till death do us part ” , could be sooner than later unless someone , somehow managed to calm down the war mongering tendencies of Netanyahu , AIPAC , and Clinton .
We are living in a very dangerous world , but an attack on Iran could and probably would drive all of us off the cliff and into World War III .
Let ’s hope reason prevails , against all odds , and that the EU , Russia and China do not let the United States commit the deadly mistake of letting Netanyahu do what he is planning to do .
Unfortunately , counting on the rationality of President Obama is questionable , after all the man which has the “ ear of the President ” is Rahm Emanuel ; a staunch supporter of Israel ’s worst follies .

OTTAWA–The federal Justice Department pays to help publicize leading criminal justice research that frequently discredits the Conservative government 's " tough - on - crime " agenda .
The most recent issue of Criminological Highlights , published last month , with federal assistance , by the University of Toronto 's Centre of Criminology , blows gaping holes in several of Justice Minister Rob Nicholson 's most cherished anti-crime measures .
It also provides a very timely reminder of why Canada 's ongoing move toward more mandatory minimum sentences can lead to the kind of plea bargain arrangement that 's created a storm of public outrage around former Conservative stalwart Rahim Jaffer .
Mandatory penalties , says the research digest , " undermine the legitimacy of the prosecution process by fostering circumventions that are wilful and subterranean .
They undermine ... equality before the law when they cause comparably culpable offenders to be treated radically differently . "
In other words , people who can afford good lawyers agree to backroom plea bargains to avoid harsh mandatory sentences , while the average Joe is hit hard .

In case you missed it , Eldrick Tont Woods , the world ’s greatest golfer , has been up against some pressing PR issues of late .
Pretty much nobody is arguing that he ’s handled it well .
Begin with the official record .
While it ’s not yet 100 % clear what touched off the fateful events of November 27 , 2009 , everybody is denying that Elin was trying to neuter him with a long iron .
But think about the story we ’re being sold : The National Enquirer pubs a story saying Tiger is stepping out on his wife .
A couple nights later , at two or three in the morning , Tiger decides to leave the house for no apparent reason .
While trying to back out of the driveway – stone sober , the reports insist – he manages to wrap the Escalade around a tree .
With me so far ?
Good .
Then his wife comes out and tries to “ rescue ” him by bashing out the windows with a club .
If none of this smells a tad overripe to you , call me .
I ’m working a sweet real estate deal – waterfront property in south - central Florida , as it turns out – and am looking for partners .
Anyhow , we ’re not here to snark over the fact that Woods lives in a town with the most gullible CSI unit in America .
We ’re here to discuss what this case tells us about the brave new world of public relations and crisis communications in the land of the ubiquitous , 24/7 / 4ever tabloid news cycle .
The Ugly Choices
Say you ’re a PR counselor .
And you represent a client who encounters a personal crisis of the general shape and / or size of Tigergate .
What do you do ?
You say this :
Client , you have a choice , and I ca n’t make it for you .
On the one hand , you have a right to privacy , despite what the howling jackals of the free press would like us to believe .
You ’re entitled to say nothing and to deal with your personal life behind closed doors .
They may stalk you for the rest of your days , but you may , if you choose , ignore them .
You do n’t even have to acknowledge their existence , and if they get out of line you can get restraining orders and hire security to keep them out of your immediate personal space .
Or you can face the music .
Now , if you choose option B , you ’ll need to be fully forthcoming .
If they smell a lie , a dodge , a rhetorical two - step , any hint at all that the truth they ’re getting is even slightly varnished , well , it ’ll be worse than if you ’d stonewalled them .
And a calculated , cynical faux press conference event like the one staged by that Tiger look - alike robot a couple of weeks back ?
Yeah , I ’d avoid that like I would pigeon tartare .
So option B = 100 % transparency .
Think about all the things that means .
Like , what ’s your self - respect worth ?
How you feel about being on your knees before the drooling , unwashed masses ?
If you opt for route A , though , understand something – and this is critical .
Your brand is going to take an epic nard - stomping .
It may never recover .
Even if it does , it may take a very long time .
If your livelihood depends on your public reputation , the question becomes how much money do you need to live on ?
How much are you willing to sacrifice ?
And I mean this literally , Client .
This is a math question – how many dollars do you have , how many do you need , and how many are you willing to forego ?
Hell Hath No Fury
Sadly , options A and B are more or less mutually exclusive .
That sucks , I know .
It ’s not fair that a person should have to make this kind of choice .
But that ’s the world we live in .
Once upon a time a newspaper arrived in the morning and the news came on TV in the evening .
Like a dog that knows dinner time is 6 pm , the public was acclimated to this information rationing routine .
In that world a pro like me could control the flow of data .
Gatekeep like a sumbitch , you betcha .
Top - down , one - to - many them until the cows come home .
Rover is going to eat at six , and he ’s going to eat what I put in front of him , by god .

These days Rover rolls with a posse and an attitude .
Kibble at six ?
Fuck you , master .
I ’ll eat when I want , and if you do n’t like it I ’ll head over to the Johnson place .
Dogs are a too - rare commodity these days , and unless you ’d like me to become the neighbor ’s faithful hound , there better be something tasty in that dish around the clock .
Forgive me if I ’m torturing the metaphor , but hopefully the point is clear .
In a world with 24 - hour “ news , ” always - on Internet and now an exploding mobile landscape , where that ubiquity is never further away than your pocket , the rules have changed .
And not in your favor .
Your Life May Belong to You , But Your Brand Belongs to the Public
See , today ’s public has gotten entitled .
They ’ve gotten accustomed to the immediacy , the comprehensiveness of the on - demand infocycle .
Key word : demand .
Something happens , they find out within seconds .
And if it ’s even remotely interesting , there are dozens ( hundreds , even thousands ) of outlets and individuals on the trail , relentlessly scouring the story for every minute scrap of detail , no matter how banal or trivial .
It ’s their right to know … well , whatever the hell they want to know .
Information wants to be free .
Information is power .
They ’ve paid for their phones and their cable and they endure the ads on their favorite Web sites because they want content .
All of it .
Now , bitches .
Understand that , at least subconsciously , they feel like they have paid for the right to know whatever they want about you .
Your private life is their property .
You ’re public domain now .
That may seem perverse , but there it is .
If you get righteously indignant and insist on option A ( that ’s the “ respect my privacy route ” ) , Client , one of two things is going to happen .
On the one hand , people may respect your courage and principles and give you the space you need to get your life back tog …[ snzrrrk…hrrf … BWAHAHAHAHA ….]
Hoo .
Thanks , thanks .
I ’ll be here all week .
Remember to tip your waitress .
Aherm .
So no , I was just kidding .
That ’s not one of the things that might happen .
I just wanted to see that cute little glimmer of hope leap into your puppy dog eyes again .
I know , I ’m a hateful , soulless bastard .
You knew that when you hired me , though .
Seriously , though .
One thing that might happen is rampant outrage .
How dare you clam up on us ?
Hell hath no fury like a consumer scorned .
They ’ll carry on like you betrayed them personally , even though they may never have been in the same time zone with you .
This will be very bad .
But not as bad as the other thing that can happen , which is that they move onto some other shiny thing and forget about you completely .
That yawning sound you ’re hearing is the sound of your personal brand sloughing onto the heap of permanent irrelevance .
It ’s a very different sound than the clink of gold coins being dropped into your pockets , is n’t it ?
This Is Your Life
I ’m sorry , Client , I ’d say .
This is all I have .
I can explain the landscape , detail your options , and execute like a hall of famer along the course you choose , but I ca n’t pick that path for you .
This is the rest of your life we ’re talking about .
You have to decide which cup of poison to drink .
I mean , sure , if you were Tiger and I had a hot tub time machine I ’d be happy to jacuzzi back a few years and try to explain to you the deleterious impact that unsanctioned cocktail waitresses can exert on your cash flow position , but let ’s be honest .
You ’d listen to me about like Senator Fatback listens to a lobbyist who shows up empty - handed , would n’t you ?
And in truth , we can carp about the system all we want , but if it were n’t for this over - the - top , completely ludicrous system your brand probably would n’t be a percent of what it is today , anyway , right ?
Live by the sword , die by the sword .
I know none of this is what you want to hear , Client , but you called me to manage the crisis .
Which means I arrived shortly after we lost control of important parts of the game .
So now we play the hand we ’re dealt .
There is an edict that was always true about crisis management , but it ’s about a million times more important today than it once was : the best way to deal with crisis is to avoid it .
The lesson is a simple one .
People will find out .
So if you do n’t want to see it on TMZ and YouTube and Facebook and Twitter , do n’t fucking do it .
As I say , simple .
Oettinger will Europa - Endlager : Niemand will die Asse- Fässer
Braunschweig und Salzgitter winken ab .
EU - Kommissar Oettinger fordert unterdessen Endlager in Europa und kündigt eine entsprechende Verordnung an .
Für die rund 126.000 Fässer mit radioaktiven Abfällen , die das Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz ( BfS ) aus dem havarierten Atommülllager Asse bergen will , findet sich kein Abnehmer .
Nach Salzgitter hat sich jetzt auch der Braunschweiger Stadtrat gegen Asse- Müll auf seinem Gebiet ausgesprochen .
Einstimmig beschloss das Kommunalparlament eine Veränderungssperre für ein Gewerbegebiet , in dem das Entsorgungsunternehmen Eckert & Ziegler die Abfälle aus der Asse für eine spätere Endlagerung vorbereiten will .
Vorstandschef Andreas Eckert stellte dafür im Gespräch mit der taz Investitionen von rund 20 Millionen Euro in Aussicht .
Die verfügte Veränderungssperre lässt dies nun nicht zu .
Braunschweigs Oberbürgermeister Gert Hoffmann ( CDU ) warf der Firma vor , nicht mit offenen Karten gespielt und den Zusammenhang mit dem Atommüll in einem nachgereichten Papier versteckt zu haben .
" Ich halte das für unseriösen Umgang mit der Verwaltung " , sagte Hoffmann
Auch die Nachbarstadt Salzgitter will den Asse - Müll nicht .
Oberbürgermeister Frank Klingebiel ( CDU ) und die im Stadtrat vertretenen Parteien stimmten kürzlich gegen eine Umlagerung der radioaktiven Abfälle in den Schacht Konrad in Salzgitter .
Das Bundesumweltministerium und das BfS planten " über die Köpfe der Bürger Salzgitters " den Transport der Fässer nach Konrad , heißt es im Ratsbeschluss .
" Der Rat und der Oberbürgermeister als Chef der Verwaltung verurteilen dieses Vorgehen . "
Schacht Konrad ist das einzige genehmigte Endlager in Deutschland .
Die frühere Eisenerzgrube wird derzeit umgerüstet , ab 2014 könnte die Einlagerung schwach - und mittelradioaktiver Abfälle beginnen .
Das BfS hat mehrfach angedeutet , dass Konrad als Lagerstätte für die Asse - Abfälle infrage kommt .
Konrad wurde nur für maximal 303.000 Kubikmeter Müll genehmigt .
Die Abfälle aus der Asse haben nach Schätzungen allein ein Volumen von rund 100.000 Kubikmeter .
Das Genehmigungsverfahren für Konrad müsste also neu aufgerollt werden .
Die Ratsfraktionen in Salzgitter und der Oberbürgermeister lehnen das aber " strikt ab " .
Die Kommune hatte bereits gegen die gültige Genehmigung für Schacht Konrad geklagt .
Auch der Streit über ein mögliches Endlager in Gorleben droht sich zu verschärfen EU - Energiekommissar Günther Oettinger ( CDU ) forderte im Hamburger Abendblatt , dass sich die Mitgliedstaaten " dringend um die Frage der Endlagerung kümmern " sollten .
Er kündigte eine EU - Verordnung zur Entsorgung von Atommüll an , die 2010 fertiggestellt werden soll .
Frankreich , Schweden und Finnland wollen in den kommenden 15 Jahren damit beginnen , ihren Atommüll unterirdisch zu lagern .
Die finnische Regierung wolle ein unterirdisches Endlager 2020 in Betrieb nehmen , sagten europäische Experten bei einer Konferenz in Kalifornien .
Schweden habe ähnliche Pläne. Frankreich will bis 2013 über einen Standort entscheiden .

The files contain verbal and drawn accounts of UFO encounters Thousands of UFOs have been spotted in the last 20 years around the UK , according to newly released documents .
More than 6,000 pages of reports describe people 's experiences with unidentified flying objects between 1994 and 2000 .
They include reported sightings over Chelsea Football Club and former home secretary Michael Howard 's Kent home .
Details have been released under a three - year project between the Ministry of Defence and The National Archives .
The fifth instalment to be released consists of 24 files of sightings , letters and Parliamentary questions , which are available to view online .
The reports detail how objects of various shapes and sizes have been witnessed flying over a range of locations .
Some drawings by witnesses have also been released .
One man told police he was physically sick and developed a " skin condition " after an eerie " tube of light " enveloped his car in Ebbw Vale , Blaenau Gwent , on 27 January , 1997 .
In another case , a UFO sighted by Boston and Skegness police , in Lincolnshire , was captured on film .
It 's impossible to prove a direct link between what people are reading and watching and what they report as UFOs but one interpretation could be that the latest advances in technology may be influencing what people see in the sky
Dr David Clarke
Strange sightings and close encounters
The police reported the sighting to the coastguard , which in turn alerted ships in the North Sea , where a crew reported seeing more UFOs .
Simultaneously , an unidentified blip was picked up on radar over Boston .
Also included in the latest release is a letter from senior MoD official Ralph Noyes , in which he describes seeing a film of UFOs captured by RAF fighter pilots in 1956 .
Mr Noyes claims the footage was shown at a secret underground screening arranged for air defence staff at the MoD in 1970 .
And a memo reveals how former prime minister Winston Churchill expressed curiosity in " flying saucers " and requested a briefing from his ministers .
He was told in reply that following an intelligence study conducted in 1951 , the " flying saucers " could be explained by " one or other " of four causes .
These were known astronomical or meteorological phenomena , mistaken identification of conventional aircraft , optical illusions and psychological delusions , or deliberate hoaxes .
DRAWINGS FROM THE UFO FILES Many of the released files included sketches .
A craft containing three beings was drawn by a passenger on a flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong in 1993 .
A drawing and description of a " flying saucer " sighting over Watford in Hertfordshire was also among the 6,000 pages of newly - released documents .
A sighting above Trenale Lane , near Tintagel , Cornwall , was also documented .
The artist identified a dome at the front of the craft as the cockpit .
Another eyewitness submitted a drawing of a triangle - shaped craft seen close to a pylon above Knutsford in Cheshire .
Two " missile - shaped " UFOs were also captured in a sketch by a witness in Smethwick , West Midlands , in 1954 .
A triangle - shaped craft was also drawn by a witness who described seeing it above Oldbury , West Midlands , on 9 August 1995 .
Another notes the diameter of the unidentified craft they saw flying above their car in Malmesbury in Wiltshire .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Experts believe the records highlight how shapes of reported UFOs have changed over the last few decades , possibly explained by representations of UFOs in popular culture .
Many reports in this latest file describe aircraft as big , black and triangular in shape with lights along the edges , whereas the predominant form in the 1940s to 1950s was saucer or disc - shaped .
Dr David Clarke , author of The UFO Files and senior lecturer in journalism at Sheffield Hallam University , said : " In the 1950s the next big leap in technology was thought to be a round craft that took off vertically and it's intriguing to note that this is the same period when people began to report seeing ' flying saucers ' in the sky .
" In the period the latest file release covers , triangular - shaped US stealth bombers and Aurora spy planes featured heavily on TV , such as The X Files .
.. , and films such as Independence Day released in 1996 , and the shape of reported UFOs corresponds .
" It 's impossible to prove a direct link between what people are reading and watching and what they report as UFOs but one interpretation could be that the latest advances in technology may be influencing what people see in the sky . "
The files are available to download for free for a month from the National Archives website .

Artist Jeremy Dean created the ultimate vehicle for wealthy , privileged Americans in a post - financiapocalyptic , post-oil war imaginary and heavily satirical future : the Horse - Drawn Hummer .
Here is its story .
Advertisement
In Jeremy 's post - apocalyptic America , the wealthy will still crave ownership of all things desirable and scarce , but they 'll be unable to drive traditional cars because Wall Street 's greed will have caused a collapse permanently destroying our economy and ability to buy oil from the Middle East .
So what do you do if you still want to lord it over the little people with the ultimate symbol of consumerism gone wrong ?
You commission your mechanic to convert your Hummer to horse power .
This Horse Drawn Hummer is equipped with chrome " CEO " badges on the roof rack to remind the starving masses of your status , tinted windows so they can't look at you with their shifty eyes and three interior flat screen televisions to distract you from their misery .
To debut the vehicle , which he built in Florida , Jeremy loaded it on to a flat bed trailer and dropped it off in New York 's Central Park where he rendezvoused with a couple of draft horses from Connecticut .
Turns out the Hummer is n't approved for use of as a Horse Cart in the park and a couple of very angry cops , likely acting on orders from The Man , kicked them out after a single lap .
Still , that was enough time to prove the Hummer 's merit as a wagon .
Most central park horse carts weigh 1,800 Lbs and are pulled by a single horse .
Chopped up like this , the Hummer weighs just under 2,000 Lbs and accommodates two horses .
It 's bigger , more comfortable and requires more resources than a standard wagon , just like the car it 's based on .

Why an H2 ?
" For me the symbol that best personifies the arrogant , unsustainable , indulgence of the last era and the inevitable downfall , is the Hummer H2 , " says Jeremy .
" This military vehicle turned 9 MPG grocery getter has been called ‘ An indictment of the American psyche on wheels , ' and is clearly consumerism at its peak . "
But Jeremy is n't pointing a finger at GM or the car industry for producing wasteful excess , saying , " they were after all giving us what we wanted . "
But he is using the car industry as a symbol of the collapse of the American Dream .

" As the country began to emerge from the Depression , Americans were obsessed with making grandiose predictions about the future , " writes Jeremy .
" At the 1939 World 's Fair in NYC GM unveiled their exhibit entitled ‘ The Futurama ' which was a large scale model of their vision of the future world we would all inhabit and how the automobile would make it all possible .
And in a way , they were right .
After WWII the automobile made this country .
Massive government investment in the highway interstate system ( which was basically the largest subsidy ever handed out to business ) created suburbia , and led to the very American Dream of a two car family , the house , picket fence , dog named Spot .
At one point the 1950's 1 in 7 jobs were directly related to the auto industry .
AAAAhhhh the golden age of America .
In 1953 the slogan ‘ As General Motors goes , so goes America ' was said with pride . "
Jeremy has cut a video from that Futurama exhibition together with the Ludachris video and displayed it on the in - cart monitors to highlight the journey from idealized consumerism to its ultimate reality .

" As the current economic crisis has unfolded , GM , Ford and Chrysler have run their companies into the ground by producing these cars , yet they requested billions of taxpayer dollars in bailouts .
When GM rolled out its new 2009 line up of cars , it still includes the HUMMER at 9 MPG and the Cadillac Escalade at 12 MPG .
HUMMER has since been sold to the Chinese ( no small irony there ) and GM is in bankruptcy .
‘ As GM goes , so goes America . ' "

The idea to convert a car into a cart came from The Great Depression , which saw many Americans add horses to their cars because they were unable to afford gasoline .
The resulting contraptions were called " Hoover Carts " after President Hoover who was largely blamed for the depression .
To realize his project , Jeremy bought a used Hummer H2 for $ 15,000 , drove it straight into a borrowed Florida garage and started cutting pieces off of it .
The resulting vehicle is actually surprisingly well made .
All the modifications have been made out of converted parts already on the car .
The bottom of the driver 's area is the upside down hood , the vertical piece behind that is a section of the roof , complete with yellow running lights .
Jeremy fitted electric trailer brakes to prevent the horses from running out of control and the horses steer the front wheels through a tow bar connected to fabricated A - arms .
When the economy does collapse , Jeremy could be one of the lucky few to find a job , he could build vehicles like these for the rich and powerful .

The Horse Drawn Hummer was displayed at the Pulse NYC art show and will likely make future appearances here in New York .
We 'd love to see it roll through next week 's New York Auto Show and even asked if it could be the official Jalopnik staff car .
Alas , no , it was not to be .
A corner to talk about software design , type theory , compilers and programming languages .
This is n't the first USB drive / Swiss army knife we 've seen from Victorinox , but the company 's new Secure Pro drive is the first that is supposedly " un-hackable . "
To put that claim to the test , Victorinox actually offered a £ 100,000 prize to a team of " professional hackers " if they could crack the drive during the company 's launch event -- they were unable to do so .
That un-hackableness apparently comes primarily from the drive 's combination of AES256 technology and fingerprint security , which is paired with ( get this ) a self - destruct mechanism that irrevocably burns the CPU and memory chip if there 's any attempt to force the drive open .
All that and a pair of scissors -- how can you go wrong ?
No word on a release over here just yet , but the drive is now available in the UK in capacities from 8 GB to 32GB for between £ 50 and £ 180 ( or about $ 75 to $ 270 ) .

The bountiful fields of the U.S. are awash in atrazine .
Some 36 million kilograms of the odorless , white powder are applied on farms to control grassy weeds .
Some 225,000 kilograms of the herbicide fall with the rain each year , sometimes up to 1,000 kilometers from the source .
All that atrazine may be having another effect : turning male frogs female .
As described in the March 1 Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences , biologist Tyrone Hayes of the University of California , Berkeley , and his colleagues exposed 40 African clawed frogs ( Xenopus laevis ) to 2.5 parts per billion ( ppb ) of atrazine in a water solution continuously for three years — a level below the three ppb allowed in drinking water by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
As a result , 30 of the frogs were chemically castrated , incapable of reproducing , among other impacts .
And four of the treated frogs actually turned female , going so far as to mate with other males and produce viable eggs despite being genetically male .
Whereas another four of the treated frogs apparently resisted atrazine 's effects , the rest " lacked male reproductive behavior , had reduced male features , and severely reduced sperm and low fertility , " Hayes says .
The key may be aromatase , a protein that spurs the production of the female hormone estrogen , causing originally male gonads to become ovaries and whose production is spurred by atrazine .
Plus , the researchers used frogs bearing only the ZZ sex chromosomes of male African clawed frogs .
In previous studies " if we got hermaphrodites , there was no way to know if they were males with ovaries or females with testes , " Hayes says .
" By using all ZZ males we were assured that any hermaphrodites or females were indeed sex-reversed males . "
Frogs follow the ZZ ( male ) , ZW ( female ) sex determination scheme rather than the more familiar XX ( female ) , XY ( male ) pattern in humans .
Hayes has a long history studying atrazine , starting in the 1990s with research funded by its maker , now known as Syngenta , that first raised the prospect that the herbicide might be a interfering with the natural hormones of animals , including humans .
A barrage of studies on such endocrine disruption have followed — some confirming that amphibians such as frogs are suffering from an atrazine onslaught , others finding no effect , and some even finding evidence of reduced sperm count in men from agricultural regions of the U.S .
" The proposed findings are incredibly important , " says biologist Jason Rohr of the University of South Florida in Tampa , who has also studied atrazine but was not involved in this research .
This study is not likely to be the last word in the controversy , however .
Critics , such as biologist Werner Kloas of Humboldt University in Berlin , charge that samples may have been contaminated by endocrine disruptors like bisphenol A ( BPA ) leaching from plastic containers or introduced during screening .
He also questions the single exposure level , lack of measurement of female hormone levels in the affected frogs , and the use of ethanol in the water solution " as they claim atrazine is easily water soluble and it is better to avoid any solvent if feasible . "
This study also went through an unorthodox form of peer review , in which the paper was edited for publication by another professor at U.C. Berkeley , rather than an unaffiliated scientific reviewer as is more common .
" Such a paper should not have become accepted for publication , " Kloas charges .
For his part , Kloas in the past reviewed atrazine 's effects for Syngenta and found no impact on African clawed frogs at up to 100 micrograms per liter of atrazine and no genetic impact at 25 micrograms per liter .
He says he currently has " no running experiment with Syngenta or any further chemical company . "
In their native habitats , African clawed frogs do not appear to be suffering from the herbicide .
" Atrazine has been used widely in South Africa for the past 45 years and our studies showed that Xenopus are doing equally fine in agricultural and nonagricultural areas , " says zoologist Louis du Preez of North - West University in South Africa .
" If atrazine had these adverse effects on Xenopus in the wild , surely we would have picked it up by now . "
Nevertheless , the countries of the European Union have banned atrazine because of its ability to contaminate water .
" I personally prefer our European habit to use the precautionary principle concerning environmental chemicals to phase out persistent compounds , " Kloas says .
And Rohr 's research has found that atrazine could exert indirect effects :
At levels found in water throughout the U.S. , it increases northern leopard frogs ' susceptibility to potentially deadly parasites .
Herbicides like atrazine are now found in 57 percent of U.S. streams , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
The EPA , for its part , announced yet another review of the herbicide last October because of human health concerns , after declaring the chemical treatment safe in 2006 .
Ultimately , atrazine may be silencing the amphibian calls of the wild : " It leads to them not croaking , " Hayes says , noting that atrazine may be contributing to the global decline in amphibians , along with chytrid fungus .
" Atrazine increases aromatase and / or estrogen production in zebra fish , goldfish , caimans , alligators , turtles , quail and rats .
So this is not just a frog problem . "

PlayStation 3 owners have been dying to get a chance to play Valve 's zombie franchise Left 4 Dead for some time .
But now it looks like there 's reason to start holding out hope .
While the studio has had harsh things to say about Sony 's console in the past , Valve appears to be finally be warming up to the idea of developing for it .
Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek recently told Edge the developer has been cautious with its approach to supporting the platform , but said he believes it 'll happen eventually .
" Before we do anything on the PS3 we need to be able to support it in the right way , " said Faliszek .
" But we 'll look at it , and I 'm sure down the road we 'll do it .
" The PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box , released in 2007 , was outsourced to Electronic Arts while the Xbox 360 and PC versions were done internally at Valve 's studio in Bellevue , Washington .
We contacted Valve for additional comments and will update this story if we hear back .

Investors should start readying themselves for some strong gains in the labor market .
Why ?
It ’s because both data and anecdotal evidence point in that direction , at least for a while .
“ We are going to be hiring this year , ” said Joe Brusuelas , of Stanford - based economic research firm Brusuelas Analytics .
He pegs the likely gain in payrolls at around 225,000 for March , up from a loss of 36,000 in February .
Here ’s the evidence :
In the first place , the government has started hiring large numbers of temporary workers for the census .
That number should peak at around 635,000 in May , according to the Commerce Department .
The jobs will be temporary , but they are still jobs and that will likely mean increased spending in the economy and hence likely more hiring .
Even without the census - related boost , Brusuelas said the private sector should add about 50,000 permanent jobs a month if the economy stays on its current trend .
That trend - growth rate should edge higher towards the end of the year , with even more jobs being added each month , he said .
Add to that further evidence hidden deep with other data series .
Even though the Institute for Supply Management ‘s Manufacturing Index , which tracks growth in the factory sector , slowed in February , the sub - index for employment was more bullish , showing three months of steady increases .
The employment sub -index within ISM ’s Services Index , which tracks the non-manufacturing economy , also showed consistent gains over the same period .
The two ISM data points augur improved hiring going forward .
Anecdotally , I ’ve seen evidence of a more vibrant job market .
Here in New York City , there has been a dramatic decline in service quality at some of the local lunch spots .
That is typically a sign that it ’s becoming harder for companies either to get quality workers and / or appropriately trained managers .
In addition , not only are there now help - wanted signs in store fronts , but there is also some rather frenetic activity among headhunters .
Both things were absent eight months ago .
On the cautious side , Charlotte - based Wells Fargo economist Adam York said the U.S. will need to see first - time unemployment insurance claims dip into the range of around 380,000 to 420,000 before the overall unemployment rate can be expected to drop significantly .
Initial jobless claims today fell 14,000 but at 442,000 still are at an elevated level .
Even so , do n’t be surprised to see some shockingly large jumps in payrolls at the end of next week and beyond .
The real question is :
How long will the hiring boom last ?
Soviets Planned to Accept JFK�s Joint Lunar Mission Offer
by Frank Sietzen " SpaceCast News Service "
Washington DC - October 2 , 1997 - Soviet Premiere Nikita S. Khrushchev reversed himself in early November , 1963 and had at the time , decided to accept U.S. President John F. Kennedy 's offer to convert the Apollo lunar landing program into a joint project to explore the Moon with Soviet and U.S. astronauts , SpaceCast learned Wednesday from one of the last remaining participants in the decision still alive .
On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the world 's first space satellite , the Soviet Sputnik 1 , Sergei Khrushchev , eldest son of the former Premiere and Soviet Union Communist Party General Secretary said that his father made the decision in November 1963 following a renewed Kennedy initiative to sell the Soviets on a joint manned lunar program .
" My father decided that maybe he should accept ( Kennedy's ) offer , given the state of the space programs of the two countries ( in 1963 ) " , Khrushchev told SpaceCast following a talk before a NASA conference in Washington on the effects of the historic Sputnik launch on Oct. 4 , 1957 .
Sputnik was the world 's first artificial satellite of the Earth , and its autumn 1957 launch into orbit is widely credited with starting the superpower space race that lasted until the end of the Cold War in 1991 .
Kennedy had made the offer of a joint manned lunar program to the Russians on several occasions , but his most aggressive effort was made in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 20 , 1963 in New York .
At the end of that address , Kennedy said : " In a field where the United States and the Soviet Union have a special capacity - space - there is room for new cooperation , for further joint efforts . "
" I include among these possibilities , " he added , " a joint expedition to the Moon . "
Why , the President asked , should the United States and the Soviet Union conduct parallel efforts that would include " duplication , of research , construction , and expenditure ? "
He laid out a proposal for a joint series of space missions , which if enacted , he said " will require a new approach to the Cold War . "
But like his earlier proposals to the Russians on joint manned spaceflight , this one also was rejected by the Khrushchev government .
But Sergei Khrushchev told SpaceCast , that in the weeks after the rejection , his father had second thoughts .
While the Premiere had agreed with Russian military leaders that said any joint Moon flight would provide an opportunity for the U.S. military to learn more about Russian rocket and missile programs , he now thought that it might be possible to learn more from the technology of the Americans .
" He thought that if the Americans wanted to get our technology and create defenses against it , they would do that anyway .
Maybe we could get ( technology ) in the bargain that would be better for us , my father thought . "
In late 1963 , the Russian government was still designing their lunar launch vehicle , the N - 1 , and their manned spacecraft system , the Soyuz .
Ultimately , the N - 1 was abandoned following repeated launch failures .
The Soviet manned lunar program would also be abandoned in the early 1970 's following the U.S. landings in the Apollo program .
The Soyuz was developed , however and became the spacecraft used in Russian space station programs , from the early 1970 's right on through to today 's MIR station .
Sergei Khrushchev also said his father viewed the prospects of new western cooperation linked with plans to cut back on the Russian Army size from its level of 2.5 million men in 1963 to possibly as low as 500,000 conscripts .
And Khrushchev was also planning to begin diverting weapons complex design bureaus into more consumer and commercial , non-military production , a process started by the Yeltsin government that is still evolving in today 's Russia .
If these newest revelations are correct , the prospects of a visit to the Soviet Union by President Kennedy during the 1964 Presidential campaign , suggested by several former Kennedy administration staffers or a visit to Russia early in a Kennedy second term might well have cemented the joint lunar plan .
And such a Kennedy / Khrushchev initiative might have staved off the planning of a coup that eventually removed Khrushchev from office in October , 1964 .
" I think , " Sergei Khrushchev said , " if Kennedy had lived , we would be living in a completely different world . "
But a week after the reversal decision was allegedly made , Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas , Texas and the decision was dropped .
Although the Johnson administration made a similar offer for joint manned spaceflights early in 1964 , the Russians were too suspicious of the new administration , some analysts have suggested .
And , Khrushchev said , much of the rationale for the acceptance of the joint mission plan was the " chemistry " built up between his father and John F. Kennedy , who had clashed repeatedly with the Soviet leader during the previous two years but seemed to be moving towards a new relationship and foreign policy following the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and Kennedy 's speech before American University in the summer of 1963 , proposing new U.S. - Soviet cooperation and a joint Nuclear Test Ban Treaty .
The Soviet government viewed the Kennedy initiative started at American University as a major turning point in U.S. - Soviet relations during the Kennedy Presidency .
Analysts , however , must be cautious about Khrushchev 's new information .
Both the Soviet Politburo and the U.S. Congress would have had to approve the bold plan , which would have abruptly ended the space competition started in 1957 , and opened the U.S. space industry to direct Russian involvement , a radical idea in the 1960's Cold War environment .
Some have also suggested that , given the political atmosphere of the time , the U.S. Congress of 1963 / 64 would not have looked too favorably on dropping a space program sold primarily as " beating the Russians to the Moon " for one that would , in essence , bring them along on a spacecraft and booster paid for by the U.S. taxpayer .
But Kennedy fretted over the cost of the Apollo program almost literally until the day he died .
A joint plan would have preserved the project while reducing the cost , further shifting its rationale onto foreign relations and superpower stability - goals now identified with the current US - Russian space partnership and a reason often given today for continuing the program .
And had the President lived to conduct a 1964 campaign , U.S. - Soviet cooperation following years of tension may well have been a central element to the foreign policy espoused during that election effort .
The available documentary evidence suggests that Kennedy was moving towards a new cooperative relationship with the Soviet government that he hoped to expand following a reelection in 1964 .
But history will never know what possibilities existed in the space program that was not to be , in what Sergei Khrushchev called " those wonderful golden years " now long passed into the mists of history .

Going about their day - to - day business , bees have no need to be able to recognise human faces .
Yet in 2005 , when Adrian Dyer from Monash University trained the fascinating insects to associate pictures of human faces with tasty sugar snacks , they seemed to be able to do just that .
But Martin Giurfa from the Université de Toulouse , France , suspected that that the bees were n't learning to recognise people .
" Because the insects were rewarded with a drop of sugar when they chose human photographs , what they really saw were strange flowers .
The important question was what strategy do they use to discriminate between faces , " explains Giurfa .
Wondering whether the insects might be learning the relative arrangement ( configuration ) of features on a face , Giurfa contacted Dyer and suggested that they go about systematically testing which features a bee learned to recognise to keep them returning to Dyer 's face photos .
The team publish their discovery that bees can learn to recognise the arrangement of human facial features on 29 January 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Biology at http://jeb.biologists.org.
Teaming up with Aurore Avargues - Weber , the team first tested whether the bees could learn to distinguish between simple face - like images .
Using faces that were made up of two dots for eyes , a short vertical dash for a nose and a longer horizontal line for a mouth , Avargues - Weber trained individual bees to distinguish between a face where the features were cramped together and another where the features were set apart .
Having trained the bee to visit one of the two faces by rewarding it with a weak sugar solution , she tested whether it recognised the pattern by taking away the sugar reward and waiting to see if the bee returned to the correct face .
It did .
So the bees could learn to distinguish patterns that were organised like faces , but could they learn to " categorize " faces ?
Could the insects be trained to classify patterns as face - like versus non-face like , and could they decide that an image that they had not seen before belonged to one class or the other ?
To answer these questions , Avargues - Weber trained the bees by showing them five pairs of different images , where one image was always a face and the other a pattern of dots and dashes .
Bees were always rewarded with sugar when they visited the face while nothing was offered by the non-face pattern .
Having trained the bees that ' face - like ' images gave them a reward , she showed the bees a completely fresh pair of images that they had not seen before to see if the bees could pick out the face - like picture .
Remarkably they did .
The bees were able to learn the face images , not because they know what a face is but because they had learned the relative arrangement and order of the features .
But how robust was the bees ' ability to process the " face 's " visual information ?
How would the bees cope with more complex faces ?
This time the team embedded the stick and dot faces in face - shaped photographs .
Would the bees be able to learn the arrangements of the features against the backgrounds yet recognise the same stick and dot face when the face photo was removed ?
Amazingly the insects did , and when the team tried scrambling real faces by moving the relative positions of the eyes , nose and mouth , the bees no longer recognised the images as faces and treated them like unknown patterns .
So bees do seem to be able to recognise face - like patterns , but this does not mean that they can learn to recognise individual humans .
They learn the relative arrangements of features that happen to make up a face - like pattern and they may use this strategy to learn about and recognize different objects in their environment .
What is really amazing is that an insect with a microdot - sized brain can handle this type of image analysis when we have entire regions of brain dedicated to the problem .
Giurfa explains that if we want to design automatic facial recognition systems , we could learn a lot by using the bees ' approach to face recognition .
Mr Obama declined to meet the Dalai Lama last year US President Barack Obama intends to go ahead with plans to meet the Dalai Lama despite warnings from China not to , a White House spokesman has said .
Mr Obama told China 's leaders last year in Beijing that he would meet with the Tibetan spiritual leader , White House spokesman Bill Burton said .
China has warned that ties with the US would be undermined if the meeting takes place .
No date has been set but it is expected to take place later this month .
" The president told China 's leaders during his trip last year that he would meet with the Dalai Lama and he intends to do so , " White House spokesman Bill Burton told reporters .
" The Dalai Lama is an internationally respected religious and cultural leader and the president will meet with him in that capacity , " he said .
The comments came after Communist Party official Zhu Weiqun said such a meeting would " threaten trust and co-operation " between Beijing and Washington .
' Tibetan separatist '
Relations between the world 's largest and third - largest economies have already been strained by trade disputes , US arms sales to Taiwan and a row over internet censorship .
US - CHINA TENSIONS
Google - China denies being behind an alleged cyber attack on the US search engine Taiwan - a US sale of $ 6.4bn ( £ 4bn ) of defensive arms to Taiwan has angered Beijing Tibet - China says a US meeting with the Dalai Lama would " undermine relations "
Trade - rows over imports and exports of meat , media , car tyres and raw materials Iran - the US fears China will not back tougher sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme Climate - the US is disappointed at China 's tough position at the Copenhagen Summit
Relations hit a bad patch The US - China power balance Send us your comments China , which took over Tibet in 1950 , considers the Dalai Lama a separatist and tries to isolate the spiritual leader by asking foreign leaders not to see him .
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule and has been living in India since then .
Mr Obama declined to see the Dalai Lama last year when he visited the US , saying he would meet him later .
A White House spokesman said last month that the two men intended to meet when the Tibetan monk visited Washington later in February .
" If the US leader chooses to meet with the Dalai Lama at this time , it will certainly threaten trust and co-operation between China and the United States , " said Mr Zhu , executive deputy minister of the Chinese Communist Party 's United Front Work Department .
" We oppose any attempt by foreign forces to interfere in China 's internal affairs using the Dalai Lama as an excuse , " he said .
Mr Zhu was speaking at a press conference to discuss the recent five - day visit to China by the Dalai Lama 's representatives .
The Tibetans repeated their hopes for greater autonomy for the Himalayan region , but Mr Zhu said there was no possibility of the " slightest compromise " on the issue of sovereignty in Tibet .
The two sides have held a number of meetings on Tibet 's status since 2002 .

We all know that John Mayer is a giant loser , but he still can't seem to keep his mouth in check ( especially in a recent Playboy interview ) , and eventually someone is going to try and wash it out with a bag of Summer 's Eve .
It 's not only us , other girls ( Taylor Swift , ahem ) also view him as the ultimate jerk .
Sure , his love songs are beautiful , but does that make up for the fact that he is a jerk in almost ever other area of life ?
No .
After you read these terrible , annoying , sometimes even racially insensitive quotes , you 'll want to punch the guy right in his stupid singing face .

This still photo taken from a SpaceX video shows the full - duration orbit insertion test firing of the Falcon 9 rocket 's second stage , conducted on January 2 , 2010 in McGregor , Texas .
A brand - newFalcon 9 rocket envisioned to launch commercial cargo ships to the International Space Station has passed its final engine test , clearing the wayfor its maiden flight in the next few months .
Built bySpace Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) of Hawthorne , Calif. , the Falcon 9rocket is a two - stage booster designed to launch the company ?s Dragonspacecraft to orbit .
It is the lynchpin rocket behind SpaceX?s plan to launchcargo ships to the space station under a $ 1.6 billion contract with NASA .
SpaceXannounced this week that the Falcon 9 rocket ?s second stage successfullycompleted a full - duration test firing at the company ?s proving grounds inTexas .
The test was the last hurdle for the upcoming demonstration launch , which is targeted to lift off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida .
? This wasthe final stage firing required for launch , so the second stage will soon bepackaged for shipment and should arrive at Cape Canaveral by the end of themonth , ? said SpaceX founder Elon Musk in a Jan. 4 update .
?

When Americans think of Canada , they generally envision a mash - up of hockey , poutine , Celine Dion , and universal health care .
But now another Canadian feature is getting top billing : its uniquely sound banking system -- the soundest in the world according to the World Economic Forum .
As president of the G8 this year , Canada will host the G8 and G20 Summits in June .
Speaking at Davos , Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced his intention to encourage fellow countries to follow Canada 's lead in adopting strong , transparent -- but " not excessive " -- regulation .
Canada is the only G8 country that has not had to bail out its financial sector .
Its mortgage default rate is 90 percent below America's , with no significant difference in the percentage of home ownership .
It also has a history of strong - handed financial regulation that depends upon cooperation between banks and the government .
In a tongue - in - cheek look at " what went right in Canada , " the Financial Times ' Chrystia Freeland summarizes this regulatory approach as " lots of quality capital , limits on leverage and a simple and co-ordinated regulatory system that forces bank bosses to take personal responsibility for managing risk . "
Though this ethos was decidedly against the grain during the free - market fury of the past two decades -- " even communist China accused Canadians of being too cautious about capitalism , " Freeland notes -- it is now looking uncannily prescient , if a bit boring .

The amazing thing about this font is that it is actually legible at 3 pixels high .
Another Tiny Font
In the midst of the discussion on the Typophile blog post ( and there are some very long and convoluted discussions going on there ) , it emerged that there was another subpixel font already on the scene .
It was designed by Ken Perlin and you can see it at actual size below .
That ’s the first five hundred words of the American Declaration of Independence in that little box .
Why did he make this font ?
“ My goal was to have something that is clearly readable , yet can fit an entire page of text onto a QVGA ( 320×240 ) screen ( eg : an Apple IPod or T - Mobile SideKick ) .
In contrast , I ’ve noticed that Microsoft ’s smallest screen fonts are unreadable , whereas their smallest readable screen fonts are way bigger than necessary . “
At the time of writing , neither font is available for download but I think they ’re interesting to look at and I imagine that Miha will eventually make his tiny three pixel high font available when he ’s finished experimenting .
What do you think of these fonts ?
When they become available for download should they come with a free pair of jam - jar glasses ?
Is there a serious application for these fonts or are they simply a curiosity ?
Evocative and provocative , a game born of the anxiety about George W. Bush 's polices abroad would have included a Chinese invasion of the U.S. and the emotional journey of a soldier struggling over whether to flee military service .

But the game was killed , not by politics but the popularity of the other game that developer David Jaffe was working on .
During our weekly Kotaku Talk Radio podcast , special guest Jaffe spoke at length about his canceled PSP game , Heartland .
Read about how the game came to life , how it died , and the game developer that rose from its ashes .

Following the release of God of War for the PlayStation 2 , David Jaffe was eager to create another story - based game .
It was this desire that gave birth to Heartland , a first - person shooter for the PlayStation Portable that he hoped would make players weep openly .

" Heartland was a very liberal response to the Bush administration and the Iraq War .
What I really wanted to do was to create a first - person shooter on the PSP that really tried to evoke emotions beyond the traditional emotions you get in a first - person shooter – you know , adrenalin and competition .
I wanted to also evoke fear and sadness .
" It was basically an invasion of the United States by a greater military power and you basically played a reserve guy who was trying to get back to his family .
It was really sort of my attempt at speaking through video games about George Bush the second and the war and all that stuff .
That 's what Heartland was . "

Jaffe spoke of the game in relatively simple terms , but his vision for the title was much more powerful .
In a lengthy article about the title posted at The Escapist in 2008 , David spoke at length about the game 's Chinese invasion of the states , which would explore the brutal reaction American 's would have to an invasion by foreign powers .
In one planned scene , the player would be ordered to set fire to a Chinese American family , herded into their home and doused with gasoline .
Advertisement
It would 've been an extremely provocative title .
Unfortunately , that 's exactly the sort of game Jaffe 's development team was n't used to working on .
" Scott Campbell and I –- my business partner and co-designer with Eat Sleep Play — are very similar in some areas .
We like arcade -y stuff , we like action stuff , we like pick up and play stuff .
I tend to also like the more arty - farty , storytelling , you know , really trying to push the medium in that direction .
I think it was just a bad marriage when it came to that particular design .
Advertisement
" I think they felt , ' This is n't the kind of game we like to make . '
If you look at some of the great games they made on their own – Downhill Domination , War of the Monsters – those are games that really speak to the kind of company we are now and the kind of games that they 've made . "
It was n't simply developmental differences that caused the downfall of Heartland .
The team had gone as far as creating the basis for an engine for the PSP first - person shooter , before Sony started stealing team members to work on a " more important " project .
Advertisement
" What happened was Scott would always call and say , you know we probably started with a team of about 20 , and every couple of days he 's like ' You know this guy got Warhawked .
This guy got Warhawked . '
Basically Warhawk was in production at the studio at same time , and it obviously was a much bigger game from a standpoint of Sony 's agenda and lineup .
It was a much more important title , because it was originally meant to be a launch title for the PS3 , so we would keep losing members of our team to go over to help finish up Warhawk . "
Stranded in Santa Monica with a dwindling team with no passion for a portable story - based first - person shooter filled with controversial themes , Jaffe and company found inspiration in the Xbox Live Arcade .
Advertisement
" By the end we were down to a skeleton crew of about six guys , and we were just like ' You know what ?
This is stupid .
What are we doing ? '
That 's when we started looking at XBLA and saying ' Hey , there 's this thing called Geometry Wars .
There 's this option out there to start doing games like that . '
And that kinda gave rise to how we started Eat Sleep Play .
" So it all kind of led to where we are now , and that 's what happened to Heartland . "
Advertisement
So that 's the beginning of Eat Sleep Play , the studio that 's produced Calling All Cars for the PlayStation Network and is rumored to be working on the next Twisted Metal , but is that the end of Heartland ?
Could it see the light of day once more , perhaps , as Crecente suggested during the podcast , as an episodic title ?
Perhaps , but not at Eat Sleep Play .
" To go in and try to say to Scott , ' Hey man , we gotta make this kind of game ' is kinda like somebody coming to me and saying , ' Jaffe , we need to do this football arcade game . '
I mean , arcade games I do , but football simulation , I 'm like ' Dude , it 's just not my thing . '
Advertisement
" So maybe one day , but I certainly do n't think it 's going to happen with Eat Sleep Play . "
It 's disappointing that Heartland was n't made .
The title had so much potential , exploring themes that many Americans either can't or wo n't ponder .
If we were invaded , would we react any differently than the citizens and soldiers of Iraq ?
It 's a question we 'll hopefully never find the answer to , but exploring it hypothetically could lead to a better understanding of ourselves .

The Martins live in a quiet Brooklyn neighbourhood
New York 's police chief has delivered a cheesecake to an elderly couple in Brooklyn , to apologise for dozens of mistaken police visits to their home .
A computer glitch had led officers to Walter and Rose Martin 's home 50 times in the past eight years , police said .
The latest intrusion came on Tuesday , with officers pounding on the front and back doors , shouting " Police , open up ! "
Thursday 's visit - cheesecake in hand - went well .
The Martins , aged 82 and 83 , shared pictures of their grandchildren .
New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly visited the couple 's modest home on Friday to " apologise and explain " for the mix - up , NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told the Associated Press .
The problem started in 2002 , when the Martin 's home address was used as " test data " for a new computer crime - tracking system .
The couple complained about the harrowing visits in 2007 , but the data remained in the system despite efforts to " purge the records " , Deputy Commissioner Browne said .
He added that the Martin 's address had now been flagged with alerts " barring officers " from questioning the octogenarians .
How do I reconcile this ?
Social butterflies who shine at parties may get their edge from special genes that make them experts at recognizing faces .
Scientists have found the strongest evidence to date that genes govern how well we keep track of who 's who .
The findings suggest that face - recognition and other cognitive skills may be separate from each other , and independent of general intelligence .
This could help explain what makes one person good at math but bad at music , or good at spatial navigation but bad at language
" People have wondered for a long time what makes one person cognitively different from another person , " said cognitive psychologist Nancy Kanwisher of MIT , coauthor of the study published Jan. 7 in Current Biology .
" Our study is one tiny piece of the answer to this question . "
The ability to recognize faces is not just handy for cocktail parties , it 's crucial for distinguishing friend from foe and facilitating social interactions .
If face recognition increases our ability to fend off predators and find mates , there is an evolutionary drive to encode this ability in our genes .
To test this , Kanwisher 's team looked at whether the ability to recognize faces runs in the family .
They found that identical twins , who share 100 percent of their genes , were more similar in their face - recognition ability than fraternal twins , who share only 50 percent of their genes .
This suggests the ability to recognize faces is heritable .
" This is the strongest evidence for a role of genes in face recognition abilities in humans , " Kanwisher said .
Some scientists have proposed that IQ is a general factor :
You are either smart at all mental abilities or weak across mental abilities .
Others have suggested that each mental ability has its own separate hardware in the brain .
The current results show that the latter is true , at least for face recognition .
" There ’s an ongoing debate about whether the brain is divided into separate pieces that do completely independent things , or whether it's a general - purpose device , " said psychologist Gary Marcus of New York University , who was not involved in the study .
" This is some of the best evidence that genes could target a particular aspect of the mind . "
It 's unclear how the genes affect recognition , Kanwisher said .
One option is that they determine how well you measure distances between the eyes and mouth .
Another possibility is that the genes may make you more extroverted , and spending more time with people helps you get better at recognizing faces .
" We just ca n't tell which is true , " Kanwisher said .
" Our study shows that genes exert a specific influence on face - recognition ability , but it does n't tell us which genes are involved , or how exactly they shape the relevant neural circuits . "
Though the new findings suggest that additional cognitive skills could be rooted in an independent set of genes as well , it may not be true for abilities .
Language , for instance , evolved much later than face perception .
" This may mean that language depends less on genes that evolved specifically for language , and that it 's less separable from other aspects of the mind , " Marcus said .
Kanwisher and the study 's senior author , Jia Liu of Beijing Normal University , are planning future studies to examine the role of genes in language , spatial ability , math and a range of cognitive abilities .

“ Some commentators have proposed ‘ science fiction ’ as the last fictional repository for theological speculation , ” wrote Margaret Atwood a few years ago .
“ Heaven , Hell , and aerial transport by means of wings having been more or less abandoned after Milton , outer space was the only remaining neighborhood where beings resembling gods , angels , and demons might still be found . ”
( Read Margaret Atwood ’s literary history of sci fi here . )
Caprica , the new sci fi TV series in the Battlestar Galactica lineage , is the latest brilliant playground of ethics , theology , and social gumbo on the small screen .
After watching the first few episodes , I can confirm that I ’m definitely a Capriphile or a Caprichaun or a Capricaner or whatever Caprica fans end up calling ourselves .
Apparently , I ’m not alone .
Over at Religion Dispatches , commentators Diane Winston , Anthea Butler , Salman Hameed , and Henry Jenkins are blogging on each Caprica episode under a series titled Capricology .
The mix of commentators is great in itself .
Winston holds the Knight Chair in Media and Religion .
Butler is an associate professor of religion at the University of Pennsylvania .
Halmeed is an astronomer who also writes about Muslims and science .
Jenkins is the Provost ’s Professor of Communication , Journalism , and Cinematic Arts at USC .
They ’re covering the cultural intersection of science and religion as well as the interwoven commentary on the body , artificial intelligence , paganism , original sin , immigration , and race .
Here are some excerpts from their posts on Caprica ‘s first episode :
Whereas most TV dramas are good guys versus bad guys , BSG and Caprica probe the passions that enliven us .
The pull of temptation , the cost of obsession , the slog to redemption ( yes , yes , and yes ) and then the biggest question of all :
Do you need to be a carbon - based life form to own and feel these ?
Teetering between “ must - see TV ” and bloated soap opera , BSG worked because the melodrama was grounded in the quotidian : model ships , dog tags , and toothbrushes .
Now with all the imaginable artifacts that could draw us into Caprica ’s odd collision of machines , mobsters , and monotheists , a newspaper — with ball scores , stock prices , and local weather makes it all so mundane , masking ( as our own newspapers tend to do ) the real stakes behind the stories .
–Diane Winston
I was most taken though by the plight of Adama ’s daughter , who is brought back from the dead not through an act of self - creation but against her will ; who is inserted into an empty world , a purgatory space , which she does n’t recognize and understand , and is abandoned there , treated as an unnatural abomination , as a monster , by her own father and forgotten by the man who created her .
( Shades of Frankenstein , but also some suggestions here of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , the series Jane Espenson worked for before Caprica , where Buffy ’s friends bring her back from the dead , like Lazarus , and she finds herself experiencing deep pain and trauma at being ripped from paradise and plunged back into our imperfect world .
In fact , Espenson wrote “ After Life , ” a key episode in the exploration of this theme in Buffy .
I hope the series will explore more fully what happens to this girl and how her experiences differ from Zoe’s . )

A brief report from the European Commission authored by Pedro Velasco Martins ( an EU negotiator ) on the most recent round of ACTA negotiations in Guadalajara , Mexico has leaked , providing new information on the substance of the talks , how countries are addressing the transparency concerns , and plans for future negotiations .
The document ( cover page , document ) notes that the Mexico talks were a " long meeting with detailed technical discussions , which allowed progress , but parties not yet ready for major concessions .
Due to lack of time , internet discussions could not be concluded . "
Start first with plans for future talks .
Round 8 of the ACTA negotiations , which will be held in Wellington , New Zealand , are apparently now scheduled for April 12 to 16th .
Countries plan a five - day round – the longest yet – with detailed discussions on the Internet provisions , civil enforcement , border measures , and penal provisions .
Moreover , Round 9 will take place in Geneva , possibly during the week of June 7th .
This aggressive negotiation schedule – three rounds of talks in six months – points to the pressure to conclude ACTA in 2010 .
Secondly , transparency .
The leaked document reveals that the summary document on ACTA is currently being updated by Canada and Switzerland , with release likely in March .
The new document will deny rumours about iPod searching border guards and mandatory three strikes policies .
There is no agreement about releasing the ACTA text , however ( though more European Union members states favour its release ) .
New Zealand is considering a stakeholder meeting during the next round in April as part of the transparency effort .
Third , the substance of the talks .
The three main areas of substantive discussion were civil enforcement , border measures ( called customs by the EC ) , and the Internet provisions .
The Commission document states :
1 . The civil enforcement chapter was discussed very thoroughly .
It was possible to agree additional language , but when entering into the detail of the different mechanisms ( provisional measures , injunctions , calculation of damages ) progress became slow due to the different technical concepts of each legal system .
2 . The customs chapter was discussed in detail for the first time in more than one year .
Good progress on items like exemptions for personal luggage ( a sensitive issue in the public opinion ) .
EU proposing a more organised and logical structure of the chapter , not always well understood by others .
3 . The internet chapter was discussed for the first time on the basis of comments provided by most parties to US proposal .
The second half of the text ( technological protection measures ) was not discussed due to lack of time .
Discussions still focus on clarification of different technical concepts , therefore , there was not much progress in terms of common text .
US and EU agreed to make presentations of their own systems at the next round , to clarify issues .
Leaving aside the more personal comments ( ie. others do not understand the border measures chapter structure ) , the leaked document is precisely what the negotiating countries should be providing to the public in the absence of an actual text .
Rather than the mundane meeting statement that says nothing , this brief report includes far more detail on the substance of the talks and the plans for the future .
Hugo Chávez may be wondering , as Venezuela 's taps run dry and its cities fall into darkness , whether God is on the side of the Yankees .
The El Niño weather phenomenon appears to be taking sides as it parches leftist - ruled parts of South America and brings bounty to US farmers and corporations .
One of the severest droughts in decades has given Venezuela 's socialist president a political nightmare as hydro- electrical power dribbles to a standstill , unleashing blackouts , rationing and protests .
The waters behind the Guri dam , which supplies more than half the nation 's power , have touched perilously low levels .
Chávez has declared an " electricity emergency " , urging people to spend no more than three minutes in the shower .
The president has even dispatched Cuban pilots to seed clouds for rain .
The state oil company Edelca has aimed higher : it summoned workers to a prayer meeting entitled " Clamour to God for the National Electricity Sector " .
The crisis has extended to Paraguay , where another leftist leader , Fernando Lugo , ordered the presidential palace lights switched off .
In Argentina and Brazil – also with leftist governments – torrential rain and high temperatures have blighted crops with insect and fungi attacks .
A suspicious soul could ask whether El Niño , a Pacific weather system that influences climate worldwide , is on Washington 's payroll .
Monsanto and Dow Chemical are enjoying booming pesticide and fungicide sales in Argentina as farmers battle to save soy harvests .
But in the US Midwest , farmers expect record corn and soy crops .
Venezuela 's economy is expected to shrivel as factories close and shops and offices reduce working hours .
" It 's a true emergency , " said Chávez .
With his popularity falling , he has fired the electricity minister and brought in foreign experts .
Chávez blames El Niño and climate change .
Critics blame the Marxist commandante for not investing enough in power plants during his decade - old revolution .
Whether there will be another decade of Chávez could depend on rain .

The Soil and Health
Albert Howard
An Agricultural Testament by Sir Albert Howard , Oxford University Press , 1940 .
This is the book that started the organic farming and gardening revolution , the result of Howard 's 25 years of research at Indore in India .
The essence of organics is brilliantly encapsulated in the Introduction , which begins : " The maintenance of the fertility of the soil is the first condition of any permanent system of agriculture . "
Read on !
Full explanation of the Indore composting process and its application .
Excellent on the relationship between soil , food and health .

A review of the work of the founder of the organic farming movement , Sir Albert Howard , by Keith Addison : " I 'll never finish reading this book -- I 've read it through three times and referred to it scores of times , and each time I learn something new .
Meanwhile I 've read Howard 's other books , and a lot of his papers and essays , and a great deal besides .
I 've talked to many other people , seen many other organics projects , farms and gardens in many different areas ; I 've used these techniques myself in a variety of settings , and it all confirms Howard 's thesis .
I still see it mostly in the Third World development context .
To me organic farming is THE basic appropriate technology for rural areas .
It 's the best place to start -- get this right and so many of the other problems will simply vanish . "
Includes a short bibliography and links to Howard 's major works and many of his published papers .
The Waste Products of Agriculture -- Their Utilization as Humus by Albert Howard and Yeshwant D. Wad , Oxford University Press , London , 1931
Where Howard 's " An Agricultural Testament " charts a new path for sustainable agriculture , this previous book describes how the Indore composting system which was the foundation of the new movement was developed , and why .
Howard 's most important scientific publication .

Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease ( The Soil and Health ) by Sir Albert Howard , Faber and Faber , London , 1945 , Devin - Adair 1947 , Schocken 1972
This is Howard 's follow - up to An Agricultural Testament , extending its themes and serving as a guide to the new organic farming movement as it unfolded -- and encountered opposition from the chemical farming lobby and the type of agricultural scientists Howard referred to as " laboratory hermits " .
Together , the two books provide a clear understanding of what health is and how it works .

The Earth 's Green Carpet by Louise E. Howard , Faber and Faber , 1947
In this unusually clear book , Lady Howard ( Sir Albert Howard 's wife ) , has written a " layman 's introduction " which is also a work of literary distinction .
Her subject is nothing less than the life cycle studied as a whole , and this leads inevitably to the importance of a reformed agriculture for the health of the community .
She saw the need for a popular introduction to her husband 's revolutionary ideas and principles , and her book draws a vivid picture of what lies behind the appearance of the Earth 's green carpet .
" Nature is not concerned to give us simple lessons , " Lady Howard says -- and yet she transmits them here with admirable simplicity and clarity , a delight to read .
More than an introduction , the book is a survey of the whole body of work of the pioneers of organic farming and growing .

Sir Albert Howard in India by Louise E. Howard , Faber & Faber , London , 1953 , Rodale 1954
Albert and Gabrielle Howard worked as fellow plant scientists and fellow Imperial Economic Botanists to the Government of India for 25 years , and this is a study of their work by Sir Albert 's second wife Louise ( sister of Gabrielle , who died in 1930 ) .
It 's a classic study of effective Third World development work .
Initially involved with improving crop varieties , the pair soon concluded it was futile to fiddle with seeds unless the work took full account of the system and circumstances as a whole .
Thus developed a sustained interest in putting agricultural research into its right relation with the needs of the people , and a fundamental belief in peasant wisdom .
Results were useful only if they could be translated into peasant practice .
This led to the development of the famous Indore system of composting organic wastes : improved seeds were no use in impoverished soils .
It 's a great story .

Weston A. Price
Nutrition and Physical Degeneration by Weston A. Price , 1939 , Paul B. Hoeber , Inc , New York , London
Weston Price ( 1870 - 1948 ) was truly " the Charles Darwin of nutrition " .
He discovered what health is made of , and proved it beyond any doubt .
In the early 1930s Price travelled more than 100,000 miles to study the diets and health of isolated primitive peoples all over the world , at a time when such communities still existed -- people " who were living in accordance with the tradition of their race and as little affected as might be possible by the influence of the white man " .
What he found makes fascinating reading , turning many of our modern ideas on their heads -- far from living lives that were " nasty , brutish and short " , these people were healthy , vigorous and happy , with few or none of the modern diseases of degeneration .
Then Price compared these communities to other , less isolated groups of the same peoples , exposed to the " trade foods " produced by industrial society ( processed foods grown by synthetic farming methods ) , in the shape of the " white man 's store " .
He found it takes only one generation of eating industrialized food to destroy health and immunity .
But he leaves us with the promise of regeneration -- thwarted health can be recaptured .

G.T. Wrench
The Wheel of Health by G.T. Wrench , Daniel , 1938
Dr. Wrench 's classic exploration of the Hunza , a mountain people renowned for their longevity and vigor .
By approaching the problem of disease from the angle of a study of a perfectly healthy people , Wrench shows that health depends on environmental wholeness , of which a whole diet is the vital factor , and that a whole diet means not only the right sorts of foods , but their right cultivation as well .
An examination of the agricultural technique of the most successful cultivators of East and West shows what an essential part of the wheel of health -- from man to soil , from soil to plant , from plant to man -- is the farmer 's renewal and protection of the soil .

The Restoration of the Peasantries , With especial reference to that of India by G.T. Wrench , Daniel , 1939 .
Argues , in Wrench 's wise and admirable style , that the health -- indeed , the very continuation of our civilization -- depends on the health and prosperity of agricultural producers , and shows how the thrust of finance - based civilization has worked to destroy their very existence .
A fascinating look at how villages work -- and how they 're reduced to poverty and worse .

Robert McCarrison
Nutrition and Health , by Sir Robert McCarrison -- McCarrison 's Cantor Lectures , to the Royal Society of Arts in 1936 , Faber and Faber , London , 1953 .
After joining the Indian Medical Service in 1901 Robert McCarrison spent his early years in the Northern Frontier region investigating the legendary Hunza tribe , mountain people who lived to a vigorous old age and never got sick .
He discovered why , and proved it in a series of experiments at the Nutrition Research Laboratories at Coonoor in India .
It was the food they ate -- and , just as important , not just what food , but how it was grown .
Unless it was grown in fertile soil , it was not health - giving food .
Most doctors study disease ; McCarrison had the rare opportunity to study health instead , as well as the lack of health among other races in the southern part of India subsisting on a poor diet .
His findings put the fledgling science of nutrition on a whole new footing .
McCarrison 's Cantor Lectures describe his experiments as Director of Nutrition Research in India , the results , and the implications for health and nutrition .

Medical Testament
The Medical Testament published by the 31 doctors of the Cheshire Panel Committee in England on March 22 1939 was a milestone in the development of the infant organic farming movement .
It acknowledged great advances in the realm of cures , but rather the opposite when it came to prevention .
It also explained why this was so , and offered the remedy , plus the proof of it : " A fertile soil means healthy crops , healthy animals and healthy human beings . "

Food & Health in the Scottish Highlands : Four Lectures from a Rural Practice by W.W. Yellowlees , 1985 .
Dr Walter Yellowlees discusses disease in terms of the work of McCarrison , Cleave , Weston Price , Albert Howard and the organic growing movement .
What he finds is " the result of a long chain of events determined by man 's relationship to his land and its crops .
Seldom in the writings of our highly skilled specialists is there a glimmer of the truth that there is a unity in the health of the soil , the health of plants and animals , and of man .
The worship of technology finds little time for a comprehension of nature 's laws , or for the humility to understand that we cannot defy nature without being punished . " ( 17,000 words . )

Making Use of Weeds and Other Pests
Common - Sense Compost Making -- by the Quick Return Method by Maye E. Bruce , Faber & Faber , London , 1946
In the 1930s and 40s , Maye Bruce developed a different way of composting to complement the Indore composting system developed by Sir Albert Howard and the complicated Bio-Dynamic composting methods of the Rudolf Steiner school of organic farming .
Her " Quick Return Compost System " is aimed at gardeners and smallholders -- the majority -- who do n't have access to livestock manure to activate their compost heaps .
Instead , the " Q.R. " system uses a herbal activator which turns vegetable matter alone into high - quality humus in only a few weeks , and with no need to turn the heap .
This activator really works .
Sixty years later it is still being made commercially : you can buy it online , or you can make it yourself , from Stinging Nettle , Yarrow , Dandelion , Camomile , Valerian , Oak Bark and Honey .
Miss Bruce provides the formula and full instructions for preparation and use , and suggests alternatives if any of the six plants is unavailable .

The Pioneering Pig by Norman Blake , Faber & Faber , London , 1956
" Mr Blake claims that where man can make a garden , pigs can make a farm , " says the fly - leaf .
It 's why pigs have snouts 
" Pigs are ideal ploughs , rooting up weeds and turning over the ground , while they manure it at the same time .
They need to have a house and temporary fence to confine them to the area .
As soon as it has been cleared , move the house and fence ready for the next section , " says Country Smallholding Magazine .
" In the building up of fertility , especially on the poor light - land farm , there is no animal more effective than the pig , " says F. Newman Turner in Fertility Farming .

Seaweed and Plant Growth -- from " Seaweed in Agriculture and Horticulture " , by W.A. Stephenson , Faber & Faber , 1968 .
" The whole chapter is packed with eye - opening information .
It looks for instance as though the small quantity of seaweed meal I regularly add to my potting composts may play a part not only in nutrition and even in disease resistance but also in their crumb structure and water - holding capacity .
Not only can these plants provide trace elements , growth substances and protection from diseases for their crops , but the seaweeds are ultimately also a potent source of soil nitrogen .

Alfred W. McCann
This Famishing World by Alfred W. McCann , George H. Doran , New York , 1918
The subtitle says it all : " Food follies that maim and kill the rich and the poor -- that cheat the growing child and rob the prospective mother of health -- that burn up millions in treasure and fill untimely graves -- and the remedy . "
McCann was a journalist and food campaigner , and this is his story of what happens when food is divorced from its nature and function to become a mere industrial commodity .
" Every pound of food juggled , changed , denatured or chemically treated is balanced by a pound of human flesh . "
Now more and more researchers are belatedly questioning the nutritional quality of our food , but most of them still only see a tiny part of the full picture McCann painted 84 years ago , and Price , McCarrison , the Cheshire medical panel , Pottenger , Cleave , Yellowlees and others after him .

Soil and humus
Professor Selman A. Waksman ( 18881973 ) of Rutgers University was the father of soil microbiology .
It was his work in the 1920s and 30s that put the subject on a solid scientific foundation .
Waksman coined the word " antibiotic " , and won a Nobel Prize for the development of streptomycin and other antibiotics from soil actinomycetes .
Sir Albert Howard often refers to Waksman 's work with humus and the soil in " The Waste Products of Agriculture : Their Utilization as Humus " and " An Agricultural Testament " ( see above ) , and indeed Waksman refers to Howard 's work at the Institute of Plant Industry at Indore in India , where Howard developed and refined the Indore composting system which became the foundation of the organic farming movement .
Waksman 's laboratory results confirmed Howard 's on - farm findings and vice versa .
Waksman authored or co-authored more than 400 scientific papers and 28 books .
His three main books on soil microbiology and humus can be downloaded ( below ) as pdf files derived from page images online at Cornell 's Core Historical Literature of Agriculture library : http://chla.library.cornell.edu/
Principles of Soil Microbiology by Selman A. Waksman , Williams & Wilkins , 1927 , 944 pages .
Waksman 's massive work of scholarship was refused by many publishers who thought there was no market for such a book , but it became a best - seller and dominated the field for decades .

Farmers of Forty Centuries -- F.H. King
Sir Albert Howard said F.H. King was " one of the most brilliant of the agricultural investigators of the last generation " , and that King 's book Farmers of Forty Centuries " should be prescribed as a textbook in every agricultural school and college in the world " .
King 's remarkable account of his agricultural investigations in China , Korea and Japan in 1909 was an often - quoted source of inspiration for Howard in his 26 years as an agricultural investigator in India .
King was Professor of Agricultural Physics at the University of Wisconsin until 1901 , and then Chief of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Division of Soil Management until he retired in 1904 .
He was a pioneer in the development of soil physics , which found the purely chemical approach wanting : simply providing chemical nutrients did not solve the problems of crop production .
" The soil is a scene of life , " King wrote , " where altered sunshine maintains an endless cycle of changes , rather than a mere chemical and mechanical mixture . "
King died in 1911 , before he could finish Farmers of Forty Centuries , which is missing its last chapter , " Message of China and Japan to the World " .
However , three years later his widow , Mrs. C.B. King , published more of King 's work in the book Soil Management , with the final chapter " Agriculture of Three Ancient Nations " , which Mrs King had assembled from 10 of King 's lectures and papers , along with much further information on the practices of the Orient in the rest of the book .

Ley Farming
Ley Farming by Sir R. George Stapledon and William Davies , 1948 , Faber & Faber , London .
Sow a piece of land with a good pasture mixture and then divide it in two with a fence .
Graze one half heavily and repeatedly with cattle , mow the other half as necessary and leave the mowings there in place to decay back into the soil .
On the grazed half , you 've removed the crop ( several times ) and taken away a large yield of milk and beef .
On the other half you 've removed nothing .
Plough up both halves and plant a grain crop , or any crop .
Which half has the bigger and better yield ?
The grazed half , by far .
" Ley Farming " explains why " grass is the most important crop " and how to manage grass leys .
Leys are temporary pastures in a rotation , and provide more than enough fertility for the succeeding crops : working together , grass and grazing animals turn the land into a huge living compost pile .
Stapledon draws on the work of Robert H. Elliot of Clifton Park , whose work with deep - rooting leys was the culmination of hundreds of years of development in grass rotation farming .

The master - work of the ley farming rotational grazing system of laying down cropland to grass -- actually a complex mixture of grasses , legumes and deep - rooting herbs ( aka weeds ) .
The rotational grass ley provided beef and dairy produce , as well as enough high - grade soil fertility for a succession of grain and root crops after the grass was ploughed up -- truly sustainable farming .

Fertility Farming by Newman Turner , 1951 , Faber & Faber , London .
One of the seminal books of the organic growing movement .
Working with Sir Albert Howard , founder of the movement , Newman Turner , along with Friend Sykes , Lady Eve Balfour and others , was central to the development of organic farming in the 1940s and 50s .
This is his first book , of three .
Turner did excellent work adapting Robert H. Elliot 's system of ley farming to organic methods .
" This kind of farming restored life to a dying farm ...
The main purpose of my book is to demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of farming by the laws of nature ; and above all to show that it can be done on the poorest of farms , by the poorest of men . "
Turner tells you how to do it .

Thirty Years Farming on the Clifton Park System --
How to supply Humus , Texture , and Fertility by the Aid of Deep - Rooting Grasses by William Lamin , Faber and Faber , 1944 .
" I quite agree with Sir Albert about the compost heap -- but you want the compost heap all over the farm .
The only way to get the humus back to the land is by R. H. Elliot 's mixture of deep - rooting grass for a four years ley ; if you use that , you will have ' millions of men ' working for you while you are asleep , " says Lamin , and what he did with the dry , empty , sandy soil at his farm proved his point .

Ploughman 's Folly , Edward H. Faulkner , Michael Joseph , London , 1945 .
Why do farmers plough ?
In examining this obvious yet seldom - asked question Faulkner laid the foundations for " ploughless farming " .
His views raised considerable interest and a lot of argument .
" It would be a foolish man who stated that Mr. Faulkner 's methods are impracticable and useless , " farmer and writer A.G. Street wrote in The Farmer 's Weekly .
" He definitely challenges that age - old implement , the mould - board plough , and opens up another field for agricultural research ... "
Faulkner 's theories were enthusiastically embraced by the pioneers of organic farming , and especially by ley farmers like Newman Turner .

Earthworms
Friend Earthworm : Practical Application of a Lifetime Study of Habits of the Most Important Animal in the World by George Sheffield Oliver , 1941 .
Dr Oliver was one of the first to harness the earthworm to the needs of the farmer and gardener -- to make highly fertile topsoil for optimum crop growth , and to produce a constant supply of cheap , high - grade , live protein to feed poultry .
He devised simple yet elegant and effective systems to bring costs and labour down and productivity up to help struggling farmers to make ends meet .
Oliver had an observant and critical eye and understood Nature 's round .
His ideas on the nature of modern food and health ( or the lack of it ) are only now being confirmed , half a century later .

The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms with Observations on their Habits by Charles Darwin , 1881 .
A classic of ecology .
" All the fertile areas of this planet have at least once passed through the bodies of earthworms . "
Darwin had a much higher opinion of this book than of his " Origin of Species " , which he had to be persuaded to write .
He experimented with worms for more than 40 years .
This is one of his conclusions , following a most elegant series of experiments : " One alternative alone is left , namely , that worms , although standing low in the scale of organization , possess some degree of intelligence . "
Darwin proved that worms make intelligent choices !
This book is a rare delight .

Mycorrhiza
Trees and Toadstools by M.C. Rayner , D.Sc. , Faber and Faber , 1945 .
Dr Rayner can be credited with putting the mycorrhizal association on the agricultural map .
Mycorrhizas are fungus - roots , a symbiotic relationship between plant roots and friendly soil fungi without which most plants cannot thrive , while many cannot even survive without their fungal partners .
The fungus actually feeds the plant , and in return the plant feeds the fungus the products of the green leaf which the fungus is unable to make for itself .
Enhanced by good humus maintenance and often damaged by chemical fertilizers and pesticides , the mycorrhizal association is fundamental to why organic growing works .

Tree crops
Tree Crops : A Permanent Agriculture by J. Russell Smith , first published 1929 , copyright 1950 , the Devin - Adair Company , ISBN 0-933280-44-0
This is the classic work on tree crops .
Russell Smith was 50 years ahead of his time , writing the basic text on agroforestry long before there was such a thing .
He travelled widely and saw it all coming .
The best book about trees -- it 's inspired generations of environmental activists .
A highly readable blueprint for the development of high - yield tree crops showing that vast , untapped food sources can be harvested from common species of trees .
Smith says agriculture must be " adapted to physical conditions , " that " farming should fit the land . "
He observed worldwide the catastrophe of hill agriculture which he described so accurately as " forest- field - plow - desert . "
" Tree Crops made so much sense to me that I have never been the same since ...
As my work took me all over the world , everywhere I could see it , thanks to Russell Smith : Agriculture in mountainous , rocky , or dry regions is a disaster , but trees are salvation . " -- E. F. Schumacher .

Soil conservation
Conquest of the Land Through Seven Thousand Years by W. C. Lowdermilk , U.S. Department of Agriculture , Soil Conservation Service , 1948 -- First published as USDA Bulletin No. 99 , 1939 .
Dr. Lowdermilk , the assistant director of the newly created United States Soil Erosion Service , wrote this classic report on agriculture and soil erosion in 1939 .
He studied the record of agriculture in countries that have been under cultivation since the earliest recorded times to see what the US could learn to avoid another Dust Bowl .
He discovered that soil erosion , deforestation , overgrazing , neglect , and conflicts between cultivators and herdsmen have helped topple empires and wipe out entire civilizations .
At the same time , he learned that careful stewardship of the earth 's resources , through terracing , crop rotation , and other soil conservation measures , has enabled other societies to flourish for centuries .

The wonderful story of Lem Putt , country carpenter and specialist builder of privies .
Lem actually existed , and Chic Sale knew him , and both lampoons him and respects him as " an artist in his way " .
Sale was an actor and " performed " this story hundreds of times , and by the time he wrote it ( to copyright it in order to stop other actors stealing it ) he had it honed to perfection .
It 's a rare delight .
And it 's more than that : Lem Putt knew his business .
" There 's a lot of fine points to puttin ' up a first - class privy that the average man do n't think about .
It 's no job for an amachoor , take you my word on it .
There 's a whole lot more to it than you can see by just takin ' a few squints at your nabor's . "
This is what a water and sanitation engineer who works in developing countries said about it : " If I could recommend one course book for all wastewater engineers this would be it . "
Not just wastewater engineers -- Lem Putt 's fine points should be everybody 's fine points .

Man and Nature
The Soul of the White Ant by Eugène N. Marais , 1937
Eugène Marais is a forgotten genius .
He was master of a science that had n't yet been invented ; he postulated natural mechanisms and systems that were not identified by mainstream science for another 40 years .
Neither science nor society has yet caught up with many of his findings and conclusions .
As a natural scientist it was the mind of man , the human psyche , that preoccupied Marais .
To unlock the key to its nature it was to nature that he turned , rather than to other humans .
He followed two parallel paths , the study of the animals most like humans , the primates , and the study of creatures that could hardly be more alien to us , termite colonies -- white ants .
In both fields his findings were revolutionary .
He developed a fresh and radically different view of how a termite colony works , and indeed of what a termite colony is , far in advance of any contemporary work .
This is The Soul of the White Ant , and it 's about much more than termites .
A rare gem , and a rare delight to read .

Jean Pain : France 's King of Green Gold -- Frenchman Jean
Pain built a home - made power plant that supplies 100 % of the his energy needs .
The core of the system is a 50 - ton compost mound , three metres high and six across , made of pulverized tree limbs and underbrush .
Buried inside the compost is a 4 - cubic - metre sealed steel tank 3/4 - full of the same compost , producing methane -- bio -gas .
Tubes connect the tank to a pile of 24 truck - tyre inner tubes , the gas reservoir .
Pain uses the gas to cook all the food , fuel a truck and produce electricity , via a methane - fuelled internal combustion engine that turns a generator .
Another tube runs from a well and into the heap , with 200 metres of tubing wound round the tank , the water emerging at 60 deg C at 4 litres a minute , enough for central heating , the bathroom and the kitchen .
The compost heap continues fermenting for nearly 18 months , and then yields 50 tons of natural fertilizer .

Yamaha has finally released full specifications for its new middleweight street sportsbikes , the naked FZ8 - N and semi- faired Fazer8 .
A 779 cc engine derived from the FZ1 donk is the star of the show , with a complete FZ1 frame and swingarm as well .
The new engine makes significantly more torque than the smaller FZ6 for a gruntier , more accessible power curve around town - but builds to a healthy 105 - horsepower top end rush when it 's time to get a boogie on .
It looks like a fun , fast and friendly street sportsbike - and yes , FZ6 fans , it has formally replaced the 600 in the FZ lineup .
As many have suspected , the engine is indeed a scaled - down version of the fuel - injected 1000cc FZ1 engine , dropped to 779 cc by reducing the piston bore , increasing compression , swapping out the pistons , crankshaft and top end .
The resulting motor puts out a touch under 105 horsepower , with 82 Nm of torque .
Yamaha 's new FZ8
Effectively , that top - end horsepower figure does n't seem to be much up on the 90 - odd rear wheel horses offered by the lighter , 600 cc FZ6 donk .
But the stroked - out FZ8 makes its power much earlier in the rev range , a fact which should make it a much more willing and eager powerplant around town and in the majority of real - world riding conditions .
The bad news is that by reducing the FZ1 engine 's bore , the FZ8 does n't manage to shed any engine size or weight .
The good news that comes as a corollary is that the FZ8 is blessed with the wonderful FZ1 frame and swingarm , which do an excellent job of providing rigidity and flex in all the right places .
Yamaha 's new Fazer8
There 's not a lot for gearheads to get excited about elsewhere ; suspension seems fairly basic , adjustable only for rear preload , and the brakes are four - piston monoblock jobs , with the option of adding ABS .
There 's two versions available , just like with the FZ6 and FZ1 platforms - the naked FZ8 - N looks nice and chunky and stylish , and the semifaired Fazer8 looks a little more ...
Practical .
The FZ8 - N weighs 211 kg ready to roll with a full tank of gas , the Fazer8 215 kg - and you can add 5 kg to either if you want the optional ABS .
Yamaha 's new FZ8
Where does the new Fazer fit ?
The FZ8 has clearly been developed to help Yamaha get a foothold in the 750 cc class , which is currently occupied only by Kawasaki's Z750 ( itself a sleeved - down Z1000 ) and Aprilia 's Shiver .
Other key contenders would have to include Ducati's 696 Monster and the excellent Triumph Street Triple 675 .
You have to wonder why Suzuki does n't make a sporty naked using its excellent GSX - R750 donk - the only purebred 750 cc sportsbike engine on the market - but then , they do n't use the Gixxer 1000 engine in a naked , either .
Looking at the engine and weight specs , you 'd have to rate it next to Honda 's everyman CB900 Hornet as well - I 've got a soft spot for those , as I put 60,000 km on one a few years back .
100 - odd horses and 82 Nm of torque should stand the FZ8 in good stead as a powerful but friendly and useable roadbike , and it certainly carries forward Yamaha 's tradition of making some the best looking of all the Japanese bikes .
So in all , it 's no major leap forward , but it 's certainly a great addition to the FZ range .
Yamaha 's new Fazer8
Speculation has been mounting in certain corners of the Internet that the FZ8 has been designed to effectively replace the FZ6 .
Such scuttlebutt postulates that the ' friendly ' 600 cc category will be handled by the more utilitarian XJ6 and Diversion , and that the highly - strung FZ6 , which needs a lot of revs to feel like it 's taking off , will disappear so that Yamaha can position the FZ range as a naked sports option for more experienced riders .
And if Yamaha Europe 's website is anything to go by , it seems the rumours are true - the FZ6 and Fazer6 have disappeared altogether .
The FZ6 certainly has its fans , plenty of people like the retuned R6 engine 's marked power curve - but if the FZ8 manages to pull off that same top - end rush , while adding in some genuine usable torque down low , I think it 's fair to say you 've got an all - round more useable bike .
We look forward to riding one !
Full specs follow , and there 's loads of photos in the FZ8 photo gallery .

Bring these two domains together , and a new vision of achievement begins to come into focus .
Shenk ’s “ ambitious goal , ” he tells us , is to take this widely dispersed research and “ distill it all into a new lingua franca , adopting helpful new phrases and metaphors ” to replace old and misleading ones .
Forget about genes as unchanging “ blueprints ” and talent as a “ gift , ” all tied up in a bow .
“ We can not allow ourselves to think that way anymore , ” he declares with some fervor .
Instead ,
Shenk proposes , imagine the genome as a giant control board , with thousands of switches and knobs that turn genes off and on or tune them up and down .
And think of talent not as a thing , but as a process ; not as something we have , but as something we do .

It ’s ambitious indeed to try to overthrow in one go the conventional ideas and images that have accumulated since 1874 , when Francis Galton first set the words “ nature ” and “ nurture ” against each other .
Yet Shenk convinces the reader that such a coup is necessary , and he gets it well under way .
He tells engaging stories , lucidly explains complex research and offers fresh insights into the nature of exceptional performance : noting , for example , that profound achievements are often driven by petty jealousies and resentments , or pointing out the surprising fact that great talent seems to cluster geographically and temporally , undermining the assumption that it ’s all due to individual genetic endowments .
Just how tall a task
Shenk took on is evident in his voluminous endnotes , which go on as long as the main text and are just as interesting .
Here the author allows us to watch him working his way through the literature , inquiring , arguing , marveling , as he wrestles a new understanding into being .
Shenk does n’t neglect the take - home point we ’re all waiting for , even titling a chapter “ How to Be a Genius ( or Merely Great ) . ”
The answer has less in common with the bromides of motivational speakers than with the old saw about how to get to Carnegie Hall : practice , practice , practice .
Whatever you wish to do well , Shenk writes , you must do over and over again , in a manner involving , as Ericsson put it , “ repeated attempts to reach beyond one ’s current level , ” which results in “ frequent failures . ”
This is known as “ deliberate practice , ” and over time it can actually produce changes in the brain , making new heights of achievement possible .
Behold our long rumored potential , unleashed at last !
Shenk is vague about how , exactly , this happens , but to his credit he does n’t make it sound easy .
“ You have to want it , want it so bad you will never give up , so bad that you are ready to sacrifice time , money , sleep , friendships , even your reputation , ” he writes .
“ You will have to adopt a particular lifestyle of ambition , not just for a few weeks or months but for years and years and years .
You have to want it so bad that you are not only ready to fail , but you actually want to experience failure : revel in it , learn from it . ”
It ’s in this self - help section that two weaknesses in Shenk ’s argument become evident .
The first is the matter of where the extreme drive and discipline that greatness requires are supposed to come from .
Shenk tells us about Beethoven writing 60 to 70 drafts of a single phrase of music , and Ted Williams hitting practice pitches until his hands bled .
Shenk would be the last to argue that such fierce dedication is “ inborn ” or “ innate ” — but if it is n’t , are the rest of us all equally capable of mustering it ?
We certainly can’t retroactively grant ourselves the kind of intense childhood exposure that Shenk describes for many of his greats , like Mozart and Yo - Yo Ma .

Scientists and doctors who study multiple sclerosis know , as of now , one of the best way to treat the condition is with beta- interferon .
But over the years , the drug 's effectiveness has been lukewarm in some people causing a third of all MS patients who are on the drug to suffer from uncomfortable flu - like side effects .
Many can't handle it and so far , researchers have never figured out why .
Now scientists from Stanford University School of Medicine may have discovered that there are actually two kinds of multiple sclerosis and that each reacts differently to the standard treatment .
Researchers know multiple sclerosis is triggered when immune cells , called T cells , attack the myelin sheathing , which insulates neurons in the body .
Healthy myelin sheathing is essential for the nervous system to function properly .
When this material is attacked , it can cause serious symptoms including paralysis and blindness in those with MS .
In this study , published in the current issue of Nature Medicine , researchers established animal models of multiple sclerosis by injecting mice with myelin into their immune systems , causing it to attack the animals ' own myelin nerve - cell coatings , much as MS attacks a human being ’s .
By looking at these animals and treating them with beta- interferon and then testing their blood the researcher found there were actually two different types of MS , caused by different patterns of T cells in the body .
So what works for one , does n't necessarily work for the other .
The researchers found that beta - interferon improved the condition of animals who had MS caused by gamma - interferon - secreting T cells , but made the symptoms worse in those mice whose MS was caused by IL - 17 - secreting T cells .
Intrigued , the investigators turned to humans .
One of the study 's authors , Dr. Brigit deJong , had previously been involved in research in Amsterdam in which multiple sclerosis patients were treated with beta- interferon and closely followed .
The Stanford group obtained blood samples taken from 26 of these patients both before and about two years after the initial treatment .
Without knowing which samples came from patients who had responded well or poorly to beta - interferon treatment , they went about measuring IL - 17 levels in those samples .
The human results were much like the animal models .
Those with high amounts of IL - 17 T cells had had negative reactions to beta- interferon .
" By making these distinctions in large human studies , people with multiple sclerosis might someday be able to take a simple blood test to see whether they are likely to respond to treatment with the standard multiple - sclerosis therapy . " says senior study author Lawrence Steinman , M.D. of the Neurology and Neurological Sciences Department at the Stanford University School of Medicine ,
If an inexpensive test can be developed to detect IL - 17 in humans , MS patients and their doctors will know whether beta interferon is or is n't going to work .
" For those who do n't have the IL - 17 T cells , " notes Steinman , " those patients can receive beta - interferon and probably not in a diluted form but in a higher dose , which will help them better fight their illness . "
According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society MS affects 400,000 people in the United States .
Dr. Patricia A. O'Looney , vice president of biomedical research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society , says the new research is very exciting .
" Obviously this will need more testing in human subjects , " explains O’Looney , " But this is a positive step in the right direction to helping to treat MS and other autoimmune conditions . "

Take a huge oceanic catamaran , stick a hydroelectric turbine underneath it , and hitch it to a 6.5 million - square - foot parafoil flying nearly a mile in the air .
That 's a Korean research team 's new proposal for generating gigawatts of clean energy .
As the parafoil pulls the boat , seawater would be forced through the turbine , which generates electricity .
The 800 megawatts of electricity produced would separate seawater into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis , and the hydrogen would then be stored on - board the ships .
" The calculation shows that , with a large such ship , a gigawatt order electrical power may be harvested by this system , " wrote Park Chul of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute and Kim Jongchul of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology , in the journal Energy in March .
" If such ships are deployed at 20 - km ( 12.4 - mile ) intervals over two temperate zones , one in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere and the other everywhere in the Southern Hemisphere , the total power produced will be many times that needed by the world , " they wrote .
The new system is a remarkable , if a bit wacky , synthesis of different lines of new energy R&D. Park and Kim rightly note that parafoils – large industrial - strength kites – are now used by the German company Skysails to reduce the fuel consumption of ocean - going vessels by up to 35 percent .
High - altitude wind power using similar parafoils has received increasing attention from entrepreneurs and green tech backers like Google.org because the higher you go , the better and steadier the winds are .
And small groups have been working on hydroelectric generators mounted to sailboats .
But it 's fair to say that though the system is largely a recombination of things that are on the cusp of feasibility , nothing even remotely similar has been tried , or even suggested , by anyone .
As such , the components such a plant would need are not currently manufactured .
For example , the largest commercially available parafoil has an area of just 6,835 square feet , or about 945 times smaller than the wing the researchers propose .
The idea does n't even have a catchy name yet .
Perhaps it could be called the " hydro paraplant . "

“ Spirit is hanging in there … remarkably good , all things considered ” , Steve Squyres told me in a rover update this week .
Squyres is the Scientific Principal Investigator for the twin Mars rovers , Spirit and Opportunity .
I asked Squyres whether the rover team would give extrication efforts a top priority if Spirit survives the harsh freezing temperatures of the looming winter season ?
Squyres replied that , “ If Spirit survives the winter then we ’ll start turning wheels again when there ’s enough power to do so , and we ’ll see what happens .
Even if we only get tens of centimeters of motion , there ’s great scientific value in doing so ” .
That ’s because the Martian terrain where Spirit has been mired in a sand trap since April 2009 has proven to a scientific bonanza and yielded some of the best evidence for past episodes of flowing liquid water .
Spirits wheels are buried in sulfate - rich deposits which were formed by water - related processes when volcanism was active around the location dubbed ‘ Home Plate ’ .
See our new mosaic above of the final panorama taken by Spirit on Sol 2175 before the onset of winter .
See our mosac below of the Troy sand trap and the final positional placement of the robotic arm ( IDD ) on Sol 2174 .
With Martian winter in the southern hemisphere fast approaching and power declining as the sun rises lower in the martain skies , Spirit ’s rover electronics module ( REM ) has now reached a new record low temperature of minus 41.5 degrees Celsius ( minus 42.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
As of today , Spirit has survived for 2217 Sols , or martian days , compared to the 90 Sol “ Warranty ” stipulated at launch .
If she survives for approximately three more weeks , she ’ll smash the record for longevity of any human made robot on Mars .
Viking 1 is the longest lived surface mission and sent her last signal on Sol 2245 on November 11 , 1982 for a total operating time of 6 Year and 116 days .
The rover team has projected that the temperature experienced by the critical electronics will likely drop down a bit further to perhaps minus 45 degrees Celsius as Spirit endeavors to endure an unprecedented 4th extreme winter at Gusev Crater on Mars while stuck in a sand trap at the place called Troy .
“ The temperature could go lower … but not by a great deal , ” Squyres added .
Picture Caption : Spirit is parked for 4th martian winter in the embedded area called “ Troy ” on the west side of Home Plate in Gusev Crater .
On Sol 2174 ( Feb. 13 , 2010 ) , the robotic arm ( IDD ) was positioned to the most favorable orientation for winter .

Energy output from the solar arrays likewise continues to drop at the same time as the energy required to run the survival heaters for the electronics continues to increase .
This means that the power deficit gap between what is available and what is required will continue to widen and eventually could trigger a low power fault resulting in Spirit entering hibernation mode .
No one knows precisely when the low power fault will occur and the team has been working diligently to find new ways of shaving off power usage to stave off the day when Spirit enters hibernation because no one knows if her critical components will last intact so that she will reawaken at a later date as the climate improves .
Squyres commented regarding the potential trigger point for a low power fault by saying , “ Our initial guess was 155 watt hours , and the latest number we ’ve seen is 133 watt - hours ( March 22 ) .
So I ’m not even going to try to guess ” .
Mars rover driver Scott Maxwell reports via recent Twitters that , “ Spirit is still alive and talking to us .
Feisty girl .
Brilliant uplink team found way to shave Spirit ’s energy needs ; can get by with 120ish [ watt - hours ] now .
Might stave off hibernation another couple weeks !
Spirit will continue to execute a single seven - sol plan each week , as long as power permits .
The seven - sol plan contains a single X - band uplink and a single Ultra - High Frequency ( UHF ) downlink , according to an update by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory which manages the rover project for NASA .
The activity on each sol consists simply of a brief wakeup , an atmospheric opacity ( tau ) measurement , and then a shutdown for the rest of the day and night .
Back on January 26 , 2010 , NASA declared Spirit would henceforth be a “ stationary lander ” after exhaustive extrication efforts failed to ‘ Free Spirit ’ .
But in her last re-positioning movements to improve her tilt to the sun and thereby increase her solar energy output , Spirit actually moved about 13 inches .
At that time Squyres said that Spirit could continue to produce significant science as a “ stationary lander ” .
He was most excited about the possibility to study tiny wobbles in the rotation of Mars to gain insight about the planet ’s core .
This requires months of radio - tracking the motion of a point on the surface of Mars to calculate long - term motion with an accuracy of a few inches .
“ If the final scientific feather in Spirit ’s cap is determining whether the core of Mars is liquid or solid , that would be wonderful — it ’s so different from the other knowledge we ’ve gained from Spirit , ” said Squyres at the Jan 26 , press briefing .
So I asked Squyres ;
What if Spirit can be moved a few meters to examine new soil , will that still permit the core determination experiment to go forward ?
“ Yes ” , Squyres responded .
“ As long as the motions can be characterized at the ~ 1 centimeter level — which we know how to do — then the geophysics experiment is not compromised by modest rover motions ” .
Based on what we know about Mars so far , what is Squyres opinion on whether the Martian core is solid or even partially liquid ?
“ My guess would be a solid core , based on the fact that Mars does not have an intrinsic magnetic field today ” , Squyres said .
“ But as my friend Bill Nye likes to say , one test is worth a thousand expert opinions ” .
Stay tuned !

SERIOUS MONEY : Proposals to regulate financial markets do not go far enough to prevent a future shock that undermines the entire system , writes CHARLIE FELL
EDWARD LORENZ , a professor of meteorology at MIT , delivered a paper to the US National Academy of Sciences in 1972 entitled Predictability :
Does the flap of a butterfly ’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas ?.
Lorenz ’s work on the mathematical modelling of weather patterns suggested that microscopic differences in the initial conditions of dynamic non-linear systems can trigger a chain of events , such that “ slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states ” .
The so - called “ butterfly effect ” led Lorenz to conclude that even the slightest imprecision in initial conditions made long - range forecasting virtually impossible .
His observations unleashed a scientific revolution , and chaos theory has subsequently affected virtually every field of scientific study .
The butterfly effect was certainly evident throughout the financial world during the autumn of 2007 and beyond , as the meltdown of a relatively minor part of the US mortgage market brought global money and capital markets to their knees , while the demise of Lehman Brothers on September 15th , 2008 , pushed the entire system to the edge of collapse .
Only the provision of government guarantees , cash injections and other supports equivalent to almost a quarter of world gross domestic product managed to pull the global economy back from the abyss and return some semblance of normality to financial markets .
The postmortem is in full swing and regulatory changes that determine whether and when the next financial crisis engulfs the world are overdue .
The task is onerous , since the financial system , unlike the simple deterministic systems explored by Lorenz , is complex and subject to random shocks arising from political and economic events , as well as from the shifting risk preferences and attitudes of investors .
The study of complex adaptive systems , however , provides important insights for those responsible for implementing changes that mitigate systemic risk .
Andrew Haldane , executive director of financial stability at the Bank of England , presented an academic paper in Amsterdam last spring that analysed the financial system under the complex adaptive system paradigm .
Haldane noted that the financial system had become progressively more complex , but increasingly less diverse , in recent years – a situation that signalled heightened system fragility and reduced resilience to random shocks .
This development , he argued , would have set alarm bells ringing in just about every non-financial discipline and , as a result , the study of complex systems should be central to financial oversight .
Financial system complexity increased in recent years as globalisation , technological advances and product innovation combined to create ever - greater connectivity .
The increased connectivity was accompanied by high concentrations among a small number of large institutions , which reduced the path lengths between a participant and any other participant in the system .
This improved the efficiency of liquidity and informational flows within the financial system during the credit boom .
But the seemingly welcome development reduced the system ’s resilience to the emergence of stress at a large connected financial institution .
The high concentration of connectivity among a small number of institutions and the reduced path lengths meant that stress at one large connected institution would be quickly transmitted to the entire system with crisis an almost inevitable outcome .
The financial system ’s resilience was reduced further by the increasing lack of diversity among participants .
The hunt for incremental yield in a low - return world contributed to the use of leverage to boost returns and this , combined with diversification strategies designed to exploit uncorrelated returns , resulted in highly leveraged crowded trades .
Financial institutions were playing the same game at the same time and with increasing amounts of leverage .
As a result , their collective actions increased the likelihood of a liquidity crisis cycle , as described by Richard Bookstaber , a pioneer of financial engineering on Wall Street , in his book A Demon of Our Own Design .
A liquidity crisis cycle begins when an exogenous shock precipitates a price drop in a market that is crowded with leveraged investors .
The drop in prices forces highly leveraged investors to dispose of assets to satisfy margin requirements , but their collective actions push prices even lower , which requires yet more selling .
Prices cascade downwards and liquidity disappears as leveraged investors desperately attempt to exit their trades .
This forces the distressed investors to begin liquidating their positions in other markets and , if a sufficient number of players do likewise , the downward cycle in prices will spread to assets that are unrelated to the original shock .
Bookstaber argues that this phenomenon explains why crises can spread in unpredictable ways , with the contagion being driven primarily by the array of financial securities held by the distressed investors .
It is clear from his observations that lack of diversity among participants can have far - reaching consequences .
Financial markets have recovered strongly from the depths of despair evident at the lows last spring and the sense of urgency to introduce concrete measures to avoid a repeat of the crisis has diminished .
Current proposals do not go far enough to prevent a future shock that undermines the entire financial system .
Would - be regulators must study the lessons of complex adaptive systems , which suggest that the highly leveraged complex financial institutions that are deemed “ too big to fail ” must be broken up to reduce dependence on a small number of participants and to increase diversity .
It is worth heeding the words of Albert Einstein : “ Today ’s problems can not be solved by thinking the way we thought when we created them . ”
Have Glenn Beck and Chris Matthews linked peaceful activists with violent acts to spring the trap for an era of thought crime laws and politically - correct repression ?
Aaron Dykes
Infowars.com Commentary
March 5 , 2010
“ The first casualty of War is Truth ”
Why are so many random acts of violence being blamed on dissenting free speech groups ?
We are repeatedly told that lone individuals who carry out violence may be 9/11 truthers or may be Tea Party members or may be Constitutionalists .
This pattern accusation is particularly perturbing because , most of these “ groups ” are really broad movements made up of many small groups , many of whom disagree profoundly , and of many individuals , some of whom associate , some of whom are isolated .
The only unifying element , if any , is in sharing a belief .
How these individuals act on such a belief is a different matter altogether .
But for media pundits like Glenn Beck , Chris Matthews and etc. , it is fuel to link individual acts of violence with broad political beliefs .
What is the agenda ?
It is clearly manifest an effort to neutralize dissent via a paralyzing guilt - by - association holding pattern .
The media smear campaign is clearly coordinated to stop the spread of popular outrage against Washington .
But how could widespread popular support for formal hate speech legislation or a de facto atmosphere of thought crime ever be generated under the bitter and divided party lines that have emerged under Obama ’s presidency ?
You ’d have to unite the right AND the left to back thought crime .
It has already been played out in the mainstream media ’s script over the past year :
What have the FOX - fueled ‘ right ’ pundits like O’Reilly , Hannity and Glenn Beck railed against more than 9/11 truthers and Bush “ haters ” ?
Outrage is triggered in the left and Democrat wing by racism and now by Obama “ haters ” .
Under the Obama - era , the phony ‘ left ’- leaning talking heads have declared open - season on branding political opponents as “ racists , ” often desperately playing the race card at every sign of opposition to anything in the President ’s agenda .
Chris Matthews has wielded the “ racist ” tea party mantra in combination with smearing the ‘ violent ’ Tea Parties and groups like the Oath Keepers .
Now , via Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) , groups such as We Are Change , who are essentially citizen journalists , and groups including the Constitution Party have also been smeared .
Astonishingly they have alleged violence where there is none .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Yet the connection is established with a scattered “ pattern ” of lone individuals who have been painted in the colors of various targeted groups .
I suspect a ‘ false flag ’ of a different kind all together– primarily media driven , and disconnected in terms of the flagrant or violent acts in question .
Perhaps a dirty tricks campaign .
All of these groups are , at any organizational level ( if any ) and in its body politic , completely within the bounds of free speech and non-violent political action .
But these smear campaigns have preemptively labeled broad groups as “ potential ” violators of some foggy , abstract category like “ terrorist ” or “ racist ” or even “ hurtful . ”
Sadly , it ’s nothing new for developing countries who were mired by cheap dictators and brutally repressive regimes .
Political dissent has been criminalized and purged in too many ‘ banana republics ’ .
For it to now take root in the United States is deplorable .
Yet it has cropped up at law enforcement fusion centers ( there ’s no law against belief or political speech ) in the leaked MIAC report and in the Federal government ’s “ mother ” organization Homeland Security .
Both hold veterans and peaceful political groups as potential “ domestic terrorists ” .
Things have become so bad in this country that The People have become indistinguishable from “ the enemy ” to our civil servants and watchdog authorities .
Many of these same groups were named in their report .
White House “ Czar ” Cass Sunstein has even written policy papers which propose censoring and even penalizing conspiracy theories ( outlawing a belief , i.e. thought crime ) and even belief in the basic goodness of sunshine .
The loudest voice in the room in all of this has been Glenn Beck , who has mapped out the battlefield of supposedly violent , subversive “ thought crime . ”
His mental map and belief system seems mired in a middle - ages Inquisition mindset .
For Beck , it is a sinister plot held in the mind that centers over 9/11 truth beliefs .
It has been the poison of the White House via Czar Van Jones ’ alleged thought crime , it has been the poison of the Tea Parties , and it was the poison latent belief of candidate Debra Medina who was mired in doublethink and 9/11 controversy fallout .
He has brazenly “ predicted ” coming violence from the wings of the Tea Party , from the midst of 9/11 truth and from the other ‘ violent ’ wings of the mind .
Beck has even claimed that a 9/11 Truther will try to assassinate the President .
If this random campaign is carried out by ‘ violent minded ’ 9/11 truthers and Tea Party racists , as the media smear would have us believe , how does Glenn Beck know so much about what ’s going to happen ?
It ’s all been on his chalkboard for months .
LOOK AT THE CASUALTY REPORT
Consider a few incidents from the Bush era :
– A student asked John Kerry an uncomfortable question about his connection with Bush and Skull and Bones .
He was unnecessarily tasered and arrested by police .
The media chorus celebrated the use of force against an accused 9/11 truther engaging in free speech .
A sensation was made out of his outburst ‘ Do n’t taze me bro ! ’ – A random “ bombing ” at Times Square was arbitrarily linked to 9/11 truthers and anti-war activists .
The mainstream media smear agents cried out and demonized the wide and varied groups as “ violent . ” – We Are Change member German “ Gary ” Talis was set up and charged with ‘ attacking a girl in a wheelchair ’ after loudly questioning two Bush women outside an event .
Witness accounts confirm Talis ’ story and he defeated the trumped up charges in court , but was smeared in the media and demonized as a senseless brute .
– The Simon Weisenthal Center accused Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth and its founder Richard Gage of being violent extremists .
The group is comprised of professionals spouting nothing more controversial than Newton ’s law of physics , but it ’s come off as more controversial than Galileo in the time of the Holy Roman Empire .
Galileo was condemned for “ grave suspicion of heresy ” due to his scientific explanation of the cosmos .
You could say he lost the battle but won the war .
– During the 2008 Election season , pundits called for “ tazing ” 9/11 truthers who asked questions to candidates and Constitutional candidate Ron Paul , whose grassroots supporters worried the establishment , was demonized and smeared under the same tactics .
One could say he lost the battle but won the war .
I predict the same for Richard Gage .
Now consider under the Obama - era , we have unconnected events that the establishment media has connected with terrorism , racism and truther - ism .
The true nature of many of these events , at a minimum , is under question , but they amount to a hazy campaign of fear and possibly dirty tricks .
The Holocaust museum shooting , Ft. Hood shooting , Underwear Bomber , Texas Capital gun firing , Joe Stack ’s crash into the Austin IRS building , Pentagon shooting …
Yet the political damage for these isolated events is painted against the typical targets , i.e. Van Jones , Debra Medina , anti-Federal Reserve activists , the Texas Gun Show , Tea Party , 9/11 Truthers , Veterans , Birthers , We Are Change , Oath Keepers , Chuck Baldwin , Ron Paul , Bob Barr , Constitution Party , and et al .
But these are faces of a decentralized political movement challenging the status quo .
There ’s no connection to the acts of a few isolated individuals , and it ’s unfair for Glenn Beck and others to insist on making that connection .

This is n’t exactly news , but it ’s news to me : Rapamycin has an orally administered derivative , Everolimus , already in use as an anti-cancer and anti-rejection drug .
( The two compounds are almost identical ; Everolimus has one additional hydroxyethyl group on the protuberant cyclohexane ring , and apparently that ’s enough to make the unwieldy rapamycin molecule orally bioavailable . )
This might be good news if it turns out that the longevity - enhancing qualities of rapamycin end up generalizing to humans :
If you need to maintain constant levels of a chronically administered drug , t’s way easier to use timed - release oral capsules than injections .
Also , as millions of diabetics will tell you , it ’s just nice not to have to shoot up .
But the drug itself might be bad news , especially if it is taken over long periods of time : mTOR , the target of rapamycin , appears to be necessary for reconsolidation of long - term memory in mammals ; inhibition of mTOR is efficacious enough at blocking fear memories that it ’s discussed as a strategy for treating PTSD .
The role of mTOR in memory appears to be general , i.e. , in memories other than fearful ones , and it is evolutionarily ancient : TOR is important for long - term potentiation in the sea slug Aplysia , beloved model of scholars of learning and memory .
So , as I ’ve commented before , I have this fear that rapamycin ( or a derivative ) will turn out to be a bona fide longevity enhancement drug , but one whose chronic use erodes long - term memory , which does defeat the purpose to some extent .
Then again , blood - brain barrier is an issue here : even though Everolimus can survive the stomach and pass through the gut into the blood , that does n’t mean it will make it into the brain efficiently .
Then again again , if the drug has a long half - life once it ’s inside the brain , it might still accumulate there if one had to take it every day for the rest of one ’s life .
On the happy side , if you find this possibility traumatic , the rapamycin will take care of that for you .
Israel is clearly making a major effort to repair relations with Ireland after the Dubai passport fiasco when Irish passports were used by Mossad agents .
Writing in The New York Times yesterday Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Zion Evrony was positively gushing as he paid tribute to the Northern Irish peace process and the lessons for Israel therein .
This is a major change in tactics .
For years Israel has said that there were few if any lessons to be learned for the Middle East from Northern Ireland ’s peace process .
Now the Israeli ambassador has changed that perception it seems .
He says the key lesson from Ireland is that both sides must give up its maximum aspiration .
“ First and foremost , there is the concept that to resolve a difficult conflict , each side , while retaining its “ dream ” — its maximum aspiration — must be willing to forego its implementation in practice .
Painful compromises were made by both sides in the Good Friday Agreement , without which no deal would have been possible . ”
He writes .
There is much more in that vein in a love letter to the Irish accomplishment in the peace process .
But is it too little too late ?
In the same online edition Irish Foreign Minster Michael Martin ( pictured above ) takes aim at the Israelis after his recent visit to Gaza and makes no bones about his belief that they are turning Gaza unto a humanitarian disaster by their blockade .
The Irish are furious and rightfully so at Israel over the use of Irish passports by the death squad that killed a Hamas operative in Dubai .
They believe such tactics put Irish travelers in the Middle East in real jeopardy .
It is hard to argue with them .
Israel is clearly on the defensive on this one hence the New York Times soothing article .
But it may be too little too late .
The town of Carrickmacross recently tore out the page devoted to the Israeli Ambassador ’s visit in their welcome book .
It is an example of the anti Israel sentiment current in Ireland .
I doubt The New York Times article will help much .
Islamic extremists must drink wine to be tolerant : Scholar
International
ani -Staff
By Super Admin
London , Feb. 6 ( ANI ) : A leading philosopher has advised Islamic extremists to drink wine to become more tolerant .
Dr Scruton , research professor for the Institute for the Psychological Sciences in both Oxford and Washington , urges " lunatic fundamentalists who have set their heart on giving Islam a bad name " to imbibe , as it would help them become more moderate .
According to Dr Scruton , the occasional glass would help teach important lessons about friendship and getting along with others .
" Muslims must learn again to drink , and should be piously applying themselves to the task , " the Daily Express quoted from Dr Scruton 's article in the international wine magazine , Decanter .
While lamenting the passing of the " laughing , tolerant " phase of Islam , Dr Scruton praises Muslim philosophers like the 11th century Ibn Sina , who called wine " the best friend of wise people " .
Dr Scruton pointed out that Muslims around the world were being brainwashed by extremists driven out of Saudi Arabia and determined to impose their hardline views on others .
He talks about the " truth in wine " in his new book , I Drink Therefore I Am : A Philosopher 's Guide To Wine .
Dr Scruton , a wine critic for the New Statesman , says " lunatics roaming the world for victims have swallowed the crazy doctrine of an ' eternal ' Koran " .
He says Muslims must " learn to drink " to find tolerance again .
Until that happens , Dr Scruton believes , the Koran will continue to be misinterpreted and the truth that life " is not a fact but a gift " will never be recognised .
" Without the benefit of wine it is hard to seize this truth - harder still to recognise the obligation that it imposes , to be gentle with others , " he added .

Lars Vilks has been living under a death threat
Two men have been charged in the Irish Republic in connection with an investigation into an alleged plot to murder a Swedish cartoonist .
They were arrested over alleged threats to kill Lars Vilks over a cartoon which put Prophet Muhammad 's head on a dog .
The cartoon was printed as part of a 2007 Swedish newspaper editorial on freedom of expression .
They were refused bail after detectives told the court they were not convinced their identities were authentic .
Ali Charaf Damache , whose address was given as John Collins House , High Street , Waterford , was charged with sending a menacing text message on 9 January .
The 44 - year - old , who is originally from Algeria but who has been living in Ireland for about ten years , swore on the Koran before taking the stand at Waterford District Court .
Abdul Salam Monsour Khalil Al - Jahani , 32 , of Johnstown , Waterford but originally from Libya , was charged with an immigration offence after allegedly giving a false name .
He is accused of presenting false documentation under the Immigration Act 2004 .
A third man who was also being held has been released .
He was one of seven people arrested last week in a series of raids by anti-terrorist units acting on intelligence from the CIA , FBI and European agencies .
Those originally detained included nationals from Algeria , Libya , the Palestinian territories , Croatia and the US .
In 2007 , a group linked to al - Qaeda in Iraq offered a $ 100,000 ( £ 66,000 ) reward for killing Mr Vilks , and a 50 % bonus if he was " slaughtered like a lamb " by having his throat cut .
The Vilks cartoon was published about a year - and - a - half after a series of depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in Denmark 's Jyllands - Posten paper caused protests by Muslims around the world .
Seaweed could hold the key to tackling obesity after it was found it reduces fat uptake by more than 75 per cent , new research has shown .
Now the team at Newcastle University are adding seaweed fibre to bread to see if they can develop foods that help you lose weight while you eat them .
A team of scientists led by Dr Iain Brownlee and Prof Jeff Pearson have found that dietary fibre in one of the world 's largest commercially - used seaweed could reduce the amount of fat absorbed by the body by around 75 per cent .
The Newcastle University team found that Alginate -- a natural fibre found in sea kelp -- stops the body from absorbing fat better than most anti-obesity treatments currently available over the counter .
Using an artificial gut , they tested the effectiveness of more than 60 different natural fibres by measuring the amount of fat that was digested and absorbed with each treatment .
Presenting their findings at the American Chemical Society Spring meeting in San Francisco , Dr Brownlee said the next step was to recruit volunteers and study whether the effects they have modelled in the lab can be reproduced in real people , and whether such foods are truly acceptable in a normal diet .

" The aim of this study was to put these products to the test and our initial findings are that alginates significantly reduce fat digestion , " explains Dr Brownlee .
" This suggests that if we can add the natural fibre to products commonly eaten daily -- such as bread , biscuits and yoghurts -- up to three quarters of the fat contained in that meal could simply pass through the body .
" We have already added the alginate to bread and initial taste tests have been extremely encouraging .
Now the next step to to carry out clinical trials to find out how effective they are when eaten as part of a normal diet . "
The research is part of a three year project being funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council .
It addresses the new regulations set out by the European Food Safety Authority that any health claims made on a food label should be substantiated by scientific evidence .
" There are countless claims about miracle cures for weight loss but only a few cases offer any sound scientific evidence to back up these claims , " explains Dr Brownlee .

Alginates are already commonly used at a very low level in many foods as thickeners and stabilisers and when added to bread as part of a blind taste test , Dr Brownlee said the alginate bread actually scored higher for texture and richness than a standard white loaf .
" Obesity is an ever - growing problem and many people find it difficult to stick to diet and exercise plans in order to lose weight , " explained Dr Brownlee .
" Alginates not only have great potential for weight management -- adding them to food also has the added advantage of boosting overall fibre content . "
What is a dietary fibre ?
Dietary fibre would be scientifically classified as a group of carbohydrates of plant origin that escape digestion by the human gut .
" Actually , there 's still quite a lot of confusion about fibre , " says Dr Brownlee .
" I think most people would describe it as roughage -- the bit of your food that keeps you regular and is vital for a healthy gut .
" Both of these facts are true but the notion that all fibre is the same and that it simply goes through your system without having an effect is wrong . "
Fibre is made up of a wide range of different molecules called polysaccharides and although it is not digested by the human gut , it both directly and indirectly affects a number of bodily processes .
Dr Brownlee adds : " These initial findings suggest alginates could offer a very real solution in the battle against obesity . "
It turns out the man 's name is Bob , and funnily enough , he 's not exactly what you 'd call a " mooch " :
He has two masters degrees and a Ph.D. from Cornell .
He taught at the University of Michigan and worked as a nuclear engineer .
My guess -- and mind you , this is just a guess -- is that he is more accomplished than any of the pricks who threw dollar bills at him .
Still , he has a level of class that I will freely admit I simply could not equal under any circumstances , let alone the humiliating circumstances he was subjected to .
In response to the question , " What would you say to the Tea Partiers who mocked you ? " , he responds :
Bob : I would n't tell them anything , I 'd ask them questions .
I 'd ask them , for example , you have a sign that says " This is socialism " .
Well , what is it about it that makes it socialism ?
What qualifies " this " as being socialism and " that " as not being socialism ?
How do you distinguish the two , and how did you get to that position ?
Well , Bob may be a nuclear engineer , but evidently he has little experience dealing with the Teabag crowd , because one simply does n't ask them such intricate questions .
These are the same people who declare " Keep your government hands off my Medicare " .
If mere reason is kicking their asses , how does he expect them to deal with the complexity of defining " socialism " ?
He continues :
So I would just ask all kinds of questions until they got sick of me .
Dude , all due respect , you 're like a nuclear scientist and shit , but they were " sick of you " the moment they laid eyes on you .
Now you 're gonna make them answer questions more complicated than " What color are your eyes " ?
What does this look like , Final Jeopardy ?
He concludes :
It 's a close one .
Every vote counts .
Just get out there .
Everyone take your own action .
If you can sit next to people like I did , great .
If you can't , do something else .
But do something .
It 's a once in a lifetime thing .
I sure hope we get it through .
Thanks for helping .
That 's community .
Just watch Bob for yourself , and observe his class and dignity , then ( if you can stomach it ) , contrast it with the revolting teabaggers .
Any questions ?
Here 's part 1 :

From our own correspondent .
They do n’t agree on everything , but they ’ve followed the same route .
When they began as undocumented workers , working in the underground economy , they avoided attracting attention .
Today , with a resident permit and a declared job , they meet at Averroès , the Moroccan cultural association that they have just set up in a neighborhood in the old historic center of Valencia .
Mohamed , who has eye problems nowadays , has had to give up his job as a truck driver .
He fears that the economic crisis will lead to an increase in xenophobia , although , of all the former undocumented workers in the group , he is the one who has the least to fear :
He has obtained Spanish citizenship .
When he first arrived in Spain in 1985 , he worked as a gardener and did odd jobs .
But he is afraid .
“ They do n’t give work to foreigners like us any more .
And when I point out that I have Spanish citizenship , they look at me , and they laugh in my face . ”
Khalid , from Fès , gives courses in Arabic .
He qualifies Mohamed ’s words : “ Spanish society is not drenched in racism , ” he points out .
“ There is no National Front [ 1 ] here . ”
Bouzekri , a shopkeeper and the president of the cultural association , thinks that North Africans are the victims of discrimination , all the same .
He cites the example of a cooperative whose workforce , not long ago , was composed mostly of immigrants .
Now , it only takes on Spaniards .
“ They hire natives first , and then Europeans , after that South Americans .
The Arabs come last . ”
Spanish economic growth was based on two lies : first , that there would always be a lot of housing to be built ; and secondly , that Spain could provide decent conditions for millions of immigrants , whereas the only jobs offered to them were ones without a future .
And this is the conundrum which the future must answer .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans ' perceptions of 20 nations that figure prominently in the news or U.S. foreign policy held quite steady in the first year of the Obama administration .
Canada retained its top position in Gallup 's annual country ratings , with 90 % of Americans viewing it favorably , unchanged from 2009 .
Iran continues to rank last , with 10 % this year .
Eight of the countries rated in this year 's World Affairs survey are viewed favorably by a majority of Americans .
Great Britain nearly matches Canada in favorability , while smaller majorities hold positive views of Germany , Japan , Israel , India , France , and Egypt .
Mexico and Russia are both about as likely to be viewed unfavorably as favorably , while 10 countries are generally viewed unfavorably .
" Although the two - percentage - point decline in Mexico 's overall favorable rating between 2009 and today is not significant , the result is that , for the first time since 1993 , fewer than half of Americans have a favorable view of the United States ' southern neighbor . "
Yemen was included on the list for the first time this year , amid news that the Christmas Day underwear bomber had ties to a Yemen - based al Qaeda terrorist group .
Its 21 % favorable rating is among the lowest in the Feb.
1 - 3 poll , although about one in four Americans have no opinion of that country .
Only Iraq saw a statistically significant , albeit small , drop in favorability over the past year on the basis of the combined percentages viewing each " very favorably " or " mostly favorably . "
Most countries ' ratings are essentially unchanged , while favorability toward Russia and the Palestinian Authority is up slightly .
Partial Rebound in Views of Russia
After dipping to 40 % in 2009 -- most likely in response to the 2008 military conflict between Russia and Georgia -- favorability toward Russia has recovered somewhat to 47 % ; however , this remains lower than where it stood for much of the past decade .
The historical high point for positive U.S. feelings toward Russia was 66 % , first reached in 1991 and repeated in 2002 .
However , favorability toward Russia plummeted to 41 % in March 2003 , after that country sharply opposed the United States ' launching of the Iraq war .
( U.S. public opinion of France and Germany , two other countries opposed to the war , also turned more negative in 2003 . )
By February 2004 , Russia 's favorability score was back to 59 % , and it remained above 50 % until 2008 .
Palestinian Authority Sees Slight Improvement
Americans ' views of the official governing body of the Palestinian people -- the Palestinian Authority -- have been decidedly negative over the years .
However , there was a slight improvement in views over the past year , from 15 % viewing the Palestinian Authority favorably in 2009 ( and just 11 % after the Hamas group won the Palestinian elections in 2006 ) to 20 % today .
Favorability toward the Palestinian Authority was quite low for most of the Bush administration , except for February 2005 , when the two sides had just announced an informal truce during Mideast peace talks .
Favorability Toward Mexico Still Dampened
Although the two - percentage - point decline in Mexico 's overall favorable rating between 2009 and today is not significant , the result is that , for the first time since 1993 , fewer than half of Americans have a favorable view of the United States ' southern neighbor .
Mexico 's image in the U.S. has generally been in decline since 2005 .
Heightened U.S. attention to illegal immigration from Mexico , as well as to intensifying violence in the Mexican drug war , could explain the deterioration of Mexico's U.S. image in recent years .
Notable Differences
Most of the countries rated this year are viewed more favorably by young adults ( aged 18 to 34 ) than by those 55 and older .
Additionally , some are viewed differently by Republicans and Democrats .
As a result of the generational differences , Egypt , China , Russia , and Mexico are all viewed favorably by at least 6 in 10 young adults , but by fewer than half of adults 55 and older .
Significant age gaps exist in favorability toward Cuba , Yemen , Pakistan , North Korea , the Palestinian Authority , and Iran , although most members of all age groups still view these countries negatively .
France , Russia , Cuba , North Korea , the Palestinian Authority , and Yemen are all viewed more favorably by Democrats than by Republicans .
Israel is the only country rated this year that is viewed more favorably by Republicans .
A handful of countries -- Canada , Great Britain , Germany , Japan , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , and Afghanistan -- receive similar ratings from the broad age and partisan groups .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,025 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 1 - 3 , 2010 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Tiger Woods ' public apology has not appeased his sponsors
Energy drink firm Gatorade has ended its sponsorship of Tiger Woods .
Gatorade is the latest major company to cut ties with the sportsman following Woods ' admission that he was unfaithful to his wife .
The drinks company , owned by PepsiCo , had already discontinued a Tiger Woods - themed drink , Tiger Focus .
It follows AT&T and Accenture in ending deals .
However , Gatorade said it would continue its partnership with the charitable Tiger Woods Foundation .
Therapy
A spokeswoman for Gatorade said : " We no longer see a role for Tiger in our marketing efforts and have ended our relationship ...
We wish him all the best . "
Its move comes just one week after the star made a frank public address to a select gathering at PGA Tour headquarters in Florida .
In his statement Woods apologised to his wife , friends and family , as well as to his fans .
" I was unfaithful , I had affairs and I cheated .
What I did was unacceptable , " he said .
Woods , 34 , told the hand - picked attendees he had spent 45 days in therapy and claimed he still had " a long way to go " to overcome his problems .
Distance
Gatorade is the third company to end its relationship with Mr Woods .
Communications company AT&T and corporate services business Accenture previously cut their sponsorship deals .
Male grooming business Gillette and luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer have also distanced themselves from him .
Carmaking giant General Motors ( GM ) said recently an arrangement that allowed Woods free access to its vehicles was over .
Wealthiest athlete
The world 's number one golfer did have an endorsement contract with GM's Buick brand , but that ended in 2008 .
Such arrangements made Tiger Woods the world 's wealthiest athlete , estimated to have earned £ 66 m ( $ 100 m ) a year in endorsement deals before allegations of infidelity emerged in December of last year .
A recent University of California study suggested the total economic damage of the Tiger Woods affair to all involved parties could amount to as much as $ 12bn .
But sports equipment giant Nike , which pays Woods a reported $ 40 m a year , has given its support .
And video game maker Electronic Arts is to go ahead with plans to roll out an online game featuring the golfer .
N'Yaounda , a western lowland gorilla at Hungary 's Budapest Zoo , gave birth to a healthy baby on Jan .
5 . The baby is N'Yaounda 's first , and it's the first western lowland gorilla birth at the zoo in 10 years .
Of course , zoo staff are overjoyed about the new baby -- but they 're also a bit distracted by a mystery surrounding its birth .
See , two males -- Golo , a 30 - year - old male , and his son , Ebobo , 10 -- both seem to think they 're the baby 's father .
The zoo hopes that DNA testing will solve this gorilla paternity mystery , the Austrian Times reports .
" They both try to protect the mother and baby and both seem to believe it is their son -- which can only mean the mother N'Yaounda may have a bit of explaining to do when we get the results , " one keeper told the newspaper .
Zoo intrigue -- color us fascinated !

In this longish post I am trying to enumerate all the forces that care about Perl .
Both those who are " just " having fun and those who are in for the money .
Many people might react badly if I claim that they have financial interest in the well being of Perl as they see it only as fun .
My feeling is that the " Perl community " - whatever that would be - does not like the idea of making money using Perl .
So when I am at a YAPC I am expected to wear of my We do it for the fun hat only .
On the other hand when I am around people who do not care about Perl or do not use it , I have to explain them in other terms why do I spend so much time in writing open source Perl code and trying to promote the language .
Fun is strange but sort of acceptable for them but when I tell them about my financial interest in it well being of Perl and the ecosystem around it then they understand and accept it .
I have started to write this blog entry a while ago as part of my plan to add a more business oriented face to the many faces of Perl .
With the recent surge in the discussion of the well being of Perl it is time to finish it and post it .
A long time ago Ovid wrote a blog post titled ( Solutions Are Not Problems .
Problems Are Problems . ) and finished it with the sentence Our careers depend on it .
referring to the well being of Perl .
To this brian d foy reacted that it is not a good enough reason and to my surprise Ovid corrected himself .
Frankly even if Perl was really like COBOL and should have been gone from the world - and many people try to distribute that kind of FUD - even that it is totally acceptable to people who have financial interest in the subject to try to protect their investment .
Let 's try not to be on some moral high - ground here or judge each other .
Some people are in " just for the fun " others are " just for the money " and yet others have both .
Stakeholders
Let 's try to group the Perl stakeholders .
If I missed some groups or you have other comments of refinement , please do comment .
Individuals : Perl Mongers and CPAN Authors , the Perl 5 Porters First and foremost are the Perl Mongers , CPAN authors and the Perl 5 porters around the world .
Most of them are heavily invested emotionally in Perl .
They are participating as they enjoy the technology or the community .
Some have financial interest too , others have no financial interest at all but they together are the enthusiastic crowd behind the actual code .
Some of them are involved purely as hobby .
They do n't use Perl at work .
Others are using Perl at work but it is far from being the most critical part of their job .
( e.g. a sys - admin who could do her work manually , or by using shell or some other programming language ) .
The third group is people who are employed as full - time Perl developers or run their own Perl developer company .
They would probably be able to switch to another language as well but it will take a long time - probably many years - for them to reach the level of expertise they have in Perl .
This is probably the group of people we mean when we are talking about the Perl Community .
In addition there are a number of people who are involved in open source projects heavily dependent on Perl but are not on CPAN .
( e.g. Bugzilla , WebGUI , Bricolage )
Individuals :
The people behind the closed doors
Both the people who use Perl - as - a - glue , the people who use Perl for lots of internal automation and the full time Perl developers are represented in this group .
This is probably a much bigger group than the above - open source - section but we hardly know about their needs and wants as they are usually not interacting with the open source Perl community at all .
These people usually have a lot less emotional connection to Perl if anything at all but they have an investment in Perl that should be protected .
They spent time and energy learning it , they build some expertise around it .
If they need to switch to another language this investment is partially gone .
Companies : Glue language
There are tons of places where Perl is used in critical applications but because it is at the sys - admin level or because it is the glue between the " real applications " higher management does not see it as having a strategic importance .
Perl Training Companies ( and individuals )
These are the companies providing Perl training - a few have specialized for Perl , many provide Perl as just another technology .
The latter do n't really care , they usually take people with 1 - 2 years experience in Perl and let them teach the usually outdated PERL training material .
( Having seen some of these training materials I am not sure why are we surprised people new to Perl show up and write code in the style of previous century . )
The former has a real interest in making Perl more popular .
( examples : Stonehenge , Perl Training Australia , Thoughtstream ( aka Damian Conway ) just to mention a few and myself ) .
Most of these companies are run by people who are involved in the Perl Community .
Small Perl Development Companies
There are companies , providing application development service using Perl ( eg. based on Moose , Catalyst , Krang , Bricolage , Titanium , Mojo or whatever else ) .
AFAIK
Most of the companies providing these services are the actual developers of the mentioned applications or frameworks and thus are already involved in the Perl Community .
Large Perl based Companies
There are larger companies using Perl in big mission - critical customer facing applications .
They have one or more applications written in Perl ( or at least that Perl is a large part of the application ) .
They recognize Perl as one of the technologies critical to their ongoing health .
Some of these companies ( e.g. Booking.com ) employ people from the Perl Community and / or have given nice sponsorship for the further development of Perl .
There are many others but I am not sure how easy or difficult it could be to find them .
Non-Perl companies
There are the huge companies that we keep mentioning such as Amazon , Yahoo , Intel , IBM that have lots of Perl code in mostly in - house applications .
They use lots of other technologies as well .
Because of the size of these companies and the number of different technologies they use neither upper nor mid-level management see Perl as a critical technology .
Individuals and companies selling products for Perl For example ActiveState ( Komodo ) , IndigoStar , Xarka ( OptiPerl ) .
They too have an interest to have more people using Perl as that will enlarge the market of their products and services .
Some of these companies have good relationship to the Perl community others do n't have much .
Individuals and companies selling products written in Perl
There are various CGI and other scripts written in Perl sold by people either as a plain commercial product or as shareware .
The developers of these applications should have some interest in how well Perl is doing but in many cases they do n't care much .
AFAIK usually they are not involved in the Perl community .
Perl related foundations The Perl Foundation ( TPF ) , YAPC Europe Foundation ( YEF ) , Enlightened Perl Organization ( EPO ) , Japan Perl Association , Italian Perl Association , and probably a few other local Perl organizations .
All of these organizations are filled by people from the Perl community who are already volunteer their time and in cases some of their money too for the advancement of Perl .
Some conclusion
Let 's accept that there are many individuals and companies that have clear financial interest in the well being of the Perl ecosystem .
Some of these people are even members of the open source Perl Community and some of these companies already support the Perl community .
Let 's not be shy and talk to all of these people and companies so we can use their expertise and money too to promote
Perl so more people will be involved and to understand how to improve Perl and the Perl ecosystem to better serve the market .
( aka marketing Perl ) .
Update In October 2010 the Perl Ecosystem Group was established .
Synergy Research Group released their newest report „ Carrier VoIP Q4 2009 and YE 2009 market shares ” that shows that the worldwide market for Carrier VoIP totaled just over $ 10 billion for the full year 2009 .
Year over year , the market fell 18 percent ; significantly less than drops measured in other Telecom and IT equipment markets .
The biggest drivers for Carrier VoIP traditionally have been migrating aging TDM PSTN switches to VoIP platforms .
In the last 24 months further growth has been added with Mobile Operators pursuing the Capex and OpEx advantages of IP as did the Wireline networks before it .
According to Synergy , mobile deployments for Carrier VoIP have made a serious impact on market sizes and market players for the VoIP Media
“ Gateway market .
Over the last 2 years the changes have been dramatic and change continues with GENBAND ’s impending acquisition of Nortel ’s CVAS group .
The move by GENBAND will garner a market share position twice that of their nearest competitor , ” say analysts .
Synergy believes that IMS will have a strong impact on the Carrier VoIP market over the coming years .
In 2009 , it was clear that IMS made its mark as a highly viable and transformational service delivery platform for both fixed line and mobile carriers .
One such marquee IMS example is AT&T ’s U - Verse network where they have added over 1 Million IMS VoIP subscribers in the last 12 months .
" Although IMS has been around for a number of years , it clearly showed its potential in 2009 , " said Jeremy Duke , Principal Analyst and Founder , Synergy Research Group .
" Synergy believes 2010 will show more IMS market development with increased deployments and continued industry cooperation such as that seen with the One Voice Initiative . "
Another growing area being tracked by Synergy includes the GGSN / SGSN and PDN equipment markets .
Synergy says that with Smart Phone usage increasing , a tidal wave of data and video traffic is building that will force mobile operators to make large investments to contend with the change in traffic .
“ We anticipate seeing more vendor activity here as vendors jockey to position themselves to take advantage of this network investment — as seen with Cisco acquiring Starent in late 2009 , ” says Synergy .
Eliminating a pest infestation is usually less challenging as people envision it to be , in spite of how significant it will be .
Pests will undoubtedly bring about some damage , both to the person ’s health or even his house , so ignoring minimal indications of an infestation will not be a good idea .
Being aware of precisely what bugs are present within your house is going to be essential in eliminating them entirely .
You might also desire to watch out for this component when you ’re investing in a new home to reside in .
Make sure that you check out the entire property or home for signs and symptoms of bug infestations before you decide to move forward with the purchase .
If you find excrement of insects about , there might be an infestation .
A single bug will depict at the very least 6 times the whole volume of bugs you could discover nearby .
Getting a periodical bug wandering far from its colony to your home in search for food and water is very improbable .
In many cases , the nest would have been established or is within the beginning stages of being formed inside your household already .
It may be a complete waste of your time looking for the nests of the bugs however .
Having said that , even though you do find the nest , it is usually incredibly hard to reach that area .
Bug nests are commonly constructed in the crevices in the wall surfaces , the floor or at dimly lit sites in which human activity is nominal .
Other examples would be an untouched attic room of the property , due to the fact that human activity there is minimum .
This means that you will need to regularly clean up any mess around or simply keep a clean setting simply because that will stop any pests from setting up their nests there .
Ants have been found to be the most challenging as well as prevalent pest worldwide .
Ant poison is readily the most effective way of ruining entire colonies since the ants will infect each other until eventually all of them are dead .
Yet another remarkably bothersome bug that lots of people are fearful of would be the roaches .
Simply because roaches contain the capacity for transmitting tons of germs that can cause several illnesses , they are generally dreaded .
Diarrhea is customarily the leading condition that roaches can cause if you accidentally consume their waste or urine in the slightest bit .
As roaches will continuously be searching for water , prevalent areas of inhabitancy include the bathroom or even the kitchen .
You might find that the normal insect sprays for other insects are useless against roaches because they have a higher level of resistance towards light poison .
As such , you will want to kill roaches using poison that are much more concentrated than the usual pesticides or chemical - based products .
To find the best roach killer to effectively eliminate roaches in under a week , click here .
The ideal roach killers would be poison that are especially designed for them or traps that can bring in the majority of them at the same time .
Should you have many cabinets or compartments inside your kitchen , you have to be particularly careful while preparing your meals since roach excrement can have extremely infectious germs like E. coli which can result in extreme dehydration or any other signs that require hospitalization .
Most property owners are affected by bed bug infestations in their residences , specifically in the bedrooms .
Their bites are a lot like mosquito bites , which are pretty much pain - free .
Bed bugs usually feed during the night time so discovering them within the act will probably be tough .
Bites from these bugs can look much like mosquito bites therefore they are typically dismissed .
A bedbug infestation is able to spread quickly mainly because they can stick onto your clothing or bags just before they get off and begin populating a different location .
You simply must eliminate these insects using an in - depth approach , if at all possible with the help of an exterminator or comparable solutions .
Everyone loves an apocalypse , and none more so than the one that sped the dinosaurs to their now legendary status .
Having been a popular theory for 30 years , last week scientists finally reached a consensus that it was indeed the after - effects of a juggernaut meteorite crashing 65 million years ago into what we now call Chicxulub in Mexico that triggered the end of the dinosaurs ' reign on Earth .
The reasons for loving this particular catastrophe are easy to understand .
Dinosaurs are awesome .
Giant meteorites are awesome .
And of course , the combination of the two opened the door for the rise of the mammals .
Our own story begins with that cataclysm .
" Consensus " has unfortunately become a dirty word outside the scientific world , thanks to those who disagree with the overwhelming majority of scientists about man-made global warming , but fail to offer any science in return .
Unlike climate change , though , many issues remain with this extinction event .
Sixty - five million years later , the pattern of extinction looks decidedly uneven .
Dinosaurs were wiped out , but many similar - sized crocodiles survived .
Amphibians managed to come out of this apocalypse relatively unscathed .
Sharks survived , but plesiosaurs perished .
Much work remains to be done .
Nevertheless , this consensus on the fate of the dinosaurs is welcomed by people such as me who worry about such things .
But let 's not get too attached to it .
On the grand scale of extinctions , the Chicxulub meteorite is a drop in the ocean .
There have been five major extinctions in the history of life .
251 million years ago was the big mama , erasing 95 % of sea species and 70 % of land life .
It is important to recognise that although 10 - mile - wide rocks crashing from space are not the norm , extinction itself is .
About 97 % of all species that have ever existed currently do not .
We may be in the midst of a mass extinction , though probably not on the scale of those 65 or 251 million years ago .
Up to a third of all species are " committed to extinction " , according to current models .
But it is the speed at which we are losing species that is truly significant .
The explosion caused by the Chicxulub meteorite would have been enormous , melting rocks into glass , and vomiting forth mile - high tsunamis .
But do n't assume that the dinosaurs abruptly keeled over .
In the aptly named Hell Creek in Montana , dinosaur fossils have been found dating from up to 40,000 years after the impact .
Climate change is also the planetary norm , but the rate at which the climate is changing since industrialisation is unprecedented .
This is reason enough to accept the scientific consensus that we are the root cause , and the same goes for current extinctions .
We have evolved the capability to partially excuse ourselves from natural cataclysms , at least at a species level .
Our ability to adapt and survive far outstrips the speed of the same process in natural selection .
Should a colossal rock fall from the sky and block out the sun for a thousand years , the effect on humankind would be devastating , but not terminal .
Should we continue to ravage the Earth 's resources to the extent that human life is unsustainable , it is not in the realm of total fantasy for us to ditch this planet , and set up somewhere else in the universe .
But these are not reasons to be complacent .
We exist as a part of this planet , not merely on it .
The loss of biodiversity from a mass extinction will be devastating to everyone 's lives .
Unlike with the previous extinctions , we have the power to slow this current one .
We will all have to change our lifestyles to adapt to the world that we have created , but by moderating our impact on extinction , that change wo n't have to be apocalyptic .
The publishing industry ’s alarm over the electronic book is n’t based on current use .
Last year , less than 2 percent of all books sold were e-books , according to Bowker , which tracks the industry .
By contrast , trade paperbacks and hardcovers made up approximately 35 percent each of unit sales , Bowker says .
Mass market paperbacks came in at 21 percent .

But we all know how fast technology can take hold .
Not long ago , e-commerce sites like Amazon.com were just a blip on the bookselling scene , and now they are major players .
DOOMSDAY .
The end of civilisation .
Literature and film abound with tales of plague , famine and wars which ravage the planet , leaving a few survivors scratching out a primitive existence amid the ruins .
Every civilisation in history has collapsed , after all .
Why should ours be any different ?
Doomsday scenarios typically feature a knockout blow : a massive asteroid , all - out nuclear war or a catastrophic pandemic ( see “ Will a pandemic bring down civilisation ? ” ) .
Yet there is another chilling possibility : what if the very nature of civilisation means that ours , like all the others , is destined to collapse sooner or later ?
A few researchers have been making such claims for years .
Disturbingly , recent insights from fields such as complexity theory suggest that they are right .
It appears that once a society develops beyond a certain level of complexity it becomes increasingly fragile .
Eventually , it reaches a point at which even a relatively minor disturbance can bring everything crashing down .
Some say we have already reached this point , and that it is time to start thinking about how we might manage collapse .
Others insist it is not yet too late , and that we can – we must – act now to keep disaster at bay .
Environmental mismanagement
History is not on our side .
Think of Sumeria , of ancient Egypt and of the Maya .
In his 2005 best - seller Collapse , Jared Diamond of the University of California , Los Angeles , blamed environmental mismanagement for the fall of the Mayan civilisation and others , and warned that we might be heading the same way unless we choose to stop destroying our environmental support systems .

Welcome to Things From The Future , where we take annoying ass market research surveys and then show you some ( possible ) things from the future !
As an introductory post , we have for you some possible upcoming beer container designs , some good and some that , well , you ’ll see …
- The Good -
The Quick Cool Core :
Who can complain about beer that is colder quicker and for longer ?
This one is a pretty cool idea …
The Twist Top :
Another good one , who does n’t like beer to stay fresher and colder longer ( especially a 40 ) , though it would probably be better if they could combine it with the next item on the list .
The Draft Spout :
I do n’t know how or if this works , but if it does sign me up , nothing makes cheap - ass beer taste better than getting it out of a keg instead of a bottle .
The Offset Neck :
Having enjoyed more than my fair share of beers in my day , I appreciate something that makes me less likely to spill beer all over myself while drunk , though it is somewhat reminiscent of a motor oil jug .
- The Bad -
The “ Classic ” 40 :
Edward 40 - Hands just would n’t be the same without the very real danger of having heavy ass glass 40s taped to your hands while drinking two of them .
The Flip - N - Snap / Pop Top :
This is the kind of shit that should be reserved for little kid ’s sippy cups .
We all get sloppy sometimes but these are just insulting .
Grooves :
I call bullshit on this doing anything at all to keep your beer colder .
- The Fucking Stupid -
Flavoring / Vitamin Spray :
Man Law – Beer should never contain vitamin or flavor sprays .
Smooth Flow :
Reminds me of periods and looks like a flower vase .
I ’d feel more manly drinking beer out of a coconut with a little umbrella .

The right has screwed up this nation too thoroughly for us to just acquiesce to CNN giving a platform to the latest overrated stooge of concorporate hegemons .
As the past few years have proved , they own or control most of this nation where it counts , and even when progressives score gains ( as we just did with Health Care Reform ) , there is still a huge question mark hovering over the future of the United States .
A recovering economy will not mask the near - kleptocratic nature of what our modern predatory - capitalist - system - run - amok has become .
Through one of many proxies like Redstate , the corporate and conservative elites use massive private funding networks to distribute professionally crafted propaganda masking as " grass roots " efforts .
Their work is designed to prey on the emotions and fears of an almost fundamentalist fervor amongst the ignorant Teahadist soldiers they are whipping up across the nation .
The primary goal is to convince these gullible — or just rich , mean , racist , or stupid — people , that the administration that inherited the burden of fixing the economic malaise they created , are actually the people who caused them in the first place .
And when you have a 24 hour news channel ( Fox News ) devoted to such efforts , it 's really not all that hard to sell such foolishness to the proles .
This professionally - crafted and marketed lying has gone on far too long — and it 's wrecking this nation .
And yet , as I type this , the US Chamber of Commerce is gearing up to spend more millions of dollars in local elections .
Precisely the kind of spending secured with the kind of right - wing propaganda that HumanEvents , Redstate , and Erick Erickson represent ( often literally ) .

Two Israeli soldiers involved in the Gaza Strip offensive a year ago used a 9 - year - old Palestinian boy as a human shield to open packages they believed were booby - trapped with explosives , the Israeli army charged Thursday .
The soldiers , whose names were not released , have been indicted in military court for “ unauthorized conduct ” and “ exceeding their authority in a manner that endangered life or health , ” the army said .
The boy , whose case was forwarded to the Israel Defense Forces by the United Nations , was unharmed .
The soldiers could face a maximum sentence of three years if convicted , an army spokesman said .
The criminal charges are believed to be the first related to combat brought against Israeli soldiers for their actions during the 22 - day Gaza assault .
A previous criminal case was brought against soldiers accused of looting a credit card .
About 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed during the operation , which Israel launched in an attempt to halt Palestinian rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israeli cities .
Human rights groups and a U.N. commission have accused Israel ’s military of committing war crimes and targeting civilians during the operation .
They have called for Israel to appoint an independent inquiry to review the military ’s conduct , but Israel has said its military court is capable of reviewing the matter internally .
Military officials said they are reviewing about 30 criminal cases .
Last month , the army said it had disciplined two top commanders for permitting shelling near a U.N. compound where civilians had taken refuge .
Michael Sfard , an Israeli attorney who represents soldiers who went public with complaints about the military ’s conduct in Gaza , called the army ’s indictment “ very little and very late . ”
He noted that his group , Breaking the Silence , tried to bring attention to the use of human shields in Gaza a year ago , but was subjected to blistering attacks from the government .
“ They dismissed everything out of hand , ” Sfard said .
“ Now a year later they ’ve found that one of the practices took place .
If the state of Israel had conceded to calls for an [ external ] investigation , I ’m sure they would have found by now other practices to be true too . ”

A poll lead as small as two percentage points , hostile mutterings from the cheap seats , and only weeks until the general election – what has been happening to the Tories ?
Explanations for their recent wobble have included the fuzziness of Conservative policy , the public 's queasiness about a looming age of austerity , and much more besides , but at least part of the story is traceable to an unassuming 41 - year - old called Clifford Singer , and one of the most inspired acts of online mischief British politics has yet seen .
On 5 January , the Tories launched their first big move of the campaign .
At a cost of around £ 500,000 , they hired 759 billboard sites across the country , and plastered them with a now - infamous image of David Cameron and the words , " We can't go on like this .
I 'll cut the deficit , not the NHS . "
At first , coverage focused on the apparent airbrushing of Cameron 's features ( denied in his recent interview with Trevor McDonald ) , and the clear echo of prime - period Tony Blair .
But within a fortnight , the story had gone somewhere rather unexpected : to a website titled mydavidcameron.com , and an ever - expanding selection of spoof artwork , which cut straight to the heart of not only the poster 's absurdity , but the often depressingly empty nature of modern politics .
Initially , Singer – a web specialist and left - aligned political activist – had put up two Cameron mock - ups of his own , but then he watched scores more arrive in his inbox .
For a few days , the people responsible used Photoshop ; then , unprompted , someone else came up with an easy - to - use online generator , whereby you could simply type in your own slogans , and the programming did the rest of the work .
The result was an avalanche : word spread via Twitter and Facebook , and soon enough , well over 150,000 designs had been created .
Some , Singer says , were all potty - mouthed insults and class warfare ( " a lot calling Cameron a cunt , and quite a few quoting the lyrics of Eton Rifles by the Jam " ) .
The best , though , had a subtlety that made them very funny indeed : my favourite remains the addition of headphones on Cameron , with the words , " Little Boots , actually . "
" For a period of time , " Singer tells me , " I was spending most evenings sitting in bed with my partner , just looking at posters .
It went viral very quickly : by day eight , we were on about 16,000 unique visitors every 24 hours . "
The story ballooned in ways that must have had some
Tory high - ups chewing their knuckles .
The spoof billboards were picked up by everyone from Sun columnist Jane Moore to the electro - pop quintet Hot Chip .
In short order , mydavidcameron.com spoofed two more Tory posters : the dig at Labour 's alleged plans for a new " death tax " that features a gravestone , and the new campaign featuring an array of real - life voters and slogans based around the words , " I 've never voted Tory before , but . . . "
( Suggestions included : " this fox stew tastes delicious " , " being unemployed sounds like fun " , and " married people are just better " . )
In turn , the people in charge of Tory activist website ConservativeHome set up their own clearing - house for anti-Labour spoofs , MyLabourPosters – though in the absence of any high - profile Labour billboards , they resorted to rather unfunny rewrites of Tory posters , some of which were described by marketing website Brand Republic as " really offensive and sinister " .
By the end of February , even veterans of the political game were declaring that something fundamental had changed .
Michael Portillo acknowledged that , thanks to the first Cameron billboards , any clear Tory message had been " lost in ribaldry over giant images of the leader 's face " , and Alastair Campbell asked the very timely question : " Has the political poster virtually had its day ? "
Labour , meanwhile , served notice that it was abandoning high - street billboards altogether – a move largely reducible to the dreadful state of its finances , but it fitted neatly into the bigger story .
As a taste of how this year 's general election will differ from every poll that has preceded it , the mydavidcameron.com saga takes some beating .
" Increasingly , the attempt to create a very top - down , marketing - led kind of politics is coming under a lot of pressure , " Singer agrees .
" Suddenly , everyone has a say .
I 'm cynical about stuff saying that the net has changed everything , but I think that in this area , there is a democratising process . "
Gordon Brown in a spoof poster from mylabourposters .
In 2005 , the general election was run according to the usual conventions .
There was the odd tactical voting site , aimed at giving Labour a fright ( I co-ran sonowwhodowevotefor.net , based on the book of the same name ) , a smattering of election - related blogs , and the usual online coverage from big media outlets – but by and large , events had a very analogue flavour .
YouTube was only two months old ; Twitter and Facebook were n't even invented .
Back in the 1980s , the main parties grasped the tightly controlled ways of media manipulation – and give or take such wheezes as John Major 's famous soapbox , every Tory and Labour campaign since has followed much the same template : presentational gloss , top - down management , and precious few of the mishaps the political world calls " gaffes " .
This time , things will be rather different .
Parties , large and small , are enthusiastically using what they still insist on calling " new technology " , and rather clumsily adjusting to its implications .
Among their other digital endeavours , the Tories are spending a good deal of cash advertising on Facebook , trying to snare the attention of the 23 million Britons said to use it .
Labour has promised a " massive " drive for online donations , supposedly modelled on the internet magic worked by Barack Obama , and led by the unlikely figure of David Blunkett .
A blog now represents the minimum required
Both parties have come up with special iPhone apps for their activists ( Shaun Bailey , the Tory candidate for Hammersmith in London , has the distinction of being the first candidate with an app all of his own ) .
Ed Miliband , charged with putting together Labour 's manifesto , is appealing for ideas online , while for all three main party leaders , catering to the Mumsnet vote seems as important as any of the standard electioneering stuff .
While nowhere near the online sophistication of politics in the US , the UK may finally be ready for things that are securely built into American debate : not just internet fundraising and advertising , but viral campaigning , websites run way beyond old party structures , and the kind of citizen journalism that has real clout .
For any serious candidate , a blog represents the bare minimum of what the online world now requires , though such activity brings plenty of danger .
As one Labour blogger recently put it , " Blogs , tweets and Facebook are actually more likely to be what loses a party the election than what wins it .
One ill - considered email , tweet or blog post by a candidate or campaigner can provide a lot of ammo for the old - fashioned media to shred a party 's campaign with . "
In other words , only one thumb - twitch may lie between a modest local campaign and a big national story .
In October last year , the Labour minister Ben Bradshaw was derided for a crass tweet responding to David Cameron 's speech at Tory conference , making reference to his disabled son Ivan and the care he received thanks to " Labour 's investment and reform " .
Then in January , in the close - run seat of Brighton Pavilion , Tory candidate Charlotte Vere was pilloried for tweeting a link to a blog that compared the Green party to the BNP .
And last month , in a plotline worthy of The Thick of It , a hapless - looking Labour whip called David Wright became the latest politician to be plunged into Twitter - related trouble , via the hilarious line , " I 've never voted Tory because you can put lipstick on a scum - sucking pig , but it 's still a scum - sucking pig . "
Rather unconvincingly , Wright claimed that an unidentified menace had been " tinkering with my tweets " , but for a couple of Labour high - ups , that fate has been real enough : both Harriet Harman and Ed Miliband have recently been the victims of the online naughtiness known as " phishing " , whereby accounts are hacked , and tweets can be not just tinkered with but completely made up .
At the same time , news surfaced of a web operation called The Year of Collaboration , which had set up unauthorised accounts in the names of scores of MPs and begun tweeting the highlights of their contributions in the House Of Commons .
Twitter is becoming a byword for a chaos that political parties cannot abide .
Small wonder , then , that Conservative HQ is said to now insist that any material to be blogged or tweeted must be approved by what a Daily Mail headline called " the Tory Twitter police " .
The official line is that such vetting applies only to pronouncements on policy , though at least one Tory insider I have spoken to claims that " with some candidates , they want to see everything " – underlining the tension that exists between devolved , spontaneous digital media , and the controlling instincts of big party machines .
Most interest is focused on the blogs and websites that may align themselves with the main parties , but remain outside their direct control .
Among the most high - profile are Labour List and Left Foot Forward ; the right 's most - read outlet remains ConservativeHome , now majority - owned by the money - dripping Tory non-dom Lord Ashcroft ( though its two - man staff lay claim to continued editorial independence ) .
To be fair , we should also mention the activist website Lib Dem Voice .
' Technology has broken the old monopoly of comment '
But beyond these outlets lies the great tangle of online sources that may not yet be household names – but that , as in the case of Singer and mydavidcameron.com , could create plenty of heat .
And it is mention of the latter that often prompts the most excited talk .
" Technology has broken the old monopoly of comment , " says Tim Montgomerie , ConservativeHome 's co-editor .
" Now we 're going to see much more interesting monopolies being broken .
Certainly , the monopoly of party political broadcasts is over : at this election , anyone can make one , and it's all completely unregulated .
It 'll probably be some amateur in their bedroom making a funny video – that 's what 'll take off . "
Already , online evidence is there in abundance , from a mildly amusing clip that casts George Osborne in the video for Culture Club 's Karma Chameleon ( Boy George – geddit ? ) , a brilliantly retooled episode of Thunderbirds titled Webcameronbirds Are Go , to wheezes so well - executed you cannot help but suspect the involvement of political insiders .
Last month , a video game appeared online whereby players have to steer Alistair Darling away from the " forces of hell " represented by Gordon Brown , Ed Balls and their former attack - dog Damien McBride – Pac - Man for Westminster anoraks .
Montgomerie mentions another fascinating aspect of how coverage online will alter traditional power balances during the campaign – by focusing no end of forensic attention not just on politicians , but the orthodox media .
" It always seems to me that there are lots of cosy clubs where the media do n't criticise each other , " he says .
" That 's not going to be true any more .
Commentators will be savaged if they do sloppy or unbalanced journalism ; people who have n't had to look over their shoulders will be forced to do so . "
He says ConservativeHome 's habit of rocking the boat may well lead them into sharp critiques of that age - old rightwing bugbear , the BBC .
" Certainly , I think one of ConservativeHome 's big jobs in the election is to watch the broadcasters .
We can go harder on the BBC than the parties can .
I 'm sure the left will do the same . "
When I talk to Paul " Guido Fawkes " Staines , though , he claims " the main way the blogosphere and its bastard sister the Twittersphere affects the political world is still via the traditional media – because the most avid followers of blogs and tweets are journalists . "
Not unreasonably , he puts his own influence down to " grabbing the attention of the media class – I think I 've got the ability to do that , so I can push an agenda . "
His key plan for the election is to make his " Guy News " films – pitched midway between the rib - tickling work of Newsnight 's Michael Crick and that Saturday morning classic Tiswas , and apparently watched by between 10,000 and 20,000 people – a once - daily online event , at least .
His people will be out way beyond Westminster , following both the campaign and media coverage of it .
" If we catch candidates doing things they should n't , " Staines says , " and we get video of it , then it 's going to get re-broadcast on TV . "
When I ask him what he wants to get out of the election , his camped - up answer comes back in a flash : " A good time .
And have no doubt : I 'll be claiming victory . "
Two or three years ago , Guido Fawkes and ConservativeHome were held up as proof that the online world was dominated by the political right .
But in the last year or so there has been a rebalancing of forces , as the left has started to find its voice and take aim at the prospect of a Conservative government .
As Will Straw from Left Foot Forward puts it , online outlets suit " oppositional " voices better than those trying to make a positive case – as proved by the fact that his own site ( a home , as its strap - line puts it , for " evidence - based political blogging " ) has found its voice via sharp critiques of the Tories .
" What Labour and its supporters have done is position themselves in opposition to the threat of a Tory government , " he says .
" We had nothing to go on before , but now we can pick apart policy and the possibility of , say , George Osborne being chancellor .
I also think it 's fair to say that Labour has more young activists , which will mean a bit of difference .
There are many , many people online who are engaged in leftwing issues : the environment , development , poverty .
When push comes to shove , they 'd rather have a Labour government than a Tory one . "
Different kinds of activism
While the left and right duke it out , other people are busy with rather different kinds of activism .
The team behind a site called The Straight Choice are appealing for scans of local election leaflets , to go into an already - bulging archive – because , as the site 's co-founder Julian Todd puts it , " that 's where most of the actual campaigning happens ; if you want to find out what a political party actually does , that 's the place to look . "
At Your Next MP , another crew of volunteers are putting together a database of every candidate standing , which currently stands at 2,432 .
( " We are completely neutral , " they advise .
" You have to make your own choice . " )
Both projects are linked to Democracy Club , an enterprise dreamed up by Seb Bacon , a 34 - year - old resident of Glasgow .
Work is still in progress , but he has already signed up more than 4,000 volunteers .
Among the site 's founding ideas , Bacon tells me , are " giving people an opportunity to engage with politics in simple , small , achievable ways " , " holding politicians to account " , and " ensuring there 's transparency and accountability at the election " .
So you can , for example , discover that landfill is a hot topic in Arundel and South Downs ; that a new bypass is desperately needed in North Cornwall ; and that " the general condition of rear access roads in Harehills " is big news in Leeds East .
Bacon aims to convert all this stuff into lists of questions for each and every candidate , and thereby make a stand for local accountability .
" The other thing is , I 'd really like people to vote for candidates because they have some insight into who they are , not just on party lines , " he says .
" There 's going to be a particularly high turnover of new MPs at this election , and I 'd like people to be interested in who 's representing them .
I think people are fed up , rather than apathetic ; I want to give people the chance to show that . "
Over at mydavidcameron.com , the more mischievous Singer is planning his next move .
Having already announced he would n't be spoofing the next Conservative ad campaign , he is trying to think of something more ambitious – " maybe involving video " – though no firm plans have yet taken shape .
What struck him about the endless poster - spoofs , Singer says , was how mean - spirited some of them were – particularly those anti-Labour designs .
Proof , perhaps , that as an idea spreads online , subtlety and humour tend to fall away , and the prevailing mood usually turns nasty .
" That 's what it 's felt like , " he says .
" But maybe there 's a simpler explanation : that Tories can't really do humour . "
So , I took the easy route : I simply contacted the same national florist delivery service that was used 6 years ago , got a callback from Tina at Coast to Coast Florist , and lo and behold , we 're all set !!
SO , here 's the deal : Coast - to - Coast Florist is gonna give us the same special pricing that they gave for the Boxer campaign : Just $ 10 to send 3 roses direct to Speaker Pelosi 's Washington D.C. office !
To add your order , simply call : 1 866 596 1860 .
You can send more than 3 roses , but it 's a flat $ 10 per batch of 3 .
They 'll take your name and credit card info , and you 'll be all set .
They can take orders right up through this evening .
All roses will be delivered to her D.C. office on Friday , as a combination Thank You / Happy Birthday from those of us who admire her amazing accomplishment in pulling this thing off .
To help spread the word , link back to this diary , or to the official link on Coast to Coast 's website .
Other ways to say thanks :
Join the facebook group wishing Speaker Pelosi a happy birthday and thanking her for healthcare reform .
( Must log in after following link . )
Write her a thank you note .
Donate money to her reelection fund .
Donate to other tight - race candidates that supported HCR .
To answer some of the FAQs :
-- The campaign has blossomed ( pun intended ) to more than 1,900 roses in just 3 days .
I 've been posting updates as new numbers come in , and will try to do so throughout the day .
-- No , I do n't have any specific target in mind .
As a point of comparison , the Sen .
Boxer campaign ended up with over 4,500 roses being sent , but they also had a full 2 weeks ; we have 4 days , so there 's no " competition " going on .
As many as people want to send , I guess .
-- The delivery of the roses has been all arranged for and confirmed by Coast to Coast 's D.C. associate , Conklyn's of Alexandria , VA .
They also happen to be the same florist that handles all of the Pentagon 's accounts , so this should be in good hands .
-- Yes , I 'm well aware that the roses wo n't last forever .
In Sen .
Boxer 's case , she ended up donating them to the wounded soldiers at Bethesda and Walter Reed .
I do n't know exactly what Speaker Pelosi will do with a couple thousand roses , but I presume it 'll be something along those lines .
-- I'm thinking over how to word the card , and will be finalizing it with my contact at Coast to Coast later on today .
We both figured I should wait until we had a better idea of just how many roses there would be before deciding on the wording !
-- Speaker Pelosi 's staff does know all about it ; I could n't expect her staff to just have something like this dumped on them with no warning ; they do have jobs to do and everything ...
-- I'm quite certain that the Speaker knows about it as well ; it was originally supposed to be a surprise for her , but come on , it 's the age of Twitter and this is a viral online campaign .
-- I could n't verify whether or not Pelosi will actually be there for the delivery , but I 'm sure her staff will do their best .
There 's no way she 's gonna leave D.C. before this Senate reconciliation business is done with anyway , so she should be around .
-- Yes , some people have started contacting some press contacts .
I have no idea how much coverage there will be , but I would think that the media would be all over it once they get ahold of the story ; it 'd make great TV to have pics of Speaker Pelosi surrounded by a zillion roses .
They love that stuff .
Plus , of course , it'd be fantastic PR for not just Pelosi , but the HCR law as well as the Dems in general to show the strong support they all have out here .
-- Plus , as noted in the title of this diary , this sort of positive PR is even stronger when contrasted with the hate - filled , nasty death threats and bricks being thrown through windows by the wingnuts .
They throw rocks .
We send roses .
The contrast could n't be clearer .
-- Coast to Coast has made arrangements to accept orders 24 hours a day through this evening , so you can call in your order any time between now and then !
I think they 're cutting it off at around 9 pm , but I 'll double - check to be sure .
-- No , you ca n't use PayPal for this particular campaign .
Again , I 'd just call them up at 1 866 596 1860 .
-- If you want an order receipt just ask for one when you place your order and they 'll email it to you .
-- Many people have pointed out that , as nice as roses on her birthday are , donating to her campaign would be a more practical / useful thing to do with our money , I say this :
Yes , you 're probably correct , and yes , I strongly urge people to also donate to her re-election fund -- or to other deserving candidates -- but it never hurts to also show a non-financial gesture of thanks to someone who 's doing their job well .
-- I should also call attention to Steven D's diary , which goes into the back story about just how much credit Speaker Pelosi deserves for this victory .
I do n't agree with every decision that she 's made -- in fact , I 've strongly disagreed with her on many issues .
HOWEVER , given what an unholy mess the whole HCR process had become , and given the realities of where things were at both politically and procedurally , it 's absolutely astonishing that she pulled this off , and she should be commended heartily for doing so .
-- There was a poll yesterday about whether to keep pushing for as many roses as possible to get the biggest PR benefit , or to wind the thing down as " point made " in favor of more " practical " donations like swing - district candidate campaign funds and so forth .
The " push for as many roses as you can ! " choice won handily with 80 % of the vote , so there it is .
It ends tonight anyway , so let 's have fun with it !
Update : Over 2,000 roses as of 9:30 am !
Action Alert : OK , I guess the next logical step here would be to see about some actual media coverage !
I was actually contacted by someone from Pelosi 's office yesterday to get some details about the flower delivery , but to be honest , I have no idea whether they plan on doing any direct media contact themselves ; they did n't commit to anything specific .
Perhaps they figured it would be best if that sort of thing is handled at our end , to maintain the true grassroots ( or flower roots ? ) nature of this thing ( and perhaps that 's for the best anyway ) .
Soooooo ... if anyone out there wants to make a few calls or send a few emails to the appropriate contacts , please feel free to do so .
I do n't have an exact delivery time beyond " Friday morning " yet , but will let you know if I hear anything more specific .
It 's conceivable that with the security concerns of the past few days , that sort of info might not be made available .
Update x2 : I just wanted to repost a fantastic comment from G2geek below that nicely sumarizes the difference between the two parties ( or at least between the two ideologies ) :
By this time Stupak has realized a few things :
Many of his supporters are worse than fair - weather friends , some of them are two - faced rabid monsters who know no boundaries of decency , or even the boundaries of the law .
His opponents here on the progressive side can cuss up a storm and threaten to have him primaried back to the private sector , but we do not threaten violence against public officials .
We 'll protect and stand up for anyone , even someone we ferociously disagree with , if they are threatened with violence .
If someone published a hit message on Boner or any of the most recalcitrant Republicans in the pack , we'd be helping the FBI find out who they were and get them arrested .
This is the difference between politics as a contact sport between teams that play by the rules , and politics as a blood feud where there are no rules .
Update x3 : OK , I 've started working on the wording of the note / card .
I 've posted a poll to see if there 's any consensus on what general direction to take ...
To be honest , the biggest thing I can't decide on is whether to direct it towards her and her alone , or to also include some mention of the other 218 members of the Democratic House Caucus who voted Yes as well .
Certainly they deserve some recognition as well , but perhaps that should be inherently understood already with this gesture ?
Update x4 : Over 2,100 roses !
Update x5 : The official cut - off time for placing your order is tonight at 10:00 pm EST .
Update x6 : Several people have reported their calls being routed to the wrong florist ( " Beneva " is Coast to Coast 's sister company ) .
It sounds like their phone lines are being overwhelmed , and may have some sort of automatic routing switch thing that takes you to an alternate florist after a certain amount of time on hold .
So , it 's possible that you may end up getting a florist who does n't know anything about this campaign .
I 've alerted Coast to Coast about the issue and will let you know what they say ; meanwhile , my recommendation is to try again a bit later .
OK , I just heard back :
Our phone system went down for 20 minutes but calls where still ringing in .
We are back up and working fine now , it was an internet issue .
Update x7 : OK , looks like the diary is about to fall off the Rec radar .
If someone wants to repost it , I 'll be happy to direct people towards it to hopefully keep this listed throughout the day .
( And yes , I 'm well aware that there are other , more important stories going on today that could use exposure -- mostly about the lunatics threatening Dem members of Congress -- but this campaign is at least diametrically connected with those stories .
Besides , this campaign will be over tomorrow . )
Update x8 : Y 'know , yesterday -- and in a few comments today -- there were a few people who griped about how this is a waste of money / time / effort / flowers / etc , and that we should donate the same $ 10 to a tight - race Democratic campaign , or the DCCC , or a charity , or ( fill in the blank here ) .
My response to that is : Fine , then do so .
I 've included several alternate links , and many of us are doing both .
One does n't preclude the other .
However , let me ask you this :
Have YOU ever spent money on flowers for someone ?
Or gone to the movies ?
Or bought a friggin ' cheeseburger ?
If so , how come YOU did n't donate that money to charity / a deserving campaign / whatever ?
In other words , stop telling other people what they SHOULD do with their money .
If people want to buy 3 flowers , or 300 , or 3,000 , or 3 million for Speaker Pelosi ( or the other Dems who voted for the HCR bill , or their wives / girlfriends / mothers / daughters ) , that 's their call to make .
As for the flowers being " wasted " , as noted repeatedly , Sen .
Boxer donated her Valentine 's Day roses ( all 4,500 of them ) to wounded soldiers at Walter Reed and Bethesda -- I presume Pelosi will do something similar .
Besides , if we 're able to get some decent press coverage , it could be worth far more in positive PR than the money spent on the flowers -- which , by the way , is going to help small businesses in Florida and DC , I should remind you .
That is all .
Update x9 : Well , in addition to being picked up by perhaps a dozen blogs ( mostly comments within blog stories , but still ) , I found this amusing quip from Roll Call 's " Heard on the Hill " ( subscription required for the whole story , but I think we can guess the gist ) :
Wie steht es nun um das Handelsabkommen ACTA ?
Um Gerüchten zu begegnen und zumindest einen Schritt zu mehr Transparenz zu machen , hat die EU - Kommission am Montag zu einer Konsultation nach Brüssel eingeladen .
Viel erfuhren die etwa 150 angereisten Interessenvertreter nicht .
Gerüchte wollte Kommissionsvertreter Luc Devigne ausdrücklich nicht besprechen , er versicherte aber , dass das umstrittene Abkommen keine Änderung substantiellen Rechts in der EU vorsehe .
Devigne , der für die Kommission die ACTA - Verhandlungen führt , betonte , dass das Abkommen die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Mitgliedsländer der EU sichern soll .
Er widersprach ausdrücklich Gerüchten , wonach die EU im Zuge des ACTA - Prozesses die Einführung einer europaweiten Three - Strikes - Regelung vorbereite , bei der Provider Internetnutzern nach Urheberrechtsverstößen die Internetverbindung kappen sollen .
Niemand habe bei den Verhandlungen eine solche Maßnahme auch nur vorgeschlagen , verdeutlichte Devigne , " und wenn dieser Vorschlag auf den Tisch käme , würden wir ihn ablehnen . "
Auch die Behauptung , dass in Zukunft private Laptops an der Grenze nach illegal heruntergeladenen Dateien durchsucht werden sollen , sei falsch .
Die ACTA - Verhandlungen finden bisher unter Ausschluss der Öffentlichkeit statt .
Devigne erläuterte , bei internationalen Abkommen würden Ergebnisse nicht kommuniziert , bevor sie am Verhandlungstisch erreicht worden seien .
Die zahlreichen durchgesickerten Dokumente wollte Devigne nicht kommentieren .
Die Geheimniskrämerei stieß während der Konsultation in Brüssel auf große Ablehnung .
So beklagte ein Vertreter des Verbandes europäischer TK - Anbieter ETNO Informationsdefizite .
" Unsere Konkurrenten in den USA sind über die Fortschritte bestens informiert . "
Unterstützung bekam Devigne hingegen von anderen Industrievertretern .
So erklärten Vertreter des französischen Medienkonzerns Vivendi und der European Competitive Telecommunications Association ( ECTA ) ihre Unterstützung für das ACTA - Abkommen .
Mehrere EU - Parlamentarier nutzten die Sitzung , um die Kommission an die Resolution des EU - Parlaments zu erinnern , die sie zu mehr Transparenz verpflichten und von weiter gehenden Vereinbarungen abhalten sollte .
Devigne will aus der Resolution allerdings nicht mehr herauslesen , als eine Verpflichtung der Kommission , nicht gegen den Kanon der geltenden europäischen Gesetze , dem " acquis communautaire " , zu verstoßen .
Eine Verpflichtung sich bei den ACTA - Verhandlungen allein auf die Bekämpfung von Produktfälschungen zu beschränken und Neuregelungen zu einfachen Urheberrechtsverletzungen auszusparen , wollte Devigne nicht erkennen .
Auch bei der geforderten Abschätzung der Folgen des ACTA - Abkommens auf die Grundrechte der EU - Bürger machte der Kommissionsvertreter wenig Hoffnung : Die ACTA - Verhandlungen seien bisher noch nicht in einem Stadium , wo eine solche Folgeabschätzung sinnvoll sei .
Immerhin versprach er , dass die EU - Kommission bei der nächsten ACTA - Sitzung Mitte April in Neuseeland eine Offenlegung der Verhandlungsdokumente beantragen werde .
" Das ACTA - Abkommen behandelt ausdrücklich nur die Durchsetzung des Rechts , an dem Gesetz selbst wird substantiell nichts geändert " , erklärte Devigne .
So soll sich an der gesetzlichen Rolle und Haftung der Provider in Europa nichts ändern .
Strafrechtlich verfolgt werden sollen Urheberrechtsverstöße nur , wenn sie im " kommerziellen Umfang " stattfinden .
Wann ein solcher Umfang erreicht wird , ließ Devigne allerdings offen .
Die in Brüssel anwesenden Bürgerrechtsorganisationen gingen mit Devigne hart ins Gericht .
Jérémie Zimmermann von der französischen Organisation La Quadrature du
Net kritisierte , dass Devigne in seiner Präsentation eine von der Industrie finanzierte Studie zitierte , wonach durch Diebstahl geistigen Eigentums bis 2015 in Europa 1,2 Millionen Arbeitsplätze verloren gehen könnten .
Diese Studie basiere auf der Legende , dass für jede unbezahlte Kopie ein Original weniger verkauft werde , argumentierte Zimmermann .
Gegenüber heise online erklärte Zimmermann : " Heute haben wir nichts Neues erfahren " – die Kommission verstecke sich hinter dem " acquis communautaire " , der freilich stark interpretierbar sei .
So sieht Zimmermann die Gefahr , dass die Three - Strikes - Regel zwar nicht explizit im ACTA - Abkommen festgelegt werde , die Provider könnten aber durch erweiterte gesetzliche Haftungsregeln im Zuge der freiwilligen Selbstkontrolle zu einer eigenständigen Einführung des Modells gezwungen werden .
" Was immer als Nächstes passiert :
Es ist nicht nachzuvollziehen , dass diese Vertreter , die niemand gewählt hat , solche weitgehenden Grundrechtseingriffe verhandeln " , sagte Zimmermann .
Maurice Wessling von der niederländischen Verbraucherorganisation Consumentenbond sieht in der Konsultation wenigstens einen geringen Fortschritt : " Immerhin haben wir heute ganz klar gehört , dass die EU - Kommission keine Three - Strikes - Regelung akzeptieren will .
An dieses Wort werden wir sie später erinnern . " ( anw )
BRUSSELS 
The European Parliament on Thursday broadly rejected an agreement with the United States on sharing information about bank transfers that was aimed at tracking people suspected of being terrorists .
The vote underlined differences between the United States and the European Union over how to balance personal privacy guarantees with concerns on national and international security .
The agreement , rejected 378 to 196 with 31 abstentions , would have freed the United States from having to seek bank data on a country - by - country basis .
It went into effect provisionally at the start of February and was to last nine months while a more permanent arrangement was sought .
But many members of the Parliament complained that the agreement had failed to guarantee the privacy rights of European citizens .
Spurned in his effort to get out of jury duty , salesman Tony Prados turned his attention to the case that could cost him three weeks ’ pay : A Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputy was suing his former sergeant , alleging severe emotional distress inflicted by lewd and false innuendo that he was gay .
Prados , an ex-Marine , leaned forward in the jury box and asked in a let - me - get - this - straight tone of voice : “ He ’s brave enough to go out and get shot at by anyone but he could n’t handle this ? ” he said of the locker - room taunting .
Fellow jury candidate Robert Avanesian , who had also unsuccessfully sought dismissal on financial hardship grounds , chimed in : “ I think severe emotional distress is what is happening in Haiti .
I do n’t think you could have such severe emotional distress from that , ” he said of the allegations in the deputy ’s case .
The spontaneous outbursts of the reluctant jurors just as Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James R. Dunn was about to swear them in emboldened others in the jury pool to express disdain for the case and concerns about their ability to be fair , and to ratchet up the pathos in their claims of facing economic ruin if forced to sit for the three - week trial .

In this time of double - digit unemployment and shrinking benefits for those who do have jobs , courts are finding it more difficult to seat juries for trials running more than a day or two .
And in extreme cases , reluctance has escalated into rebellion , experts say .
After three days of mounting insurrection , lawyers for both the deputy and the sergeant waived their right to a jury trial and left the verdict up to Dunn .
“ We ca n’t have a disgruntled jury , ” said attorney Gregory W. Smith , who represents Deputy Robert Lyznick in the lawsuit against his former supervisor .
He called the panel “ scary ” and too volatile for either side to trust .
Money woes inflicted by the recession have spurred more hardship claims , especially by those called for long cases , say jury consultants and courtroom administrators .
More than a quarter of all qualified jurors were released on hardship grounds last year , according to court statistics .
And judges say they have seen more people request such dismissals in the last year .
Advertisement
“ There ’s a lot of tension , a lot more stress people are dealing with these days , ” said Gloria Gomez , director of juror services for the Los Angeles County Superior Court .
In Lyznick ’s suit against the county , Dunn granted hardship dismissals for more than half of the 65 people sent to his courtroom .
In a neighboring courtroom , where Judge Robert H. O’Brien was about to try an asbestos case , 66 of 107 prospective jurors were excused for financial difficulties before the individual questioning , or voir dire , got started .
“ The economic situation has really put attorneys and judges in an awkward position of having to say to someone who is the sole wage earner in a family or someone who is self - employed and does n’t get paid when they do n’t work that they have to serve , and we have more and more of those , ” said Jaine E. Fraser , a psychologist and jury consultant who sat in for the asbestos jury selection before the parties settled .
People on the margins of society tend to be more sympathetic with victims bringing suit , and excluding them on hardship grounds can disadvantage plaintiffs , Fraser said .
But it ’s also risky , she noted , to force people into jury service that will cut deeply into their paychecks .

With shrinking budgets , courts are under pressure to do more with less .
Los Angeles County courthouses were summoning 55,000 people a week , at $ 15 a day each , until the economic crisis imposed more belt - tightening .
The county is now making do with 45,000 summonses a week -- only about half are even answered -- compelling stricter scrutiny of those claiming financial , medical and child - care problems , Gomez said .
The county has also tightened sanctions for repeat no - shows , imposing fines of as much as $ 1,500 .
Fraser , who is based in Dallas , said jurors there have been more willing to serve since the city raised daily jury compensation from $ 6 to $ 40 .
California courts have been trying for years to get the daily stipend raised to $ 40 , without success , Gomez said .
As he struggled with the mounting pleas for dismissal , Dunn alluded to pressures on the court “ to be very diligent in reviewing excuses . ”
High school teacher Sharon Friedman told the judge she had no savings and would lose 60 % of her February pay .
Substitute teacher Martine Tomczyk argued that she needed to be free to take work days when they surfaced .
Freelance producer Robert
Thatcher said he could lose contracts to competitors if he missed deadlines while on the jury .

As excuses were flying and Dunn struggled to maintain order , one of the few jurors who had n’t sought dismissal interrupted the questioning to offer his take on the unusually passionate resistance .
“ I think with what is going on in the country , there are a lot of angry people , ” said retired Broadway actor Sammy Williams .
“ Money is such an issue and to give money to someone for results of a case , it ’s really important that they ’re getting it for a real reason , an important reason . ”

Hello , my name is Eugenijus - Jonas , or Eugene - John in English .
I am a catholic .
I live in Lithuania .
When I heard about changed NetBSD logo I exulted - they go to the right way , but I disappointed soon , because it was changed by political or ethical reasons .
As a result - beastie still alive in docs page , you support obtaining of previous devotionalia by providing information where it can be purchased and so on .
So , what is wrong ?
Crux of the matter is that God and Devil is real .
They are not political or ethical term , they are and have real power .
Main difference is that God is love , but Devil is ego or , in other words , He love himself and do it absolutely .
So , whats happens next : when you love God , He loves you and this love is felt by other peoples around you , peoples want to be with you , want to deal with you just because you love God and you emit love , even if you do not think that and do not feel that by yourself ; when you love Devil He loves himself and other peoples around you feel that you love yourself , because you love Devil , because you deal with Devil , because you emit self loving .
Devil is just as a black hole for love .
You can love Him as much as you can , but you can never expect love from Him .
Of course , NetBSD is not such the black hole , because everyone of you are supported by love from your family , your friends , your kids , but how long they suffer ?
Just see , where is Linux today and where is all of BSD's ?
No , Linux do n't base on God , but they do n't base on Devil too .
Mascot of Linux is penguin , mascot of BSD is Devil ( or Beastie ) .
Really no one can expect happiness in his / her life , while deal with , or support , or supported by Devil .
Life can not exist without love .
So , what must be done to change the situation ?
First of all everyone of you must go to church and confess your sins , if you are the catholics .
If you are not , then pray for God for forgiveness by yourself , but it is much harder .
Next , for NetBSD : 1 . Must be clearly written in philosophy / constitution of NetBSD , that NetBSD do n't have any relation with old logo now , and www pages must be cleaned up from any beasties , daemons and so on , and official mirrors must be controlled .
There is the example - www.netbsd.se, and the question - what are they represent : Devil , NetBSD or Devil in NetBSD ?
Logo had changed 5 years ago .
It is possible to write , that NetBSD believe in God , but it is too hard to continue such promise .
2 . Name of the NetBSD must be changed .
It would be principle - no BSD , because all of BSD 's mascot is beastie .
It can be NetOS or NetSomething or what you ( community ) want .
Logo is good .
Of course , NetBSD is derived from BSD 4 .
So , put this all information to the history page and forget it .
3 . Licence must be changed too .
No BSD or BSD like licence .
It can be MIT , or Apache or even ( L ) GPL licence .
4 . Must be changed naming of servers - no daemons .
It must be servers or services .
I do n't need support by daemons , I do n't need served by daemons .
I can be served by servers or by services provided by other peoples .
Good example is Microsoft Windows and Sun Solaris .
Sun has new rc.d subsystem where they start / stop services .
They have some daemons of course , but it is good example - they want to change situation .
Really it is long work , but it is right way and it has future , at least for everyone of you personally .
Why I wrote this post ?
Some years ago I had installed FreeBSD as my desktop , then switched to Linux , then became the catholic :) .
I have some nostalgic feels about BSD .
FreeBSD disappoint me - they had changed they logo very cosmeticly - really by political reason only .
They want to be with Devil , but I do n't .
All these rules are correct for OpenBSD and even for FreeBSD .
And again - if you want to be happy you must be with God , you must emit the love and a clean design ( of NetBSD for example ) here is not in the first place .
Eugenijus - Jonas .
P.S. I am 38 years old .

Science reporter , BBC News
Scientists say they can boost supply of the key anti-malaria drug artemisinin Global supply of a key , plant - based , anti-malaria drug is set to be boosted by a genetic study , scientists say .
Researchers have mapped the genes of Artemisia annua to allow selection of high - yield varieties .
The study , published in the journal Science , aims to make growing the plant more profitable for farmers .
" It 's a major milestone for the development of this crop , " Professor Ian Graham from the University of York in the UK told BBC News .
Short supply
The research has been welcomed by Dr Chris Drakeley , director of the Malaria Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
" Anything that enables an increased yield of product from something like Artemisia annua is a major step .
" This is the first line anti-malarial in nearly all endemic countries at the moment and supplies can be limited . "
Artemisinin combination therapies , or ATCs , are used widely to treat malaria and are seen as the best solution to the parasite 's increasing resistance to anti-malarial drugs .
All the information and tools we 've developed in this work are free for people to use
Professor Ian Graham
University of York Professor Graham , who led the study , hopes that new higher yielding and more robust varieties could increase global supply of the malaria treatment within three years .
" Our aim is to have hybrid seeds that can be released to farmers in the developing world by 2011 or 2012 .
With a year lag for planting , this would have an impact on supply in 2012 or 2013 . "
" We have to wait six to eight months from putting the seed in the ground to harvesting the crop and seeing how it has performed . "
Dr Drakeley hopes the new varieties will become available quickly .
" This will allow an increase in the basic compound that forms ATC therapies .
If they can get these seeds out in the timeframe they 're talking about it 'll be a major advance , " he said .

To identify the best plants for hybrid seed production , researchers measured characteristics of individual plants , for example , the number of artemisinin producing glands on the leaf .
They also performed tests to find the plants with the best genetic make - up .
The resulting seeds are being planted in field trials in China , East Africa , India and Madagascar .
" We are expecting to end up with not just one hybrid .
Leaf gland which produces artemisinin " Ideally we would like good hybrids for east Africa and good hybrids for India etc. , " explained Professor Graham .
The study is the culmination of three years work funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the genetic maps and markers the researchers have identified will be made available for free all over the world .
" All the information and tools we 've developed in this work are free for people to use for the charitable purpose , " Professor Graham told BBC News .
" We 're also working with seed producers so they can produce the seeds as cheaply as possible for the developing world . "
Window of time Scientists hope a better supply of the drug might also help with the problem of fake drugs being distributed .
Some treatments being sold have been found to have no drug content or to be substandard in quality .
This can make them fatal or they can be more likely to encourage resistance rather than combat the disease .
" Hopefully , if the final product is easier and cheaper to procure after this development , it might lessen the production of counterfeit drugs , " said Dr Drakeley .
Professor Graham believes that the development of drug resistance by the malaria parasite has made the work more urgent .
" We have a window of time when we can use artemisinin effectively , and we want to have a stable , reliable supply that can be used in that window , " he said .

The Asus Eee PC T101MT is a netbook with a 10 inch touchscreen display that you can fold down over the keyboard for use in tablet mode .
The display is a 10.1 inch , 1024 x 600 pixel capacitive resistive touchscreen display with support for multitouch gestures .
And the netbook runs Windows 7 Home Premium , which includes optimizations for touch input ( as well as the Asus TouchGate software suite , which provides a few touch - friendly applications to get you started ) .
After demonstrating the latest version of the 10 inch convertible tablet at CES in January , Asus is finally getting ready to ship the T101MT in April .
Eee PC.it notes that it will be available in Italy next month for 499 Euros .
And I ’ve been told that it will be available in the US in early April for around $ 499 US — which puts the Eee PC T101MT in a pretty good position to compete with the Apple iPad , which also has a $ 499 price tag , but no physical keyboard or ability to run desktop apps .
The Italian version of the Eee PC T101MT has a 1.66 GHz Intel Atom N450 processor , GMA 3150 graphics , 2GB of RAM , a 320 GB hard drive , 802.11b/g/n WiFi , Bluetooth , and a 0.3 MP webcam .
Asus says the battery should be good for about 6 hours , and the netbook has VGA , mic , and headphone jacks as well as 3 USB ports and an SDHC card reader .
But it looks like there will also be a version with Windows 7 Starter Edition , 1GB of RAM , and a 160 GB hard drive .
My guess is that ’s the model you ’ll get for $ 499 in the US .

Fireboy and Watergirl 1 : The Forest Temple
One task that comes up again and again is adding , removing or updating source CIDR blocks in various security groups in an EC2 infrastructur ...
1. Bottom Skirt .
Next we 'll prepare a metal skirt to go around the three " leg " bolts located at the underside of the base plate .
Cut a band of aluminum band about 44 mm wide and 27 inches long .
2 . Apply poster mount putty to the outside portion of the three 1/4 - 20 bolts that serve as base plate legs .
Wrap the aluminum strip into a nice circular shape around the 3 bolts - the putty will help the strip stick to the legs .
3 . Where the strip ends join , use a large paper clip and aluminum tape to fasten the ends together .
You will also need to cut an opening in the strip large enough to accommodate the power supply jack and on / off switch or RS - 232 cable depending on which controller you 're planning to use ( see photos ) .
4. Bottom Disk .
The bottom disk sits inside the glass cylinder resting on the heads of the 3 , 8 - 32 rubber grommet mounting screws .
Its job is the hide the screws and help create the appearance on a solid disk at the bottom of the glass cylinder .
5 . Cut a aluminum disk with an outside diameter ( OD ) sized to fit inside the cylinder about 1 inch in from the open end .
The disk inside diameter ( ID ) should be about 1 / 2 inch , it does not have to be perfectly centered as the cover washer ( described below ) will hide any off center errors ..
6 . Then cut a cardboard disk about the size as the aluminum disk and glue the two disks together - the cardboard just serves to stiffen the aluminum disk .
7. Cover Washer .
The Cover washer goes over the drive shaft below the wax Intersect Cube and rests on the top of the Bottom Disk described above .
Cut from aluminum strip stock a washer with 1 " OD and 3/16 " ID .
Its job is just to mask any not quite centered errors between drive shaft and the bottom disk .
8. Attach Wax Intersect cube to Drive Shaft .
First assemble the cylinder to the base plate and measure the distance ( D1 ) from the base plate up the upper edge of the bottom 22 mm wide aluminum band you attached to the cylinder in Step 6 .
Next measure the distance ( D2 ) from the base plate up the lower edge of the top 22 mm wide aluminum band .
Now remove the glass cylinder and and install the drive shaft on the motor and hold the drive shaft straight up .
Mark the locations D1 and D2 ( measured from the base plate ) on the drive shaft .
The wax cube should be centered half way between the D1 and D2 marks , this will center it in the " window " of the glass center created by the top and bottom bands .
10 . Important - Before you glue the Wax cube in place .
Slide the cover washer onto the drive shaft so that is rests on top of the drive shaft heat shrink tube coupler and below the final location were the wax cube is attached to the drive shaft ( see photo ) .
Glue the wax cube to the drive shaft using white epoxy - let sit overnight to fully cure .
Finally , paint the exposed portions of the drive using a black magic maker .
11 . Test fit Assembly .
After the epoxy cures assembly the cube / drive shaft , bottom disk , and glass cylinder onto the base plate to make sure it all fits together as it should .
It can be a little tricky to get the top of the shaft fit into the nylon bushing , but by carefully tilting the glass tube and base plate assembly back and forth you should be able to get it assembled OK .
If you 're really struggling , you can loosen the motor mount nuts enough to drop the motor way down - this will allow the glass cylinder to be fully seated against the base plate , you can then grab the motor to move the drive shaft up and into position .
After test fitting everthing together , you can now dis-assemble to make it easier to complete the controller assembly on the bottom side of the base plate .
Once that 's done just re-assemble one final time .
Benchmark Results : Crysis ( DirectX 10 )
Crysis is perhaps the closest thing to a synthetic in our real - world suite .
After all , it ’s two and a half years old .
Nevertheless , it ’s still one of the most demanding titles we can bring to bear against a modern graphics subsystem .
Optimized for DirectX 10 , older cards like ATI ’s Radeon HD 4870 X2 are still capable of putting up a fight in Crysis .
It should come as no shock that the Radeon HD 5970 clinches a first - place finish in all three resolutions .
All three of the Radeon HD 5000 - series boards we ’re testing demonstrate modest performance hits with anti-aliasing applied , with the exception of the dual - GPU 5970 at 2560x1600 , which falls off rapidly .
Nvidia ’s new GeForce GTX 480 starts off strong , roughly matching the performance of the company ’s GeForce GTX 295 , but is slowly passed by the previous - gen flagship .
Throughout testing , the GTX 480 does maintain better anti-aliased performance , though .
Meanwhile , Nvidia ’s GeForce GTX 470 is generally outperformed by the Radeon HD 5850 , winning only at 2560x1600 with AA applied ( though it ’s an unplayable configuration , anyway )
Overall , the Radeons show the strongest in Crysis .
Over this past weekend ODB was in the studio with the Wu group Twelve O'Clock , in Brooklyn , when they rushed to the aid of a four - year - old girl who had been hit by a car outside of the studio .
The child was trapped underneath the vehicle when Dirty and some of his friends lifted the car off of her .
She was taken to the hospital and treated for first and second degree burns from the car 's engine .
Dirty visited the hospital to check on the girl 's condition , but the normally anything - but - low key ODB never identified himself to her family .
However , they recognized him and alerted the media .
WASHINGTON — Is Alan Greenspan , famous for his libertarian leanings and hands - off approach to Wall Street , having some second thoughts ?
After more than six decades as a skeptic of big government , the former Federal Reserve chairman , now 84 , is gingerly suggesting that perhaps regulators should help rein in giant financial institutions by requiring them to hold more capital .
Mr. Greenspan , once celebrated as the “ maestro ” of economic policy , has seen his reputation dim after failing to avert the credit bubble that nearly brought down the financial system .
Now , in a 48 - page paper that is by turns analytical and apologetic , he is calling for a degree of greater banking regulation in several areas .
The report , which he is to present Friday to the Brookings Institution , is by no means a mea culpa .
But in his customarily sober language , Mr. Greenspan , who has long argued that the market is often a more effective regulator than the government , has now adopted a more expansive view of the proper role of the state .
On the morning of Monday , January 18th , I set out with Frantz Ewald , a Haitian - born painter , to drive into Port - au - Prince from the hilltop suburb of Pétionville , where I was staying .
It had been six days since the earthquake struck , and the city was still in chaos .
As rescuers hacked at the rubble , looking for survivors , residents were out on the streets searching for water , for food , and for fuel .
In Pétionville , a gas station had opened for business , and that morning a long line of cars formed ; mixed among them were men and women on foot , holding plastic jerricans and waiting anxiously for their turn at the pump .
An elderly woman came up to the people in line and asked politely for help .
The charred corpse of a man , said to be a thief , lay at the curbside across the street , in front of a bank .
His head was crushed and his legs were strangely folded behind him , and a small pile of rubbish was gathering around him .
As people walked past , they cupped their hands over their noses and mouths because of the smell .
A few feet away , young touts sold scratch cards for a mobile - phone company to passing motorists .
Frantz and I were in his black Toyota pickup truck , and we had not gone far when we braked to allow a group of teen - agers to cross the street in front of us .
They were being led by a tall young woman in a white tunic and a long black skirt .
They trailed behind her as if she were some kind of Pied Piper .
As they passed in front of us , she gave us a sidelong glance of polite recognition , and we carried on .
Four or five hours later , in the flatlands at the edge of the Port - au - Prince airport , we saw the young woman and her followers again .
She was standing amid a scrum of onlookers outside the gates of the airport , where U.N. and American planes were landing on the airstrip beyond the little terminal building .
We stopped and hailed her , and she spoke to us , surprisingly , in English , with a Southern drawl .
She said that her name was Nadia François and she was from Delmas 75 — a neighborhood five miles back up into the hills .
She had come down , she said , in representation of some three hundred people there who were in need of help .
She handed us a paper with a handwritten message that attested to her mission , signed and stamped by a Protestant pastor .
Nadia had led her group down to the airport after hearing that the U.S. military was handing out food .
We told Nadia and her companions — there were nine of them — to hop into the back of the truck , and we set off to look for food .
Despite the rumors , which had attracted several hundred Haitians to the road by the airport , to gather and stare hopefully , no food was being given out there .
We drove onto a nearby field where there were tent camps and aid supplies , demarcated with a dozen or more national flags , but it was a bivouac , not a food - distribution point .
We asked a U.N. peacekeeper where to find aid ; he said he did n’t know .
Someone told us that food was being handed out at a factory nearby , where the Dominicans had set up a base , and so we drove there .
The earliest and most visible relief presence in Haiti had come from the neighboring Dominican Republic .
When I first entered Haiti , in the early morning of January 15th , I had been waved across the border with a long stream of vehicles carrying relief supplies .
There was also a convoy of trucks , driven by soldiers , that were inscribed with messages that the relief had been dispatched as a personal gesture by the Dominican President , Leonel Fernández .
Now a vast international aid effort was beginning to establish itself .
Humanitarian assistance and rescue teams were appearing daily from all over the world — from Spain , France , Russia , Israel , Venezuela , and Cuba , as well as the United States .
A team of yellow - shirted Scientologists showed up , as did one from the order of the Knights of Malta .
Countless tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way .
But the distribution of food was scattershot , and every outlet was swamped with desperate crowds .
All over the city , banners and signs painted on sheets asked for aid .
Only the patient and motivated seemed to be getting it .
Nadia said she had grown up in Miami with her family .
She was thirty - six , “ going on thirty - seven , ” she said , and had been back in Haiti for only the past two years .
I asked her why she had returned .
She gave a rueful smile and said she had “ been bad ” and had had “ immigration difficulties . ”
In the past week , she had become a principal means of support for her community .
Every day , she ’d come into the center of town and tried to return with food and other essentials .
At the Dominican food depot , a detail of Peruvian U.N. peacekeepers nervously clutched acrylic shields and assault rifles as they tried to hold back a large crowd of Haitians who had gathered at both sides of the gated entrance .
The soldiers were harried and flushed , and they yelled when we pulled up to talk to them , as if they had been deafened by the noise of the crowd .
We persuaded them to let us through , and inside we found a tumultuous scene : trucks came and went , and civilians who had slipped through the cordon mingled with Haitian police , Dominican soldiers , and dozens of yellow - T - shirted volunteers for Haiti ’s Ministry of the Feminine Condition — a legacy of the populist Presidency of Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
An official from the ministry was standing in the loading bay of the warehouse , where relief supplies were being piled haphazardly onto trucks .
The aid consisted of plastic bags with the essentials to sustain a single family for a day : rice , cornmeal , beans , sardines , and Vienna sausages .
The official wore a decorative print dress with a matching head scarf and large sunglasses , and she spoke intently and continuously on a cell phone .
Around her , arguments erupted as unauthorized people tried to sneak through the final barrier to get to the food in the loading bay .
A fierce - looking woman wearing a bandanna came in and began screaming that she wanted food .
A soldier pushed her .
She yelled at him , and he shoved her again .
He protested that the woman had been there the day before and was making off with the supplies to sell them .
A hapless - looking Dominican Army colonel was trying to oversee the proceedings .
He gave Nadia ’s group permission to take some food , and then added , a little apologetically , that he was under orders to distribute food through the Haitian government , and therefore could not take it directly to the people in the city .
He led us to the ministry official , who removed her cell phone from her ear and listened as we pled the case .
She looked sternly at Nadia , nodded in assent , and went back to her phone .
We loaded the pickup with seventy or eighty bags and secured them with yellow plastic cargo webbing , and then made for the gates .
Outside , the throng was bigger , and the soldiers had grown agitated .
They yelled at us to go fast and not to stop for anything , because the people would overwhelm our vehicle in order to get the food .
We gunned the pickup and made it past the crowd ; on the way into the hills , we drove cautiously through back streets .
After a few miles , we stopped on a middle - class street , fringed with shade trees , where there was a gap between houses at a bend in the road .
A crude patchwork awning of sheets and tarps stretched across the gap , and underneath were a large number of women and children , living on mats that had been laid over the pavement .
At the far edge of the awning , the street ended , and the ground fell sharply away .
Below , in a ravine twenty or thirty feet deep and about a hundred feet across , was Nadia ’s community , Fidel — named after Fidel Castro , she said — where she and three hundred other people normally lived .
( Delmas 75 , I realized , corresponded to the street that ran past the ravine and appeared on city maps ; Fidel itself was off the grid . )
It was a dry , stone - filled riverbed , filled with a geometry of cinder - block and tin-scrap dwellings , one of which was her house , a twelve - foot - square cinder - block structure that she rented for the equivalent of about three hundred U.S. dollars a year .
Most of the residents of Fidel had moved up to the street to sleep under the awning .
They were frightened by the continuing aftershocks , and did not want to be caught in the ravine if there was another earthquake .
Nadia pointed to a broken section of rock - and - block wall on the far cliff edge ; I could see the outlines of an unfinished residential development there .
Nadia said that the residents of Fidel had asked the developer not to put the wall so close to the edge of the cliff , but he had ignored them .
During the earthquake , a section of the wall had collapsed on top of Nadia ’s neighbor , hitting her on the head and killing her .
Beside the truck , Nadia called out for help , and soon a group of young men and boys began to carry the bags of food down into a small rudimentary Protestant church , the Église Pancotista Sous Delovy .
The church , built into the side of the cliff , was made of sheets of salvaged corrugated tin , painted blue and pink .
The altar and benches were down a steep concrete staircase , at the bottom of what seemed almost like a well .
As Nadia called out orders to the youths , the pastor , Jean Vieux Villers , vowed that he would see that the food was fairly distributed ; everyone seemed happy with this arrangement .
Fidel was settled thirty - two years ago , according to Verner Lionel , a neighbor of Nadia ’s , when the area above the ravines was developed .
Lionel was considered a leader in Fidel , because , at fifty - two , he was the oldest man there .
Like many other men in Fidel , he was an itinerant construction worker and jack - of - all - trades .
He had come there in the nineteen - seventies , as a worker for a developer , a woman he called Prosper , who allowed him to build a shack for himself in the ravine .
“ Mine was the first house , ” he said .
Friends and relatives of Lionel from the countryside followed him to the ravine , and then others came .
Today there are some eight hundred and sixty people living there , according to Nadia ’s calculations .
Haitians have big families ; international - aid agencies tend to estimate five or six people per family , and some have many more .
Nearly half the country ’s nine million people are under eighteen .
Nadia waved to the many mothers and babies and children on the tarp and said something had to be done for them .
“ The thing is , ” she said with a tone of fond disparagement , “ these Haitians do n’t know what to do . ”
The immediate problem was that the people of Fidel ordinarily bought their water from a cistern truck , but it had n’t appeared since before the quake on January 12th , and so there was no longer any easy access to water .
( This problem was widespread ; even before the earthquake , half of the people in Haiti could n’t reliably get water . )
There was no food or medicine , either , since there was no work , and no one had any money saved .
These people were poor ; like many of their countrymen , Nadia included , they were living below the poverty line and had been since long before the earthquake .
Haiti has been in a state of persistent struggle since it won its independence from France , in 1804 .
It is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere , with seventy - eight per cent of its people living on less than two U.S. dollars per day and fifty - four per cent on half that .
Its traditional exports , coffee and sugar , have collapsed , and manufacturing has been in decline for decades .
It has suffered riots and hideous violence and depressingly regular political upheavals , led by a succession of despots and cheats : Papa Doc , Baby Doc , the priest Aristide .
Amid all this , Haiti seems almost uniquely victimized by nature .
From June to October , it has severe storms and hurricanes .
In the span of just two months in the summer of 2008 , it was walloped by Tropical Storm Fay , Hurricane Gustav , Tropical Storm Hanna , and Hurricane Ike , which together left eight hundred thousand people homeless and the country ’s infrastructure severely damaged .
Haiti relies heavily on foreign aid , but little of that money contributes to sustained development , and it has often been withdrawn for political reasons .
Most of the jobs are in agriculture ; as exports have dipped , nearly a hundred thousand Haitians a year have made their way from the country to Port - au - Prince .
There they work largely in the “ informal ” sector : as bellboys , day workers , shoe shiners , and street venders .
Now even those jobs are gone .
One day , Frantz and I drove past the Port - au - Prince cemetery , on our way from the small cinder - block judicial police headquarters , near the airport , that had become the provisional seat of Haiti ’s government .
Bodies were everywhere in the city — lying on street corners and sometimes dumped in the middle of avenues — and , at the office , the mayor of Port - au - Prince and the director of the Ministry of Health had both informed me that they were doing what they could to clean them up .
Disposing of bodies was , for all intents and purposes , now the extent of the Haitian government ’s capabilities .
The Prime Minister , Jean - Max Bellerive , had told me that seventy thousand bodies had been collected by bulldozers and dump trucks and buried in four mass gravesites , in town and outside .
One of those places was the main cemetery .
As we approached , I saw three bodies lying face down on the dirt in a gap in the wall .
Two of them appeared to be women , one very young .
The other bodies I had seen in Port - au - Prince were distended and blistered from the heat .
These were fresh , with no visible injuries .
They reminded me of photographs I had seen of victims of death squads in El Salvador .
An overwhelming stench permeated the air , even inside the truck .
Lying next to the cemetery wall was a young man , drenched from head to foot in blood ; more blood had pooled around him on the sidewalk .
He lay on his side , with an elbow propped up on the ground so that he could cup his head in his hand .
There was a bright - red advertisement for Nino cell phones painted on the wall just above him , and next to it a crucifix embossed within a circle .
Frantz said , “ I think he ’s still alive . ”
Several people gathered on the median strip to stare down at him .
One of them said , “ He ’s a thief .
The police executed him and dumped him here .
And those people , too ” — he indicated the fresh bodies .
“ They are thieves . ”
During the earthquake , hundreds of prisoners had escaped from the national penitentiary , just a few blocks from the Presidential Palace and the cemetery .
The fugitives included hardened criminals and some of Port - au - Prince ’s most violent gang leaders .
Looters — thousands of them , by some reports — had overrun the Grand Rue , the main commercial area , and other places in the city .
The police were hard pressed to respond , having lost half their force around Port - au - Prince .
I had heard reports of police shooting thieves and of looters killed by vigilantes .
There was gunfire at night in the neighborhood where I was staying , and at one point rumors spread of nocturnal kidnappers who were stealing people ’s babies to sell for adoption , supposedly abducting them as they slept in the streets outside .
One day , I saw a man tied to a pole , hacked up by machetes and beaten to death with rocks .
The man on the sidewalk twitched ; his chest rose and fell slowly a couple of times .
A yellow bulldozer came up the street , and a rough - looking man , walking in front of it , directed it toward the three bodies lying inside the cleft in the wall .
The bulldozer , amid great noise and fumes , scraped them up into its iron beak and then , in several violent motions , rolled them into a mound of yellow dirt that rose some fifteen feet inside the broken wall .
Within a minute , the bodies had vanished .
The bulldozer came along the sidewalk and lowered its beak .
Before it could scoop up the wounded man , though , the worker directing operations walked over .
Seeing that the man was still alive , he waved the bulldozer away .
As it roared off , we asked him what he planned to do about the wounded man .
He said , “ I am only responsible for the dead , ” and walked away .
“ I ’ve changed the locks and taken out a restraining order , so no , I wo n’t be your valentine . ”

When the quake hit , Nadia had tried to run out of the ravine .
She was halfway up the crude concrete steps that led to the street when she heard screaming from near her house .
She ran back , and saw her neighbor lying dead under the pile of cinder blocks .
The neighbor had a seven - month - old boy .
“ I said , ‘ Where ’s the baby , where ’s the baby ? ’ and we saw him lying there on the ground . ”
She had managed to toss the child clear just as she was buried by the blocks .
“ A woman picked him up and gave him to me , ” Nadia said .
“ He was covered with blood , and there was also blood on his socks .
One arm looked dislocated , and one of his legs , too , and he had a swelling on his head .
I was scared he would die in my hands .
He kept trying to go to sleep , and I was trying to wake him up . ”
Nadia went looking for his relatives and found his aunt , who lived in Ravine 75 , a few blocks away from Fidel .
“ After , I went outside and sat , and I was crying , because I did n’t know what happened to my boyfriend . ”
Her boyfriend , a young man named Kesnel Jean , had left earlier in the day on a bus for Jacmel , a town on the southern coast of Haiti .
He had not been heard from .
That night , “ after it stopped , ” Nadia said , she walked down to Delmas 36 , about thirty - five blocks away , to see if her cousin and his family had survived .
They had , but what she saw of the city — “ a lot of houses down , ” and people dead and wounded everywhere — saddened her .
Nadia recalled that a rumor had begun circulating after the disaster struck .
“ The Haitians started saying that it was the U.S. doing an experiment that caused it , because they wanted to take over Haiti .
But I know it ’s God ’s work , because if it was the U.S. that did it , then did they also do the earthquake in California a few years ago ?
I tried to tell them it do n’t make no sense . ”
In the next days , she continued roving out of Fidel .
“ On Wednesday , I walked all the way to downtown and back up , looking for my boyfriend .
I saw dead people lying around , ” she said .
“ I saw one kid who had tried to run out of a building , and it smashed down on him , and all you could see was his face and one of his arms .
I saw looters taking things and throwing them down from one building that was destroyed , and I took off running , because I did n’t want to get taken by the police . ”
It was in those initial sorties of hers , looking for Kesnel and for her relatives , that Nadia had started searching for food .
She told me , with a kind of fierce pride , “ I never suffered in the U.S. for things like food and water , so I do n’t think I should have to in Haiti . ”
She brought the food she found to Pastor Villers , to be stored in the little Pancotista church until it could be handed out .
It was n’t until two days after Kesnel went missing that he arrived back in Fidel , injured in one leg but otherwise unharmed .
When the earthquake had struck , his bus had crashed ; a U.N. vehicle was also in a wreck nearby .
Many passengers had been killed , he told Nadia , but he had been pulled to safety by the U.N. people .
He had managed to hire a motorcycle to get partway back to Port - au - Prince , and had hitched a ride the rest of the way .
On the coastal road leading west out of Port - au - Prince to Léogâne — an old plantation town that had been almost entirely destroyed in the quake — I stopped one day at the home of Max Beauvoir , Haiti ’s preëminent houngan , or vodou priest .
Beauvoir ’s rambling complex was situated in a shady glade of tropical trees — an unusual sight in this part of the country , which , like much of Haiti , has been largely deforested .
The coral - rock wall in front had partly collapsed in the earthquake .
A section of his temple and an open - air kitchen had been damaged , too , but his home was intact .
Several statues of vodou gods overlooked the garden from the parapets of the buildings .
Beauvoir , seated at a round table beneath the trees behind his house , greeted me graciously .
A tall , handsome man with deep - set , intense eyes , he had a pair of huge Rottweilers at his feet and a pack of Marlboro Lights on the table , which he drew from as we talked .
He said he was upset about remarks made by the American evangelical preacher Pat Robertson , who had blamed Haiti ’s tragedy on a pact with the Devil .
“ I feel that Pat Robertson missed a very good opportunity to close his mouth , ” Beauvoir said .
“ What is needed most in Haiti now is certainly compassion .
A tragedy like this is the fault of nobody , and to look for fault is ridiculous , and it seems to me that was not very intelligent .
It would have been more intelligent on his part if he had simply shut up . ”
Beauvoir was also upset about the mass burials of the earthquake victims .
Tens of thousands of unidentified human bodies a day were being bulldozed into the ground without any ceremony , and he wished for a way to bring greater dignity to the process .
“ We all have a part of God in us , and our bodies should be disposed of in a decent way .
The way they are doing it , picking them up and putting them in holes , it ’s undignified . ”
I told Beauvoir about the bodies I had seen dumped at the cemetery , and he nodded .
On January 16th , he said , he had been summoned by Haiti ’s President , René Préval , to an emergency cabinet meeting , along with the Prime Minister , the police chief , and the surviving heads of the Catholic and Protestant churches .
At the meeting , the leaders had discussed the unravelling security situation in Port - au - Prince .
“ We decided we had to deal with them in an emergency way , ” he said .
“ Beginning on the seventeenth and for the next two weeks , ” criminals were to be treated “ as in an emergency . ”
I asked him if this meant capital punishment , and he said it did : “ Capital punishment , automatically , for all bandits . ”
Some of the looters were taking what they desperately needed , and from places where it would n’t be missed .
And some of them must have been supplying those too sick or badly injured to fend for themselves ; Nadia could n’t have been the only one tending to a community .
Others , of course , were stealing out of greed and opportunism .
But this seemed an impossible distinction to make , especially for a beleaguered and diminished police force .
I really enjoyed watching this video and thought it would be a great way to show you how architects can design with the emergence of nano - technology .
The future of architecture is in development today – and such architects like John M. Johansen are creating unique perspectives on how we will create a fusion of new technologies with build form .
This video brings up some very important factors about what nano - architecture can bring .
Here are some key ideas that I can see already developing …

MAKING THE TECHNOLOGY MORE HUMANE
Johansen ’s vision for the future of architecture is quite thought - provoking .
In this video you get a sense of how built environments can evolve — for the better .
Johansen ’s envisioned “ community ” shows a new kind of architecture that makes use of the emergence of nanotechnology in both adaptive and humane ways .
Nano - architecture will allow for designs that better interact with the human senses .
Experiencing this type of architecture could feel more “ natural ” and less forced than many of the designs we experience today .
( … although this might be up for debate . )
Johansen shows that the future of architecture can be both technologically rich and humane — simultaneously .
DESIGNING YOUR OWN MATERIALS
By merging both nanotechnology and architecture , the advent of nanotechnology will give architects renewed freedoms that we do n’t experience today .
For instance , the ability to design your own materials — going beyond wood , concrete and glass .
BUILDINGS THAT WILL “ GROW ”
It is interesting to think of architecture as a “ growing ” environment that evolves according to different respective codes .
Nanoarchitecture could treat such codes ( or rules ) as a way to optimize intended functions and aesthetics .
Architecture would then be more of a dynamic entity , morphing to occupant needs .
RESPONSIVE ARCHITECTURE
An architecture that is responsive would allow for better design variations that meet occupant need .
Personalization of nanoarchitectural spaces will be a likely benefit giving occupants greater flexibility and choice .
BRINGING ARCHITECTURE CLOSER TO NATURE
Johansen ’s vision of a chapel responding to light energy is a rather beautiful idea .
This one concept powerfully illustrates the possibilities that nano architecture will allow .
It is likely that nano - architecture will bring architectural design a few steps closer to having buildings more synchronously harmonize with nature .
WHO IS JOHN M. JOHANSEN ?
Just in case you are not familiar with John M Johansen , here is a brief biography of this well - known architect :
John Johansen has been one of the pre-eminent architects in the United States for more than half a century .
After studying under Walter Gropius ( who became his father - in - law ) at Harvard , he embarked on an extraordinary career marked by experimental domestic and public design .
Since retiring from practice , Johansen has devoted himself to producing futuristic architecture that looks to the newest technologies science has to offer–from nanotechnology to magnetic levitation to material science –for its inspiration .

Nervous Tea Partiers See Possible Democratic Win on Health Care
Created : March 17 , 2010 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Demonstrators at Tuesday 's rally on Capitol Hill ( Photo by David Weigel )
“ Might as well not even be here , ” grumbled Georgia Holliday .
“ I ca n’t believe that Dick Armey screwed up like this ! ”
Holliday was not alone .
Having traveled into the city from the suburbs for the 10 a.m. “ Code Red ” rally on the Capitol grounds , she got more and more annoyed that she could n’t hear any of the speakers .
( She was also annoyed at the wrong Tea Party activist — the Code Red rally was sponsored by a coalition of Tea Party groups , while a different , 9 a.m. rally had been organized by Armey ’s FreedomWorks . )
As Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R - Texas ) waved a copy the massive Senate version health care bill — “ I brought an abortion to show you ! ” — Holliday winced and chanted her disapproval .
[ GOP1 ] “ Kill the bill ! ” she said .
“ Kill the bill !
And get us a PA system ! ”
The Code Red rally was small , drawing around 300 people into a noisy circle .
So was the FreedomWorks “ People ’s Surge , ” which sent Tea Party activists onto Capitol Hall to seek out one - on - one meetings with members of Congress whose votes could decide the fate of health care reform .
Both events were mocked for their size , by Democrats and liberal groups that had grown used to explosive media coverage of the conservative movement .
“ I ’ve been to birthday parties that drew more people , ” sneered DNC spokesman Hari Sevugan in an email to Politico ’s Ben Smith .
If the relative fizzle fazed Tea Party organizers — FreedomWorks had hoped for closer to 2,500 activists — they did n’t show it .
Rob Jordan of FreedomWorks told smug Democrats to wait for election day : “ You can count on people showing up . ” Libertarian and conservative blogs reported on larger Tea Party protests happening in Michigan and San Diego .
But the smallish numbers of the March 16 Tea Party push amplified the new attitude coming from politicians and activists : pessimism .
Slightly over a year since the start of the movement , Tea Party activists were , for the first time , contemplating a major legislative victory for President Barack Obama and the Democrats — the final passage of health care reform .
While many held out hope that plans to pass the Senate ’s version of reform in the House would stall out , others pondered their next steps .
Some , like Rep. Steve King ( R - Iowa ) , took a dark view of what might come .
“ Right now , they ’re civil , because they think they have a chance of stopping this bill , ” said King to reporters , waving his arm at a pack of “ People ’s Surge ” activists forming a line to enter the Cannon House Office Building .
“ The reason we do n’t have violence in this country like they do in dictatorships is because we have votes , and our leaders listen to their constituents .
Now we ’re in a situation where the leaders are defying the people ! ”
Later , King would expand on those remarks and speculate on a possible anti-Washington revolt in which Tea Parties would “ fill the streets ” of the capital .
Few Tea Party activists were as pessimistic as King .
All agreed that the determination of Democrats to pass a bill — post - Sept. 12 , post - Massachusetts special election — was getting harder to overcome .
“ Nothing they do surprises me ! ” said an exasperated Amy Kremer of Tea Party Express .
“ Nancy Pelosi has said , ‘ If we ca n’t get through the fence , we ’ll go over it ; if we ca n’t go over the fence , we ’ll catapult over it ; if we ca n’t catapult over it , we ’ll parachute over it . ’
So , basically , they ’ll do whatever it takes .
Just a total disregard for what the American people want . ”
Activists spent the day — they plan on spending most of this month — trying to convey just what it is they say Americans want .
Those who arrived at the Hill on Tuesday morning were handed thick packets of advice on how to lobby members , and who needed their attention .
Those who could n’t make it there could pick up other guidelines at a small “ war room ” set up at a hotel a few blocks south of the Capitol .
In all cases , activists were given advice on how to complement the phone calls and faxes that were coming to targeted representatives from , largely , Americans who did n’t live in their districts .
A white sketchpad in the war room ran down a few possible responses to members who blanched at talking to the activists .
“ If you are not a constituent and they do n’t want to talk to you , ” advised war room organizers , “ ask — ‘ If you wo n’t talk to someone from outside of your district are you ready or willing to pledge not to take money from donors outside of your district ? ’
Or —
‘ If I gave you a donation , would you talk to me ? ’ ”
The lobbying had mixed results .
A group of activists from Georgia told TWI that they were trying to lobby Rep. John Barrow ( D - Ga. ) , who has said he ’d vote “ no ” on the Senate bill , after a difficult time lobbying Rep. Sanford Bishop ( D - Ga. ) , who has said he ’d vote yes .
“ We spent an hour with him , ” grimaced Kathryn Jackson , a retired hospital worker from Fortson , Ga .
She pointed to a lamppost .
“ It was about as useful as talking to that , right there . ”
Kathy Ropte — like Jackson , a member of the Harris County , Ga. Tea Party , had started to move beyond lobbying .
As cameras snapped away , she stood in front of the Cannon Building and announced the termination , “ to take effect in November , ” of pro-health care reform members .
One activist chided her for the display , which included a massive sign reading “ Waterboard Congress . ”
Jackson did n’t care .
She was in the fight , whether or not health care reform passed .
“ One day I turned off American Idol , ” Ropte told TWI , “ and I turned on Fox News .
Before this year I ’d never voted in my life . ”
Of the activists who spoke to TWI , none were ready to give up on opposing health care reform if the bill passed .
Some , however , were looking to other potential fights .
Jane , a Montgomery County , Md. activist who declined to give her last name ( “ my kids do n’t want to see it show up in the paper ! ” ) suggested that a health care win would free up President Obama to give amnesty to undocumented immigrants , possibly by an executive order .
Susan Clark , whose sign compared the health care bill to the notorious Tuskegee Experiment , suggested that passage would bring Democrats a step closer to enforcing a new “ slavery ” over Americans .
But most activists who pondered the aftermath of health care reform ’s passage said they would fight on , looking for ways to roll it back .
Susan Birch , a Chester County , Penn. activist , sported a button for insurgent Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Sam Rohrer because he was pledging to make the governor ’s office “ the front line ” against government expansion .
“ Whatever Congress does , ” said Birch , “ you ’re going to see the 10th Amendment invoked to stop it . ”
The thought of a post - vote backlash — electoral and legal — was the cheeriest thought of the day .
“ I ’ve got a standing bet with [ Rep. ] Jason Altmire [ D - Pa. ] , ” said Henry Hill , a retired police officer and member of the Pittsburgh Tea Party .
“ A case of Yuengling says that the mandate will not go through the Supreme Court . ”
The toilet - dwellers have been living in their unusual home for several months
Ten Chinese migrant workers are living in a public toilet in the city of Hangzhou , according to local media .
They are believed to have been living there for several months , and the toilet is now kitted out with a bed , cooking facilities and a television .
One of the women said she could not afford to rent a room or pay normal living expenses .
Correspondents say the story highlights the poor pay and living conditions of many migrant workers in China .
China 's rapid economic growth has transformed the country , says the BBC's China analyst Shirong Chen - but many migrant workers are struggling .
China has an estimated 20 million migrants , who have moved from the poorer countryside to find work in the rapidly expanding cities and manufacturing hubs .
Strong smell A woman called Ai , who lives in the female toilets , told the Zhejiang Morning Express : " We have got used to the strong smell of urine .
The worst thing is that people keep stealing my stoves and cooking pots . "
The migrant workers have tried to make the toilets look like home Ai's friend Wang Yuhua lives in the male toilets .
" The bad thing is there are mice everywhere , " she said .
Local Hangzhou residents are reportedly sympathetic to the plight of the migrant workers and generally avoid using the facilities .
But some are still surprised by the sight of the toilets ' new residents .
" When I ran inside to use the toilet , I was stunned to see several people sitting around , chatting or doing things , " Mr Du told the newspaper .
One of the migrant workers even said that a friend of hers was a little envious of her , as she could live in the toilets rent - free .
But a spokesman for the local council warned : " It 's forbidden to live inside the toilets , as they are supposed to be for public use . "

That Sony is a company known for its rather …
Unfortunate stance towards DRM and copyright infringement should come as no surprise to anyone , after they more or less crippled the MiniDisc format with DRM , installed rootkits on users ’ machines , and started removing features from the PlayStation 3 .
That last one does n’t seem to end well : George Hotz , the famous iPhone hacker and the first to crack the PS3 ’s security , has vowed to bring Linux support back to the PS3 .
Only yesterday the news hit the web that an upcoming firmware update from Sony will remove the “ Install other OS ” feature of the PlayStation 3 , a feature which allowed geeks , nerds , and researchers to install Linux on the Cell - powered device .
While this feature most certainly is n’t high on most people ’s priority lists , it ’s still an advertised feature that is now being retroactively removed .
No , that PlayStation 3 is n’t yours .
You may have given Sony money , but that ’s it .
This is how we do in the modern world , baby .
While Sony claims it ’s about “ security concerns ” , we all know what it ’s really about : protecting the rights of content providers – since they are way more important than you , the lousy customer .
The security in the PlayStation 3 was finally cracked this January , and it seems this is Sony ’s response .
However , that very same hacker has now vowed to combat Sony ’s update .
First , though , he expressed his disgust at Sony ’s intentions .
“ What security concerns ? , ” he wonders , “ It ’s not like the exploit can be run even close to without the users knowledge .
You have to open the fucking thing up .
How could this harm users ?
Your blog post does n’t list positive reasons for upgrading like I think most users expect .
Instead it lists things you will lose if you do n’t upgrade .
Seriously ? ”
This is n’t the first thing Sony has removed from the PlayStation 3 ’s feature list .
While Japanese and US models of the PS3 had hardware emulation for PS2 games , the European version had to settle for a less - compatible software version – PS2 support was removed altogether with the third generation PS3 .
SACD playback support also fell victim to Sony ’s feature removal police at around the same time .
While Hotz had promised not to involve himself with custom firmware , he now no longer believes he has much of a choice .
“ A note to people interested in the exploit and retaining OtherOS support , DO NOT UPDATE , ” he warns , “ When 3.21 comes out , I will look into a safe way of updating to retain OtherOS support , perhaps something like Hellcat ’s Recovery Flasher .
I never intended to touch CFW , but if that ’s how you want to play … ”
“ This is about more than this feature right now , ” he continues , “ It ’s about whether these companies have the right to take away advertised features from a product you purchased .
Imagine if an exploit were found in Safari on the iPhone , but instead of fixing it , Apple decides to pull web browsing altogether .
Legally , they may be within their right to do so , but we have to show them it ’s the wrong move for the future of the product and the company . ”
How very early - Jobs - and - Wozniakian of him , but it ’s hard to disagree with him .
Sony ’s behaviour here is despicable , and the company needs to know that .
Owners of the fat PlayStation 3 have had this feature advertised to them , and as such , they are entitled to it .
I hope the PR ramifications of this move will be massive , hurting the company .
This kind of stuff – like Apple ’s approach to jailbreaking iPhones – should not be possible .

Hi all , Blake Ross here .
Alex asked me to guest write a post this week because he 's a fan of the Firefox project , which I cofounded .
Before Firefox , I worked at Netscape throughout high school on its 6.x and 7.x releases .
It was my first experience in a professional programming shop .
I 'm writing this now from my therapist 's couch .
It 's hard for me to write a WTF , not because I can't remember one , but because I remember too many .
Netscape was one giant WTF , or as they called it back then , AOL .
The company had grown so inept that " WTF " became just another thing we said each day , like " Hey " or " What time is it ? " or " We just lost another 5 % " or " Marketing wants to replace the Back button with an ad for Bowflex " .
In fact , as I 'm sure you know , the Mozilla movement itself was born when Jim Barksdale looked at the old Netscape 4.x codebase and announced , with tremendous gusto and wondrous pride : WTF ?
I 've been reading this site since its inception and seen most of the classic coding errors .
There are a few doozies I could share -— a Netscape engineer who shan't be named once passed a pointer to JavaScript , stored it as a string and later passed it back to C , killing 30 —- but most are what I call " nested WTFs . "
The surrounding code is so equally offensive that you'd have to understand all of it before finally experiencing the epiphany of The One True WTF .
Such experiences , therefore , are best left to ABC miniseries .
If you 'll indulge me , I will instead share a poor product decision made about Netscape 7 , and that is : it was released .
More importantly , it was released without popup blocking , an egregious mistake given that :
Popups dominated the Web in 2002 .
No major consumer browser blocked them natively .
Mozilla 1.0 did , and that release was the basis of Netscape 7 .
AOL ordered us to cut popup blocking because its web properties , especially Netscape.com , relied on the advertising format .
Such is the life of an engineering organization which must design a browser for 20 billion websites and then optimize it for one of them .
( See also : theming the browser to integrate seamlessly with that site while clashing savagely with all others . )
So Mozilla 1.0 came out in June with popup blocking , and Netscape 7 came out six months later without it , but offered , as consolation , 12 AOL icons on your desktop .
Technology reviewers who understood the Netscape / Mozilla relationship did not miss the fact that Netscape went to additional trouble to remove popup blocking .
To put it another way , all Netscape had to do to release one of the most compelling browser features in years was : nothing .
They still managed to mess up for reasons I have n't yet figured out .
During my tenure at Netscape , I sat through more meetings than we had users , throughout which people seemed very good at doing nothing .
Fortunately , AOL management got the picture after c|net , in flagrant violation of marketing 's press kit , slammed the release for omitting the blocker .
To make things right , Netscape quickly released a version 7.01 that included it , but only after renaming it the " popup suppressor " ( " popup decongestant " was trademarked ) .
Unfortunately , the release also contained a feature called the " popup suppression whitelist . "
This was a list of sites that were still allowed to open popups , and it was seeded with all of the AOL properties that used them , such as Netscape.com .
By the way , Netscape.com was the default homepage .
Now back to my therapy , already in progress :
When dozens of people eagerly fired up the New Netscape 7.01 , Now With Popup Blocking ! , the very first thing they saw was a popup ad .
WTF ?
* Much has changed since these glorious years .
For instance , Netscape now adds only 7 AOL icons to your desktop .
But also , Netscape.com no longer has a popup ad .
You can still download Netscape 7.01 , turn on " popup suppression " and change your homepage to CNN to relive the magic .
