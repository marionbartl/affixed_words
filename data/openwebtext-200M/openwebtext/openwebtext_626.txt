Barely a left - wing pundit , barely an Oscar - nominated softie can sleep a wink these days for fear of the race riots and international humiliation that will ensue should " The One " be defeated on Tuesday .
They think he 's going to win , of course , but their hearts still bear the scars of 2000 and 2004 .
The comedian Chris Rock is at least capable of joking about it .
" If Obama loses ? " he replied to a question from talk show host Bill Maher .
" Well , that Wednesday after election day , anybody … any activity in your life that involves black people , it 's not going to get done .
If you 're at the airport ?
No one 's going to get your bags . "
But for others , the dread is nameless and paralysing .
Erica Jong , author of the 1970s feminist bible Fear of Flying , has developed a new complex in recent weeks - the fear of an Obama flogging .
" If Obama loses it will spark the second American Civil War .
Blood will run in the streets , believe me , " she told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera last week .
" My back is also suffering from spasms , so much so that I had to see an acupuncturist and get prescriptions for Valium .
" Yesterday , Jane Fonda sent me an email to tell me that she cried all night and can't cure her ailing back for all the stress that has reduced her to a bundle of nerves . "
The American shock - jock Rush Limbaugh , on hearing this last detail , had a direct , if crude , response .
" Maybe you should try getting off your back , Jane ! " he roared .
( The two are not friends . )
Hollywood in general is on red anxiety alert for an Obama loss .
Crack teams of chiropractors are at the ready , and Nissen huts full of qualified shrinks and aromatherapists line Rodeo Drive to soothe the tortured brigades of the psychologically wounded should " The One " be robbed of victory .
Actress Susan Sarandon has already issued a veiled threat to the public .
" It 's a critical time , but I have faith in the American people , " she told Britain 's Telegraph newspaper with a touch of implied menace in June this year .
" If they prove me wrong , I 'll be checking out a move to Italy .
Maybe Canada , I do n't know .
We 're at an abyss … "
Sarandon 's words qualify her for membership of a small but committed group of Potential Canadians ( PCs ) in American artistic and creative circles .
Barbra Streisand vowed to emigrate to Canada in 2000 if George Bush were ever elected President , an undertaking she refreshed four years later at the prospect of his re-election .
But she was still sufficiently resident in California on September 16 this year to host a $ US2500 ( $ 3800 ) a head fund - raiser for Obama at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel .
The actor Alec Baldwin and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder made similar threats in 2000 , as did Robert Redford in 2004 , but none has since enriched the Canadian cultural scene .
In fact , Canadian immigration records show that arrivals from the United States actually slowed in the six months after George Bush 's re-election in 2004 .
Greenpeace Releases Tenth Guide to Greener Electronics
November 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
It ’s time once again for the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics , and the results are sobering .
Despite plentiful attempts at greenwashing , most electronics companies are not making the changes necessary to significantly cut carbon emissions .
American companies Motorola , Microsoft , Dell , and Apple are faring the worst , with no plans to cut global warming pollution and no targets or timelines for CO2 reduction .
Of all the companies surveyed , only Fujitsu , Philips , and Sharp support the cuts in pollution levels necessary to reach a 2020 target of cutting emissions by 30 percent in industrial countries .
Additionally , only HP and Philips have committed to substantial cuts in their own emissions .
The electronics companies also had low scores in the usage of renewable energy , with only Nokia achieving the 25 percent clean power mark .
So while surveyed companies have made strides in reducing toxic chemicals in their products — all Apple products will be free of PVC and brominated flame retardants by the end of 2008 — there is still much progress to be made in the electronics industry .

A little known survival aid related to wilderness fire making skills is the Dakota Fire Hole , also known as the Dakota Fire Pit .
This handy device is easy to construct and has marked advantages over other types of camp fire constructs .
Once you make a Dakota fire hole and try it out , you may choose to use this method for outdoor fires on a regular basis .
Making a Dakota Fire
Hole is initially more labor intensive than simply building a fire on the surface of the ground .
However the outlay in energy required to make a Dakota fire hole is more than offset by its efficient consumption of fuel ; it greatly reduces the amount of firewood required to cook meals , treat water to destroy pathogens , or warm your body .
The Dakota fire hole is a valuable wilderness survival aid because it burns fuel more efficiently , producing hotter fires with less wood .
In many areas firewood is scarce or requires a large amount of time and expenditure of energy in foraging to obtain it .
Once you build a fire , efforts are better spent attending to your other wilderness survival needs rather than in the constant gathering of firewood .
Other advantages of the Dakota fire hole are that it creates a kind of woodstove with a stable platform that is very convenient to cook over .
Should you need to conceal your fire , the fire hole will limit the amount of visible smoke that rises from the fire , since the fuel wood is burning hotter and more efficiently .
The pit will also help conceal the light emitted from your fire , especially at night when even a single candle flame can be seen from miles away .
Where to Build a Dakota Fire Hole
Before you start to dig your Dakota fire hole you should scout out an area where soil conditions are conducive to its proper construction .
You will want to avoid areas
that are rocky and difficult to dig
with thick tree roots that require cutting
that are wet or where a dug hole will fill with water .
with soil conditions such as dry loose sand that will not hold shape as it is dug into
The usual requirements related to general fire craft and care always apply .
As always , treat the wilderness areas you enjoy and count on to survive with respect .
Be sure you do not make a Dakota Fire Hole in conditions where out of control wild fires are a possibility and avoid ecologically sensitive areas .
Try not to injure the roots of trees and plants .
Follow local ordinances regarding the making of fires ; these rules are in place for good reason .
Making a Dakota Fire Hole
Now that we have the introduction taken care of , we can make a Dakota Fire Hole .
As shown in the picture , I am using an army folding shovel to dig with .
Many wilderness survivors carry a small hand trowel for the burying of human wastes and this also works well .
A strong stick or part from your mess kit can also be utilized for digging holes in a pinch ; survival experts are experts at innovation so use whatever means you have available .
Making the Fire Pit Chamber
Having selected a likely area in which to dig the fire hole , first remove a plug of soil and plant roots in the form of a circle about 10 or 12 inches in diameter .
Continue digging straight down to a depth of about one - foot being sure to save the plug and the soil you removed for replacement later on .
This part of the Dakota fire hole will serve as the main chamber that contains the fire .
I prefer to extend the base of the fire chamber outward a couple of inches in all directions so that it can accommodate longer pieces of firewood .
This saves time and energy in breaking up firewood into suitable lengths , and also has the effect of allowing larger and therefore hotter fires .
The effect is a jug - shaped hole at the base of which you place firewood .
The neck of the jug will serve as a chimney of sorts the function of which is to increase the draft and concentrate the heat of the fire into the small opening .
Making the Dakota Fire Hole Airway
Now comes the key component of the Dakota hole that makes this fire making method so effective ; the airway .
Before you start on the airway tunnel , determine the general direction of the wind .
If the wind is too light to easily ascertain its direction you can often lick a finger and hold it up , being sure it is away from any obstructions .
Evaporative cooling on one side or the other of your appendage will be felt from which direction the wind , however light , is blowing .
That is the side of the fire hole on which to construct the airway .
Dig a 6 - inch diameter airway tunnel starting about one foot away from the edge of the fire hole .
Angle its construction so that the tunnel intersects with the base of the fire chamber as shown in the diagram and picture .
As when you made the fire hole section , be sure to save the plug containing the vegetation and roots as well as the loose soil you remove .
Now that the Dakota Fire Hole is properly constructed , you can partially fill the fire pit chamber with dry combustible kindling materials and light the fire .
To start the fire I am using a FireSteel , the kind Survival Topics highly recommends to be included in every survival kit .
These firesteels from FireSteel.com work even when wet and will literally light thousands of fires before wearing out – try doing that with matches or a lighter !
They sell high quality Firesteels at the lowest prices in the Survival Supplies section of this website .
Help support this website and buy them here – I guarantee a quality product .
Once the flame is going strong , drop it into the fire pit so that it catches the kindling on fire ; gradually add sticks so that a strong hot fire is maintained .
How a Dakota Fire Hole Works
The accompanying diagram shows the secret of what makes the Dakota Firehole so effective .
As the fire burns , the hot air that is created goes up through the fire hole “ chimney ” .
This creates a suction action that forcefully draws air down through the tunnel and into the base of the fire .
The draft is increased even more by your having constructed the tunnel on the side from which the prevailing wind is coming .
Acting as a kind of bellows , the flames are continuously fanned and the fire burns hotter and more efficiently than a fire that is simply made on the surface to the ground .
Hotter fires mean less smoke .
In addition , the heat of the fire is concentrated into an upward direction where you can better capture it for use .
This allows you to do more with less wood – an excellent survival fire by any measure .
Fire Hole Improvements
Once you have made the Dakota fire hole you can easily set up a cooking surface for pots and pans by laying several parallel green sticks across the fire pit as show in the picture .
Lacking camp cooking gear you can also find a flat rock that only partially covers the hole – and use it as a sort of hobo frying pan .
It is also an easy matter to set a “ Y ” shaped stick into the ground onto which is rested a green pole with bannock dough , fish , or other outdoor meal .
For more information on the wilderness survival staple known as bannock .
Campfire Cleanup
When it is time to leave the area , be a responsible wilderness survivor who values the land you need for survival .
Fill in the Dakota fire hole with the dirt you removed and saved when you were constructing it .
Then replace the cap of vegetation .
Doing so serves the double purpose of extinguishing the fire and leaving as little trace of your visit as possible .
In summary , the main advantages of using a Dakota Fire Hole include :
burns hotter
with less fuel
producing less smoke
less light visible to reveal your position
providing a stable cooking surface
easy extinguishing of the fire
easy removal of evidence you have been there when you are preparing to leave .
There can be no doubt , making the Dakota Fire Hole one of the best types of survival fires you can make when surviving in the wilderness .
You can call me " dense , " you can call me " iconoclastic , " but I see nothing constructive about an annual pay and performance review .
It 's a mainstream practice that has baffled me for years .
To my way of thinking , a one - side - accountable , boss - administered review is little more than a dysfunctional pretense .
It 's a negative to corporate performance , an obstacle to straight - talk relationships , and a prime cause of low morale at work .
Even the mere knowledge that such an event will take place damages daily communications and teamwork .
The alleged primary purpose of performance reviews is to enlighten subordinates about what they should be doing better or differently .
But I see the primary purpose quite differently .
I see it as intimidation aimed at preserving the boss 's authority and power advantage .
Such intimidation is unnecessary , though :
The boss has the power with or without the performance review .
And yes , I have an alternative in mind that will get people and corporations a great deal more of what they actually need .
To make my case , I offer seven reasons why I find performance reviews ill - advised and bogus .
This morning I posted the price - to - rent ratios for the U.S and a few selected cities .
Here is a look at house price to median household income :
Click on image for larger graph in new window .
This graph shows the price - to - income ratio and is based off the Case - Shiller national index , and the Census Bureau 's median income Historical Income Tables - Households ( and an estimate of 2 % increase in household median income for 2008 ) .
Using national median income and house prices provides a gross overview of price - to - income ( it would be better to do this analysis on a local area ) .
However this does shows that the price - to - income is still too high , and that this ratio needs to fall another 15 % or so .
The further decline in this ratio could be a combination of falling house prices and / or rising nominal incomes ( Note : this uses nominal incomes , and even if real incomes are stagnant or declining , nominal incomes usually are rising ) .
Last quarter this index was over 1.25 .
Now it is close to 1.2 .
At this pace the index will hit 1.0 in Q3 2009 .
However , during a recession , nominal household median incomes are usually stagnate - so it might take even longer .
MANTECA , Calif . 
As the classified ads put it , everything must go .
Socks .

Three - year - old Marita Duarte ’s tricycle was sold by her mother , Beatriz , to a stranger for $ 3 even as her daughter was riding it .
On Mission Ridge Drive and other avenues , lanes and ways in this formerly booming community , even birthday celebrations must go .
“ It was no money , no birthday , ” said Ms. Duarte , who lost her job as a floral designer two months ago .
The family commemorated Marita ’s third birthday without presents last week , the occasion marked by a small cake with Cinderella on the vanilla frosting .
They will move into a rental apartment next month .
An eternity ago , people in this city in northern San Joaquin County braved four - hour round - trip commutes to the San Francisco Bay Area for a toehold on the dream .
Today , Manteca ’s lawns and driveways are storefronts of the new garage - sale economy  the telltale yellow signs plastered in the rear windows of parked cars Friday through Sunday directing traffic to yet another sale , yet another family .
“ You can get great deals , ” said Sharrell Johnson , 32 , who was scouting for toys in the Indian summer heat last Friday amid boxes of tools and DVDs and forests of little skirts and shirts dangling from plastic hangers on suspended rope .
“ Sad to say , you ’re finding really good things .
Because everybody ’s losing their homes . ”
Why You Should Use Adobe Flash and Why You Should Avoid It
The oldest browser plugin to date is Adobe Flash Player , but it ’s waning in terms of popularity .
In fact , most tech experts have cautioned users from using it – to uninstall it from their computers and laptops and use HTML5 .
With so much urging , users have wondered if they need to uninstall the Adobe Flash Player from their computer or use it sparingly .
If you ’re wondering about whether or not to keep it , here are a few things to keep in mind :
Website Management –
If you run or own a website with Flash player , users can still find and browse your site .
Many Internet users still have the plugin , which makes your site accessible to your visitors .

Music Players – Many music players such as Spotify Web use Flash Player for you to play and listen to music .
There are many reasons to use Adobe Flash Player , but there are several reasons to stop using it too .
You ’d Rather Have A Secure System
Flash Player is well - known for being riddled with bugs .
These bugs can be used by hackers to steal a person ’s private information or to remote access their computer .
Adobe is constantly working on ways to deal with those issues , but they are always under attack .
You Want A Faster Browser Speed
One reason Apple failed to add Flash Player to its iPhone is that it causes browsers to slow down in speed .
If you ’re not worried about speed , then sticking with Adobe Flash is fine .
While Flash Player has been around for some time , its importance and popularity have waned considerably .
Do you keep it or get rid of it ?
The choice is up to you .
Latest Firefox Has Issues Initializing Adobe Flash Player
Most people realize that Google no longer allows the Adobe Flash Player plugin in its Chrome , but it appears that Mozilla Firefox also has some issues with the program .
In fact , a Flash Player user brought up the issue on the Adobe forum to bring to light the issue of the Flash Player installation .
According to the writer , they updated to the Firefox 53 version in the hopes that some kind of clue would come to light about what happened .
It appears that trying to open the Adobe Flash Player setup file , they had the “ Initialization problem ” message come across their screen .
In order to get to the bottom of the issue , an Adobe tech chimed in to ask for more information about the OS the OP was using including the version .
It appears the OP was using the Windows 10 Creators Update .
As of right now , there ’s no fix for it , and it ’s not been traced back to the OS .
The forum user was assured that Adobe was looking into the matter .
The staff member wanted to get the OP ’s installation log files to see what was going on .

American scientists tested a new ultra - high - power laser which provokes lightning .
Scientists fired ultra - fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region .
The beams sent from the laser made channels of ionized molecules , also known as " filaments . "
It is worth mentioning that before the lighting strikes earth the filaments lead electricity through the clouds , playing the role of lightning rods .
Researchers generated filaments that are too short - lived to trigger a real lightning strike .
According to the French and German scientists , the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke thunder strikes on demand .
It is worth mentioning that for the first time the proposal of using laser to provoke thunderbolts was made in 1970s , but back then there has been no laser powerful enough to achieve the goal .
In laboratories scientists widely use powerful lasers that can create terawatts of energy .
But to make an experiment outdoors , researchers applied a new type of laser , named Teramobile , created by a teem of engineers from France and Germany .
" This is the first laser that has terawatt power and is also mobile , " outlined Andre Mysyrowicz , a researcher working at the Ecole Nationale Superieure de Techniques Avancees , Paris , France .
Researchers performed their experiment during a stormy weather .
They placed the laser on top of South Baldy Peak in New Mexico .
Scientists had the goal of provoking lightning strikes using an increasing rate of pulses sent from the terawatt laser and applying more complicated sequences of laser pulses .
Mr. Mysyrowicz explains that when the laser beam goes through the air , on its way to the cloud it becomes progressively more intense due to a process called " self - focusing . "
" The air acts like a succession of lenses , focusing the laser , " mentioned Mysyrowicz .
The lightning strike is caused by the filaments of plasma , which a generated by the molecules ionized by air .
The filaments of plasma reach a length of several hundreds of meters .
According to scientists , the main goal of provoking lightning is to deplete unpredictable storms before they cause chaos and destruction .
" Lightning control , if you want to protect particular sites , would be very useful .
You could avoid lightning on very expensive or fragile sites , " says Mysyrowicz .

Tallahassee Democrat | Nov 17 , 2008
The National Weather Service in Tallahassee has issued a hard freeze warning for the Tallahassee area on Tuesday and Wednesday night .
According to Kelly Godsey , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee , a hard freeze is when the temperature drops below 26 degrees for two or more hours .
Tuesday itself will see high clouds and some wind , said Godsey .
Once sunset comes though , the temperature will plummet .
To make matters worse , there should be a slight breeze on Wednesday morning to increase the wind chill factor .
On Wednesday morning the projected low is 25 degrees Fahrenheit .
If that proves correct , it would set a new record .
The previous low for November 19 was 29 degrees and was set in 1990 .
If it ’s any consolation , Wednesday should be warmer .
Godsey anticipates a balmy 29 degrees by Wednesday night .

A thief caught on camera stealing expensive equipment picked the wrong target if he wanted to keep a low profile : a billboard company that has plastered his image around New Zealand 's largest city seeking his capture .
The unidentified thief was photographed by a suspicious onlooker as he uncoupled 15 electrical transformers used to boost the lighting on a billboard in Auckland .
The photographer knew the pillaged sign belonged to Mark Venter , who runs OTW Advertising , one of New Zealand 's oldest billboard companies .
IN THE anthropologically isolated subculture of elite bloggers , it was the equivalent of a watershed , and certainly a tear - shed .
With “ a heavy heart , and much consideration ” , Jason Calacanis this summer announced his “ retirement from blogging ” , which he believed was “ the right decision for me and my family ” .
Mr Calacanis , a founder of Weblogs , Inc. , a blog network that he later sold to AOL , an internet portal , had been a member of the “ A - list ” — those bloggers with the most incoming links and the highest “ authority ” on blog - search engines such as Technorati .
With the bathos of Napoleon departing for Elba or Michael Jordan bidding adieu to basketball , Mr Calacanis bowed out , reverting to the ancient medium of e-mail to disseminate his opinions .
“ Blogging is simply too big , too impersonal , and lacks the intimacy that drew me to it , ” he offered by way of explanation .
It was , he said , “ the pressure ” of staying on the A - list — ie , of keeping his blog so big and impersonal — that got him .
Only a few years ago , so few people blogged that being a blogosphere celebrity required little more than showing up .
Now it takes hard work .
And vitriol .
“ Today the blogosphere is so charged , so polarised , and so filled with haters hating that it 's simply not worth it , ” Mr Calacanis lamented .
The rest of the world may well have missed the unfolding of his tragedy .
Behind it , however , is a bigger trend .
Blogging has entered the mainstream , which — as with every new medium in history — looks to its pioneers suspiciously like death .
To the earliest practitioners , over a decade ago , blogging was the regular posting of text updates , and later photos and videos , about themselves and their thoughts to a few friends and family members .
Today lots of internet users do this , only they may not think of it as blogging .
Instead , they update their profile pages on Facebook , MySpace or other social networks .
They may also “ micro - blog ” on services such as Twitter , which recreate the raw , immediate and intimate feel of early blogs .
Twitter messages , usually sent from mobile phones , are fewer than 140 characters long and answer the question “ What are you doing ? ”
Tellingly , Evan Williams , the co-founder of Blogger — an early blogging service that is now owned by Google , the Wal - Mart of the internet — now runs Twitter , which he regards as the future .
As for traditional ( if that is the word ) blog pages , these tend increasingly to belong to conventional media organisations .
Nearly every newspaper , radio and television channel now runs blogs and updates them faster than any individual blogger ever could .
Professional blogs such as HuffingtonPost.com for liberals ( with 4.5 m visitors in September ) or FreeRepublic.com for conservatives ( with 1 m visitors in that month ) have played a big role in America 's election season , according to comScore , an online - measurement firm .
These “ new media ” firms are now suffering from the same advertising slowdown as their offline rivals .
Gawker , a gossip - blog empire , has already begun laying off bloggers .
Simultaneously , companies far outside the media industry have embraced blogging as just another business tool .
They are using blogs both to get corporate messages to the public and as an internal medium for staff .
Companies like Six Apart , which provides Movable Type , TypePad and other blogging tools , see firms as their most promising market .
Gone , in other words , is any sense that blogging as a technology is revolutionary , subversive or otherwise exalted , and this upsets some of its pioneers .
Confirmed , however , is the idea that blogging is useful and versatile .
In essence , it is a straightforward content - management system that posts updates in reverse - chronological order and allows comments and other social interactions .
Viewed as such , blogging may “ die ” in much the same way that personal - digital assistants ( PDAs ) have died .
A decade ago , PDAs were the preserve of digerati who liked using electronic address books and calendars .
Now they are gone , but they are also ubiquitous , as features of almost every mobile phone .
Then he will say to those at his left hand , “ Depart from me , you cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels ; for I was hungry and you gave me no food , I was thirsty and you gave me no drink , I was a stranger and you did not welcome me , naked and you did not clothe me , sick and in prison and you did not visit me . ” ( Mathew 25:41 - 46 )
Memorize these verses and take them to heart when you see one party claiming monopoly on Jesus in the United States .
Symbolism aside , the main question is : for a believer , who is to decide whether being a Democrat , even a pro-choice one , is evil ?
As a Catholic , what are my choices in this presidential election ?
On one side , we have a much maligned Democrat with a pro-choice record .
On the other side , we have a Republican who is pro-life on abortion issue while being anti-life in other matters .
How would I choose the lesser of the two evils ?
I can deliberate on the effects of their policies and come upon my own opinion .
My deliberations , soul searching , and research on the candidates have led me to choose Barack Obama as the candidate who reflects my Catholic values .
One prominent Catholic scholar who has come to the same conclusion is Douglas W. Kmiec , a conservative Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations official and leading pro-life legal scholar who endorsed Barack Obama despite his strong anti-abortion views .
The main argument that he put forward was that Obama cares for the whole spectrum of pro-life issues including poverty , torture and human rights and that Obama 's abortion reduction program would actually have a bigger impact on saving lives than a traditional war against Roe v. Wade .
He recently published a book called Can a Catholic Support Him ?
Asking the Big Questions About Barack Obama and published an op -ed in The Los Angeles Times titled “ For Obama and Against Abortion ” on Oct. 17 .
The reaction to Kmiec ’s declarations was stunning .
There was a huge backlash against him and the words that described his action included : duplicitous , treason , Benedict Arnold , treachery , traitor , delusion , etc .
He was even denied communion by a priest at his church .
These people might want to open their bible and read Matt.
7 : 1 - 5 , which starts with these words : “ Judge not , that you be not judged . ”
What these critics fail to recognize is the reality in terms of the fight against abortions .
Can any of these people come up with a practical way to address abortion issue that includes overturning Roe v. Wade ?
So , as a Catholic who believes that we need to prevent abortions , I have come to the determination that Obama 's policies would help the cause more than what John McCain is standing for .
Let me explain how .
The main evidence comes from Obama 's response from the final presidential debate at Hofstra University .
He said : “ Abortion is always a tragic situation ... and we should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth , communicating that sexuality is sacred ... and providing options for adoption and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby ...
Nobody is pro-abortion ...
We should try to reduce these circumstances . ”
This reply alone proves that he sees the complete picture in the issue .
Abortion is a symptom of a bigger problem and if we can curb the root causes , abortions will be drastically reduced .
Now , contrast this very practical solution with McCain 's opposition of sex education and support of abstinence - only education .
Common sense and reality proves that it does not reduce unwanted pregnancies .
We do not want an impractical solution that never contributes to the cause .
Remember , it has not worked in decades .
We need a solution that works .
An uncle of mine , who is an archbishop in Asia , has remarked that the Catholic Church in the United States has lost its direction fighting the war against abortion and gay rights .
The debate sadly pushes aside the real issues that face the society ; the real action that needs to be taken by us fellow Christians .
Inequality and poverty should be the primary issues that we need to care about as a society .
Abortion and gay rights , which are cases of individual morality , should be left to the individuals .
I cannot agree more with Douglas Kmiec ; this is federalism at its best , the issues solved first in the family , church and the community .
So , as a Catholic , I 'd rather see the Church acknowledge that social morality is at least as important as individual morality .
But Republican policies in the past decade have made me wonder if they even agree .
Cutting health - care to children in different states is definitely not pro-life .
Waging an unnecessary war that results in hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions dollars of taxpayer money is not a Christian way of doing things .
The so called neo-conservatives , whom McCain bravely fought against in 2000 and later sold his soul to , do not stand for my values as a Catholic .
Their support for a baseless war , torture and death penalty makes them the real party of death .
If anyone thinks Jesus is siding with the GOP against the marginalized millions — the unemployed man in Pennsylvania who got laid off and had to pack his machinery to be sent to China ; the uninsured mother who was denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition ; or a widowed mother grieving over a son lost in Iraq — it is you who has some serious explaining to do , not Kmiec .
And to suggest that it is a duty of a Catholic to condemn Barack Obama and anyone who supports him is a betrayal of the same values that Jesus gave us .

Obama 's Plan Now Available Posted by Pile ( 9903 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Humor ]
A video has been leaked onto the net confirming what McCain supporters feared ...
This Could Be True
Posted by MrWorrier on 2008-11-10 00:56:27
The video fails to mention that the choice is either military service or community service so I assume that the government will allow the military will be marketing to those needing financial aide , etc ...
Personally , I think Barack will be building up the military so the next warmonger , or even Barack himself , can mobilize as needed .
The scary part is that Barack 's army might even be used to control peace demonstrators , etc ...
In the UK , there was an article in their papers about censoring the newspapers when " national security . "

So , watch out below !
since people bought Obama 's smile and , in return , will be betrayed .

Personally , I think that Barack will build up the military to allow the next warmonger , or even Barack himself , to mobilize it as needed .
The scary part is that Barack 's army might even be used to control peace demonstrators , etc ...
Moreover , UK newspapers are saying that their government intends to censor them when " national security " is at stake .

So , watch out below people since you bought Obama 's smile and , in return , he 'll betray you !
Better grammar , but not spelling or insight

It 's grammar NOT grammer !
This video is a satire by the way !
Obama is not going to build up the military .
He 's going to look for cost savings if anything .
There 's a small matter of a financial meltdown to deal with .
Nor is he going to use the army to ' control peace demonstrators . '
Even if he wanted to repress dissent he'd use a different agency to do it , probably an arm of the FBI , which is what the Bush regime has long been doing to animal rights activists .

David McClain ignited some interest on the LispWorks mailing list when he celebrated some major performance gains for his Lisp audio application .
After getting several requests for more information , he followed up with some details :
He also sent me this message , with some screenshots :
Hi Zach ,
I do n't have a white paper on this , per se , but it is being heavily used in our GigaDSP simulator ( see attached pics ) , which is ( except for the vDSP FFT library use ) , a 100 % Lisp program .
GDSP uses a form of reactive programming ( RPS ) to effect a totally asynchronous network environment .
Blocks with brown lower borders are system primitives , coded in Lisp with super - macros that describe everything from how they respond to inputs on their pins , to how they respond with editable properties , and save persistent properties .
But complete asynchrony means total anarchy too , so you can't predict when one block will fire over another .
To fend off this non- determinism , where needed , we use a sub- clocking device that issues sub -cycle clocks in a predictable order , all of which must fire and complete before the next major clock cycle .
That way we can use an asynchronous network to effect a systolic chain of processing .
The pic with the beige background is the top - level network environment .
If you double click on a macro block ( those with blue lower borders ) you open up their editor ( the blue background ) which is just another nested network .
This can go on to arbitrary depth .
So in addition to coding high - performance primitives in the Lisp super - macros , any ( unknowledgeable about Lisp ) user can design his / her own processing blocks out of combinations of other primitive and macro blocks .
There are property sheets and block selection menus that can be popped up on the display .
I also use this to model audio processors ( refined- audiometrics.com ) .
GDSP allows me to visualize the transients that go by so quickly you would n't be able to catch them otherwise .
Then after exploring the math and the algorithms in GDSP , I take the results and implement them on a 20 - DSP Kyma system ( www.symbolicsound.com) for realtime performance and analysis on real audio being piped through my studio here in the lab .
Kyma is a Smalltalk environment , and Capybara is the 20 - DSP realtime audio processing box that Kyma ( the language ) controls .
All in all , the whole setup here from Lisp and GDSP through Kyma and Capybara is hard to beat .
The only thing that would make things even more fun would be to have all of Kyma written in Lisp too !
We use GDSP to help us design ultra - high - speed wireless radio links ( 10 - 40 Gbps ) operating in the millimeter wavelength regime ( 100 - 200 GHz ) .

Let me know if I can answer any other questions for you .

CHICAGO -- Is Charlie Weis ' job as the head football coach at Notre Dame safe because of the size of his contract buyout ?
A person with knowledge of Weis ' contract told ESPN's Joe Schad on Wednesday that the amount Notre Dame would have to pay Weis is greater than $ 4 million to $ 5 million , which was reported earlier Wednesday by the Chicago Tribune .
The source told Schad that the buyout , which is specified in the contract , is " stupefying . "
The Tribune , citing multiple sources , reported that the size of Weis ' buyout -- previously said to be as much as $ 10 million -- is inaccurate and put the figure at closer to $ 4 million .
The paper also said that the amount is n't enough to affect whether Notre Dame decides to part ways with Weis .
Notre Dame ( 6 - 5 ) , coming off an embarrassing home loss to lightly - regarded Syracuse , plays at No. 5 USC on Saturday night ( 8 p.m. ET , ESPN ) .
Notre Dame is a 32 - point underdog ; no Irish team has been more than a 24 - point underdog since 1975 .
The Tribune reported that typical buyouts for college football coaches are base salary times years remaining on a contract .
Weis ' base salary ( not including outside income ) for the 2007 season was $ 598,000 , according to a report in the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette , which attributed the figure to Notre Dame 's tax forms .
Inside the Linux scheduler
The latest version of this all - important kernel component improves scalability
This article reviews the Linux 2.6 task scheduler and its most important attributes .
But before diving into the details of the scheduler , let 's understand a scheduler 's basic goals .
What is a scheduler ?
An operating system , in a general sense , mediates between applications and available resources .
Some typical resources are memory and physical devices .
But a CPU can also be considered a resource to which a scheduler can temporarily allocate a task ( in quantities called slices of time ) .
The scheduler makes it possible to execute multiple programs at the same time , thus sharing the CPU with users of varying needs .
An important goal of a scheduler is to allocate CPU time slices efficiently while providing a responsive user experience .
The scheduler can also be faced with such conflicting goals as minimizing response times for critical real - time tasks while maximizing overall CPU utilization .
Let 's see how the Linux 2.6 scheduler accomplishes these goals , compared to earlier schedulers .
Problems with earlier Linux schedulers
The importance of O - notation O - notation gives you an idea how much time an algorithm will use .
The time for an O ( n ) algorithm depends on the input ( linear with n ) , whereas O( n ^ 2 ) is quadratic to the input .
O( 1 ) is independent of the input and operates in constant time .
Before the 2.6 kernel , the scheduler had a significant limitation when many tasks were active .
This was due to the scheduler being implemented using an algorithm with O ( n ) complexity .
In this type of scheduler , the time it takes to schedule a task is a function of the number of tasks in the system .
In other words , the more tasks ( n ) are active , the longer it takes to schedule a task .
At very high loads , the processor can be consumed with scheduling and devote little time to the tasks themselves .
Thus , the algorithm lacked scalability .
The pre-2.6 scheduler also used a single runqueue for all processors in a symmetric multiprocessing system ( SMP ) .
This meant a task could be scheduled on any processor -- which can be good for load balancing but bad for memory caches .
For example , suppose a task executed on CPU - 1 , and its data was in that processor 's cache .
If the task got rescheduled to CPU - 2 , its data would need to be invalidated in CPU - 1 and brought into CPU - 2 .
The prior scheduler also used a single runqueue lock ; so , in an SMP system , the act of choosing a task to execute locked out any other processors from manipulating the runqueues .
The result was idle processors awaiting release of the runqueue lock and decreased efficiency .
Finally , preemption was n't possible in the earlier scheduler ; this meant that a lower priority task could execute while a higher priority task waited for it to complete .
Introducing the Linux 2.6 scheduler
The 2.6 scheduler was designed and implemented by Ingo Molnar .
Ingo has been involved in Linux kernel development since 1995 .
His motivation in working on the new scheduler was to create a completely O ( 1 ) scheduler for wakeup , context - switch , and timer interrupt overhead .
One of the issues that triggered the need for a new scheduler was the use of Java™ virtual machines ( JVMs ) .
The Java programming model uses many threads of execution , which results in lots of overhead for scheduling in an O ( n ) scheduler .
An O ( 1 ) scheduler does n't suffer under high loads , so JVMs execute efficiently .
The 2.6 scheduler resolves the primary three issues found in the earlier scheduler ( O(n ) and SMP scalability issues ) , as well as other problems .
Now we 'll explore the basic design of the 2.6 scheduler .
Major scheduling structures
Let 's start with a review of the 2.6 scheduler structures .
Each CPU has a runqueue made up of 140 priority lists that are serviced in FIFO order .
Tasks that are scheduled to execute are added to the end of their respective runqueue 's priority list .
Each task has a time slice that determines how much time it 's permitted to execute .
The first 100 priority lists of the runqueue are reserved for real - time tasks , and the last 40 are used for user tasks ( see Figure 1 ) .
You 'll see later why this distinction is important .
Figure 1 . The Linux 2.6 scheduler runqueue structure
In addition to the CPU 's runqueue , which is called the active runqueue , there 's also an expired runqueue .
When a task on the active runqueue uses all of its time slice , it 's moved to the expired runqueue .
During the move , its time slice is recalculated ( and so is its priority ; more on this later ) .
If no tasks exist on the active runqueue for a given priority , the pointers for the active and expired runqueues are swapped , thus making the expired priority list the active one .
The job of the scheduler is simple : choose the task on the highest priority list to execute .
To make this process more efficient , a bitmap is used to define when tasks are on a given priority list .
Therefore , on most architectures , a find - first - bit - set instruction is used to find the highest priority bit set in one of five 32 - bit words ( for the 140 priorities ) .
The time it takes to find a task to execute depends not on the number of active tasks but instead on the number of priorities .
This makes the 2.6 scheduler an O ( 1 ) process because the time to schedule is both fixed and deterministic regardless of the number of active tasks .
Better support for SMP systems
So , what is SMP ?
It 's an architecture in which multiple CPUs are available to execute individual tasks simultaneously , and it differs from traditional asymmetrical processing in which a single CPU executes all tasks .
The SMP architecture can be beneficial for multithreaded applications .
Even though the prior scheduler worked in SMP systems , its big - lock architecture meant that while a CPU was choosing a task to dispatch , the runqueue was locked by the CPU , and others had to wait .
The 2.6 scheduler does n't use a single lock for scheduling ; instead , it has a lock on each runqueue .
This allows all CPUs to schedule tasks without contention from other CPUs .
In addition , with a runqueue per processor , a task generally shares affinity with a CPU and can better utilize the CPU 's hot cache .
Task preemption
Another advantage of the Linux 2.6 scheduler is that it allows preemption .
This means a lower - priority task wo n't execute while a higher - priority task is ready to run .
The scheduler preempts the lower - priority process , places the process back on its priority list , and then reschedules .
But wait , there 's more !
As if the O ( 1 ) nature of the 2.6 scheduler and preemption were n't enough , the scheduler also offers dynamic task prioritization and SMP load balancing .
Let 's discuss what these are and the benefits they provide .
Dynamic task prioritization
To prevent tasks from hogging the CPU and thus starving other tasks that need CPU access , the Linux 2.6 scheduler can dynamically alter a task 's priority .
It does so by penalizing tasks that are bound to a CPU and rewarding tasks that are I /O bound .
I /O - bound tasks commonly use the CPU to set up an I/O and then sleep awaiting the completion of the I/O .
This type of behavior gives other tasks access to the CPU .
Better user responsiveness
Tasks that communicate with the user are interactive and therefore are given preference over noninteractive tasks .
Because communication to the user ( whether emitting data to stdout or awaiting input via stdin ) is I / O bound , these tasks are given a priority boost that results in better interactive responsiveness .
Because I /O - bound tasks are viewed as altruistic for CPU access , their priority is decreased ( a reward ) by a maximum of five priority levels .
CPU - bound tasks are punished by having their priority increased by up to five levels .
Tasks are determined to be I /O - bound or CPU - bound based on an interactivity heuristic .
A task 's interactiveness metric is calculated based on how much time the task executes compared to how much time it sleeps .
Note that because I /O tasks schedule I/O and then wait , an I / O - bound task spends more time sleeping and waiting for I/O completion .
This increases its interactive metric .
It 's important to note that priority adjustments are performed only on user tasks , not on real - time tasks .
SMP load balancing
When tasks are created in an SMP system , they 're placed on a given CPU 's runqueue .
In the general case , you can't know when a task will be short - lived or when it will run for a long time .
Therefore , the initial allocation of tasks to CPUs is likely suboptimal .
To maintain a balanced workload across CPUs , work can be redistributed , taking work from an overloaded CPU and giving it to an underloaded one .
The Linux 2.6 scheduler provides this functionality by using load balancing .
Every 200 ms , a processor checks to see whether the CPU loads are unbalanced ; if they are , the processor performs a cross-CPU balancing of tasks .
A negative aspect of this process is that the new CPU 's cache is cold for a migrated task ( needing to pull its data into the cache ) .
Remember that a CPU 's cache is local ( on - chip ) memory that offers fast access over the system 's memory .
If a task is executed on a CPU , and data associated with the task is brought into the CPU 's local cache , it 's considered hot .
If no data for a task is located in the CPU 's local cache , then for this task , the cache is considered cold .
It 's unfortunate , but keeping the CPUs busy makes up for the problem of a CPU cache being cold for a migrated task .
Dig for more gold
The source for the 2.6 scheduler is well encapsulated in the file /usr / src/linux / kernel / sched .c .
Some of the more interesting functions that can be found in this file are listed in Table 1 .
Table 1 . Linux 2.6 scheduler functions Function name Function description schedule
The main scheduler function .
Schedules the highest priority task for execution .
load_balance
Checks the CPU to see whether an imbalance exists , and attempts to move tasks if not balanced .
effective_prio
Returns the effective priority of a task ( based on the static priority , but includes any rewards or penalties ) .
recalc_task_prio
Determines a task 's bonus or penalty based on its idle time .
source_load Conservatively calculates the load of the source CPU ( from which a task could be migrated ) .
target_load Liberally calculates the load of a target CPU ( where a task has the potential to be migrated ) .
migration_thread
High - priority system thread that migrates tasks between CPUs .
The runqueue structure can also be found in the / usr / src / linux / kernel / sched .c file .
The 2.6 scheduler can optionally provide statistics ( if enabled via CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS ) .
The statistics are available from the / proc filesystem at / proc / schedstat and present a variety of data for each CPU in the system , including load - balancing and process - migration statistics .
Looking ahead
The Linux 2.6 scheduler has come a long way from the earlier Linux schedulers .
It has made great strides in maximizing CPU utilization while providing a responsive experience for the user .
Preemption and better support for multiprocessor architectures move it closer to an operating system that 's useful both on the desktop and on the real - time system .
The Linux 2.8 kernel is far away , but from looking at the changes in 2.6 , I see good things ahead .

Timothy Shepherd was sentenced late Tuesday to 99 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine , the maximum punishment for the murder of former girlfriend Tynesha Stewart , whom he strangled and dismembered before burning her remains on two barbecue grills in March 2007 .
Sitting between his lawyers , Shepherd showed no emotion as he leaned back , rested his chin on his hand and listened to Stewart 's mother and sister testify from the witness stand during their victim impact statements .
" You 're no man , " said Stewart 's sister , Gayla Taylor .
" You 're still a scared little boy .
I feel sorry for you .
Your soul is gone . "
Stewart 's mother , Gale Shields , said she will forgive Shepherd and hopes he gets mental help .
" I have to forgive Timothy if I 'm going to see Tynesha again , " Shields said .
Testimony during the trial showed that the two had a history of domestic violence , something Stewart 's mother and sister railed against after the verdict .
" Timothy once was a wonderful , wonderful man , " Shields said .
" There are always red flags and young people need to recognize the red flags . "
It also was a point addressed in a short statement to reporters after the verdict .
" In the interest of the public , we hope the media coverage will pay more attention to the details regarding the nature of the relationship between Tynesha and Tim that could lead to this event and less on the events that occurred after the murder , " said the jury foreman , who read the statement and declined to give his name .
" An increased awareness of the indicators of domestic abuse could prevent such an event in the future . "
Shepherd , 28 , said the two were arguing in his north Harris County apartment about a man Stewart was dating at college when she grabbed a knife from a table and came toward him .
Shepherd testified that Stewart , 19 , swung a knife at him , nicking two of his fingers .
Shepherd told jurors he held her by the neck with one hand and tried to get the knife out of her hand with another as the two struggled .
He said he " snapped " and strangled Stewart , then went to a hardware store to buy a jigsaw to cut up her body .
Prosecutor Kebharu Smith said Shepherd 's testimony showed jurors that he was a " monster . "
Chip Lewis , Shepherd 's attorney , said he expected Shepherd to appeal the conviction .
Lewis ' strategy , to compartmentalize what happened to Stewart 's body after she had been killed , from the actual strangulation , was " almost impossible , given the decisions Shepherd made after Miss Stewart died . "
During the guilt / innocence phase of the trial , Lewis argued that there was n't enough evidence to convict Shepherd .
At the punishment stage , Lewis argued that Shepherd was in the grip of " sudden passion , " a legal doctrine that would have capped Shepherd 's sentence at 20 years .
The jury disagreed .
Prosecutor Marie Primm said she was satisfied with the verdict and noted that 99 years and a life sentence for murder are essentially the same .
With either , Shepherd is eligible for parole in 30 years .

On September 4 and 5 , at least 4,000 anti-Scientology videos were removed from the video sharing website , YouTube .
The videos removed were done so by a single Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) notice by an alleged ' rights group ' called the American Rights Counsel LLC , which Wikinews has confirmed does not exist beyond the scope of those requests .
In an exclusive interview with Wikinews the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) acknowledged that they " do n't know anything about " the Counsel and that any attempt to intentionally commit fraud by filing false DMCA requests , could lead to criminal charges .
" We do n't know anything about this group .
However , if these DMCA notices were sent improperly , there could be legal remedies .
The particulars would depend on the particulars of the situation , " Rebecca Jeschke , a spokeswoman for the EFF , told Wikinews .
The EFF first broke the story regarding the requests .
YouTube received the notice all at once , in a single request .
When Wikinews asked the EFF if they knew the names or links to the material in question , they stated that they do not know the names and that they have not seen the notice filed with YouTube .
According to Jeschk , the " EFF fights abuse of the DMCA .
... " but did not state where the EFF heard about the request .
" We have not seen the notices , merely heard about them [ and ] we do n't know enough to know if the DMCA has been abused here .
However , only copyright holders can issue DMCA takedowns , " Jeschke said .
The EFF is investigating the incident , and it is not yet known who or what was behind the DMCA request .
Some have speculated that the Counsel is a front for Scientology operated by a Dr. Oliver Schaper .
In an exclusive interview with Wikinews , Schaper denied any involvement with the DMCA requests and also denied having any knowledge whatsoever of the Counsel .
" As many other people , and even members of the Church of Scientology received information about a company that removed anti-Scientology content from YouTube , shit hit the fan and members of Anonymous went on a full attack on me .
I still have to this date no information about the American Rights Counsel and I have no connection , knowledge or involvement in this company which I have been informed of does not even exists , " Schaper said .
Producer of XenuTV Mark Bunker defends Schaper and does not believe he is responsible .
Bunker also believes that the Counsel is a fraud and called the DMCA requests a crime .
" I next did a Google search for American Rights Counsel LLC which brought up absolutely no results so clearly this was fraud from the beginning .
I had never heard of Schaper before he was accused of this .
I do n't know anything about him other than he contacted me and said he was not involved .
I do n't know who was responsible .
4000 deletions in a matter of hours is a pretty major feat .
It would be worth a subpoena to find out who committed this crime , " Bunker said .
Currently the EFF does not represent any of the users or groups who were affected by the mass take - down .

In science fiction , characters often swap bodies to achieve immortality , pose as someone else , or walk a mile in a loved one 's shoes .
Now neuroscientists at the Karolinska Institute have found a way to convince subjects that they 've swapped bodies with another person .
Men become women , humans become mannequins , and the participants are eager to try it again .
The research team at the Karolinksa Institute presented their findings today at the annual meeting at the Society for Neuroscience .
They provided male and female volunteers with sensory input to convince them that they had switched bodies with another person or a mannequin :
Volunteers experienced the body - swap illusion by receiving simultaneous visual and motor input from another 's body .
In one experiment , each participant stood across from a male mannequin , and in another experiment volunteers faced a female experimenter .
A headset covering participants ' eyes displayed a three - dimensional view of the other 's visual perspective , transmitted from a small video camera positioned on the mannequin 's or the woman 's head .
In the mannequin situation , an experimenter simultaneously touched the participant 's belly and the mannequin 's belly with separate probes .
So the volunteer felt a poking in the abdomen but saw the poking happen as if he or she were the mannequin .
In the real - person situation , participant and experimenter shook hands .
Thus , while volunteers felt the sensation of hand shaking , it appeared to them that they were shaking their own hand .
After 10 to 12 seconds of abdominal touch or hand - shaking , male and female participants spontaneously had the experience of looking out from the body of the male mannequin or the female experimenter .
They literally felt that they were in the mannequin 's body getting poked or had embodied the female experimenter and were shaking their own hands .

Neither male nor female participants had any trouble convincing themselves that they had entered the body of the male mannequin .
Similarly , when male volunteers were given sensory input from the female experimenter , they readily believed that they had swapped bodies with her .
And as surreal as the experience was , presenter Valeria Petkova reported that the subjects were ready for another go :
" Our subjects experienced this illusion as being exciting and strange , and often said that they wanted to come back and try it again . "

NComputing : The Energy - Efficient $ 70 PC
November 3rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Imagine a PC unit that costs only $ 70 and uses as little as 1 watt of power .
Sound too good to be true ?
Not anymore , thanks to the innovation of a California - based company called NComputing .
The company creates access devices that have no CPU , memory , or moving parts .
Instead , the devices connect to a central shared computer that uses NComputing ’s virtualization software to share its excess processing power .
According to NComputing ’s Chairman and CEO Stephen Dukker , 30 users can share a single $ 500 PC and still run videos , the Internet , and a host of other programs .
And since the access devices do n’t have any moving parts , they use 95 to 99 % less energy than a traditional PC — in most cases , just 1 to 4 watts per user .
That same lack of moving parts means the devices have a service life of 10 years or longer .
NComputing ’s solution has been quick to catch on — in only 20 months , the company has sold over 1 million units .
Not surprisingly , many of the devices have been sold to developing countries like Macedonia , India , and Bangladesh .
So will you use an NComputing device in your home anytime soon ?
Probably not , but do n’t be surprised if they pop up in schools and offices around the world — after all , almost any organization would jump at the chance to save thousands of dollars while looking environmentally responsible .

Airports almost empty day before Thanksgiving BAY AREA
The economic meltdown appears to be taking its toll on traveling for the holidays

The dreaded Day before Thanksgiving was not so dreadful after all .
Bay Area airports were eerily empty for much of what traditionally has been among the busiest travel days of the year .
Traditions appeared to die a swifter death this year than many a turkey .
Travel costs money , something a lot of people do n't have right now .
" There 's nobody here , " said Deborah Vainieri , who was waiting at San Francisco International Airport with her husband , Humberto , for a flight to Portland .
In a plot to beat the crowds , the Vainieris had arrived at the airport four hours early .
They walked right up to the check - in machine and were done in less than a minute .
Then , at 1:02 p.m. , they walked to the main Terminal 3 security line and found themselves all alone .
There was nobody in line ahead of them , not a single person .
" Now what do we do ? " said Humberto .
" We have four hours to kill . "
" We will have a long , leisurely lunch , " said Deborah .
" Then we 'll have coffee .
Then we 'll talk for a while .
After that , we 'll think of something . "
Baltimore - bound passenger Jason Moran said he had three hours to sit around catching up on his business e-mail on his laptop computer .
" I 'm shocked it 's not more crowded , " he said .
" The security line is nonexistent .
Where is everybody ? "
Business picked up as the afternoon wore on but , even so , most airport regulars said the building seemed emptier than Carlsbad Caverns .
" This is eerie , " said guitarist Craig Ventresco , an airport artist - in - residence who was flat - picking " Ain't She Sweet " for a crowd of one person on a landing near the door to the parking lot .
" If this is a sign of the times , it 's frightening . "
Ventresco , whose fingers were flying faster than most planes , said the plummeting economy was making ordinary people as broke as musicians .
" That 's not good , " he added , with a grim smile .
In the airport information booth , volunteer Doris Homer said people apparently were deciding to stay home this year .
In general , deciding to stay home tends to have a negative impact on the travel industry .
" See for yourself , " she said .
" Look around .
It 's nowhere near as busy .
People are out of work and saving their money . "
At the Oakland airport , the parking lot was nowhere near full and the terminals were pleasantly roomy .
" There are lines , but nothing like they 've been , " said an airport duty manager .
" You used to see the parking lot completely packed .
Not today . "
And at Mineta San Jose International Airport , spokesman David Vossbrink said it was " fairly quiet at times " with no reports of crowds , problems or delays .
The parking lot , he said , had " plenty of room . "
As at many airports , the airlines have cut flights at San Jose International , which has led to less crowding in the terminals .
It was the same story at airports across the country .
In Miami , San Francisco resident Sharon McKellar called the international airport there " shockingly quiet " after flying in to visit family .
In Boston , passenger Alicia Kelly said Wednesday was the lightest Thanksgiving travel day she 'd ever seen .
" We have waited in no lines so far , " she said .
There were no significant flight delays at any major U.S. airport , according to a Federal Aviation Administration Web site .
In San Francisco , the new airport industry of selling shorter lines to the highest bidder seemed to be falling flat .
One such system , the Fly Clear security line , enables anyone with a $ 199 membership card to bypass the ordinary screening line and zip to the front .
But since there was n't an ordinary line , it was tough to sell new membership cards .
" When there 's a line , this is a great deal for business travelers , " Tony Wightman said .
" And when the economy comes back , the long lines will come back , too . "
eck ! doom and gloom , funny how the government tells us we should
better manage our financial well being + made it harder for regular
joes now to file bankrupty and yet here they are bailing out these big
greedy corporate companies that were peddling sub - prime loans and doing
risky financial dealings , Seriously the government need to start
practicing what they 're preaching .
Costing us 10 billion a month keeping our military in operation on
the whole Irag shennagians , and government fleecing is still very much
alive with them paying $ 30 - $ 50 bucks for a box of pencils that would
normally cost $ 5 dollars at your local store , and the most pathetic
thing is seeing our own GOVERNMENT borrowing money from other
countries / Allies so they can pay their bills here in the states .
I say a big Government Shake - Down is in order , get rid of everyone
in there and start over with a new way operating seriously , before we
become a Third - World country and CHINA ends up being the new
super - power overall ..
Tore S. had it made .
He landed an enviable position that many of his fellow students had been gunning for – an evening / night shift as a Unix admin and general support for a large company that let him work from home .
And you know what that means : equal time given to work and dancing around in your PJ's Risky Business - style .
He could sleep and get paid for it , so long as he kept his cell phone on and would wake up and answer if / when it rang .
Then he'd have to VPN into the network , do his thing , and then carefully weigh the decision to have another one - man dance party or go back to sleep .
( Sleep usually won . )
One fine Saturday morning around 11:00 , Tore was sound asleep , visions of sugarplums dancing in his head – only to have his wonderful dream violently interrupted by the screech of his cell phone .
Tore squinted , rubbed his eyes , and read the caller ID .
Damn , it was work .
He quickly practiced saying " hello " without sounding tired , and then answered .
" Hel - "
" THE LOTUS NOTES SERVER IS UNREACHABLE . "
Ivan ,
Tore 's boss 's boss 's boss , was furious .
Tore was used to his attitude and had learned not to take it personally .
" So you want me - "
" FOLLOW THE SUPPORT PROCEDURE . "
* click *
Tore sighed , dragged himself to his computer , and looked up the standard operating procedure .
The Lotus Notes server was outside of Tore 's authority , so this was going to be easy .
" Call internal support , " the document read .
Tore dialed the number , reported the problem , they assured him that they would contact the responsible admin , and Tore moved on to his next task : procuring a bowl of cereal and watching some TV .
Tore was impressed by how quickly he escaped Constable Cornpuff 's maze , decrypted Mr. Marshmallow 's word scrambles , and figured out all of the words in Baron von Blueberry 's crossword puzzle .
Mysteries on the back of the cereal box solved , Tore paid more attention to whatever forgettable show was on the TV .
After a half hour or so , another call .
" Hey , Tore , this is Martin , " he began .
Martin was one of the system managers .
" The Lotus Notes server is down ; I need you to take care of it . "
" Oh , yeah , I know .
It 's already been reported , and currently being worked on . "
Since
Tore had no access to their internal ticket system , he was officially out of the loop .
" I 'll let you know as soon as I get an update . "
Martin sighed .
" OK , fine . "
* click *
Tore was a diligent guy , though , and figured he'd better call internal IT just to check up .
" We 've escalated it to the responsible admin , " they reported .
Uh oh , Tore thought , usually this is just a server reboot .
This must be a serious issue if it 's taking this long ...
Right after getting off that call , another came in .
" TORE . "
Ivan was clearly still upset , and was inadvertently giving Tore 's cell phone speaker a stress test with his yelling .
" THE LOTUS SERVER IS STILL OFFLINE . "
" Right .
I 've reported it to internal IT , talked to Martin , and just got off the phone with internal IT again .
They 've escalated it to the appropriate person .
I 've done everything in my power . "
Ivan demanded that he call internal IT .
Though it had been less than two minutes since he'd talked to them , he was n't going to agitate Ivan any further .
Internal IT put
Tore on hold while they called the tech for an estimate .
As Tore listened to the Michael Bolton hold music , he noticed that Martin was calling on the other line .
He quickly switched over .
" Hey Tore , do you have a status update on the Lotus Notes situation ?
What 's the ETA ? "
Tore responded , " No news just yet , but I 'll let you know as soon as learn more . "
Satisfied , Martin hung up .
Tore switched back over to internal IT .
A minute later , the IT support guy said that someone was working on it , but that could n't give a solid estimate .
Tore called Ivan with the update , and got back to his TV show .
Again the phone rang .
Again , it was Ivan .
After another call to internal IT and a status report , and close to an hour of the server being down , Ivan was about ready to explode .
" GIVE ME THE NUMBER FOR INTERNAL IT .
I'LL SETTLE THIS MYSELF , " he barked .
Tore could n't help but feel bad about the verbal beat - down that internal IT was about to receive .
Another five minutes passed , before Tore 's next phone call .
" Tore . "
It was Ivan , but he was n't speaking in all caps , his rage having melted away .
" The problem 's fixed .
What was the name of the system manager you talked to ? "
" Martin . "
" YEAH .
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT . "
Uh oh .
His rage is back .
" Uh ... is there a problem ? "
Ivan went on to explain , with varying rage levels , that Martin had been the responsible admin for the Lotus Notes server all along .
Martin had just decided to be lazy that morning , and that he was going to pass the buck to Tore .
The circle went thusly : Tore called internal IT , internal IT called Martin , Martin called Tore .
And occasionally Ivan would jump in just to keep things interesting .
Martin did n't realize that Tore did n't have any control of the server , despite the fact that Martin was the one who'd set up the security .
All Martin had to do was a server reboot , but apparently that was too much to ask .
For over an hour , the four circled the solution and grew more and more frustrated with one another .
And as a result of this mess , Ivan fired Martin for this and other similar incidents .
Tore 's job was eventually replaced by an Indian service desk , where no doubt their poor staff are getting yelled at by Ivan , calling internal IT ...
Edward L. Glaeser is an economist at Harvard .
Rarely , if ever , has an economics Nobel laureate been as widely known before receiving the prize as Paul Krugman .
His New York
Times columns have been read by millions ; he has argued economic policy eloquently in a large number of popular books .
Yet these pursuits had little to do with the decision of the Nobel committee .
They gave this prize to honor a truly seminal figure in economic trade and geography .
Mr. Krugman ’s fame as a public intellectual should not lead anyone to think that they understand his contributions to economic research just because they regularly read his columns .
The Nobel Prize citation highlights two distinct but connected contributions : Mr. Krugman ’s development of the “ new trade theory ” and his work on the “ new economic geography . ”
International trade has a long history in economics , and for the bulk of the field ’s history , patterns of trade have been explained by factor endowments and comparative advantage .
Why does England export wool and Portugal export wine ?
The cold winters of Yorkshire produce really fluffy sheep and the banks of the Douro produce splendid grapes .
Yet comparative advantage does little to explain much of modern international trade , especially not trade within industries .
Mr. Krugman published two seminal papers in 1979 and 1980 that made sense of the fact that Toyota sells cars in Germany and Mercedes - Benz sells cars in Japan .
Mr. Krugman started with a variant of Edward Chamberlain ’s model of monopolistic competition .
In this model , every firm sells a slightly different good — an Infiniti is not exactly the same thing as a BMW .
There are fixed costs of production , which means that producers get more efficient as they sell more .
Finally , consumers like variety , so that even if they live in the Land of the Rising Sun , with its abundant well - made cars , they still occasionally want something a little more Teutonic .
These ingredients came together and provided a framework than can match the world ’s trade patterns better than the 19th - century framework of David Ricardo , or the mid-20th - century models of Eli Heckscher , Bertil Ohlin and Paul Samuelson .
The fact that two out of three of those 20th - century giants are themselves Swedes should remind us of how seriously the Swedes take their trade theory , and what a big deal it is for them to admit Mr. Krugman to the pantheon .
Mr. Krugman ’s trade models became the standard in the economics profession both because they fit the world a bit better and because they were masterpieces of mathematical modeling .
His models ’ combination of realism , elegance and tractability meant that they could provide the underpinnings for thousands of subsequent papers on trade , economic growth , political economy and especially economic geography .
Mr. Krugman ’s 1991 Journal of Political Economy paper , “ Increasing Returns and Economic Geography , ” is the first article that provides a clear , internally consistent mathematically rigorous framework for thinking simultaneously about trade and the location of people and firms across space .
It is one of only two models that I insist that Harvard ’s Ph.D. students in urban economics be able to regurgitate , equation by equation .
The model begins with the same basic elements as the new trade theory : monopolistic competition , scale economics , love of variety .
To these elements Mr. Krugman adds free migration of workers across space and industries .
Because workers are able to move , real wages equalize across space .
People in New York City may be paid more , but they give some of that back in the form of higher housing prices .
The paper provides economists with a clear framework that can make sense of where we all live .
Firms and workers are pulled toward the same location to reduce transportation costs of shipping goods .
For example , the garment industry located in New York City , in part because of the vast trade in textiles that was already moving through the city and because of the large number of customers already living in America ’s largest city .
Of course , we do n’t all live in the same city .
A good model of geography needs both a centripetal and a centrifugal force .
In Mr. Krugman ’s model , populations are pulled apart by the desire to be close to natural inputs , like land or coal mines .
Cyrus McCormick moved his reaper business from Virginia to Chicago to be closer to his rural customers in the Midwest .
Later models incorporated traffic congestion and other forces that limit the growth of a single large urban area .
Mr. Krugman ’s model proved to quite adaptable ; it has received thousands of citations .
In his public role , Paul Krugman is often a polarizing figure , loved by millions but also intensely disliked by his political opponents .
I still chuckle over an old New Yorker cartoon with one plutocrat saying to another that he gets some satisfaction from the fact that his vote will cancel out the vote of Paul Krugman .
Within the less divided world of the academy , Mr. Krugman ’s economic research has generated plenty of light , but far less heat .
His papers are universally acknowledged to be immense contributions that helped to create two distinct fields .
His Nobel Prize is extremely well deserved and not unexpected .
I , for one , had bet on him in Harvard ’s Nobel Prize winner pool .
Are Feds Out to Help Owners of Foreclosed Properties ?
Category Rss Feed - http://www.realestateproarticles.com/rss.php?rss=265
By : Leticia Carvalho
The US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Treasury Department are set to work hand in hand on a program that could help improve the national concern on foreclosed properties .
The said government agencies are reported to have been finding ways to alleviate widespread foreclosures in the country .
One of the initial plans is to utilize $ 50 billion of the overall budget to gather $ 500 - $ 600 billion government guarantees .
The government is eying to provide guarantee on mortgages that are lower than $ 3 million .
All the funds for the overall budget will come from the bailout package that has been passed recently .
The said guarantee scheme will require bank savings or five - year period loans that offer lower interest rates .
And since the government is giving out the guarantees , risks in the mortgages will no longer be the homeowner�s concern .
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair had discussed the said program in an international deposit insurer�s conference last October 29 .
Bair said that FDIC and the Treasury Department had developed a federal program that could help lots of borrowers avoid foreclosures .
She also said that such a framework is needed to have the chance of altering loans on a large scale basis .
Jeenifer Zuccarelli , spokeswoman of the Treasury Department , has denied reports that the program was scheduled for a release last October 30 .
Zuccareli said that the report was gravely inaccurate .
She also said that the office is still on the process of looking at several proposals on stopping the increase of foreclosed homes .
Lobbyists for the program also said that the details of the plan could still be subjected to changes .
Although the FDIC has taken the initial steps to improve the situation of possible foreclosure properties , the Treasury Department still has the upper hand .
According to Federal laws , the Treasury Department has the power to administer the terms of the banking bailout .
However , the said government office has yet to evaluate the program .
Leticia Carvalho has been educated in the finer points of the foreclosure market over 5 years .
A few weeks back I had the good fortune to be handed a dump of a mysql database stuffed to the gills with historical Proms data .
It 's got every Prom from 1895 to 2007 ( and ( you 'd hope ) 2008 at some point ) .
I 've started to wrap a Ruby on Rails app around it and the results can be seen here .
For now it 's pretty basic with lots of gaps left to fill but the intention is to link it to MusicBrainz / DBpedia and publish the results into the Linking Open Data cloud .
In the meantime I thought it might be interesting to develop the site in public so you can see all my mistakes in real time .
So I 'll be posting progress reports here and updating this post as things get added .
What 's happened so far
I wrapped a very basic rails app over the data just to peek inside and check the relationships .
The result was a simple domain model of people and works and events and etc .
The next step was to create a new rails app and begin to build the site one table at a time .
The beginnings of the schema are here .
What happens next
The next step is to continue on , one table at a time through parts and events and performance and etc to fill out the site .
And when that 's done the interesting work of linking to external data sources can begin .
At which point I 'll probably be buying drinks for colleagues old and new .
With the data published and linked I 'll hopefully manage to persuade boss type people to open it under a creative commons non-commercial licence .
Add some RDF and the Proms can join Later , Top of the Pops and John Peel on the LOD cloud .
Well that 's the plan .
A beta ( of a beta ( of a beta ... ) )
This is very much work in progress .
Eventually the data should make it's way into / music ( via the MusicBrainz next generation schema ) and the upcoming / events .
If we can match events to broadcasts some of it should also make it into / programmes .

FROM KURDISTAN TO K- STREET ….
Over on our home page today , Laura Rozen tells the story of Shlomi Michaels : former Israeli counterterrorism commando , owner of a coffee / chocolate shop franchise , lobbyist and contractor for Iraqi Kurds , and , it turns out , friend of intelligence service chiefs from Moscow to Tokyo to Washington DC .
It is definitely not set in the foreign affairs world that we normally see on TV :
This is a story of the other world , the one whose real power players never show up in the CNN headline crawl .
It ’s the story of a man with a habit of popping up , Zelig - like , at the nexus of foreign policy and the kinds of businesses that thrive in times of war — security contracting , infrastructure development and postwar reconstruction , influence and intelligence brokering .
It ’s also the story of how this entrepreneur and middleman , in the shadowy environment created by the 9/11 attacks and Washington ’s advance on Iraq , seized the opportunity to propel himself from small - time businessman into global player .
The trajectory of Shlomi Michaels is testament not only to one man ’s driven intensity , but also to the opportunities the war on terror has presented to those with the information , connections , and ambition to seize them .
The eternal search for WMD programs in Iraq makes an appearance too .
The whole story is here .
Now that is an awesome staircase !

Introduction
We have been developing a large project in ASP .
NET 3.5 along with Microsoft AJAX for the last few months and when we started testing in the test environment , we came across a large number of ScriptResource .
axd entries making the HTTP calls to download the JavaScript to make it available for the page .
Here we had about 80/90 lines keeping the HTTP handler busy , so in this case if we had 100 concurrent users , we would have had about 800/900 concurrent calls to HTTP .
In order to optimize the performance / scalability and reducing the HTTP calls , we found out a way to get those calls minimized and thought of sharing with the community who could have the same performance issue .
The Solution
The solution we present here combines multiple JavaScript file declarations in your HTML into a single declaration , meaning our 80/90 JavaScript file references are combined into 1 .
Script Profiler
There is a very cool utility contained in this project which gets you a list of all scripts being used on the page .
So , before running the project , just set enable Profiler to true and you will get the list of scripts on the page .
Those scripts must be placed under optimizerSection tag , so it will help ScriptManager to find the script and combine it .

Configuration
We have a file called ScriptCombinerSection.cs which loads the necessary configuration information from the web.config file and makes it available using a static class called OptimizerConfig .
public class OptimizerConfig { protected static Dictionary < string , /> _scripts ; protected static bool _enable ; protected static bool _enable Profiler ; protected static bool _enableScriptCompression ; protected static bool _enableHtmlCompression ; protected static bool _enableScriptMinification ; protected static bool _enableHtmlMinification ; static OptimizerConfig ( ) { _scripts = new Dictionary < string , />( ) ; OptimizerSection sec = null ; try { sec = ( OptimizerSection ) System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.
GetSection " optimizerSection " ) ; foreach ( ScriptElement i in sec.
Scripts ) { _scripts .
Add( i. Key , i ) ; } _enable = sec .
Enable ; _enable Profiler = sec.
EnableProfiler ; _enableScriptCompression = sec.EnableScriptCompression ; _enableHtmlCompression = sec.EnableHtmlCompression ; _enableScriptMinification = sec.EnableScriptMinification ; _enableHtmlMinification = sec.EnableHtmlMinification ; } catch { } } public static ScriptElement GetScriptByKey ( string key ) { ScriptElement objElement = null ; try { objElement = _scripts [ key ] ; } catch { } return objElement ; } public static ScriptElement GetScriptByResource ( string name , string assembly ) { ScriptElement objElement = null ; foreach ( KeyValuePair < string , /> element in _scripts ) { if ( element .

Value .
Path == path ) { objElement = element .
Value ; break ; } } return objElement ; } public static ScriptElement GetScriptByName ( string name ) { ScriptElement objElement = null ; foreach ( KeyValuePair < string , /> element in _scripts ) { if ( element .

Optimization Types
We can divide the overall performance optimization into five different pieces :
Script Combiner : Combines all scriptresource.axd calls into a single call .
Combines all scriptresource.axd calls into a single call .
Script Compressor : Compresses all client side scripts based on the browser capability including gzip / deflate .
Compresses all client side scripts based on the browser capability including gzip / deflate .
Script Minifier : Removes comments , indentations , and line breaks .
Removes comments , indentations , and line breaks .
HTML Compressor : Compress all HTML markup based on the browser capability including gzip / deflate .
Compress all HTML markup based on the browser capability including gzip / deflate .
HTML Minification : Writes complete HTML into a single line and minifies it at possible level ( under construction ) .
Script Combiner and Compressor
As mentioned earlier that the basic purpose of developing the script combiner was to minimize the HTTP calls and get the complete client side script in one shot .
In order to get it working , we will need to override the ScriptManager class and three of its methods .
One of the main methods which must be overridden is OnResolveScriptReference .
Whenever each script gets resolved , we get it here and replace it with the script information provided by the web.config .
If we enable script profile , the Render method writes the list of profiled scripts on the browser .
public class OptimizeScriptManager : ScriptManager { private const string HANDLER_PATH = " ~/ ClientScriptCombiner.aspx?keys= " ; private const string BLOCKED_HANDLER_PATH = HANDLER_PATH + " - 1 " ; private Dictionary < string , /> _scripts = new Dictionary < string , />( ) ; private List < ScriptReference > _profilerScripts = null ; protected override void OnInit( EventArgs e ) { base .

Once all scripts have been resolved , it will build the URL with all keys which are required by the page :
< script src = " ClientScriptCombiner.aspx?keys= 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.21.22.23.24 . " type = " text / javascript " > < / script >
Here keys parameter in query string represents the script numbers separated by dot (. ) .
These script numbers are specified in web.config , so while resolving the script , it picks the number against the matching string and builds the URL .
Once the URL has been built and written to the browser , the handler will get called and pick each number to extract the client script from the assemblies or files .
The StringBuilder is used to collect the stream of scripts and write it on the browser .
When the handler gets called and finishes combining all scripts , it determines the capability of the browser , either it supports the compression or not .
If it does , e.g. gzip , it will create the instance of the GZipStream class and compress the scripts , otherwise it writes as is .

Script Minifier
We are using jsmin i.e. courtesy of Douglas Crockford .
HTML Compressor , HTML Minifier
In order to compress and minify the HTML markups , we have come up with the new streaming class called HtmlCompress Stream inheriting from Stream .
public class HtmlCompressStream : Stream { public enum CompressionType { None = 0 , GZip = 1 , Deflate = 2 } ; private Stream _stream ; public HtmlCompressStream ( Stream stream , CompressionMode mode , CompressionType type ) { switch ( type ) { case CompressionType .
GZip : _stream = new GZipStream ( stream , mode ) ; break ; case CompressionType.Deflate : _stream = new DeflateStream ( stream , mode ) ; break ; default : _stream = new StreamWriter ( stream ) .
BaseStream ; break ; } } public Stream BaseStream { get { return _stream ; } } public override bool CanRead { get { return _stream .
CanRead ; } } public override bool CanSeek { get { return _stream .
CanSeek ; } } public override bool CanWrite { get { return _stream .
CanWrite ; } } public override long Length { get { return _stream .
Length ; } } public override long Position { get { return _stream .
Position ; } set { _stream .
Position = value ; } } public override IAsyncResult BeginRead ( byte [ ] array , int offset , int count , AsyncCallback asyncCallback , object asyncState ) { return _stream .
BeginRead ( array , offset , count , asyncCallback , asyncState ) ; } public override IAsyncResult BeginWrite ( byte [ ] array , int offset , int count , AsyncCallback asyncCallback , object asyncState ) { return _stream .
BeginWrite ( array , offset , count , asyncCallback , asyncCallback ) ; } protected override void Dispose ( bool disposing ) { _stream .
Dispose ( ) ; } public override int EndRead ( IAsyncResult asyncResult ) { return _stream .
EndRead( asyncResult ) ; } public override void EndWrite ( IAsyncResult asyncResult ) { _stream .
EndWrite( asyncResult ) ; } public override void Flush ( ) { _stream .
Flush ( ) ; } public override int Read ( byte [ ] array , int offset , int count ) { return _stream .
Read( array , offset , count ) ; } public override long Seek ( long offset , SeekOrigin origin ) { return _stream .
Seek ( offset , origin ) ; } public override void SetLength ( long value ) { _stream .
SetLength ( value ) ; } public override void Write ( byte [ ] array , int offset , int count ) { if ( OptimizerConfig.EnableHtmlMinification ) { _stream .
Write ( array , offset , count ) ; } else { _stream .
Write ( array , offset , count ) ; } } }
Based on the browser ’s capability , we create the compress stream object and let the writer write the stuff .
Writing this class has a couple of advantages , one is to enable compression and the second is to minify HTML markup at the time of writing .
So , when the writer wants to emit stream on the browser , it invokes the Write method which writes the stream of bytes to the browser .
We assign the instance of this class to the Response .
Filter property at the time of page ’s request , i.e. written in the Application_BeginRequest event of Global.asax .
public class Global : System .
Web.HttpApplication { protected void Application_BeginRequest ( object sender , EventArgs e ) { HttpRequest request = this .
Request ; HttpResponse response = this .
Response ; if ( request.RawUrl.IndexOf ( " .aspx " ) > - 1 && string .IsNullOrEmpty ( request .
Params [ " keys " ] ) ) { if ( OptimizerConfig.EnableHtmlCompression && !( request .Browser .IsBrowser ( " IE " ) && request .
Browser.MajorVersion < = 6 ) ) { string acceptEncoding = request .
Headers [ " Accept - Encoding " ] ; if ( ! string.IsNullOrEmpty(acceptEncoding ) ) { acceptEncoding = acceptEncoding .ToLower ( CultureInfo.InvariantCulture ) ; if ( acceptEncoding .
Contains ( " gzip " ) ) { new GZipStream ( response .
Filter , CompressionMode .Compress ) ; response .
Filter = new HtmlCompressStream( response .
Filter , CompressionMode .Compress , HtmlCompressStream.CompressionType.GZip ) ; response .
AddHeader ( " Content - encoding " , " gzip " ) ; } else if ( acceptEncoding .
Contains ( " deflate " ) ) { response .
Filter = new HtmlCompressStream( response .
Filter , CompressionMode .Compress , HtmlCompressStream.CompressionType.Deflate ) ; response .
AddHeader ( " Content - encoding " , " deflate " ) ; } } } else { response .
Filter = new HtmlCompressStream( response .
Filter , CompressionMode .Compress , HtmlCompressStream.CompressionType.None ) ; } } } }
Note :
The HTML minification is still under construction and would be done very soon .
We ’re looking forward to having a great HTML minifier .
Using the Sample Project
There are some Ajax client controls and *.js files created to run and test the sample .
You will need to rebuild the project and then access default .aspx .
If you want to test it with AjaxControlToolkit , download the latest version of control toolkit and reference it in the project .
Drag and drop some controls from the Toolbox , enable the profiler , and run the project .
It will write the list of scripts on the page ; just copy those scripts and put it in the web.config file under optimizerSection .
That ’s all we need to do to run the project .
Useful Results
BEFORE ( 1.55 seconds for 238kb )
AFTER ( 62 milliseconds for 75 kb )
Conclusion
We always find some kind of trade - off between processing and network latency , this article is entirely focusing on network latency ; not on the processing cost because it has been assumed that this implementation is done on high end processing servers .
Finally , if you 're using ASP .
NET with AJAX client controls , make sure your website is providing best performance at all levels of scalability .
Jason Liebrecht used to write about his motorcycle adventures on his blog .
But since early this month , the 36 - year - old San Diego computer software engineer ’s daily musings have been about a less thrilling new experience : unemployment .
“ Do I find a job , or do I head to Central and South America on the motorcycle ? ” he wrote on Day 4 .
By Day 7 , he had become more realistic : “ So far in the last week I ’ve made $ 1,245 off of EBay sales .
Mostly stuff I was n’t using , or do n’t need much .
Nice way to clean the house up ! ”
After selling some stock and applying for unemployment , Liebrecht figures he can pay his $ 2,300 - a- month mortgage and other bills for just two months .
When his company health insurance runs out in a few weeks , he ’ll go uncovered because he ca n’t afford the premiums .
“ You have to just hope you land on your feet , ” Liebrecht said in an interview .

People everywhere are coping with rising credit card balances , falling home values and layoffs .
But such worries are particularly jarring for a younger slice of the workforce that has known little but long - term financial prosperity and optimism .
After all , a large share of today ’s 20 - and 30 - somethings -- a nearly 80 - million strong cohort -- were in college or high school ( and some in grade school ) the last time the country experienced a severe financial jolt .
Some can barely remember the mild recession of 2001 , which was followed by an extraordinary boom that coincided with their entry into the workforce .
Raised amid a long stretch of financial bounty and weaned on video games , cellphones , iPods and weekends at the mall , many Generation X and Y members have barely seen a time when they could n’t spend freely on the latest styles and gadgets .
In these tighter times , they ’re watching their spending and they ’re borrowing money from family members for the first time .
To economize , some are moving in with friends and -- the horror -- even Mom and Dad .
Advertisement
And after years of being able to boast about promotions and climbing income , a growing number find themselves having to admit that they are out of a job .
In the last year , the unemployment rate for 25 - to 34 - year - olds rose from 4.3 % to 5.4 % -- nearly twice the increase for age groups above them .
“ This generation as a whole has not experienced any substantial kind of financial difficulty , ” said Leslie Winefield , director of the Portland , Maine - based Institute for Financial Literacy .
“ It could be a defining moment for them . ”
Jean Twenge , a San Diego State psychology professor and author of “ Generation Me : Why Today ’s Young Americans Are More Confident , Assertive , Entitled -- and More Miserable Than Ever Before , ” said many are so far in debt that even a minor recession could be extremely challenging .
“ Now they have to deal with losing their jobs , keeping their house and $ 4 gas , ” Twenge said .

Paradoxically , she said research shows that younger people have grown up in a time of great wealth but have more anxiety about their economic future than past generations .
“ They seem to be looking into the future and understanding they may not have it as easy as their parents , ” she said .
Years of low unemployment may have masked the precarious finances of many young workers .
A study released last year by the Brookings Institution and the Pew Charitable Trust found that the median income of men in their 30s fell 12 % from 1974 to 2004 when adjusted for inflation .

Charged up
Credit card debt for the average 25 - to 34 - year - old rose 52 % , from $ 2,873 to $ 4,357 , between 1989 and 2004 , when adjusted for inflation , according to the research institute .
The age group also experienced the largest increase in those making late payments during that period , up from 3 % of all cardholders to 12 % .
Nearly a quarter of all bankruptcies in 2006 were filed by people ages 25 to 34 , up 40 % in the last decade .
But the age group makes up only 14 % of the adult population .
The state of the economy has passed the Iraq war as the top concern for voters between ages 18 and 29 , according to a poll this month by CBS News and MTV , raising the possibility that economic anxiety among younger workers could weigh heavily on the upcoming presidential election .

Kelly McAuliffe of Los Angeles can’t believe how quickly she has gone from rushing to back - to - back business meetings to passing her days watching the Game Show Network and reruns of “ Law & Order . ”
Since getting laid off from an online advertising company in February , the 34 - year - old former sales director has stopped meeting friends for drinks and has pared her grocery list ( less Whole Foods , more sales at Ralphs ) .
She ’s scaling back her cellphone calls and where she drives because of rising gas prices .
To get by , she recently did the unthinkable :
She borrowed money from her mother .
“ It ’s hard to say it , but it ’s demeaning , ” said McAuliffe , who has had a handful of job interviews in the last month .
“ You work so long to make your parents proud , and this is the last thing you expect to be doing at my age . ”

Ray of hope
Few experts predict that younger workers face a dire long - term financial future , and not everyone is suffering .
Some say younger workers may weather the uncertainty of economic downturns well because they ’re accustomed to changing jobs frequently .
The housing crisis might even open up opportunities .
“ The bright spot is that younger people who did n’t buy a house in the last few years and who have some cash can get into the housing and stock markets ” for the first time in years , said Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff .
Advertisement
Although there are few reliable statistics on how many among younger home buyers are dealing with foreclosure , some economists believe they are bearing the brunt of the housing downturn .
The explosion of sub - prime loans coincided with many first - time buyers with poorer credit histories entering the market .
Edward Wolff , an economist at New York University who studies generational wealth differences , worries that many younger people could accumulate even more debt in this downturn on top of outsize college loans , credit card balances and mortgage payments .
“ It ’s not a doomsday scenario , ” Wolff said .
But younger people “ are stretched thin and do n’t have as much to fall back on . ”
Time running out

Dulce Maya is worried that she wo n’t be able to squeeze by much longer .
The 27 - year - old restaurant manager bought a three - bedroom , two - bath house in Fontana for $ 350,000 two years ago with a $ 5,000 down payment and an adjustable - rate mortgage .
This year , her $ 2,300 monthly payment will probably rise to $ 3,300 and her work hours were recently cut because business is slow .
Maya has asked her bank to lower her payments so she can keep her house , which is now valued at $ 200,000 , and expects to hear back in the next few weeks .
If it does n’t agree , she says , she may have no choice but to hand the bank the keys .
“ I do n’t know what happens next , ” Maya said .
“ I may try and rent an apartment for around what I ’m paying , but rents are going up too . ”

Per capita consumption only two - thirds of minimum needed
An Israeli human rights organization says the West Bank is facing a severe water crisis in the coming months .
The B�Tselem human rights group issued a report July 1 linking the chronic shortage to Israeli policies .
A drought , the most serious in the past decade , is aggravating the ever - present water shortage in the West Bank , further exacerbating the already intolerable living conditions for the Palestinians .
According to the World Health Organization , the minimal amount of water per capita needed daily for household and urban needs is 100 liters , or just over 26 U.S. gallons .
Average per capita consumption throughout the West Bank is 66 liters , or just over 17 gallons �two - thirds of the minimal amount specified by the WHO .
In the northern West Bank , consumption has dropped even more , to only one - third of the designated minimum .
In comparison , average daily water consumption per capita in Israeli cities is 235 liters , or 62 gallons .
That amount is 3.5 times that consumed by Palestinians in the West Bank .
A total of 227,500 Palestinians in hundreds of towns and villages in the West Bank are not connected to a water network at all .
Another 190,000 Palestinians live in villages that are only partially connected to a water network .
Even in Palestinian towns and villages that have a water network , the water supply is irregular and unreliable most of the year .
Water is supplied intermittently , being available only for some hours and sometimes on a rotating basis .
In distant areas , the water supply may be disconnected for days or even weeks at a time .
The B�Tselem report relates the testimony of Aminah Jabarin , a Palestinian mother of nine who lives in the West Bank town of Tuqu : " I fall asleep completely exhausted from effort and worry .
It hurts me to see my boys hauling bottles long distances to fill them up , especially on hot days .
Worrying about water has become a nightmare , so much so that if you ask me what I want most , I would say water in my house all the time . "
As an occupying force , Israel is required under international humanitarian law to ensure public order and safety in the occupied territory , without discrimination .
In addition , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , to which Israel is a signatory , ensures access to clean drinking water without discrimination .
In flagrant violation of these laws , Israel holds complete control of the water sources shared by Israel and the Palestinians , primarily the Mountain Aquifer , and prohibits by army order any Palestinian drilling of wells without a permit .
Israel allocates to Palestinians only 20 percent of the water from the Mountain Aquifer , and prevents the development of additional water sources to enable greater water supply for Palestinians in the West Bank .
More importantly , however , the water shortages lay bare the colonial character of Israel .
The Palestinian people have no sovereignty over a resource as basic as water in their own land .
Access to this life - sustaining necessity is subject to the whims of the Israeli colonial state .
In that context , unapologetic disregard for international law is just one of the many perks accorded to an occupying force that has the full backing of U.S. imperialism .
A kinder water policy from Israel would do nothing to change what is , in essence , a colonial relationship .
Palestinians must be given full control of their land , natural resources and infrastructure .
The racist character of Israel will begin to erode only when all Israeli aggression against the West Bank and Gaza is ended and the Palestinian people secure the right to return throughout all of historic Palestine .

Why did the current financial crisis happen ?
I do n't think a fully comprehensive answer could fit into a few paragraphs , but I can give some brief thoughts .
As of this morning , otherwise sound companies are encountering financial difficulties .
If we think of the current financial crisis as being a simmering pot on an oven , the water just boiled over and knocked the cover off .
Forces that were either hidden or contained were let loose , and this had a cascading effect .
Credit markets dried up further in response to the fall of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mae , and Lehman Brothers .
Businesses that otherwise were solid ran into cash flow problems .
Essentially , we saw a bank run and lenders pull back their lines of credit and new credit could not be found .
This morning we have news that a neo -Resolution Trust Corporation will be formed to handle the tranches of bad debt currently out in the market .
The market rebounded because such a move increases the certainty that at least part of the bad debt will be repaid .
But still , companies like Washington Mutual and Morgan Stanley are whispered about in the hallways .
Will they be bought ?
Will they declare bankruptcy ?
Just what else is out there ?
And sadly , the answer is that we really do n't know , because we do n't have a handle on just who owns what debt in what financial instrument .
We do n't know the final impact of the government 's foray in this financial maelstrom .
What I 'd venture to say is that the output and growth of our future economy will be slowed .
If we were to have 3 % GDP growth before , maybe it 's 2 % now .
We know that compounding matters , so losing even fractions of a percentage of GDP growth means that , over time , we 're going to lose out on a lot of wealth creation .
That impacts our children .
With the new Resolution Trust Company , our national debt will increase .
That impacts our children .
Whatever presidential candidate you support , their budget plan just went the way of the dodo .
This crisis further serves as an illustration that our actions have tangible effects on others .
Our actions affect others .
The risky behavior of many investment firms which have led to the credit crisis sent 401K values tumbling , strained home mortgages , and reduced confidence worldwide of our financial system 's health .
There 's going to be a lot of congressional oversight hearings on these matters shortly , along with regulation .
We 're sure to hear “ Where 's the accountability ? ”
But do n't expect hearings and inquisitions to solve much .
We 're reacting to actions and events that started years ago .
Any regulation is likely to also be reactive .
But when this crisis does abate — and it will — we will have other problems looming .
We have in this country increasing healthcare costs , a growing national debt , and a retiring workforce .
While their impact will be felt 5 , 10 years from now , perhaps now's the time to proactively address these concerns , rather than reacting .
This is , I think , where the personal finance community here and throughout the web can have a large , positive impact .
Detroit
In Rahm Emanuel 's telling , the Democratic victories on Tuesday were a continuum of what began in the 2006 midterm elections , when his party won majorities in the House and the Senate for the first time in 12 years .
" After 2006 , I said it was George Bush and the desire for change , " the congressman from Chicago 's North Side tells me .
" And the same cocktail contributed to this turnout .
You had Barack Obama 's message of change and Bush and the Republicans ' record of incompetence . "

8. Ajax Inline Edit
AJAX , DOM , whatever you call it makes it possible to let people edit a piece of text inline without having to use a submit button .
A small piece of javascript reads al SPAN tags , checks if it has class = ” editText ” and a id= .
If that is true , it adds a onclick function .
That onclick function will create a textfield or input ( depending on the size of the editable text ) .
Someone has the ability to edit the field .
When the text field is blurred , it will read the contents , and starts a XMLHttpRequest and ‘ sends ’ the content + fieldname + any set vars to an update file .
That file will update your database , and reply with the newly set text and the textfield will dissapear again .
Demo can be found here .
Download Code here
The in - place “ text edit ” testing allows for Flickr - style AJAX - backed “ on - the - fly ” textfields .
The constructor takes three parameters .
The first is the element that should support in - place editing .
The second is the url to submit the changed value to .
The server should respond with the updated value ( the server might have post - processed it or validation might have prevented it from changing ) .
The third is a hash of options .
The server side component gets the new value as the parameter ‘ value ’ ( POST method ) , and should send the new value as the body of the response .
An AJAX ( or AHAH ) proof - of - concept page that allows the visitor to edit the very ( x ) HTML page they are viewing , without leaving the page .
Click the text to be edited and magically a textarea appears with buttons beneath to save or cancel the changes .
Changes are sent via AHAH to a PHP script which normally would be used to update a database ( MYSQL or flatfile ) .

Fail and You Hadoop is a library for writing distributed data processing programs using the MapReduce framework .
It 's got all the makings of a blogosphere hit : cluster computing , large datasets , parallelism , algorithms published by Google , and open source .
Every four days or so , a nerd will discover Hadoop , write a “ Basic MapReduce Tutorial with Hadoop ” tutorial on his blog with some trivial examples , and feel satisfied with himself for educating the world about a yet - undiscovered gem .
Comparatively , very few people actually use Hadoop in practice , and those who do do n't write about it .
Why ?
Because they 're adults who do n't care about getting on the front page of Digg .
Hadoop was birthed to the world by Doug Cutting , the man who gave us the Lucene search library and the Nutch web crawler .
It 's a little known fact that Cutting only sleeps three hours per night , and not because he is tired , but rather as an act of mercy for his keyboard .
Furthermore , Hadoop is n't open source because Doug wanted to help other developers solve distributed computing problems .
It 's open source because he thought you could learn a thing or two from his code .
Despite being a canon of Java engineering , Hadoop is actually pretty useful , if you 've got a problem it can solve .
Now , that 's a tricky caveat that is n't well understood by many contemporary programmers .
A lot of developers ( and this is most prevalent in the Web 2.0 world ) , walk balls - first into any given task , assuming that scalability is going to be issue number one .
If you 've got a big data processing problem that needs to scale , then Hadoop will probably help you out .
In that case , you can read any one of the over nine thousand regurgitations of the same word count tutorial on some nerd 's blog .
Otherwise , you can do like the web scalability Bible beaters and completely miss the point of Hadoop , contort your code into something that resembles MapReduce , and let those throbbing nuts of yours hang out in the breeze , because shit , you just built one scalable - ass system .
Sure , it runs several times slower than your old code used to , but it 's parallelized , and that 's really all that matters .
Put Me In , Coach
When it comes to open source , Hadoop is a good example of what separates the men from the boys .
Being a top - level Apache project , there 's significant backing behind it .
With corporate sponsorship , a software project can go far .
When I say “ corporate sponsorship ” , I 'm referring to companies that actually make money , which brings us to the comedic open source attempts of Web 2.0 .
Twitter , which is widely accepted as the drum major of the Web 2.0 failure parade , released an open source project called Starling in January of this year .
Starling is the Ruby - based messaging system that runs Twitter 's backend .
Yes ,
Twitter , the nonprofit web service known widely for its downtime , dropped its disaster - producing shitpile on the world .
Why ?
Maybe they thought more competent developers would fix their problems .
The more likely scenario is that they wanted to get a quickie beatoff from the fake tech media to make themselves look more important .
I am guessing this is why no code has been released for Starling since it was open sourced .
Oops .
Twitter decided they would be cute and trendy .
They wrote their code in Ruby : the official state language of the hipster - developer nation .
Doug Cutting , on the other hand , decided he would get shit done , and wrote Hadoop in Java .
Starling was hidden away in some corner and forgotten ( it 's hosted at RubyForge ... what the fuck is that ? ) .
Hadoop lives prominently at the Apache Software Foundation .
Starling is a re-hash of an existing Java Enterprise API called JMS that has several open source implementations .
Hadoop is an implementation of Google 's MapReduce , a system that publicly only existed on paper .
Hadoop has the added benefit of actually working .
Perhaps this is a feast of apples and oranges .
Starling is a messaging system , Hadoop is a distributed data processing system .
Do n't worry .
There 's plenty of failure to be had elsewhere in the open source world .
Let 's take , for example , a project called Starfish ) , which is a pure - Ruby implementation of MapReduce .
Eh , well that 's not entirely accurate .
Starfish is a MapReduce - inspired framework that 's simple enough for even Ruby developers to understand .
That means there 's no actual “ reduce ” phase in the MapReduce , and it works on MySQL database records .
In other words , this project is virtually useless in every way , aside from getting the author a quick beatoff from the blogosphere .
It 's a half - baked implementation of an algorithm from Google , it 's written in Ruby and it integrates with Rails .
That 's so warm and fuzzy it could turn Clint Eastwood gay .
But hey , taking the time to actually understand something is way harder that writing an open source Ruby implementation of it .
More Than Just Data Processing
Along with the data processing framework , Doug Cutting also included a fault tolerant , replicated , distributed file system with Hadoop just because fuck you .
Called HDFS , it is inspired by Google 's GFS , again something that only existed to the public in the form of an academic paper .
HDFS is designed to integrate perfectly with the MapReduce framework , but you can also use it on its own .
If you need to replicate large files across many machines , then HDFS has got what you need .
Why do n't you see distributed filesystems coming out of places like Twitter ?
Because that shit is hard .
It could also be that companies like Twitter are blissfully unaware of any data storage medium other than MySQL .
In either case , data processing gets you more pedantic nerd - cred than data storage .
Processing large amounts of data lets a nerd excuse himself for being a shut - in , because shit , he 's doing important work in there .
He 's got to command an army of machines , all working in unison .
That will show the football team who the real man is .
Sure beats talking to girls .
Projects like Hadoop are few and far between .
Everybody wants to work on an interesting problem like distributed data processing , but few people actually can .
It 's the disparity between “ want ” and “ can ” that brings us failures like Twitter .
Sometimes , your best just is n't good enough . ®

COLORADO SPRINGS , Colo . --
Concerned about possible demonstrations during the Beijing Olympics , the Chinese government produced a list of nine American athletes and one assistant coach it thought might cause problems during the games .
The U.S. State Department knew about China 's concerns and made " multiple representations " to the country 's government to reinforce the American belief in freedom of expression .
USA Today reported Thursday that it had obtained an internal U.S. Olympic Committee e-mail in which a Chinese official expressed concern that members of the U.S. team might stage some sort of demonstration .
USOC spokesman Darryl Seibel confirmed that the list was given to the federation during a meeting July 8 with Shu Xiao , minister counselor for cultural affairs at the Chinese Embassy in Washington , the e-mail said .
The athletes included softball players Jennie Finch , Jessica Mendoza , Natasha Watley , Amanda Freed , and softball assistant coach Karen Johns ; soccer player Abby Wambach ; cyclist Jonathan Page ; paralympic basketball player Jen Howitt ; paralympic wheelchair racer Cheri Blauwet ; and golfer Laura Goodwin .
Wambach was injured and did not compete in the Olympics .
Goodwin did not compete because golf is not an Olympic sport .
Page was not selected for USA Cycling 's Beijing - bound team .
He specializes in cyclocross , a combination of road and off - road racing that is not part of the Olympic program .
Shu was concerned that some of the athletes have been affiliated with Team Darfur , an international coalition of athletes committed to raising awareness about the human rights crisis in Sudan 's Darfur region , according to the email .
Asked about the list of athletes Thursday , the State Department issued a statement saying it had seen media reports about the list .
" During the run-up to the Olympics , we discussed with Chinese authorities their concerns about the potential for protest actions by Olympics athletes or others attending the Games , " the statement said .
" At the time we made multiple representations to Chinese authorities regarding the importance of respecting freedom of expression , and we continue to stand by these views . "
It referred other questions to the USOC .
Seibel told The Associated Press that the federation knew of the list but did not pass on the concerns to the athletes because it did n't want to burden them with what it felt was a non-issue .
" We did make clear to the embassy that our athletes would have the same right to free speech and free expression , consistent with what is set forth in the Olympic Charter , that they have enjoyed at previous Games , " Seibel said .
" We made certain those rights would in no way be infringed upon or compromised . "
International Olympic Committee spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said the IOC was not aware of the list .
" Any questions on the matter should be addressed to the Chinese authorities , " she said .
Sun Weide , who was one of the spokesmen for the Beijing Organizing Committee , told The AP that he had resigned his position and declined to comment .
Much of the committee has been dissolved more than two months after the Games .
Did anyone else actually lean to the front and back in time with the guy while watching this ?
My wife still makes fun of me for leaning while I play video games , I am just wondering if I am the only one that is dorky enough to do this while watching videos as well .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - African Americans with heart disease are as likely to suffer from depression as their white counterparts , but they are less likely to be on medication for it , a new study suggests .
The study of 864 adults with coronary heart disease found that 35 percent of African Americans and 27 percent of whites had symptoms of depression .
Yet black patients were less than half as likely to be on an antidepressant medication .
The findings are important , the researchers say , because depression in people with heart disease has been linked to a two - to four - fold higher risk of complications .
Studies have found that depressed heart disease patients have higher risks of a heart attack or stroke , and may die earlier than those without depression .
“ Undertreatment of depression is a serious clinical issue , ” Dr. James Blumenthal , one of researchers on the current study , said in a statement .
These latest findings suggest that black heart patients , in particular , need better diagnosis and treatment of depression , according to Blumenthal and his colleagues at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina .
The study included 727 white patients and 137 black patients seen at Duke for coronary heart disease .
All completed a standard questionnaire used to screen for depression .
Blumenthal ’s team found that depression was similarly common among black and white patients , and the severity of their symptoms was comparable as well .
However , while 21 of depressed white patients were on an antidepressant , only 12 percent of black patients were .
The difference was greatest among men ; 43 percent of moderately to severely depressed white men were taking an antidepressant , versus 22 percent of their black counterparts .
The researchers are not sure why the racial disparity exists .
They lacked information on the study patients ’ health insurance , so it ’s not possible to tell whether differences in coverage are a factor .
Nor do they know whether doctors were less likely to prescribe to black patients , or whether African Americans were less likely to want an antidepressant .
Blumenthal pointed out that therapies other than antidepressants may be helpful for heart disease patients ’ depression .
He is currently conducting a study comparing aerobic exercise with drugs in treating depression .
“ We clearly need to do a better job of recognizing and treating depression , especially in heart patients , ” Blumenthal said .
“ We need treatments that work , treatments that are acceptable to patients , and treatments that are actually incorporated into medical practice . ”

The Original Macintosh : 74 of 127 Stolen From Apple Author : Andy Hertzfeld Date : August 1983 Characters : Steve Jobs , Susan Kare , Steve Capps , Andy Hertzfeld , Steve Jasik Topics : Software Design Summary :
We put a hidden icon in the ROM the secret " Stolen From Apple " icon
In 1980 , a company called Franklin Computer produced a clone of the Apple II called the Franklin Ace , designed to run the same software .
They copied almost every detail of the Apple II , including all of its ROM based software and all the documentation , and sold it at a lower price than Apple .
We even found a place in the manual where they forgot to change " Apple " to " Ace " .
Apple was infuriated , and sued Franklin .
They eventually won , and forced Franklin to withdraw the Ace from the market .
Even though Apple won the case , it was pretty scary for a while , and it was n't clear until the end that the judge would rule in Apple 's favor - Franklin argued that they had a right to copy the Apple II ROMs , since it was just a " functional mechanism " necessary for software compatibility .
We anticipated that someone might try a similar trick with the Macintosh someday .
If they were clever enough ( which Franklin was n't ) , they could disguise the code ( say by systematically permuting some registers ) so it would n't look that similar at the binary level .
We thought that we better take some precautions .
Steve decided that if a company copied the Mac ROM into their computer , he would like to be able to do a demo during the trial , where he could type a few keystokes into an unmodified infringing machine , and have a large " Stolen From Apple " icon appear on its screen .
The routines and data to accomplish that would have to be incorporated into our ROM in a stealthy fashion , so the cloners would n't know how to find or remove it .
It was tricky enough to be a fun project .
Susan designed a nice " Stolen from Apple " icon , featuring prison bars .
Steve Capps had recently come up with a simple scheme for compressing ROM - based icons to save space , so we compressed the icon using his technique , which not only reduced the overhead but also made it much harder to detect the icon .
Finally , we wrote a tiny routine to decompress the icon , scale it up and display it on the screen .
We hid it in the middle of some data tables , so it would be hard to spot when disassembling the ROM .
All you had to do to invoke it is enter the debugger and type a 6 digit hexadecimal address followed by a " G " , which meant execute the routine at that address .
We demoed it for Steve and he liked it .
We were kind of hoping someone would copy the ROM just so we could show off our foresight .
As far as I know , no one ever did copy the ROM in a commercial project , so it was n't really necessary , but it did create some intrigue for a while .
We let it slip that there was a " stolen from Apple " icon hidden in there somewhere , partially to deter people from copying the ROM .
At least one hacker became moderately obsessed with trying to find it .
Steve Jasik was the author of the MacNosy disassembler / debugger , which could be used to create pseudo - source for the ROM .
He found out about the " stolen from Apple " icon pretty early on , and became determined to isolate it .
He lived in Palo Alto , so I would occasionally bump into him , and he would ask me for hints or tell me his latest theory about how it was concealed , which was invariably wrong .
This went on for two or three years , before he finally cracked it : I ran into him and he had it nailed , telling me about the compressed icon and the address of the display routine .
I congratulated him , but was never sure if he figured it out himself or if someone with access to the source code told him .

Good on paper , bad in practice : from fart offsets to eco-beer , blocking the sun to Green Burning Man , here are 20 of the craziest innovations , inventions , and ideas to save the planet – most of which have fallen miserably short of the mark .
In the modern green movement rush to solve our numerous environmental crises , scientists have been scrambling to develop innovative technologies and creative solutions .
Some of these developments – from small - scale interventions like cargo container homes to citywide green urban re-designs – have been lauded for their ingenuity and potential .
But other concepts , while initially offering promise , have turned out to be impossible , dangerous , or just … ridiculous .
Global warming .
Food shortages and water scarcity .
Fossil fuel depletion .
Deforestation and extinction .
Freakish weather .
Methane pollution and acid rain .
Dwindling resources .
It ’s an understatement to say we ’re facing major environmental issues as the first decade of the 21st century draws to a close .
No wonder scientists are trying anything and everything .
Even things that do n’t work .
At all .
Artificial Islands and Floating Cities
( Images via wikipedia and Reuters )
Land reclamation project turned private playground for the rich and famous , artificial island projects such as Dubai’s The World have come under criticism for harming the environment and disturbing delicate ecosystems as developers claim the projects actually benefit the planet like natural islands .
Despite the fact that self - professed environmentalists Brad and Angelina have snapped up their own faux islet , The World is an environmental embarrassment compared to contemporary architectural trends toward prefabrication , portability and the recycling of old structures into new houses .
Other artificial islands claiming to preserve the environment are credible , such as ( where else ? ) the Bay Area ’s Treasure Island project , China ’s Dongtan , and the high - tech Lilypad – the amphibious answer to a future of rising tides .
These artificial cities are carbon neutral , self - sufficient and 100 % sustainable .
However , a lack of scalability and prohibitive cost for at - risk regions makes projects like Lilypad a novelty , not a global solution .
A more likely ( and practical ) solution will be to retrofit existing cities and suburbs … although the Superstar is cool , but the nuts and bolts like bedrooms , bathrooms & storage spaces have yet to be worked out .
Human - Powered Floating Gyms
( Image via Inhabitat )
Human - powered floating gyms – a great way to transport yourself downriver as long as you do n’t mind working out in an encased shell with a dozen other sweaty bodies .
Could this be New York ’s answer to the problem of traffic congestion ?
While scientists have been working to find a way to harness wasted energy expelled by people at gyms , the practicality of floating gyms is debatable .
Would people want to work out on their way to meetings and appointments ?
Would the resources used to build the gyms make the energy savings even worth it ?
Is n’t walking or biking on existing roadways a more feasible ( and inexpensive ) method of transport ?
The 15 - Year Light Bulb
( Images via Ecoble and Fort Photo )
Everyone would love love a light bulb that lasts 1.5 decades .
Think of all the energy humans would collectively save .
Unfortunately , though many were excited by the , um , glow of this idea , the radioactivity of the bulb means we still need a nontoxic answer to the problem of wasted electricity when it comes to lamps and lighting .
Failed Hybrids
( Images via PureGreenCars , Motortrend and tuvie )
Hybrid concepts are hot , but not all futuristic vehicle concepts are realistic .
Like the extreme gravity car .
Or even Hybrid SUVs that get worse gas mileage than most sedans and require tremendous virgin resources to produce .
But then there is Ford ’s failed hybrid revolution and the plight of the electric car .
Though there are plenty of great hybrids on the market these days , as well as some great upcoming models and concepts , many have been dismal failures .
The air car is a kick - ass concept , but time will tell if it can significant mileage with the media or consumers .
And of course , there is the infamous water - powered car .
You may want to hold out hope for the 330 mpg Aptera .
Road Cells
( Image via Nicolas T )
The friction and heat generated by cars on the road adds up to a lot of wasted energy .
Scientists have toyed with the idea of special absorbent cells that could harness all that alternative energy for reuse .
The only problem is a lack of feasibility : retrofitting roads with special cells is unlikely when our crumbling infrastructure is already in such a state of disrepair .
And the wear - and - tear dilemma has yet to be resolved .
Biofuels
They were the next great answer to the unquenchable thirst for fuel .
And then people saw the rapidly burgeoning rates of deforestation and created a global food crisis the world is still dealing with .
Biofuels seemed like the magic ticket , but the number is up .
Though biofuel production is still growing and politicians are still hopeful that these agricultural sources of energy can get us off fossil fuels , the management and production thus far has been a free - for - all with unintended consequences and tragic collateral damage .
Biofuels may even create more carbon emissions .
And as if this were n’t bad enough , biofuels apparently marginalize women .
Cow Fart Offsets
( Image via hans s )
Cows produce a lot of methane when they emit .
Methane is 23 times worse than carbon dioxide .
Researchers recently discovered that kangaroo flatulence is methane - free thanks to a certain unidentified bacteria .
They have said that if people can infect livestock such as cows with the bacteria , humans can possibly prevent this widespread methane pollution .
But it will take at least three years to isolate the bacteria , and scientists have no idea what impact the germ would have upon the health of cows .
While cows do produce tremendous amounts of methane ( 14 % of greenhouse gases total ) , bypassing cattle farts would do nothing to put a dent in the tremendous resources they use : water , feed , and space .
Beef is one hell of an inefficient dinner .
Besides , cows also produce ammonia .
Burning Man Goes Green
The glorious dome became Earthdome and Burning Man went green .
And around the world … crickets were heard .
Bay Area Prada - wearing hippies and artsy types from all corners were bummed , but unfortunately , the great green statement of last year ’s Burning Man went up in smoke .
Burying Pollution in the Ocean in Really Big Bags
( Image via Popular Science )
There are numerous ideas to deal with carbon dioxide that involve the ocean : planting lime , seeding iron , and least plausibly , dunking carbon - filled sacks .
Some ideas may indeed be viable , but specialized sacks do n’t look to be .
The appeal ?
These large , sausage - shaped skins could be easily transported ( the resources and transport required for carbon tanks has rendered that scheme a lost cause for now ) .
But they could also be easily snagged and torn , and scientists wo n’t have them ready until 2020 .
And since humans produce 800 tons of carbon every second , people would use a bag every 11 days at the current rate .
If oceans are forced to absorb carbon dioxide , though , the acidity will increase , which translates to danger for marine life .
The inherent dilemma remains : people simply need to create less mess .

Geo-engineering was once consider loony bin science .
No more .
Of particular interests to scientists right now is the potential cooling that could result if they engineered a massive volcanic explosion .
When Mt. Pinatubo exploded in 1991 , millions of tons of sulfur dioxide helped create a cooling effect .
Unfortunately , scientists still know too little about the exact mechanisms of global warming , and intentionally creating massive weather systems or environmental catastrophes could cause more harm than good .
This is talking about tinkering with a watch when people do n’t know the time .
It ’s not off the table , but geo- engineering has a long way to go before being viable .
Eureka !
Do n’t Have Babies
Humans tend to look to technological innovation in hopes of saving the planet , but the simple truth is that consuming fewer resources is ( or was ) the best hope .
And that means no more babies .
Especially for Americans – they are living as if there are 5 earths instead of 1 .
Unlikely , however , until humans no longer feel compelled to continue the species and the Pope no longer feels compelled to keep millions in the Middle Ages with his rants against birth control .
The urge to procreate and religion : good luck taking these on , environmentalists .
Really Dumb “ Green ” Gadgets
( Images via respective manufacturers )
From the Asus bamboo paneled laptop to the flower you can grow in a plastic case hooked up to your computer , many “ green ” home gadget inventions are not only silly but require the use of virgin resources to produce .
Other dumb inventions to “ help ” the environment include the Petapotty ( an indoor platform on which your dog can dump – to prevent harm to lawns because you forgot your baggy ) , the Go Green paper shredder ( it shreds your paper into squares , because you do n’t own scissors ) , the so - called Eco Kettle ( Barbie says : measuring is hard ! ) , the solar - powered fan hat ( do n’t ask ) , the nano - silver washing machine that eliminates the need for detergent ( because silver strip mining is eco ? ) , and many more .
There ’s nothing like a good coat of greenwash to remind everyone that silly gadgets are not going to save the planet .
Sonic Curtains

Biophony is an important element of environmental stability , and with the widespread problem of noise pollution harming animals and stressing humans , scientists are looking for answers .
The Polytechnic University of Valencia , Spain is convinced that sonic cloaks are the remedy to camouflage too much noise .
Ostensibly , this will encourage people to repopulate cities , reducing suburban sprawl , but what happens if your neighbor ’s apartment is on fire and you ’re blissfully sleeping through the screams ?
Rich people

Oh , rich people .
They ’re so cute !
From pristine environmental enclaves for the superrich that turn out to be harmful to Kevin Costner wasting $ 40 million on useless green initiatives , to Madonna plastered on a green Vanity Faire as she spends $ 120 grand a year on plastic bottled water , to celebs claiming to be green while their lifestyles are anything but , rich people and green = FAIL .
Hairy Plants
( Image via Popular Science )
A researcher named Christopher Doughty of the University of California at Irvine noticed that plants in hot , arid regions are hairy – and this unique characteristic enables the plants to reflect harmful near - infrared light and drive more efficient photosynthesis .
The proposed solution : a hairier , furrier landscape , coming to a backyard near you .
Unfortunately , disturbing natural ecosystems by introducing alien plant species is a poor idea .
And while plants could be genetically engineered to be as furry as their desert counterparts , the practicality of this green solution is questionable at best .
Extra reflection could mean less water evaporation , which would actually heat the planet further .
Beaming Electricity from Space
( Image via Popular Science )
Send satellites into space , where they unfurl 1.5 mile - long solar arrays and send limitless clean energy to earth .
Japan is already investing heavily in this technology .
One problem : the beam could theoretically miss the receiver and fry , say , a neighborhood .
Researchers are working on a solution to this potential disaster , but so far no luck .
Giant Fake Trees
( Image via Mash Down Babylon )
One passionate , if nutty , scientist named Wallace Broecker has a desperate plan to save the planet : “ plant ” millions of massive trees all over the globe at a cost of $ 600 billion a year .
Fake trees , at that .
The trees will be capable of sucking up carbon dioxide , thereby theoretically containing the climate change threat .
Broecker is the scientist who originally coined the term “ global warming ” , but his scrubber tree scheme is n’t sticking .
Harnessing Tornadoes
( Images via Popular Science and tlindenbaum )
Since tornados frequently exceed 100 mph , generating 10 mega - watt hours of power , scientists are hard at work developing machines that could somehow intake and harness this power .
One scientist says he knows how to trap a tornado and keep the twister going indefinitely , generating all the power we need .
The commercial machine is slated for debut in about 5 years , but the dangers of such a device are serious .
A tornado might grow out of control , destroying the machine and creating widespread devastation .
The scientist working on the machine says such concerns are ridiculous , because all he has to due is flip a switch to slap that silly little tornado back into its place .
Why , a tornado spinning out of control would be inconceivable !
Pig Pee Plates

1 billion pigs , 90,000 tons of urine daily .
With all the bacon and pork chops Americans eat , there ’s a lot of porcine pee to divert .
Pig urine contains urea , which is already in use in many products ( it is used in de-icing formulas , among many applications ) .
Researchers have created a bioplastic from the urine , but it is not as great as one might think .
For starters , when the bioplastic breaks down in landfills , it releases methane .
The inherent problems associated with meat production are not alleviated , either .
What ’s more , bioplastic still requires the use of some petroleum - based plastic , meaning recycling facilities are going to have a hard time getting equipped for this new hybrid of plastic .
The Danish scientists are undeterred , however , envisioning pig skyscraper cities where all waste is harnessed for reuse .
Production on plates begins soon .
Eco Beer
Something involving wort and steam cannot be worth toasting – or can it ?
Engineers think that using steam to brew the wort ( the mixture of starch – like barley – and water ) can reduce brewing time by half while using half the energy .
And this is a solution to our environmental woes ?
It ’s like that scene in South Park when the gnomes are stealing underpants .
Steal the underpants , do other stuff , profit !
Great green innovations do n’t always pan out .
And sometimes ideas that read like a wacky sci - fi novel turn out to be brilliant .
Look for updates in future posts .
Liberal democracies are n't generally pleased with massive state - run mandatory Internet filtering schemes , but Australia 's government is plowing ahead with just such a project .
Stoking fears that such a scheme could easily blacklist legal content from all Australians , one national politician has now called for precisely that sort of a blacklist .
Under the " Family First " party 's scheme , hardcore sex and drug content would be added to the list of " illegal " content , even though they are actually legal for adults to view offline .
Family
First is n't a major party — it has only one federal member of Parliament — but it does command more regional support .
While massive federal government intervention in the Internet might not seem to be an especially conservative principle , Family First argues that the porn problem has reached epidemic levels , that parental responsibility simply is n't workable , and that kids are stumbling over damaging material both purposefully and by accident .
Government needs to act .
The party 's federal legislator , Steve Fielding , is opposed to both a " fart tax " ( PDF ) and to an unfettered Internet .
The party " will work to achieve Government commitment to establish a Mandatory Filtering Scheme at the ISP Server Level in this country , " says the official party plank ( PDF ) .
The government agrees , and it has been pursuing a two - tiered scheme .
The first tier would be a " clean feed " that filters porn and " illegal content , " and it would be optional .
The second tier would filter only " illegal content " and would be mandatory for all Australians .
No to cow fart taxes , yes to Internet filtering
But what would be included in " illegal content " ?
The government is n't saying yet , but Family First has its own ideas .
The Sydney Morning Herald asked Fielding what he envisions for the mandatory feed .
" Family First would consider a mandatory ISP - based filtering system that protects children by blocking illegal content like child pornography , but allows adults to opt out of filtering to access material classified R18 + or less , " said the party .
The statement indicates that any material rated above R 18 + ( including X 18 + and " refused classification " ) would fall under the mandatory blacklist and could not be accessed through any Australian ISP .
Such material is currently legal for Australian adults .
The free speech concerns of a politicized blacklist that includes legal material are profound , and they are stressed by groups like the " No Clean Feed " campaign .
But there are technical concerns as well .
The System Administrators ' Guild of Australia , SAGE - AU , issued a statement again stressing its opposition to Internet filtering on grounds that it simply would n't work .
" SAGE - AU remains concerned that the filters tested are unable to provide an effective , reliable filtering solution with the performance required for modern broadband connections , " she said .
" The filters tested have demonstrated an excessively high exclusion rate of legitimate Internet content . "
The government 's own testing has shown that the filters still have serious problems with false positives and can degrade network performance from 20 - 75 percent .
If Australian Internet users are n't thrilled about the metered ' Net connections that are common in the country , we can only imagine how much they will enjoy metered connections that run 20 - 75 percent slower and censor the Internet .

I think you are dead wrong .
It is absolutely wrong to say they are NEVER read as people DO see them , and CAN read , ergo some do .

No , they wo n't , and should n't .
Why pay some idiot corporation an extortion fee just because they bribed the browser manufacturers to include their certs by default ?
There is NO added security to having a paid for cert .

University of British Columbia archaeologists have dug up a mystery worthy of Indiana Jones , one that includes a tomb , skeletons and burial rites with both Christian and pagan elements .
This summer , Prof. Roger Wilson led excavations at Kaukana , an ancient Roman village located near Punta Secca , a small town in the south - eastern province of Ragusa in Sicily .
Combing through the sand - buried site , the 15 - member team made a series of startling discoveries .
Central to the mystery was finding a tomb inside a room in a house dating from the sixth century AD .
Wilson explains that tombs during this period are normally found only in cemeteries outside the built - up area of a town , or around the apse of a church .
And since the building was substantial with mortared walls and internal plaster , this would have been likely a tomb for the wealthy .
“ It ’s extremely unusual to find an elite burial set inside a house in the middle of a settlement , even as late as the sixth century , ” says Wilson , who heads UBC ’s Department of Classical , Near Eastern and Religious Studies .
The UBC initiative -- in collaboration with Prof. Giovanni Di Stefano of the Superintendency for the Cultural Heritage of Ragusa -- is the first major exploration of this historic site since 1972 .

Locals first stumbled upon the late Roman village during the 1960s when a bulldozer preparing for new houses uncovered the tops of some 24 ancient buildings .
Only a few , among them a church , were explored at the time , by renowned Italian archaeologist Paola Pelagatti .
Wilson directed students from UBC and Sicily in their painstaking work , focusing on what proved to be an “ exceptionally well - preserved ” structure on the south side of Kaukana , only yards from the beach .
The walls uncovered stand nearly six feet high .
Once the cover was lifted off the tomb , one team member spent 10 days sieving the contents with great care .
Two skeletons were found .
One was of a woman between the ages of 25 and 30 , with teeth in excellent condition and no signs of arthritis .
“ She was in pretty good nick , so we know this was n’t a peasant working in the field , ” says Wilson .
The other skeleton was a child of indeterminate sex between the ages of five and seven .
The position of their bones showed that the woman had been laid to rest first .
The tomb was then re-opened to bury the child and the woman ’s spinal column was pushed to one side .
A hole in the stone slab covering the tomb allowed visitors to pour libations for the dead .

“ This shows that the long - established , originally pagan , rite of offering libations to the dead clearly continued into early Byzantine times , ” observes Wilson .
Yet , the presence of a Christian cross on a lamp found in the room and on the underside of a grave slab suggests that the deceased were Christian .
As well , the skeletons were wrapped in plaster , a practice believed to be Christian for preserving the body for resurrection .
“ It is the first plaster burial recorded in Sicily , although the practice is known from Christian communities in North Africa , ” says Wilson .
What also intrigued the archaeologists was learning that the tomb was opened one further time , an intrusion that disturbed the bones of the child and caused its skull to be placed upside down .
Wilson says he wondered whether it was grave robbers in search of expensive jewelry or other loot .
“ But the tomb was tidied up again afterwards . ”
Around the tomb was plentiful evidence of periodic feasting in honour of the dead .
The archaeologists found cooking pots , glass and several large clay containers ( amphorae ) , of which one is virtually intact .
These would have been used to carry oil and wine to the site .
The team also found the remains of two hearths where meals had been prepared .
As well , the room was designed with niches along one wall .
Wilson says a knife , seafood , and fragments of stemmed goblets and other glass vessels were left on these shelves , “ as though placed there after the last party . ”
UBC ’s snapshot of late Roman and early Byzantine life has stirred considerable interest among the Italian media and historians worldwide .
With support for three years of study from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada , Wilson says the team is eager to further unravel the skeins of history .
When they return to Kaukana next summer , they will attempt to solve the riddles encountered this first year .
“ Along with questions of when the house was built and whether it was still occupied when the tomb was inserted , we want to find out why the woman and child were buried in the tomb at all . ”
A Japanese man set fire to the hotel where he was due to get married at the weekend , rather than go through with the ceremony later the same day , newspaper reports said .
Tatsuhiko Kawata , 39 , had gone along with wedding plans despite already having a wife , the Yomiuri newspaper said .
" I thought if I set a fire I would n't have to go through with the wedding , " the paper quoted him as telling police .
Guests at the hotel were evacuated and no one was injured when he set the fire in the early hours of Sunday morning at the resort hotel in Yamanashi Prefecture , west of Tokyo .
Mr Kawata and his fiancee had been set to get married before 80 guests .
He was arrested after suddenly cancelling the event and behaving suspiciously , the Yomiuri said .

The neocons ' Palin project
Will the neocons who tutored President Bush in the ideology he pursued to the ruin of his presidency do the same for GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin ?
Should they succeed , they will destroy her .
Yet , they are moving even now to capture this princess of the right and hope of the party .
In St. Paul , Palin was told to cancel a meeting with Phyllis Schlafly and pro-life conservatives .
McCain 's operatives said Palin had to rest for her Wednesday convention speech .
Yet , on Tuesday , Palin was behind closed doors with Joe Lieberman and officials of the Israeli lobby AIPAC .
There , according to the Washington Post , Palin took and passed her oral exams .
" Palin assured the group of her strong support for Israel , of her desire to see the United States move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and of her opposition to Iran 's aspirations to become a nuclear power , according to sources familiar with the meeting . "
AIPAC 's mission , like that of the Israeli political party Likud , is to goad America into launching air and missile strikes on any and all Iranian nuclear facilities .
AIPAC went away happy .
Purred spokesman Josh Block , " We were pleased that Gov. Palin expressed her deep personal commitment to the safety and well - being of Israel . "
Heading home to Alaska to prepare for her interview with Charlie Gibson , Palin was escorted by Randy Scheunemann , McCain 's foreign policy guru and , until March , a hired agent of the Tbilisi regime .
Scheunemann 's lobbying assignment : Bring Georgia into NATO , so U.S. troops , like 19 - year - old Track Palin , will be required to fight Russia to defend a Saakashvili regime that has paid Scheunemann and his partner $ 730,000 .
Reportedly , a phone conversation was held between Saakashvili and Palin , in which Palin committed herself to the territorial integrity of Georgia , though South Ossetia and Abkhazia have declared independence and been recognized by Moscow , which now has troops in both .
Also on Palin 's plane was Steve Biegun , formerly of Bush 's National Security Council , and Scheunemann 's choice to tutor her .
Of Biegun , Steven Clemens of the New American Foundation says , " He will turn her into an advocate of Cheneyism and Cheney 's view of national security issues . "
During her interview with Gibson , Palin often took a neocon line .
Three times she said that , should Israel decide to attack Iran , the United States should not " second guess " Israel 's decision or interfere .
This contradicts U.S. policy .
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs , has warned Israel not to attack Iran , as the United States does not want a " third front . "
And the Pentagon is withholding crucial weapons the Israelis want and need to carry out any such attack .
Palin also volunteered that the Russian invasion was " unprovoked , " though Georgia attacked South Ossetia first .
She followed up by saying that Georgia and Ukraine should be brought into NATO .
Would that mean America would have to go to war with Russia on behalf of Georgia in any new conflict ?
asked Gibson .
" Perhaps so , " said Palin .
Scheunemann should get a fat severance check from Saakashvili for that one .
One ex-White House aide at American Enterprise Institute , asked by Tim Shipman of the Daily Telegraph if AEI sees Palin as a " project , " replied : " Your word , not mine .
...
But I would n't disagree with the sentiment .
...
She 's bright , and she 's a blank page .
She 's going places , and it 's worth going there with her . "
In fairness to Palin , on issues like NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia , her answers reflect the views of the man who chose her .
She has no option at present but to follow the line laid down by Scheunemann .
But make no mistake .
Sarah Palin is no neocon .
She did not come by her beliefs by studying Leo Strauss .
She is a traditionalist whose values are those of family , faith , community and country , not some utopian ideology .
Wasilla , Alaska , is not a natural habitat of neoconservatives .
And her unrehearsed answers to Gibson 's questions reveal her natural conservatism .
Asked if she agrees with the Bush Doctrine , Palin asked for clarification .
" In what respect , Charlie ? "
Gibson : " Do we have the right of an anticipatory self - defense ? "
Yes , said Palin , " if there is legitimate and enough intelligence that tells us that a strike is imminent against ( the ) American people , we have every right to defend our country .
In fact , the president has the obligation , the duty to defend . "
Exactly .
The intelligence must be legit and the threat " imminent . "
Interviewed by Alaska Business Monthly in March 2007 on the surge , Palin said , " I heard on the news about the new deployments , and while I support our president , I want to know that we have an exit plan in place . "
That is not the language of empire or " benevolent global hegemony . "
Palin may disappoint many conservatives in the next seven weeks by having to parrot the McCain - neocon line on NATO expansion , NAFTA and a " path to citizenship " for illegal aliens .
But the battle for Palin 's soul is not over .
For , again , the lady is no neocon .
Nor is the husband Todd , first dude of Alaska and former member of the Alaska First Independence Party .
In the first investigation , Branchflower found that Sarah Palin had abused her power and violated ethics laws .
On Friday , she will give her first deposition in this second inquiry , into the Troopergate affair .
Of course , to hear Sarah Palin tell it , she has been completely clear .
She had an interview with CNN :
“ I do n’t think that it was an abuse of power of my office at all , ” Palin told CNN in an interview Tuesday .
“ And I was very thankful that that report cleared me of any illegal dealings or anything else .
I replaced the commissioner because he was not doing the job that I expect of my Cabinet members . ”
Talk about being in denial .
Maybe this second inquiry will give her a reality check .
Here are the details from the Anchorage Daily News on what will transpire on Friday .
The Palins ’ attorney , Thomas Van Flein , said Tuesday that the governor and her husband will both give depositions Friday afternoon outside of Alaska , but declined to say where .
She is on the campaign trail as Republican John McCain ’s running mate .
McCain - Palin campaign spokesman Taylor Griffin said Palin ’s Friday schedule has not been released .
These depositions are part of an investigation by the Alaska Personnel Board , which has hired independent counsel Timothy Petumenos , who did not return a telephone call to his Anchorage office .
Van Flein said he expects each interview to take up to three hours .
Unlike the Legislature , the Personnel Board is an agency of the state ’s executive branch and its officials can be fired by Palin for cause .
Only the three - member board has the authority to sanction Palin .
Palin has said it was up to the Personnel Board to investigate her actions , not state lawmakers .
Palin agreed to cooperate with the board ’s investigation .
The Alaska Supreme Court rejected a bid by five Republican state legislators to shut down the Legislature ’s investigation .
This should be interesting to see what this investigation turns up .
Witness tampering should be at the top of the list .
If I find anymore information about this second inquiry , I will keep everyone posted with an update .
I ’m interested to hear how many of you think she is guilty .
If not guilty , I would love to hear your reasons why not .
Mentally Unstable Soldiers Redeployed to Iraq Bob Woodruff reports on vulnerable soldiers who are sent back to Iraq .
Oct. 23 , 2008  --
Two weeks before his second deployment to Iraq last September , Army Specialist Michael DeVlieger broke down .
" At first , I thought it was something that everybody experienced , " DeVlieger told ABC 's Bob Woodruff , " and just through time and perseverance I guess it would pass . "
It did n't pass .
After an 11 - day hospitalization , DeVlieger was given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder , three psychiatric prescriptions -- and deployment orders .
" Eighteen hours after he got out of the hospital , he deployed to Iraq , " DeVlieger 's wife , Christine DeVlieger , recalled .
He left for Iraq despite Pentagon policy requiring that service members establish three months of " stability without significant symptoms " before deploying .
" I was a ticking time bomb , " Michael DeVlieger said .
Watch " World News " Tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET for the full report
Citing privacy , officials at DeVlieger 's base in Fort Campbell , Ky. , declined to comment except to say there was a combat stress unit assigned to DeVlieger 's base in Iraq .
' Stretched Too Thin '
More than 600,000 Americans have served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Psychological trauma is cumulative , " explained Dr. Paul Ragan , a former Navy psychiatrist who is an associate professor of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University .
More deployments can mean more mental stress , and for some , more mental illnesses , he said .
Army surveys show that for those soldiers deployed once , the rate of anxiety , depression and post - traumatic stress disorder is 12 percent .
For those deployed three or more times , the rate is 27 percent .
" People who have psychiatric symptoms , actively symptomatic with PTSD or depression , are being sent back to the very situation that caused their PTSD and depression , " Ragan said .
The Army 's chief psychiatrist , Dr. Elspeth Ritchie , agrees with the Rand Corp .'s estimate that 300,000 service members have demonstrated post - traumatic stress disorder symptoms .
Some are returning to the battlefront , although the Army is not keeping track of how many .
" I certainly would not want to lump all soldiers who have experienced post - traumatic stress disorder and say they are impaired and not able to do their job , " Ritchie told Woodruff .
" I think that would be very stigmatizing . "
Many soldiers , as Ritchie points out , receive treatment and cope successfully with PTSD or depression .
" We have a number of reasons for sending the soldiers back to war -- we have a mission , clearly , " Ritchie said .
The mission asks a lot of a few .
Less than 1 percent of the population serves , and serves again .
" We know the Army is stretched too thin .
We know how busy we are .
We know we need more forces , " Ritchie said .
While Ritchie said she was unfamiliar with the details of DeVlieger 's case , she added that if it were true , it " clearly violates our policy . "
Ritchie said the Army works hard to screen veterans , but there will always be some missed cases .
Medicated Soldiers
The military is increasingly medicating its warriors , and in some cases , returning them to the fight .
Ritchie defended the concept .
" You have to remember , PTSD is a treatable disorder , and you can have symptoms and still do your job quite well . "
Twelve percent of soldiers in Iraq and 17 percent of those in Afghanistan reported taking antidepressants , anxiety medications or sleep medications in the Army 's most recent mental health survey .
The use of psychiatric drugs on the battlefield has not been scientifically studied , and some say the practice carries risks .
" The black box on the label talks about side effects like suicide , poor judgment , " retired Army psychologist Bart Billings warned .
" It 's really not a good idea to put people in a battle situation where the side effects of the medications they 're taking could be suicide -- when they 're carrying weapons . "
As a psychiatrist in Kuwait during the first Gulf War , Ragan saw a vastly different military opinion of psychiatric medications .
" Clearly , in 1990 , if someone was on antidepressant medication , we sent them back to the United States . "
The Army has 200 mental health professionals in Iraq to treat soldiers and monitor medications .
This number has remained constant since the start of the war , even as the number of troops has increased .
' It Still Sticks With Me '
Former Marine Cpl. Michael Cataldi , an Iraq war veteran , remembers the dark days that followed his first deployment .
" I was taking anti-psychotics , narcotics for pain and drinking at least 30 beers a night , " he said .
He came home to Camp Pendleton , Calif. , haunted by the horrors of war , including a helicopter crash that killed 30 fellow Marines .
" I saw a Marine Corps sergeant who had the majority of the top of his head missing , and he had the look of a scream on his face , " Cataldi recounted .
" And that stuck with me , and it still sticks with me . "
Cataldi said he went to see a military psychiatrist who brushed aside his concerns .
" I tell them , `I 'm having nightmares .
I feel like I 'm having out - of - body experiences .
I feel like I 'm watching myself in a movie .
I 'm losing memory , coordination . '
This whole time he said , ` You 're not feeling that way . '
Exact words : ` No , you 're not . ' "
Cataldi was prescribed several psychiatric medications and deployed to Iraq for a second tour of duty .
When asked for comment , Marine public affairs officer Cpt. Carl Redding told ABC News that Cataldi 's records were " private and not releasable . "
Redding continued , " Marines with a psychiatric disorder in remission or those whose residual symptoms do not impair their duties may be considered for deployment . "
Cataldi's wife , Monica Cataldi , believes the decision was wrong .
" In my opinion , anybody who has to be on medication just to function , just to do their job , should n't go to Iraq . "
A month into his second tour in Iraq , Cataldi said he ran out of his psychiatric medication .
" I went cold turkey on a narcotic in a combat zone , " Cataldi said .
" I woke up lying in the dirt in the middle of the night .
I do n't remember how I got there , with my rifle buried next to me . "
" I was n't mentally safe .
I was a liability .
I could have got someone hurt , " Cataldi said .
Redding emphasized the military 's focus on mental health .
" Providing proper mental health care and assessing mental fitness to deploy are of the highest importance to Marine leaders . "
Sgt. Barrett Wanted to Go Back
Last fall , Sgt. Chad Barrett stood before an Army medical evaluation board in Fort Carson , Colo. , and asked to return to Iraq , even though his medical record included a PTSD diagnosis , a suicide attempt and a commander 's recommendation that he be " removed from the United States Army and receive the treatment he needs . "
On Christmas Day last year , the Army sent Barrett to Iraq for the third time .
He never came home .
" This was a slow , progressive mental illness that never would have come about had he not been deployed repeatedly in a short period of time , had he gotten the care that he needed , had he gotten the best that the Army had to offer , " said Chad 's widow , Shelby Barrett .
A month into his third tour , 35 - year - old Chad Barrett committed suicide in his barracks .
He overdosed on the medications the Army had prescribed to help him cope .
Officials at Fort Carson , citing privacy , said they could not comment on Barrett 's death .
" In a body bag is not how I wanted my husband back , " said Shelby Barrett .
Half of Suicides Followed Treatment
The most recent Army Suicide Event Report showed suicides climbed to the highest number on record last year .
Half of those who committed suicide had visited a medical program or clinic within 30 days of death and twenty - seven percent had a history of psychiatric medication .
ABC News looked into a dozen suicides that followed multiple deployments and had showed clear signs of mental distress .
In February 2007 , Army Sgt. Brian Rand took his life in the park in Clarksville , Tenn. , where he had been married a year before .
" He shot himself in the head , " Rand 's widow , Dena Rand , told Woodruff .
" It was like a nightmare . "
Dena Rand has paperwork showing that her husband sought mental health care and was referred to the mental health department during his second tour in Iraq .
But nothing ever came of it .
" He knew he needed help , and he tried and he was n't very successful , " Rand said .
In a physical exam for discharge from the military , a psychiatrist wrote that Brian Rand was " mentally unsound . "
" Someone got that report showing that my husband was mentally unsound .
Someone should have notified his chain of command , or at least myself , " said Rand .
" I want to know who dropped the ball . "

" We can choose a better future -- based on clean energy and clean jobs .
Tell Congress to act now on global warming -- before the climate crisis brings our planet even one degree closer to destroying our future . " -- Kyra Sedgwick
Research indicates that a rise of just two degrees Centigrade in global temperatures would expose millions of people to drought , hunger and flooding .
As we hover a mere two degrees from this irreversible damage , Congress needs to pass legislation that :
* Sets enforceable deadlines to cut global warming pollution by 80 % by 2050 ,
* Dramatically increases the production of more fuel - efficient vehicles and cleaner fuels , and
* Requires utilities to generate 25 % of their electricity from renewable sources such as wind , solar , and geothermal power .
To prevent the catastrophic outcomes of global warming , tell Congress to act now by passing tough global warming legislation .

In a recent speech , Palin said , “ ” Senator McCain , he promises to use that power of veto also in defense of the public interest .
I can assure him that it works and I will continue to assure him that that power of the veto works . ”
For a rundown of her budget vetoes , see this pdf from the State of Alaska .
That ’s the 2007 budget she cut .
What about 2008 ?
Palin ’s veto ax lops $ 268 million from budget
TENSION : Some legislators say cuts were unnecessary and went too deep .

Gov. Sarah Palin on Friday axed about 10 percent of the spending that state legislators approved for hometown projects .
This is the second year in a row Palin vetoed projects dear to legislators .
She said lawmakers stuffed the $ 2.7 billion state capital budget too full .
Meanwhile , Sitka Republican Sen . Bert Stedman said the state has a surplus that could expand by $ 9 billion over the coming year if oil prices stay at these heights .
The very next month , Palin proposed to give every Alaskan ( man , woman and child ) $ 1,200 for “ energy relief . ”
This money would be in addition to what they receive under the the 2008 Permanent Fund dividend program .
According to the LA Times , a family of four can expect to receive about $ 13,000 this year .
Larger families will receive more , as the cash distributions are per person , not per household .
To summarize : Palin cut $ 268 million worth of projects which were democratically approved by the State Legislature , but supported plans to give away $ 781 million to her constituants .
Yes , Palin knows how to use the Veto pen .
She also knows how to buy votes .

As a population of West African chimpanzees dwindles to critically endangered levels , scientists are calling for a definition of personhood that includes our close evolutionary cousins .
Just two decades ago , the Ivory Coast boasted a 10,000 - strong chimpanzee population , accounting for half of the world 's population .
According to a new survey * , * that number has fallen to just a few thousand .
News of such a decline , published today in * Current Biology , * would be saddening in any species .
But should we feel more concern for the chimpanzees than for another animal — as much concern , perhaps , as we might feel for other people ?
" They are a people .
Non-human , but definitely persons , " said Deborah Fouts , co-director of the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute .
" They have n't built a rocket ship to the moon .
But we 're not that different . "
Fouts is one of a growing number of scientists and ethicists who believe that chimpanzees — as well as orangutans , bonobos and gorillas , a group colloquially known as great apes — ought to be considered people .
It 's a controversial position .
If being a person requires being human , then chimpanzees , our closest primate relative , are still only 98 percent complete .
But if personhood is defined more broadly , chimpanzees may well qualify .
They have self - awareness , feelings and high - level cognitive powers .
Hardly a month seems to pass without researchers finding evidence of behavior thought to belong solely to humans .
Some even suggest that chimpanzees and other great apes should be granted human rights .
So argued advocates for Hiasl , a chimpanzee caught in an Austrian custody battle , and the framers of an ape rights resolution passed by the Spanish parliament .
The question of rights is practically thorny — how could a chimp be held responsible for , say , attacking another chimp ? — but the fundamental question is n't practical , but rather scientific and ethical .
" They have been shown to have all kinds of complex communication and cognitive powers that are similar to humans , " said Clayton State University primate researcher Jared Taglialatela .
" They have feelings , they have ideas , they have goals . "
The capacity of chimpanzees to feel , vividly illustrated when primatologist Jane Goodall documented the grief of a chimp named Flint
for his mother , is the least ambiguous of chimpanzee characteristics .
More ambiguous is their ability to think abstractly and empathically .
" They do n't have time .
They can't talk about yesterday or tomorrow .
Their communication is very much instantaneous : ' A neighbor is coming , let 's go .
A female 's in heat , so check me out . '
It 's not , ' How are you today ? ' " said Pascal Gagneux , a University of California , San Diego primatologist .
He considers chimpanzees to be persons , but fundamentally different from humans by virtue of their profoundly different communicative range .
But Fouts , who has trained her chimpanzees to use sign language , disagrees .
" They do remember the past .
When people come that they have n't seen in many years , they use their name signs , " she said .
Taglialatela echoed Fouts .
" I do n't know if they think about what they want to be when they grow up , " he said , " but they understand the concept that something will happen later . "
Taglialatela has shown that chimpanzees utilize parts of their brain similar to our own Broca 's and Wernicke 's areas , which in humans are considered central to speech production and processing .
When communicating , chimpanzees choose circumstance - appropriate forms :
gesturing by hand to someone who looks at them , or calling out to someone who looks away .
" We 're seeing this rich communicative repertoire .
It 's not simply , 'I
see a piece of food and make some emotional sound , ' " he said .
" They 're using different perspectives to communicate . "
Researchers have also found that chimps use hand gestures that vary
according to context .
The same gesture can be used for purposes as diverse as requesting sex or reconciling after a fight , a linguistic subtlety that suggests a capacity for high - level abstraction .
Chimpanzees even appear capable of altruism , being willing to help strangers in the absence of anticipated reward .
But their empathy , said
Gagneux , who proposes treating research chimps in the manner of human subjects incapable of giving informed consent , does not translate to compassion .
Of course , compassion is hardly universal among humans .
" How many times do you find yourself seeing someone on the news , or walking by someone on the street , and being apathetic towards them ? " said Taglialatela .
And Fouts , who said that chimpanzees " feel pain and anger and love and affection and the kinds of feelings we feel , " said that her sign language - trained chimpanzees can indeed inquire about the well - being of their handlers .
" They do n't use it very often , but it does n't mean they do n't understand , " she said .
So what of the situation in the Ivory Coast , where chimpanzee numbers have plummeted so dramatically that researchers say they 're not merely endangered , but critically endangered ?
Should they be mourned as animals , or people ?
Perhaps semantics are irrelevant .
" This is a tragedy , for lack of a better word , " said Taglialatela .

The clothes , from a charity shop , were ripped and doused with lager A minister posed as a tramp and gatecrashed his own service to teach churchgoers about " acceptance " .
The Reverend Derek Rigby donned a wig and some torn clothes and surrounded himself with lager cans and syringes in the church doorway on Sunday morning .
Most of the congregation at the Trinity Methodist Church in Prestatyn , Denbighshire , ignored the intruder .
Mr Rigby said most were " embarrassed " by their behaviour when he finally revealed himself during the service .
The former police officer had told the congregation he would be late for Sunday 's service , and only informed one church member of his true plans , in case anyone decided to dial 999 .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The minister said he did not shave for three days and drew on tattoos to make his appearance more convincing .
He said : " I could n't take the car in case anyone spotted it , so I walked from my home to the church .
That was interesting , because my neighbours avoided me .
" I had bought clothes from a charity shop - which were immaculate - so I had to dirty them up a bit and I poured a bit of lager on them .
" When I got to the church I arranged a couple of cans and some plastic syringes , without needles , which I have at home for the dog .
It gave the impression of a real down and out . "
He added : " None of them spoke to me , apart from a few who told me off and told me to get away from their cars , which they kept checking .
" They all ignored me . "
The minister plans to throw his " tramp " clothes away
He waited until the children had left the church to join their Sunday School before walking to the front of the building and revealing his identity to the congregation .
He said : " Some were very embarrassed .
Nobody was angry with me but they were shocked they had ignored me in the way they had .
" They could have given me a cup of coffee .
" I was surprised rather than disappointed .
Some people said they wished I had been there because I would have known how to deal with the situation . "
Mr Rigby said he had intended to communicate a " serious message of acceptance in an emotive way " , and used the example of the Disciples not recognising Jesus on the road to Emmaus after his resurrection .
He said he had tried a similar stunt twice before in Newport and London - where the congregations had been more generous .
He added : " I told them they were stingy because I had been given as much as £ 4.50 , a packet of biscuits and a blanket in the other places , but in Prestatyn I got nothing .
" Although , I 'm sure that would n't happen again . "

A DIRTY tenant turned his home into a rubbish tip by cramming it with more than 1000 burger and Kentucky Fried Chicken cartons .
Landlord Chris
Dowling could n't believe his eyes , or nose , when confronted with the squalor the man had left behind .
The mountain of burger cartons , bags and other rubbish in the living room of the £ 100,000 flat was so huge that Chris struggled to force his way through it .
More McDonald 's and KFC cartons were piled high around the bed .
It 's thought the tenant had eaten his way through £ 5000 worth of fast - food .
And when Chris made it to the bathroom , he found that the tenant had left a giant heap of cigarette ends on the sink .
Chris , 57 , said : " In 15 years of running properties I 've never come across anything like this - and we see all sorts .
" The tenant had also been smoking without opening windows and there were nicotine stains dripping from the walls .
" It smelled like a giant ashtray .
I can't imagine how anyone can live like that . "
Chris 's tenant , a mechanic , moved into the flat in Slough , Berkshire , in 2005 and always paid his £ 450 - a- month rent .
His filthy lifestyle was exposed when bailiffs turned up at the flat to chase him for unpaid council tax .
They alerted Chris , who went to inspect the flat but found the locks had been changed .
He wrote to the tenant telling him to get out and spoke to him on the phone last week .
Chris said : " He told me he had quit the flat .
I told him the council were after him and he said he would sort that out . "
Chris had to hire specialist cleaners who took a full vanload of rubbish from the studio flat .
He has also had to pay to have the property redecorated .
But he insisted : " It has n't put me off renting places out .
I 'll just take the hit . "
Don Gorske , of Wisconsin , says he has eaten 23,000 of Big Macs burgers in 36 years .
He has also kept every receipt .
Facebook has walked away from talks to buy Twitter because the $ 500 million price tag was too high , according to a report by AllThingsD .
For Facebook to be a picky value shopper is quite a turnabout from just two years ago , when Yahoo walked away from a deal to buy Facebook largely over the price .
I do n’t think that Twitter is as important to Facebook as Facebook could have been to Yahoo .
But the whole thing shows how hard it is come up with a value for this sort of Internet company .
Frankly , so much of the commentary about the “ value ” of these companies assumes there is some sort of calculation that will say whether Twitter is “ worth ” $ 500 million or $ 150 million , or whether Facebook is worth $ 1 billion or $ 15 billion .
These are not utilities with predictable schemes of cash flow that can be discounted using an H.P. calculator .
They are better seen as lottery tickets — companies that just might capture a lot of user attention in some specific area and then might find a way to profit from that attention .
Two years ago , Yahoo had to evaluate a young Facebook .
It was rapidly growing , yet it had unclear prospects for revenue and it was unclear whether the site was more than a fad .
Ultimately , Yahoo decided the company was n’t worth more than $ 1 billion .
I ’d argue on balance that Yahoo made a mistake .
Even though Facebook has n’t gotten the profit part of the equation down , it turned into an important platform — the sort of site that people use to organize a lot of their communication and information .
And most significantly , it has become a direct rival to Yahoo .
Yahoo ’s decision to pass on Facebook was n’t quite as disastrous as its decision not to buy Google early in that company ’s history .
On the flip side , Yahoo , like lots of other Internet companies , has certainly done its share of dumb deals , like buying Geocities and Broadcast.com .
Picking out a Google from a Geocities is more art than science .
Now Facebook is presumably looking at Twitter much the same way — as a company with no revenue that nonetheless could be important .
Twitter is surfing a growing wave of user behavior and engagement that is related to , but not the same as , how people use social networks , blogs , cellphones and other tools of self - expression .
The wave may crest and Twitter may stumble .
Then again , Facebook could find that Twitter by itself , or as part of a bigger company , could help shape a rival community of social sharing .
If the public reports are to be believed , Facebook decided that the answer to these questions justified giving Twitter 3.33 percent of its stock .
That ’s worth $ 500 million if you accept the $ 15 billion valuation for Facebook that was set when Microsoft invested in the company a year ago .
But no matter what you think Facebook was worth last year , its value must have fallen since then simply because the share price of other Internet companies have fallen .
( Google , which does have revenue , has seen its stock fall 61 percent over the last year . )
I ’ve got to imagine that Twitter ’s management and investors are torn .
Given the economic storm clouds , it has to be tempting to take some money off the table .
Then again , they have a hot hand now , with Twitter taking off among a wider range of users , so there is the temptation to double down and see how much they can win .
My bet : the two sides wo n’t come to an agreement on price anytime soon .
And in any case , it will take years to figure out whether Twitter is more Geocities or Google .
" There are lies and there are damned lies . "
That spin of Benjamin Disraeli ’s adage may just have to be amended .
This past week , while railing into a writer at the New York Times , Bill O’Reilly said that “ I ’ve been at Fox News for 13 years and I do n’t know of one time anyone at Fox lied .
If they did ( Fox News Boss ) Roger Ailes would have them fired . ”
There are lies and there are Bill O’Reilly lies .
If the Ailes firing comment were true , today there would be no Fox News commentators .
It ’s does n’t take much research to find if anyone on Fox News has ever lied … just watch the Factor and Bill .

In March of 2000 , Katie Hong , a Korean - American woman who worked for the Washington state government , wrote an article for the Seattle Post - Intelligencer about Senator John McCain ’s remark to reporters on his campaign bus .
He said , “ I hated the gooks .
I will hate them as long as I live . ”
Although he attempted to explain he was referring specifically to his Vietnamese prison guards while he was a POW – his habitual justification for just about everything he does or says – he refused to apologize for his use of a racially offensive epithet generally regarded as applicable to anyone of Asian background .
Ms. Hong was not only hurt by his comment , having committed to serving her country as a place where equal opportunity and justice for everyone regardless of their skin color could become reality , she was disturbed by how little reaction his remark generated from the media .
It is eight years later , and McCain ’s second run at the White House .
In that time , he ’s dropped numerous F - bombs , called his wife the C- word , and used racially charged language in his campaign to refer to his opponent .
There is no reason to believe that his attitude toward “ gooks ” has changed all that much , either .
McCain ’s unmanageable irritability and use of inappropriate and offensive language has generated serious questions “ whether he has the temperament , and the political approach and skills , we want in the next president of the United States . ”
But a deeper and far more troubling uncertainty concerns me .
This particular McCain Macaca
Moment is not excusable just because he was a POW , and it ’s disconcerting that McCain himself is incapable of seeing it , saying , “ Do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like that ?
No , I do n’t . ”
But far more importantly , this is indicative of a dangerous and intransigent racism that not only offends a large percentage of American citizens – and not all of them need be Asian to be offended – it has no place in a presidency that may well be called upon to negotiate with the aforementioned “ gooks ” , some of whom have nuclear weapons and others who own a good deal of our national debt .
To “ hate the gooks ” is bad enough , but to declare “ I will hate them as long as I live ” demonstrates a pig - headed obstinacy that is antithetical to anyone aspiring to hold the most influential and powerful office in the country , if not the world .
But just how many more McCain Macaca Moments is it going to take ?

These are some frequently asked questions , and some frequently given answers to go along :
Q : Can I ask you a question ?
A : Yes .
Q : So , where is The Hotel Café ?
A : 1623 1/2 N. Cahuenga Blvd .
In Hollywood .
1/2 a block south of Hollywood Blvd on the West side of the street .
Q : How many stages do you have going at once ?
A : Two !
The Main Stage & Second Stage .
Q : How big is Hotel Cafe
A : The Main Stage has a capacity of ~200 .
Second Stage ~85 .
Q : What time do you open ?
A : 630 pm most nights .
Check calendar .
Q : Is The Hotel Café still an all ages venue ?
A : No .
We are now 21 +.
Q : Since you 're not an all ages venue anymore , should i call or email to ask if the show is all ages ?
A : No .
Q : But I have a friend / cousin / brother / niece / girl that babysits for me / grandfather / doula / merch seller that will be 21 in two weeks .
A : Really you have a doula that is under 21 ?
Q : Yes .
A : That seems a bit risky , would n't you want a doula to be somewhat experienced in child birthing ?
Q : Are we really discussing your opinion of the age limitations for a doula ?
A : You brought it up ...
Q : Can I bring in my newborn baby ?
A : No .
Q : Why ?
A : Do I seriously need to answer that ?
Q : Can I bring in a child of any age ?

A : Because we believe a live performance has value .
Not charging an audience to see said live performance takes away that value .
In time , music fans will come to expect live shows , much like recorded music nowadays , to be free .
Especially in smaller venues where many , now stadium sized acts , get their starts .
Really a lose lose for everyone in the long run .
We also believe that paying less than the cost of parking your car for an entire night of great music is a fair trade .

A : No .
Q : If I send you a package , can i use Fed Ex or UPS ?
A : No .
Q : Regular mail ?
A : Yes .

Political campaigns in the United States are notorious for inspiring dirty tricks and nasty tactics .
Now , in the most tech - attuned presidential race to date , the dark art of misleading voters is growing even more malignant than it was in the past .
The Internet adds powerful ammunition to the election scammer 's arsenal -- and odds are , some of these nasty virtual shots have already been fired your way .
Web of Lies
Election deception is nothing new .
For decades , underhanded political operatives have spread lies to impressionable voters -- disseminating disinformation about everything from changes in election dates to canceled caucuses .
The difference now is that the falsifications are easier than ever to spread .

Part 1 : Five Nastiest Methods to Persuade Voters Not to Vote
Our dirty dozen tricks start with five deceptive ways that political schemers are manipulating the Web to discourage would - be voters from voting .
1. Inbox Infestation
One of the Internet 's oldest tricks has acquired a new political spin .
Scammers send mass e-mailings that appear to come from legitimate addresses -- often ones belonging to campaign or election officials .
The problem ?
The messages contain inaccurate information .
This ploy was used against Mitt Romney during the presidential primaries , and voter rights advocates fear that it could resurface as a way to steer citizens away from the polls .
" Some of the things we 've seen in the primary and caucus processes indicate that deceptive attacks have happened , and that certainly similar types of attacks may be attempted for the general election , " says Lillie Coney , associate director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) .
2. Web Site Wiles
Some scammers have adopted the strategy of orchestrating Web site - based attacks .
These may take the form of actual hacks -- remember the Obama - Clinton redirect exploit back in April ?-- but more commonly they involve creating an independent site whose URL suggests affiliation with a candidate or organization but whose content dishonestly promotes a hostile agenda .
" People get domain names that sound like they could be the official campaign names , and then have on there links to all sorts of misinformation and criticism of the candidate , " Wang says .
" The potential is there ... that someone could do the same thing with respect to a secretary of state Web site or the Web site of a voting rights organization . "
3. Phony Phoning
Perhaps the fastest growing form of Web deception is in the use of voice - over - Internet protocol ( VoIP ) technology .
Much as their predecessors did in the phone - bank campaigns of yesteryear , tricksters call unsuspecting voters -- this time via the Internet -- to try to dissuade them from casting ballots .
Unfortunately , VoIP makes these efforts easier , cheaper , and less traceable than ever .
" You can do it in a matter of minutes , " Coney says .
" The per -call cost is so low that it 's minuscule compared to a typical telephone banking service . "
4. Texting Tricks
Mobile text messaging has made enormous headway as a campaign tool in this 21st century race , but hot on the heels of the benefits come the abuses .
Take , for example , Senator Barack Obama 's plan to announce his VP pick via text .
It did n't take long for fake revelations to reach the masses -- and thanks to the slew of free Web - based texting tools available , it probably did n't take much time or money , either .
The same approach could reappear with a message calculated to cause polling - day confusion .
5. Social Network Stunts
Voters , particularly younger ones , spend lots of time on social networks , and the candidates know it -- as do the scammers .
Observers have already reported signs of misuse , ranging from fake profiles to mass postings of erroneous information , and they are watching for more as November 4 draws near .
How much money is there in the economy to borrow ?
Well , if you do n't have foreigners lending you large amounts of money , and you do n't have central banks creating large amounts of money , then the amount of money available to be borrowed each year is roughly equal to the amount of money saved .
Take a gander at that graph .
The green line is personal savings .
The Bureau of Economic Analysis calculates that .
It 's just income minus spending -- the obvious way of figuring saving .
The red line is debt .
The Federal Reserve calculates that value .
The value on the graph is the change from the previous year -- that is , it shows each year 's new debt , just like the green line shows each year 's saving .
Both values are adjusted for inflation -- the graph is in billions of ( year 2000 ) dollars .
Everything looks fine from the 1950s right up until the late 1990s .
New borrowing goes up during expansions and drops during recessions .
( Sometimes it even drops below zero in a recession -- people are paying off old debt faster than they 're taking on new debt . )
Saving rises a bit during the early 1980s , when interest rates reached generational highs , then declines pretty steadily as interest rates fell .
Then , starting in about 1998 , borrowing just goes through the roof .
How did that happen ?
It was largely due to two things :
China and rich oil - producing countries were making huge profits from our purchases , leaving them with lots of dollars .
One thing they did with those dollars was lend them to us .
Banks lobbied for and got permission to lend much more money for each dollar deposited .
Instead of lending out around $ 10 for each dollar deposited , they could lend out $ 30 or $ 40 .
And , using houses as collateral , they did just that .
Of course , none of this is news .
People could have ( and did ) produce the same graph last year or the year before or the year before that -- and when they did , they saw the same thing we see .
So , why is it now that things have come to pieces ?
Starting back in about 2005 , the American consumer reached the point that they could no longer service ever - increasing amounts of debt .
That led to the housing bubble popping .
The result is what you can see in the last datapoint on the graph -- less new borrowing in 2007 .
All the news just lately has been about how the banks have been unwilling to lend .
Just as important , I think , is that consumers are unable to borrow -- the ones who would be willing to take on more debt simply would n't be able to make the payments .
The real , long - term solution is going to have to be to get borrowing back under saving .
That , though , would mean a huge decline in spending .
Just the little drop in new borrowing that you can see on the graph is sending us into a recession .
The central bank and the Treasury are terrified about what letting borrowing drop all the way down to our current level of saving would mean .
So , since the consumer is all borrowed up , they 're trying to have government borrowing replace consumer borrowing .
Because of their fear , the Treasury has n't done one obvious thing that 's necessary to get the economy back on sound footing -- it has n't made it more attractive for savers to save .
They 're afraid that more saving would mean less spending , resulting in an even worse recession .
And yet , longer term , it 's that saving that will support future borrowing .
In the meantime , we 've dodged one bullet .
Those folks who looked at versions of this graph from past years and got worried mostly figured that the crisis would come when China and the rich oil - producing nations either decided that they were n't comfortable loaning us so much money , or simply decided to spend more of the money on domestic consumption .
Instead , the crisis has had the perverse effect of bringing dollars flying back to the US all the faster -- brought by people who figure that US Treasury securities are the safest way to hold dollars .
That means that the Treasury has been able to borrow the hundreds of billions of dollars used for the bailout so far .
But that 's not the same thing as making sure that there 's domestic savings to support domestic borrowing .
Quite the reverse .
At least a dozen people asked me to comment on the New York Times article So When Will Banks Give Loans ?
Most seem to believe the bank bailout package is part of some complicated scheme by the treasury and Fed to give banks taxpayer money explicitly for takeovers .
Indeed that is the very essence of the tale the New York Times is spreading .
The Times article is a bit disjointed , so I rearranged paragraphs slightly for ease in understanding .
My insertions are in braces .
From the New York Times ....
It was Oct. 17 , just four days after JPMorgan Chase ’s chief executive , Jamie Dimon , agreed to take a $ 25 billion capital injection courtesy of the United States government , when a JPMorgan employee asked [ on a conference call ]
“ Chase recently received $ 25 billion in federal funding .
What effect will that have on the business side and will it change our strategic lending policy ? ”
[ Dimon Responded ]
“ What we do think it will help us do is perhaps be a little bit more active on the acquisition side or opportunistic side for some banks who are still struggling .
And I would not assume that we are done on the acquisition side just because of the Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns mergers .
I think there are going to be some great opportunities for us to grow in this environment , and I think we have an opportunity to use that $ 25 billion in that way and obviously depending on whether recession turns into depression or what happens in the future , you know , we have that as a backstop . ”
Read that answer as many times as you want — you are not going to find a single word in there about making loans to help the American economy .
On the contrary : at another point in the conference call , the same executive explained that “ loan dollars are down significantly . ”
He added , “ We would think that loan volume will continue to go down as we continue to tighten credit to fully reflect the high cost of pricing on the loan side . ”
In other words JPMorgan has no intention of turning on the lending spigot .
It is starting to appear as if one of Treasury ’s key rationales for the recapitalization program — namely , that it will cause banks to start lending again — is a fig leaf , Treasury ’s version of the weapons of mass destruction .
In fact , Treasury wants banks to acquire each other and is using its power to inject capital to force a new and wrenching round of bank consolidation .
As Mark Landler reported in The New York Times earlier this week , “ the government wants not only to stabilize the industry , but also to reshape it . ”
Now they tell us .
Indeed , Mr. Landler ’s story noted that Treasury would even funnel some of the bailout money to help banks buy other banks .
And , in an almost unnoticed move , it recently put in place a new tax break , worth billions to the banking industry , that has only one purpose : to encourage bank mergers .
As a tax expert , Robert Willens , put it : “ It could n’t be clearer if they had taken out an ad . ”
There Is No Lending Conspiracy
The government stepping in to provide cheap financing to GE is not doing anyone any good .
Paulson wants banks to lend , and by doing so is artificially driving down short term rates .
Why should GE get short term financing from banks , when it can get a better deal ( at taxpayer expense ) from the government ?
Fed Becomes Lender Of Only Resort
Rising unemployment
Rising credit card defaults
Rising foreclosures
Rising bankruptcies
Massive overcapacity
The TAF , PDCF , TSLF , CPFF , MMIFF , ABCPMMMFLF
Terms of the Bailout
Could That Be The Treasury Game Plan All Along ?
New York Times Theory
Paulson asked for taxpayer bailout money explicitly to get banks to merge .
To cover up his tracks , Paulson changed his mind three times on how to spend that money .
To guarantee the merger outcome , Paulson called all the big banks in a room , forced them to take loans at a rate that would ensure they would not want to lend it , but instead would want to use it in mergers .
Prior to the above three points , the Fed embarked on a series of lending facilities cleverly disguised to make it undesirable for banks to lend to each other or for anything else , while purporting to do the opposite .
My Theory

Posted on by Phemone
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama 's grandmother died of cancer , he said in a statement on Monday , a little more than a week after Obama interrupted the White House race to say goodbye to her in Hawaii .
" It is with great sadness that we announce that our grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , has died peacefully after a battle with cancer , " Obama said in a joint statement with his sister , Maya Soetoro - Ng .
" She was the cornerstone of our family , and a woman of extraordinary accomplishment , strength , and humility . "
Dunham helped raise Obama from the age of 10 while his mother was working in Indonesia , and Obama took an emotional 22 - hour trip to Hawaii to visit her on October 23 and 24 .

It would be ridiculous if anyone were to cast a sympathy vote for Obama because of this .

Create your own live network maps from the network statistics you already have
Weathermap is an open source network visualisation tool , to take data you already have and show you an overview of your network activity in map form .
Data is collected via plugins .
Plugins are supplied for RRDtool , MRTG ( RRD and old log - format ) , tab - delimited text files , SNMP , fping , external scripts , and Cacti-specific data .
The RRDtool plugin means you have access to data from a large range of open source monitoring tools , including Cacti , Cricket , Zenoss , MRTG , Routers2 , Munin , and many more .
Other sources are supported via plugins or external scripts .
It also includes detailed documentation , and an interactive editor to make creating your own maps as painless as possible .
There is strong Cacti integration in particular , leveraging the Cacti plugin architecture to provide a management user interface , and access control for maps using Cacti ’s existing user database .
Additional datasource plugins allow efficient access to data from Cacti ’s poller directly , and data from other Cacti plugins like THold and DSStats .
Weathermap is widely used by national and international ISPs , tier - 1 carriers , internet exchanges , telcos , national academic networks , many Fortune 500 companies in finance , automotive , medical / pharma and other sectors , state and national government departments , schools and universities , and even a church .
Download latest version
This version does not support Cacti 1.x – see this post : End of Cacti 1.x plans
Here is version 0.98a ( requires PHP 4.3.x + PHP ’s gd module ) and here ’s the current manual ( this is also in the download , so you have a local copy ) .
Earlier releases are also available on github .
Development Versions
The development version ( master branch ) on github is currently halfway through a very significant refactoring / rewrite .
I do n’t recommend it for production use !
However , there is also a database - refactor branch on github , which is much more likely to be functional if you wanted to follow development .
Support
For Cacti users , the best place for a quick question or howto is the Weathermap board on the Cacti forums .
For everyone else , and for specific bug reports , there ’s the Github Issues system .
This makes it easier to track those issues , and whether they are resolved .
For old - school internet folks there ’s still a ( very low traffic ) mailing list , now hosted on Google Groups .
Lastly , you could e-mail me .
Generally , I ’d rather you used a public forum , so other people might also benefit from the work involved in solving the problem .
If your question can be rewritten as either “ I did n’t read the manual and I want you to explain this ” , or “ I did n’t read the manual and I want you to do this for me ” , then we can talk about rates to do that – I have a day job , so it ’s not that often that I do this .
And absolutely last :
A few people have asked about donating money , or otherwise saying thanks .
If you ’d like to do that , there ’s my Amazon UK wishlist , a hardly ever updated Amazon US wishlist or cold hard cash via Paypal or Bitcoin ( ask me ) .
I know a lot of companies do n’t have any way to do this ( “ pay for free things ? ? ” ) – if you happen to have nice swag ( stickers , shirts , toys ) and a marketing list , I like nice marketing swag !
Typically any money is used for weathermap - related expenses , such as web - hosting , the domain name , development tools or other related things – over the years , Weathermap has ‘ cost ’ perhaps $ 1000 in expenses , and thousands of hours in coding and support time .

This floating fractal ( top , left ) is formed 90 seconds after a drop of instant coffee falls into a cup of milk .
Coffee is heavier than milk and the battle between gravity and surface tension plays out at the boundary between the two liquids .
The coffee falls vertically through the milk ( bottom , left , with water replacing milk for ease of viewing ) , and the fractal pattern emerges .
The pattern constantly shifts as parts of it are sucked into the milk , producing a fractal structure with the same dimension as a Sierpi´nski carpet — formed when a square is cut into nine identical squares ; the central square is removed ; and the procedure is repeated with the remaining eight squares and so on infinitely .
Michiko Shimokawa and Shonosuke Ohta , fluid scientists at Kyushu University in Fukuoka City , Japan , say that it is the first time this kind of fractal has been shown experimentally ( http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0809.2458), and they managed to recreate the process using a magnetic liquid instead of coffee ( far right ) .

Tucked in an out of the way spot on the Washington Post ’s website , Rosalind Helderman writes about Republican Congressional candidate Peter James , who believes the banker bailout currently wending its way through Congress is illegal and unconstitutional .
James is challenging Democrat Donna F. Edwards in Maryland ’s 4th Congressional District .
He not only believes the bailout scam is unconstitutional , he also stands behind a lawsuit challenging the as of yet passed $ 700 billion ( more likely to be ultimately in the trillions ) bailout plan , more accurately described as welfare socialism for the financial class .
Republican Congressional candidate Peter James talks about how the government and the Federal Reserve violate the Constitution .
James agreed to work with We the People to serve papers in a lawsuit challenging the bailout .
We the People is a grassroots constitutional activism organization determined “ to restore Constitutional Order and the reclaim the fundamental Liberties which have been seized by those that would deprive us our Freedom , ” according to their website .
On September 18 , WTP chairman and constitutional activist Robert Schulz filed a federal lawsuit in United States District Court in Albany seeking to halt the execution of the emergency bailout of American International Group , Inc. by the United States Government and the Federal Reserve .
“ The lawsuit asserts that the commitment of public funds and credit for the direct benefit of privately owned AIG is an ultra vires action by the United States Government and Federal Reserve , i.e. , beyond the limited legal authority granted by the Constitution , ” explains the WTP website .
“ The lawsuit asks for a ‘ show cause ’ hearing demanding that the Government produce evidence of its legal authority to commit public funds for such a purpose , as well as emergency and permanent injunctions halting the bailout transaction . ”
Defendants in the lawsuit include the Federal Reserve System , Fed Chairman Ben Bernake , the U.S. Treasury , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson Jr. and the United States Government .
“ Through a long - standing policy of disinformation and collusion with the Federal Reserve and Wall Street financial elite , the United States Federal Government has denied public access to information about the secretive operations of the privately owned and operated Federal Reserve and its monopoly control of America ’s money system , ” states a WTP press release .
Since 2002 , WTP has tried unsuccessfully to get the government to respond to a number of First Amendment Petitions for Redress of violations of the Constitution , specifically the Fed ’s violation of the money clauses of the Constitution .
Ron Paul recently confronted Fed boss Bernanke about these violations , indicating that the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to coin money and regulate the value of the currency and thus fractional reserve banking and the Fed are unconstitutional .
In response , Bernanke cited the Federal Reserve Act , in essence stating Congress long ago surrendered its constitutional authority to the bankers .
“ This monopoly control of our currency by a private banking cartel has resulted in increasing distortion , volatility and cyclical ( boom and bust ) economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad , ” WTP continues .
“ America ’s fiat currency ( produced from thin air ) is manipulated by the Federal Reserve for the benefit of its owners , major Wall Street financial institutions and the Federal Government and is not unaccountable to the taxpayers .
These abuses of the Constitution have taken our financial system to edge of the abyss .
The chickens have come home to roost . ”
Indeed , the chickens have come home to roost , as even the corporate media now admits the financial system is at the edge of the abyss .
However , Peter James ’ participation in the WTP lawsuit and the lawsuit itself have received virtually zero mention in the corporate media .
Instead , the corporate media insists Paulson ’s banker bailout plan or a slight variation of it are our only options .
Passing a bill that gives the bankers a blank check will certainly exacerbate the situation and push the country into a financial black hole , a disaster long sought by the bankers .

Advertisement Increasing numbers of teenagers are starting to dabble in hi-tech crime , say experts .
Computer security professionals say many net forums are populated by teenagers swapping credit card numbers , phishing kits and hacking tips .
The poor technical skills of many young hackers means they are very likely to get caught and arrested , they say .
Youth workers added that any teenager getting a criminal record would be putting their future at risk .
Slippery slope " I see kids of 11 and 12 sharing credit card details and asking for hacks , " said Chris Boyd , director of malware research at FaceTime Security .
Many teenagers got into low level crime by looking for exploits and cracks for their favourite computer games .
Communities and forums spring up where people start to swap malicious programs , knowledge and sometimes stolen data .
For a kid , getting a criminal record is the worst possible move
Graham Robb , Youth Justice Board
Some also look for exploits and virus code that can be run against the social networking sites popular with many young people .
Some then try to peddle or use the details or accounts they net in this way .
Mr Boyd said he spent a lot of time tracking down the creators of many of the nuisance programs written to exploit users of social networking sites and the culprit was often a teenager .
From such virus and nuisance programs , he said , many progress to outright criminal practices such as using phishing kits to create and run their own scams .
" Some are quite crude , some are clever and some are stupid , " he said .
The teenagers ' attempts to make money from their life of cyber crime usually came unstuck because of their poor technical skills .
" They do not even know enough to get a simple phishing or attack tool right , " said Kevin Hogan , a senior manager Symantec Security Response .
" We have seen phishing sites that have broken images because the link , rather than reference the original webpage , is referencing a file on the C : drive that is not there , " he said .
Symantec researchers have collected many examples of teenagers who have managed to cripple their own PCs by infecting them with viruses they have written .
Video choice Chris Boyd from FaceTime said many of the young criminal hackers were undermined by their desire to win recognition for their exploits .
Many teenage hackers publicise their exploits on YouTube " They are obsessed with making videos of what they are doing , " he said .
Many post videos of what they have done to sites such as YouTube and sign on with the same alias used to hack a site , run a phishing attack or write a web exploit .
Many share photos or other details of their life on other sites making it easy for computer security experts to track them down and get them shut down .
Mr Boyd 's action to shut down one wannabe hacker , using the name YoGangsta50 , was so comprehensive that it wrung a pledge from the teenager in question to never to get involved in petty hi-tech crime again .
Mathew Bevan , a reformed hacker who was arrested as a teenager and then acquitted for his online exploits , said it was no surprise that young people were indulging in online crime .
" It 's about the thrill and power to prove they are somebody , " he said .
That also explains why they stuck with an alias or online identity even though it was compromised , he added .
" The aim of what they are doing is to get the fame within their peer group , " he said .
" They spend months or years developing who they are and their status .
They do not want to give that up freely . "
Graham Robb , a board member of the Youth Justice Board , said teenagers needed to appreciate the risks they took by falling into hi-tech crime .
" If they get a criminal record it stays with them , " he said .
" A Criminal Record Bureau check will throw that up and it could prevent access to jobs . "
Anyone arrested and charged for the most serious crimes would carry their criminal record with them throughout their life .
Also , he added , young people needed to appreciate the impact of actions carried out via the net and a computer .
" Are they going to be able to live with the fact that they caused harm to other people ? " he said .
" They do not think there is someone losing their money or their savings from what they are doing .
" For a kid , getting a criminal record is the worst possible move . "

MUMBAI : In continuation of the last four day 's fall , gold prices lost another 4 per cent on Friday .
COMEX December futures was near $ 685 an ounce .
On MCX , December futures was closer to Rs 11,400 per 10 gm , down nearly Rs 300 from Thursday .��
� The decline is largely attributable to the extended strength in the dollar while liquidity pressure persists .
As traders utilize their profits from positions in gold against the falling global equity markets , the yellow metal is seeing a move closer to strong supports , ��� said Harish Gallipeli , research head , Karvy Comtrade .
The dollar index ��� a measure of dollar 's strength against a basket of major commodities like euro , sterling ��� is trading near two - year highs past 86.65 .
The index has gained over 14 per cent from its September low of 75.89 .
The index is holding well after the release of UK third - quarter GDP that showed the economy had contracted by 0.5 per cent .
Eurozone and Germany manufacturing indexes also contracted significantly , putting some pressure on the local currency .
International prices , in this scenario , can correct further to $ 675 , corresponding to a move towards Rs 11,200 for domestic prices .��
� While the underlying bullish picture has not altered for the yellow metal considering the uncertainty in the global financial markets , the precious metal could extend its decline further , ��� added Gallipeli .
According to Debjyoti Chatterjee , AVP - research , Mape Admisi Commodities , ���As important supports are tested in international markets , domestic demand will also play a key role for prices to consolidate in Rs 11,250 - 11 , 800 range .�� �

One of the strange things about our world is that people who take positions that are inconsistent and arbitrary are considered normal while people who act according to logical principles are considered extremists .
Were it the other way around , there 'd be no reason for surprise , no tension .
Some people always do and believe weird things .
Strangeness in individuals is easily ignored and does n't cause much trouble .
When these odd ticks and delusions are institutionalized in the state , it 's a different story .
For those predisposed to thinking carefully , the logic of liberty is inescapable .
From the principle of self - ownership springs forth a self - consistent system of ethics , one that most people intuitively understand .
In practice , liberty seems to have a short life .
Wherever liberty has once flourished , it has evolved into soft totalitarianism .
Iceland , England , and America quickly come to mind .
Many libertarians believe the problem is with education .
They suppose that if more people learned the logic , a libertarian society would inevitably emerge .
I disagree .
The conditions that give rise to liberty are simple : begin with a low population density of people who demand to be left alone .
No theory required .
America was a one - chance - only experiment in that light .
Here , you had self - selected misfits from Europe who did n't trust authority and did n't accept anyone 's fooling around in their business .
Incidentally , they were mostly dirt farmers who did n't produce enough to support a big government , so they had a small one instead .
It worked for a while , but sure enough , the people had big families , so did their kids , and in a few generations the conditions for liberty were lost .
The country did n't have a low population density anymore , nor did it have the same independent go - it - alone streak .
It was bound to happen just as a reversion to the mean .
Being a libertarian is n't so much a choice as it is a low - rate inborn personality type .
The things that drive independent people ' logic , consistency , rationality , and so on 'are n't the building blocks to casual friendships .
Practically , they are the munitions for carrying out intellectual violence .
When I talk with new acquaintances about liberty , maybe one in 20 sees the light .
Unsurprisingly , they tend to be way brighter than average , oftentimes engineers , but they show up in other lines of work , too .
They draw their own conclusions .
They say what they think , and they do n't obsess over other people 's feelings .
They 're exposed to the same mainstream as everyone else , but the ideas do n't root .
I 've asked like - minded people about this and we see similar things .
Maybe one in ten , maybe one in 50 , but probably one in 20 gets why liberty works .
Whatever the number , it 's obvious that we are statistically in the noise .
I muse over this because this government is beyond useless , and with regard to supporting liberty , the supermajority of people living here are too .
There 's no sign that 's going to change .
Given the choice of freedom or social safety nets , it 's clear what most people want .
The people want to feel charitable , so they expect the state to be charitable for them .
Of course , a lot of people want to feel like winners without putting forth any effort , so they closely follow ' their ' team on Sunday afternoons .
There 's not much difference between the two , but there are occasionally differences between perception and reality .
Liberty requires mutual respect of a few ideas .
It 's unusual to hear people support violation of property rights directly , but emotion , feelings , intuition , and often religion create linguistic loopholes that circumvent the inhibitions they may have had , were they thinking clearly .
Liberty can't long survive among people who cannot obey a few simple principles that they claim to agree with .
If the libertarian view can be supported only by a few percent of the people among a population , then there is n't reason to expect that society at large will come to its senses .
The loss of freedom always begins with someone sticking their nose where it does n't belong and that gets easier the closer people live together .
Unlike those who believe our salvation is in ever - higher technology and unending increases in the division of labor , it 's clear that states have been very effective at diverting the technologically - derived stream of wealth and converting it into the means for greater control .
I , for one , can easily imagine scenarios where I would accept lower consumption in return for greater liberty .
We are living in interesting economic times , and who knows , perhaps an opportunity to live free will come disguised as a full - blown societal calamity .
We can always hope .
Capitalizing on a crisis requires preparation .
If you are serious about experiencing freedom in your lifetime , now would be a good time to think about your plan for action .

Dolphins are popular attractions in Japan , even though the country has come under fire abroad over the annual tradition of slaughtering thousands of dolphins for meat in the western town of Taiji .
I ’ve converted over my Retlang spider example over to IronPython in order to get a feel for the differences .
Here ’s some notes :
Python list comprehensions can do the same as LINQ for simple cases , but LINQ is much more powerful , and it supports deferred execution , while list comprehensions are evaluated greedily .
UPDATE : Thanks to Mark for pointing out that generators support deferred execution .
There ’s still no syntax for grouping or ordering , but these are relatively rare cases .

Every description of the python syntax I ever see emphasizes the fact you do n’t need to put in braces .
Pity they do n’t spend more time telling you that you have to put in colons , that would actually be useful knowledge .
This really bit me when I learnt boo , which is syntactically very similar .
IronPython 1.0 targets CPython 2.4 .
This sounds fine until you realize that this was released in 2004 .
A fair bit has happened since then , not limited to the introduction of an inline if syntax .
While we ’re on the subject , the inline if ( defaultValue if condition else exceptionValue ) is actually quite cool .
The fairly lax approach to types means I do n’t need to call .
Cast < Match > anymore .
Tabs are the devil as far as indents in Boo and Python are concerned .
I highly recommend using something that shows tabs explicitly , and then eliminating the lot .
Instance methods that explicitly take self feels awkward to me .
Static Methods that require an incantation such as “ ToAbsolute Url = staticmethod ( ToAbsoluteUrl ) ” also feels pretty awkward .
UPDATE : I ’ve now learnt about decorators , thanks to Ken. @staticmethod is relatively readable .
: I ’ve now learnt about decorators , thanks to Ken. @staticmethod is relatively readable .
The casting to delegate is n’t quite as slick as it is in C#. Passing in “ spiderTracker .
FoundUrl ” instead of “ lambda url : spiderTracker . FoundUrl(url ) ” results in an extremely unhelpful runtime error .
The lambda syntax is pretty elegant , but so is C #3’s .
Indeed , C #3 seems to have the edge .
Python ’s regular expressions are powerful , but not quite as good as .
NET’s .
In particular search does what you ’d expect match to do findall does n’t return matches .
Rather , it returns the value of the first group of the matches .
This is often actually what you wanted , but it ’s a bit peculiar .
The semantics of “ Matches ” in .NET are much easier to understand .
It did seem rather slow compared to the C# version .
There are , of course , way too many variables here to make a final judgement , but it was disappointing .
So , I ’m still waiting for my ESR moment .
Ca n’t say my program ran correctly the first time I ran it .
The code
A couple of notes if you ’re looking at this in detail :
You ’ll need to explicitly declare where the Retlang DLL is .
I ’ve inlined a couple of functions , since the lambda syntax seemed less work than the class method syntax .
It handles proxies better than the original version .
There ’s a minor bug fix from the previous version to encourage it to ignore hrefs in the HTML .
I ’m not intending to work this up into a working HTML parser , so there will definitely be other bugs in this space .

Mr. Abdullah , a shepherd , said that he had just returned from leading his sheep to pasture when Muhammad asked permission to play soccer with some friends in the lot across the road from the family ’s home .
About 15 minutes later , around 3 p.m. , Mr. Abdullah heard an explosion .
“ Their bodies were completely torn apart by the blast , ” Mr. Abdullah said .
His son , he surmised , must have been sitting on the ground waiting for the ball to be passed to him , because he found Muhammad seated .
An official at Kirkuk ’s morgue later said that Muhammad ’s head had been blown off .
That was just the latest tragedy to befall Mr. Abdullah ’s family , and it has left him wondering if there is such a thing as a safe place to live here .
He already had lost his two older sons as a result of the war , he said .
First , Muazzaz , 19 , was kidnapped and killed .
Then last month , Saad , 21 , was killed in a suicide bombing near the Kirkuk police academy , where he was a student .
“ Now I lost my little son just as I lost his two brothers , ” Mr. Abdullah said .
“ Today , I lost the last son .
I have no one left except my daughter . ”
Ahlan suffered abdominal injuries , but she is expected to survive .
Mr. Abdullah said that he had moved to Kirkuk in 1987 to flee the violence that the war between Iran and Iraq brought to his home city of Basra .
Last night at a dinner with Ivan Krstić and Itamar Shtull - Trauring , we were all lamenting that too many ( all ? ) software conferences focus specifically on positive results .
This is what you want , of course , if you treat a conference as purely a marketing venue .
However , most learning takes place based on something that someone didand then needed to correct , not something that they did right .
All of the great software developers I know have at least onestory of how a project they were working on was a complete disaster .
Often these projects are shielded from the public eye , since nobody wants to talk about failure .
So , how do we make a public discussion of these ideas socially acceptable ?
Thus , an idea was born : FAILcon .
The idea is simple : submitted talks and papers must be related to projects which failed in an interesting way .
The larger the better , of course — the bigger they are , the harder they fail — but anything that failed in an interesting way would be a valid subject for discussion .
I 'm writing about it so that it wo n't be forgotten , because I think it 's a great idea .
But I doubt that any of us are going to organize a conference any time soon .
So please , steal this idea .
Does anyone out there with conference - organizing skills want to get something together based around the common theme of failure ?
However , in the interview Mr Rouillan said : " I have no right to talk about that .
But the fact that I do n't talk about it is a response .
For it is obvious that , if I spat on everything we have done , I would be able to talk . "
Last week , Tom Ridge , the former Pennsylvania governor , said that Senator John McCain might now be on the verge of winning Pennsylvania  the mainly Democratic state where Mr. McCain is investing considerable time and energy in these final days of his presidential campaign  had he chosen Mr. Ridge as his running mate .
Senator Lindsey Graham , the senator from South Carolina and one of Mr. McCain ’s closest friends and advisers , has in recent days been quite direct in saying that he counseled Mr. McCain to choose Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut for the second spot .
Mr. Lieberman , he said , would have been a breakthrough choice , winning Mr. McCain plaudits and support from independent voters who are weary of partisanship .
Mr. McCain may still win the election .
Still , anticipating that he will fall short , the pre-postmortems have already begun , both inside and outside his campaign headquarters .
And without question , the biggest one is whether he would have been in a better position today had he not chosen Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running - mate .
The answer , in the view of many Republicans and Democrats , is almost certainly yes .
In choosing Ms. Palin , Mr. McCain and his advisers set aside the traditional criteria for picking a running - mate  such as choosing someone who could deliver a battleground state  in favor of selecting someone who could upend the story line of the campaign .
The idea was that Mr. McCain could benefit on several fronts :
¶ Ms. Palin ’s reformer credentials would buttress his own , and strengthen his ability to run against Washington , which potentially would appeal to moderate and independent voters .

Take your health and beauty to the next level with superfoods !
[ social_buttons ]
From dietitians to raw food gurus , superfoods have been promoted as the fountain of health and youth .
While I ca n’t vouch for the fountain of health and youth claim , I have experienced the extra vitality that comes from eating these nutrient - dense foods .
There is no formal definition for the term superfoods , but they are generally described as being especially nutritious , with bio-active compounds and special health benefits not available from other foods .
Superfoods are the foods with high levels of phytonutrients and antioxidants , and they possess a superior nutritional profile .
Adding some of these foods into your diet is one more way to support your body ’s natural health and beauty .
Ten Superfoods for Health and Beauty
Goji Berries :
Also known as wolfberries , goji berries contain all 8 essential amino acids , are packed with vitamin C , trace minerals , and are revered in Asia as a powerful healing food .
They are available dried ( they look like red raisins ) , and taste similar to a cranberry / cherry mix .
Goji berries have been called one of the most nutrient rich fruits on earth .
Cacao Nibs : Nibs are pieces of cacao beans , pictured above , the source of cocoa powder , and contain large amounts of magnesium , as well as having the highest antioxidant concentration of any food .
Cacao nibs are unsweetened , somewhat unusual in taste and can be found in better health food stores .
Spirulina : A blue - green algae prized by the Aztec , spirulina is 60 % protein in a highly digestible form .
It is a great source of B12 , iron , beta - carotene , and GLA ( gamma - linoleic acid ) , and lutein .
It boosts energy levels and supports the immune system .
Available as a powder or capsule , spirulina is a great addition to a smoothie or sprinkled on a salad .
Chlorella :
This single - celled algae is packed with chlorophyll , enzymes , and anti-oxidants .
Chlorophyll is high in protein and calcium and is a potent detoxifier .
The most recommended form of chlorella is “ broken - cell ” , which increases the availability of the nutrients , and is available in tablets , capsules , or powder .
For an in - depth look at both spirulina and chlorella , read Superfoods for Optimum Health ( free online ) .
Coconut Oil :
The oil ( or butter ) of coconuts is not the same as cocoa butter ( from cacao ) .
Coconut oil is a saturated fat with anti-microbial and anti-fungal properties , and can be used just like butter in recipes .
Coconut stimulates the thyroid and helps to lower cholesterol .
It is a superb bodycare moisturizer .
Try using it for lotion , lip balm , and a pre-wash conditioner for your hair .
Hemp Seeds :
These protein - packed seeds possess a great essential fatty acid profile , and are now found in everything from energy bars to hempmilk .
Unfortunately , the US does not discriminate between hemp and marijuana , so growing it for food and fiber in this country is illegal .
It typically comes to us from Canada , and hulled hemp seeds and hemp oil can be found in most health food stores .
Kombucha Tea :
A cultured tea known to the ancient Chinese as the Immortal Health Elixir , kombucha can be grown at home from a mother , or “ scoby ” .
Kombucha is also available in bottled form in many flavors .
It is definitely an aquired taste , one that you either love or hate .
Miso : Miso is made from fermented soybeans , rice or barley , and is a live food rich in vitamins and minerals .
Add miso to soups or salad dressings , or use it to marinate vegetables .
Many variations of miso are sold , so try several to fnd the one you like .
Bee Pollen :
This should actually be known as flower pollen , but honeybees are the ones to gather it , so we call it bee pollen .
It is the male seed of flowers , and is known as a fertility food .
Eating local pollen every day is said help alleviate allergies , and the highly assimilable protein is both healing and energizing .
Blend into a smoothie or just eat a spoonful for a pick - me - up .
Mushrooms : Shiitake , reishi , and maitake are probably the most well known medicinal edible mushrooms , but many more are available through companies such as New Chapter .
Mycomedicinals is the name for mushroom compounds with healing properties .
For a superfood sauté , slice up fresh shiitake mushrooms and sweet peppers , cook with miso and shoyu sauce , and serve it with brown rice .
Add a new one to your diet every so often and find the superfoods that work for you .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) --
An engine fell off a Mexican government jet before it crashed , killing the second - highest official in the nation , the Cabinet member in charge of the investigation said Saturday .
Firefighters at the scene of the crash Tuesday night in Mexico City .
Officials also said they have ruled out the possibility that the crash was caused by a bomb .
" There is no trace of explosives on the plane wreckage or the [ crash ] site , " said Luis Tellez , Mexican secretary of communication and transportation .
Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino , former deputy attorney general Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos and six others onboard were killed in the crash .
At least five others on the ground died , and others were reported missing .
Officials said 40 people were injured .
Camilo Mourino and Santiago Vasconcelos had been instrumental in the war on drugs , leading to widespread speculation among Mexicans that drug lords orchestrated the crash .
But Mexican authorities have said there is no indication that foul play was involved .
The government Learjet 45 was traveling at 500 kmh ( 310 mph ) when it crashed in central Mexico City as it approached Benito Juarez International Airport .
Do n't Miss Toll of Mexico plane crash rises to 13
Gilberto Lopez Meyer , Mexico 's director of airports and auxiliary services , said the jet 's left engine fell off when the plane was traveling between 250 and 300 kmh ( 150 to 186 mph ) , according to Mexico 's state - run Notimex news agency .
An examination of the wreckage indicates that the engines were functioning at high speed , Lopez Meyer said .
Tallez said the day after the crash that the Learjet 45 did not explode in the air because when that happens , pieces of the airplane are scattered over a wide area .
But the wreckage in this instance was limited to a small area , he said .
Tellez also said Wednesday that the pilot did not report an emergency , Notimex said .
A recording released Wednesday of what Mexican officials said was dialogue between the pilot and the airport control tower did not appear to have an emergency call from the aircraft .
Officials have vowed to make all aspects of the investigation public .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon inspected the crash site Saturday , Notimex said .

Jan has corrected a misconception that I had here , where I assumed that PUT was create and POST was update .
Apparently this is not quite correct .
A PUT request will update / create a new document with a user supplied name , while a POST request will create a new document with a server generated name .
That narrows down my search for " create new document " code path again .
Here is the method in couch_httpd_db that handles a POST request on a document .
It parse the form , get the revision of the document , and then it calls to open_doc_revs , which we have n't explored so far .
I feel confident that I understand what this is doing , however :
I 'll not show the open_doc_revs_int , because it is too big , but it contains some references that so far I have n't encountered .
Specifically , couch_key_tree , which I do n't think that I seen before , and to get_full_doc_infos , which looks like this :
Oh , now we are on a more familiar territory .
Lookup performs a search on a binary tree , and we have gone over it in depth before .
However , we can now see that the we pass to it a fulldocinfo_by_id_tree ...
I do n't think we have explored how CouchDB make use of the btree , so let us head to the db structure and see what else we have there .
Here is what I know about this structure at the moment .
db_header container the data that is actually written to the file , while db is the in memory structure .
Not sure what write_version is all about , update_seq looks like the the internal sequence number for CouchDB .
I do n't think that I have even seen the concept of stream before , but it is there , and look like most stream implementations that I am already familiar with .
get_state on that returns a { Position , BytesRemaining} , since I do n't understand how this is used at the moment , I do n't understand why this is important .
fulldocsinfo_by_id_btree_state contains the root of the btree , and the same holds for docinfo_by_seq_btree_state , I assume that local_docs_btree_state is also the same .
purge_seq is a counter for the last purge ( physical delete ) , and it is used in conjunction with the views in order to ensure that there are no purged documents in the view .
purged_docs keeps track of the documents that were last purged .
db , the runtime structure , is considerably more interesting .
It took me a while to figure out where it is created , but I finally found the init_db function in couch_db_updater :
The first part is to open the summary_state stream , still not sure what this is about , though .
We then define a comparison function for use when opening the fulldocsinfo btree , and we pass several additional functions when we create the btree .
Reduce is usually used when we compact the tree , and to get information about the btree ( such as count of documents ) .
The join and split also prepare the data to be written to disk in a consistent fashion .
I do n't like the name join / split .
The internal names , assemble and extract seems to be much more accurate .
Finally , we get to the actual creation of the db structure itself .
An interesting thing to note is that only the update_pid is filled .
Since CouchDB implements the many readers / single writer , I assume that this is how we ensure the single reader , because only a single process ever handle writes to the DB .
I am assuming for now that main_pid is for readers , and compactor_pid if for compacting ( obviously ) .
I 'll track them next .
Well , that took some doing , the main_pid is set in the couch_db_updater : init ( the same function that calls the init_db function ) :
I had hard time tracking this because I could n't figure out what who was calling couch_db_updater : init ( and what is the MainPid ) .
Usually , in gen_server processes , there is a start_link function that you call , but in this case , there was n't .
Some digging revealed that the couch_db process is the one that actually call start_link on the couch_db_updater .
I wonder if this is a common pattern in erlang , because it sure did caught me by surprise .
So main_pid is the couch_db process , and update_pid is the couch_db_updater .
It actually goes a lot further than that .
couch_db_updater does n't actually have a public interface .
It looks like couch_db is the one that exposes the interface , and send synchronous messages to the couch_db_updater process :
That is the way in which CouchDB ensures that we have only a single write , I presume .
Compaction is handled in couch_db_updater as well , the implementation is interesting :
We create a new process and return before we finish compacting .
It is interesting because it is the first example of explicit concurrency that I saw .
Let us dig a bit better into start_copy_compact_int , which is pretty straight forward :
This just create a new file , init a database and call_compact_docs , finishing by notifying the updater that it finished compacting .
copy_compact_docs is interesting in itself :
We start by defining the EnumBySeqFun , which batches documents to write to disk until should_flush returns true .
should_flush is funny , it check memory thresholds and flush to disk whenever there is about 10 MB of data ready to be flushed .
The usage of foldl here is a good reason to go back and examine it in more details :
And fold is defined as :
So we have this stream_node , whatever that is , let us take an additional look .
We are already familiar with get_node ( ) , but adjust_dir and stream_kp_node and stream_kv_node are new .
The first is easy :
Let us explore stream_kv_node , which is likely to be easier than stream_kp_node .
This is slightly complex .
We start by defining the drop off point ( smaller / greater from the current key ) .
The important bit is in the last function , the call to our function and the recursion back into the function .
As a reminder , here is the function that we pass :
I hope that this make it clear how this works .
We simply stream all the items to the function , and it copies it .
Note that an important subtlety is that we have several btree over the same data ( we will touch down in a bit ) and in this case we are only copying the items that are greater than the update_seq in the current DB .
Still not sure what this update_seq is all about .
We will go all the way back to copy_compact_docs_int 's last line , where it notify the updater that it finished the current compaction .
This message arrive to this method :
This looks complex , but it really is n't .
It is simply opening the new database , and checking if the current update_seq equal to the latest in the new database .
If it is n't , we restart the process .
If it is , then we copy the local documents ( not sure why they get special treatment , and it looks like it is expected to have very few of them ) , move the files and move on with our lives .
Now , it looks like update_seq is updated whenever someone make a change to the database , but let us verify this , shall we ?
Looking at couch_db_updater : update_docs_int , we can see that the update_seq is updated for each new document that is modified ( see merge_rev_trees ) .
Okay , that was interesting .
But I still do n't know how we save a document to disk .
Let us go back to couch_db : update_docs , and see what is going on here .
This is pretty complex , so we will break it apart to discrete pieces .
We start by generating a new revision for the documents .
Note that in the case local revisions , we just increment the revision , if it is a standard document , we generate a random revision number .
I think that this is done in order to support farm wide revisions , so if I update document # 1 in server A and in server B , I get two different revisions , which would be detected as conflicts .
We extract all the new revisions , group all the documents by id and extract all the ids .
So far , so good .
Let us see the rest of the function :
We get the current existing documents , and then we merge the existing with the new bucket .
That requires some explanation .
The first function clause uses list comprehensions in order to ensure that if we could n't find a document in the DB , we did n't specify a previous version .
The second is more complex and require us to understand about key trees .
CouchDB defines them as :
Based on that and the dict : from_list arguments , we can deduct what the structure of a revision is .
It should be noted that it looks like there is an expectation that the number of revisions would n't be too big .
This make sense , CouchDB does keep previous versions , but it make no guarantees about their life spans .
Also , we should note that we have both revs and rev_tree , I am not quite sure why .
The last line in the zipwith function is prepare_doc_for_new_edit , which is called for each document , let us take a look at it .
This is an example of how condense functional code can get .
Let us see what it does :
Get the new revisions and all the previous revisions
If the previous revisions has a value , it perform a lookup based on the revision to the revision tree , to get the revision information .
( Which answers the question of why we need both revs and rev_tree .
revs is an ordered list of revision keys .
rev_tree is apparently the metadata ) .
Now , the LeafRevsDict contains only the most recent one , so failing to find it in the dictionary means that we trying to update a non current version , so we error .
I am not sure what a stub is , but the rest of it seems pretty simple .
The last part is interesting , however , we check that we are n't trying to create a new document with the same id as existing one ( although we allow it if that document is deleted ) .
After the call to zipwith ( ) , we have a call to doc_flush_binaries , which we totally ignored so far .
It flushes all the documents to disk , it is not really interesting , it is dealing with writing the attachments to disk .
I am not quite sure what is going on ( it is complex ) , mostly because I do n't follow to which file it is writing .
Or , to be rather more exact , I am not following how the attachment can be written to a different file , which is what the code seems to imply .
Anyway , the code there is pretty clear about what is going on , we append to the current file ( except if we write to a different file , again , not following that ) and update the in memory structure of the document to point to the range of data that each attachment contains .
Let us look at the last part of the couch_db: update_docs :
And is looks like we have hit the place where it is actually happening .
We call to the couch_db_updater in order to do the actual update , and we make be asked to retry ( this will require more study ) , in which case we do try .
Let us look at update_docs at the couch_db_updater .
Sigh , I can feel it in my waters , update_docs_int is going to be complex ... once more , we will try to divide and conquer .
We start by extracting variable from the Db , then we split the list based on whatever this is local or not .
NonRep documents ( local ) are not replicated , have only a single version and are expected to have very few of them .
I still do n't know what is the use case for those , however .
It looks like DocsList is a list of lists of docs , probably this is the buckets that we had to deal with earlier .
We finish the snipper by extracting the ids from the documents , what comes next ?
We lookup the existing documents , and then we merge them into a file info ( note that we create a new full_doc_info with just the id if this is a new file ) .
We then create the new doc infos by calling merge_rev_trees .
We will ignore the implementation for now .
Finally , we gather all the sequences that we would like to remove .
Moving on , we see that we start by updating the local docs and then flushing the trees .
Both of which looks promising for my quest to understand how the data is stored on the disk :
update_local_docs just modify the in memory btree , so I am not going to show it , flush_trees should be more interesting , based on just the comment .
This is interesting .
What we see here is that we write the attachment references and the document body to the summary stream .
That is interesting , because I am still not sure what the summary stream is .
Note that here we have the issue of writing to a file during compaction , so we ask the higher level code to retry that again .
We still have to see how the indexes are maintained , but that just update the in memory structure , the real bit happens next :
Here we see our good old friend the btree , and we add / remove the new index to the file .
We have seen how this works here .
We finish by updating the Db structure with the new values and committing the data .
I now feel that I have a much better understanding on how CouchDB file handling works .
Except that I still do n't know what this summary stream is .
That is a topic for later , though .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Naysayers who predicted the U.S. dollar ’s demise as the world reserve currency of choice have been silent of late given the greenback ’s meteoric recovery in recent months .
Slammed over the last several years as U.S. government budget and trade deficits mounted , the greenback was seen ceding its status as the predominant currency to the euro .
Talk of nations reducing their dollar reserves in favor of the euro prompted talk the dollar would also lose favor as the medium of exchange for commodities .
However , the global financial crisis that has rocked markets worldwide has seen investors voting with their cash and buying U.S. dollars , indicating that reports of the greenback ’s death as a reserve currency have been greatly exaggerated .
“ Talk of the euro replacing the dollar is off the table , ” said Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon .
“ The U.S. has the only economy in the world that supports a strong currency by policy and is an anchor for the global economy . ”
The current credit freeze has its roots in the U.S. subprime mortgage market where overzealous lending in exotic debt products has led to a wave of homeowner loan defaults and problems with repackaged mortgage securities .
But the crisis went global when holders of those mortgage securities faced huge losses and became reluctant to take on additional risk through either lending themselves or buying more securities .
Investors then were quick to understand that the United States was the only nation with the political will to act quickly and the government and private sector infrastructure in place to implement policies .
The pockets of the U.S. tax payer to fund a bailout added to the allure of the U.S. currency .
“ The United States continues to be the only entity sufficiently large and coordinated enough to deal with the multiple issues surrounding the credit crisis , ” said Andrew B. Busch , global FX strategist BMO Capital Markets in Chicago .
“ It clearly is not over . ”
The dollar ’s value against major currencies had changed little in the first half of 2008 , after a six year slide , but since mid-July when the magnitude of the credit crisis became apparent , the dollar has rebounded significantly .
The Intercontinental Exchange ’s U.S. dollar index <.DXY has climbed 21.3 percent since that time , roughly corresponding to a 21.8 percent drop by the euro against the greenback .
The British pound has dropped 23 percent while the Australian dollar plunged 37.5 percent against the U.S. dollar .
Emerging market currencies have been particularly hard - hit as investors fled risk and repatriated funds either home or to the safety of the U.S. dollar .
Latin American - focused funds suffered their 20th straight week of outflows , EPFR Global data showed on Friday , losing a net $ 134.8 million to redemptions .
Europe , Middle East and Africa funds had outflows of $ 189.1 million .
The U.S. dollar has gained 27 percent against the South African rand since mid-July and 21 percent against the Turkish lira .
To be sure , International Monetary Fund data relating to the first quarter shows the U.S. dollar ’s share of currency reserves of central banks around the world had declined to 63 percent from 65.1 percent a year earlier .
That though , was more a function of a decline in the dollar , analysts said , with little evidence of a large shift away from the greenback .
While countries hostile to U.S. foreign policy such as Iran had talked about pricing oil in euros and other nations such as Russia did increase euro reserves , action was always piece - meal .
“ Those nations who threatened to move to the euro from the dollar or actually did move in terms of reserves or commodity prices are going to be punished and the ones who did n’t are thankful , ” said Andrew Bekoff , chief investment strategist at Meyers Associates in New York .
And with crude oil prices down 56 percent from its peak in mid-July , there is even less incentive to move commodity pricing away from the dollar .
“ A stronger dollar will buffer the Middle East ( producers ) , ” said Bekoff .
“ Even though crude is down it is not as bad as it could be if they were selling in euros . ”
Olive oil is good for you , doctors say , which is why I drink a glass a day .
Yes , it 's easy to see the folly in such reasoning .
But not so when it comes to vitamins .
People readily swallow mega - doses in pill form with the logic that if vitamins in food are healthy then concentrating them into capsules surely must be healthier .
Major studies published in the past few months , however , have revealed that not only do n't vitamin pills ward off cancer and heart disease , in some cases they make things much worse .
Easy on the E
Vitamin E , in particular , took a big hit .
This was once touted for its antioxidant properties , and diets rich in vitamin E from food sources such as nuts and olives are associated with longevity .
The recommended daily allowance is about 15 milligrams or 20 international units ( IU ) .
In pill form the dose is often 100 to 400 IUs .
Couple this with the fact that vitamin E is fat soluble and lingers in the body for a while , and you 'll see the potential trouble .
In September researchers behind a four - year , $ 100 - million study on selenium and vitamin E for the prevention of prostate cancer , funded largely by the National Cancer Institute , called off the study , telling participants to stop taking their supplements .
Neither selenium nor vitamin E did anything to prevent cancer , and there seemed to be slightly more cancers among the men taking 400 IU of vitamin E . ( The selenium group had more diabetes . )
By October doctors came to realize that vitamin E pills did nothing for the heart .
As detailed in the Journal of the American Medical Association , 400 IU of vitamin E did not prevent cardiovascular disease in the over 14,000 subjects followed in the massive and ongoing Physicians ' Health Study II , run by Harvard University .
The same study found that vitamins E and C , together or solely , did nothing to prevent any type of cancer over the course of 10 years .
This was reported last week at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington , D.C .
Vitamin C for cancer
Meanwhile , researchers at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York studied the interaction of vitamin C and cancer cells .
Apparently cancer cells love vitamin C as much as healthy cells do .
This is why previous studies have shown cancer to worsen in patients taking too much vitamin C .
The researchers found that every chemotherapy drug they tested did not work as well if cells were pretreated with vitamin C .
In the cell culture experiments , 30 to 70 percent fewer cancer cells treated with vitamin C were killed depending on the drug tested .
Turning to animal studies they found that chemotherapy could keep cancer in check but that tumors grew more rapidly in mice given vitamin C .
The researchers theorize that vitamin C protects cancer cells from drug damage at the mitochondria level .
These findings were published in the October 2008 issue of Cancer Research .
Forget ginkgo
The dietary supplement ginkgo biloba did n't hold up well to scrutiny , either .
Ginkgo leaf extract was an ancient cure for asthma , bronchitis , fatigue and tinnitus .
It never really worked well for those things , and today it is an ancient cure for memory loss , seeing how the alarming rising rates of dementia - related diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease is a modern phenomenon demanding an ancient cure .
As reported in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association , ginkgo supplements did not reduce the rate of dementia or Alzheimer 's disease among more than 1,500 elderly study participants after several years of use .
Instead the ginkgo raised their risk of internal bleeding .
Ginkgo's not dead , though .
There seems to be protective elements in the extract that researchers hope to turn into drugs to treat neurological disorders .
We 'd all love cheap cures in the form of bottled vitamins and other natural supplements .
But the best preventive medicine , which has held up under the scrutiny of large clinical trials , is to eat a diet rich in the aforementioned vitamins — along with maybe just a tablespoon or two of olive oil , not a glass .

Obama on McCain's ' change ' : ' They must think you 're stupid ' Associated Press
Published : Saturday September 6 , 2008
Print This Email This By CHARLES BABINGTON , Associated Press Writer
TERRE HAUTE , Ind . - Barack Obama made his first direct criticism of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on Saturday , saying she pretends to oppose spending earmarks when she actually has embraced them .
Speaking to 800 people at the Wabash Valley Fairgrounds in Terre Haute , Ind. , the Democratic presidential nominee ridiculed John McCain and his running mate , the Alaska governor , for describing themselves as agents of change at this week 's GOP convention .
" Do n't be fooled , " Obama told the crowd surrounding him in a large barn .
" John McCain 's party , with the help of John McCain , has been in charge " for nearly eight years .
" I know the governor of Alaska has been saying she 's change , and that 's great , " Obama said .
" She 's a skillful politician .
But , you know , when you 've been taking all these earmarks when it 's convenient , and then suddenly you 're the champion anti-earmark person , that 's not change .
Come on !
I mean , words mean something , you can't just make stuff up . "
McCain has vowed to wipe out earmarks , which are targeted funding for specific projects that lawmakers put into spending bills .
As governor , Palin originally supported earmarks for a controversial Alaska project dubbed the " bridge to nowhere . "
But she dropped her support after the state 's likely share of the cost rose .
She hung onto $ 27 million to build the approach road to the bridge .
Until Saturday , Obama had refrained from criticizing Palin directly , saying only that she , like McCain , would continue the Bush administration 's policies .
Democrats have debated how to deal with Palin .
They want to avoid charges of sexism but find ways to highlight what they see as her political weaknesses .
Obama delivered some of his most withering criticisms yet of McCain , although he did so with chuckles and an air of mock disbelief .
McCain has acknowledged voting with President Bush 90 percent of the time in Congress , Obama said .
" And suddenly he 's the change agent ?
Ha .
He says , ' I 'm going to tell those lobbyists that their days of running Washington are over . '
Who is he going to tell ?
Is he going to tell his campaign chairman , who 's one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington ?
Is he going to tell his campaign manager , who was one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington ? "
" I mean , come on , they must think you 're stupid , " Obama said as the crowd laughed and cheered .
The McCain campaign noted that Obama has steered numerous earmarks to his state of Illinois .
However , Obama has not been the critic of earmarks that McCain and , more recently Palin , have been .
Obama said Republicans are targeting his character , and he criticized McCain for saying he would reduce the partisan rancor in Washington .
Pretending to address McCain , he said , " Did you pay attention to the last two days of your convention ?
Were you not watching ? "
" When you start just focusing exclusively on trying to tear the other person down instead of what you are going to do on behalf of the American people to deal with this economy , " Obama said , " then that 's not serving Democrats , that 's not serving Republicans , that 's not serving anybody . "

( Whatever that is ...)
On October 15 , the Presidential candidates had their last debate before the election .
They talked of the baleful state of the economy and the stock market ; but omitted from the discussion was what actually caused the credit freeze , and whether the banks should be nationalized as Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson is now proceeding to do .
The omission was probably excusable , since the financial landscape has been changing so fast that it is hard to keep up .
A year ago , the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through 14,000 to make a new all - time high .
Anyone predicting then that a year later the Dow would drop nearly by half and the Treasury would move to nationalize the banks would have been regarded with amused disbelief .
But that is where we are today .
1
Congress hastily voted to approve Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ’s $ 700 billion bank bailout plan on October 3 , 2008 , after a tumultuous week in which the Dow fell dangerously near the critical 10,000 level .
The market , however , was not assuaged .
The Dow proceeded to break through not only 10,000 but then 9,000 and 8,000 , closing at 8,451 on Friday , October 10 .
The week was called the worst in U.S. stock market history .
On Monday , October 13 , the market staged a comeback the likes of which had not been seen since 1933 , rising a full 11 % in one day .
This happened after the government announced a plan to buy equity interests in key banks , partially nationalizing them ; and the Federal Reserve led a push to flood the global financial system with dollars .
The reversal was dramatic but short - lived .
On October 15 , the day of the Presidential debate , the Dow dropped 733 points , crash landing at 8,578 .
The reversal is looking more like a massive pump and dump scheme – artificially inflating the market so insiders can get out – than a true economic rescue .
The real problem is not in the much - discussed subprime market but is in the credit market , which has dried up .
The banking scheme itself has failed .
As was learned by painful experience during the Great Depression , the economy cannot be rescued by simply propping up failed banks .
The banking system itself needs to be overhauled .
A Litany of Failed Rescue Plans
Credit has dried up because many banks cannot meet the 8 % capital requirement that limits their ability to lend .
A bank ’s capital – the money it gets from the sale of stock or from profits – can be fanned into more than 10 times its value in loans ; but this leverage also works the other way .
While $ 80 in capital can produce $ 1,000 in loans , an $ 80 loss from default wipes out $ 80 in capital , reducing the sum that can be lent by $ 1,000 .
Since the banks have been experiencing widespread loan defaults , their capital base has shrunk proportionately .
The bank bailout plan announced on October 3 involved using taxpayer money to buy up mortgage - related securities from troubled banks .
This was supposed to reduce the need for new capital by reducing the amount of risky assets on the banks ’ books .
But the banks ’ risky assets include derivatives – speculative bets on market changes – and derivative exposure for U.S. banks is now estimated at a breathtaking $ 180 trillion .
2
The sum represents an impossible - to - fill black hole that is three times the gross domestic product of all the countries in the world combined .
As one critic said of Paulson ’s roundabout bailout plan , " this seems designed to help Hank ’s friends offload trash , more than to clear a market blockage . "
3
By Thursday , October 9 , Paulson himself evidently had doubts about his ability to sell the plan .
He was n’t abandoning his old cronies , but he soft - pedaled that plan in favor of another option buried in the voluminous rescue package – using a portion of the $ 700 billion to buy stock in the banks directly .
Plan B represented a controversial move toward nationalization , but it was an improvement over Plan A , which would have reduced capital requirements only by the value of the bad debts shifted onto the government ’s books .
In Plan B , the money would be spent on bank stock , increasing the banks ’ capital base , which could then be leveraged into ten times that sum in loans .
The plan was an improvement but the market was evidently not convinced , since the Dow proceeded to drop another thousand points from Thursday ’s opening to Friday ’s close .
One problem with Plan B was that it did not really mean nationalization ( public ownership and control of the participating banks ) .
Rather , it came closer to what has been called " crony capitalism " or " corporate welfare . "
The bank stock being bought would be non-voting preferred stock , meaning the government would have no say in how the bank was run .
The Treasury would just be feeding the bank money to do with as it would .
Management could continue to collect enormous salaries while investing in wildly speculative ventures with the taxpayers ’ money .
The banks could not be forced to use the money to make much - needed loans but could just use it to clean up their derivative - infested balance sheets .
In the end , the banks were still liable to go bankrupt , wiping out the taxpayers ’ investment altogether .
Even if $ 700 billion were fanned into $ 7 trillion , the sum would not come close to removing the $ 180 trillion in derivative liabilities from the banks ’ books .
Shifting those liabilities onto the public purse would just empty the purse without filling the derivative black hole .
Plan C , the plan du jour , does impose some limits on management compensation .
But the more significant feature of this week ’s plan is the Fed ’s new " Commercial Paper Funding Facility , " which is slated to be operational on October 27 , 2008 .
The facility would open the Fed ’s lending window for short - term commercial paper , the money corporations need to fund their day - to - day business operations .
On October 14 , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York justified this extraordinary expansion of its lending powers by stating :
" The CPFF is authorized under Section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act , which permits the Board , in unusual and exigent circumstances , to authorize Reserve Banks to extend credit to individuals , partnerships , and corporations that are unable to obtain adequate credit accommodations .
. . .
" The U.S. Treasury believes this facility is necessary to prevent substantial disruptions to the financial markets and the economy and will make a special deposit at the New York Fed in support of this facility . "
4
That means the government and the Fed are now committing even more public money and taking on even more public risk .
The taxpayers are already tapped out , so the Treasury ’s " special deposit " will no doubt come from U.S. bonds , meaning more debt on which the taxpayers have to pay interest .
The federal debt could wind up running so high that the government loses its own triple - A rating .
The U.S. could be reduced to Third World status , with " austerity measures " being imposed as a condition for further loans , and hyperinflation running the dollar into oblivion .
Rather than solving the problem , these " rescue " plans seem destined to make it worse .
The Collapse of a 300 Year Ponzi Scheme
All the king ’s men cannot put the private banking system together again , for the simple reason that it is a Ponzi scheme that has reached its mathematical limits .
A Ponzi scheme is a form of pyramid scheme in which new investors must continually be sucked in at the bottom to support the investors at the top .
In this case , new borrowers must continually be sucked in to support the creditors at the top .
The Wall Street Ponzi scheme is built on " fractional reserve " lending , which allows banks to create " credit " ( or " debt " ) with accounting entries .
Banks are now allowed to lend from 10 to 30 times their " reserves , " essentially counterfeiting the money they lend .
Over 97 percent of the U.S. money supply ( M3 ) has been created by banks in this way .
5
The problem is that banks create only the principal and not the interest necessary to pay back their loans .
Since bank lending is essentially the only source of new money in the system , someone somewhere must continually be taking out new loans just to create enough " money " ( or " credit " ) to service the old loans composing the money supply .
This spiraling interest problem and the need to find new debtors has gone on for over 300 years -- ever since the founding of the Bank of England in 1694 – until the whole world has now become mired in debt to the bankers ’ private money monopoly .
As British financial analyst Chris Cook observes :
" Exponential economic growth required by the mathematics of compound interest on a money supply based on money as debt must always run up eventually against the finite nature of Earth ’s resources . "
6
The parasite has finally run out of its food source .
But the crisis is not in the economy itself , which is fundamentally sound – or would be with a proper credit system to oil the wheels of production .
The crisis is in the banking system , which can no longer cover up the shell game it has played for three centuries with other people ’s money .
Fortunately , we do n’t need the credit of private banks .
A sovereign government can create its own .
The New Deal Revisited
Today ’s credit crisis is very similar to that facing Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s .
In 1932 , President Hoover set up the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) as a federally - owned bank that would bail out commercial banks by extending loans to them , much as the privately - owned Federal Reserve is doing today .
But like today , Hoover ’s plan failed .
The banks did not need more loans ; they were already drowning in debt .
They needed customers with money to spend and to invest .
President Roosevelt used Hoover ’s new government - owned lending facility to extend loans where they were needed most – for housing , agriculture and industry .
Many new federal agencies were set up and funded by the RFC , including the HOLC ( Home Owners Loan Corporation ) and Fannie Mae ( the Federal National Mortgage Association , which was then a government - owned agency ) .
In the 1940s , the RFC went into overdrive funding the infrastructure necessary for the U.S. to participate in World War II , setting the country up with the infrastructure it needed to become the world ’s industrial leader after the war .
The RFC was a government - owned bank that sidestepped the privately - owned Federal Reserve ; but unlike the private banks with which it was competing , the RFC had to have the money in hand before lending it .
The RFC was funded by issuing government bonds ( I.O.U.s or debt ) and relending the proceeds .
The result was to put the taxpayers further into debt .
This problem could be avoided , however , by updating the RFC model .
A system of public banks might be set up that had the power to create credit themselves , just as private banks do now .
A public bank operating on the private bank model could fan $ 700 billion in capital reserves into $ 7 trillion in public credit that was derivative - free , liability - free , and readily available to fund all those things we think we do n’t have the money for now , including the loans necessary to meet payrolls , fund mortgages , and underwrite public infrastructure .
Credit as a Public Utility
" Credit " can and should be a national utility , a public service provided by the government to the people it serves .
Many people are opposed to getting the government involved in the banking system , but the fact is that the government is already involved .
A modern - day RFC would actually mean less government involvement and a more efficient use of the already - earmarked $ 700 billion than policymakers are talking about now .
The government would not need to interfere with the private banking system , which could carry on as before .
The Treasury would not need to bail out the banks , which could be left to those same free market forces that have served them so well up to now .
If banks went bankrupt , they could be put into FDIC receivership and nationalized .
The government would then own a string of banks , which could be used to service the depository and credit needs of the community .
There would be no need to change the personnel or procedures of these newly - nationalized banks .
They could engage in " fractional reserve " lending just as they do now .
The only difference would be that the interest on loans would return to the government , helping to defray the tax burden on the populace ; and the banks would start out with a clean set of books , so their $ 700 billion in startup capital could be fanned into $ 7 trillion in new loans .
This was the sort of banking scheme used in Benjamin Franklin ’s colony of Pennsylvania , where it worked brilliantly well .
The spiraling - interest problem was avoided by printing some extra money and spending it into the economy for public purposes .
During the decades the provincial bank operated , the Pennsylvania colonists paid no taxes , there was no government debt , and inflation did not result .
7
Like the Pennsylvania bank , a modern - day federal banking system would not actually need " reserves " at all .
It is the sovereign right of a government to issue the currency of the realm .
What backs our money today is simply " the full faith and credit of the United States , " something the United States should be able to issue directly without having to draw on " reserves " of its own credit .
But if Congress is not prepared to go that far , a more efficient use of the earmarked $ 700 billion than bailing out failing banks would be to designate the funds as the " reserves " for a newly - reconstituted RFC .

About
Salsa is an experimental Haskell library and code generator that allows Haskell programs to host the .NET runtime and interact with .NET libraries .
It uses type families extensively to provide a type - safe mapping of the .NET object model in the Haskell type system .
Requirements
GHC 7.8
Salsa makes extensive use of type families and thus requires at least version 7.8 of GHC .
Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5
Since the Salsa code generator requires .
NET 3.5 , any Salsa development also requires this version .
Executables produced with Salsa however will run with just .
NET 2.0 ( provided that only . NET 2.0 assemblies are used by the program ) .
Mono support has been implemented .
Salsa will be compiled against Mono if not running on windows or the flag ' use_mono ' is set .
Salsa will not work with versions 1.0/1.1 of the .NET Framework .
Caution !
Salsa is experimental and has not been thoroughly tested .
A single typographical error can trigger multiple pages of errors from GHC , or cause it to eat lots of memory .
Getting Salsa
You can find Salsa on Hackage , but it is not getting updated frequently due to the manual build steps required .
Please instead go directly to the repository on GitHub :
git clone https://github.com/tim-m89/Salsa.git
Using Salsa
Having a look at the sample programs in the Salsa distribution is probably the best way to learn how to use Salsa at the moment .
There are currently three sample programs available :
Hello : a basic console ' Hello World ' program .
Weather : a console program that asynchronously downloads the Sydney weather forecast and displays it .
Conway : a simulator for Conway 's Game of Life with a Windows Presentation Foundation GUI .
( Requires .NET 3.0 or later . )
C# in Haskell
The following table shows some C# code snippets and what they translate to :
C# Salsa Notes < pre-c>o. ToString ( ) </ pre-c> o # _toString ()
Method names have a leading underscore and lowercase first character .
< pre-c>Console .
Write ( " Hi {0} ! " , " world " ) ;</ pre-c >

< pre-c >b. Text = " OK " ;</ pre-c > set b [ _ Text := " OK " ]
Use the set function to set the value of fields and properties .
Multiple assignments can be made in the one call .
< pre-c>b.
Width = 10 ;</ pre-c > set b [ _ Width :== 10 ] Use :== to assign without applying implicit conversions .
This is useful for assigning polymorphic numeric literals to properties , since polymorphic - typed values confuse the Salsa coercion machinery .
< pre-c>b. Click += ( EventHandler ) delegate ( ... ) { ... };</ pre-c> set b [ _ Click :+> delegate _ EventHandler ( ... ) ]
Use :+> to add a handler to an event , and delegate to wrap a Haskell function as a .NET delegate .
Limitations
There are a number of .NET features that Salsa does not currently support .
These include :
generic methods and classes
multi-dimensional arrays
explicit coercions
indexer properties
exception handling
Also , only a handful of value types are automatically marshaled between Haskell and .NET ( these are Int32 , String , Bool and Double ) .
All other types are marshaled by reference ( which is typically what you want for .
NET reference types anyway ) .
( Patches are certainly welcome . )
Documentation
Some of the inner workings of Salsa are described in my undergraduate thesis .
In particular , Chapter 8 describes how type families are used to provide a type - safe mapping of the .NET object model in Haskell .
If you 're considering playing with Salsa , it is probably worth a read :
Filling the Open Source Usability Testing Gap
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 03 , 2008
Could open source software benefit from more usability testing ?
It sure seems so , and usability labs are heavily emphasized at big proprietary software companies , especially Microsoft .
In fact , early interface standards in Windows applications , such as common menu options , were largely driven by the experiences of usability testers .
Here are some open source projects that are setting a good example when it comes to usability .
OStatic is based on the Drupal content management system ( CMS ) .
If you 're unfamiliar with it , here is an interview that covers Drupal 's unique strengths .
One of the reasons that Drupal is favored by many people in need of a CMS is the standardized approach to user interface design that project leaders adhere to .
Many of the ongoing user interface and design enhancements in Drupal are driven by the Drupal Usability Group , which has over 450 members .
If you look through the posts online at the Drupal Usability Group , you 'll find an active community of folks policing everything from Drupal 's installation routine to " those little annoying UI things . "
The Drupal Usability Group also reaches out to university researchers to extend Drupal 's usability testing .
This post discusses Drupal usability testing done at the University of Minnesota and the University of Baltimore .
Red Hat and Novell also stand out for focusing on usability testing , and community input on user interface design .
Here is an extensive set of interface guidelines from Red Hat Magazine .
Some open source projects can benefit much more than others from doing usability research properly .
GNOME , for example , stands or falls with many users based on how friendly the interface it provides is .
Keeping it friendly is part of the GNOME Usability Project , which publishes its own Human Interface Guidelines .
There are a lot of other examples of open source projects that put proper focus on usability , but there are also too many examples of projects where the issue is ignored altogether .
Starting an active usability group , publishing interface guidelines online , and reaching out to researchers at external labs such as university labs are all good ideas to start with .
The Beijing 2008 Olympic Games kick off on August 8th , and the Web will be an important destination for sport lovers who want to be able to watch all of the action from their favorite events online .
Here is a list of the places online where lovers of the Games will be able to catch all of the action .
Some are legal , while others may be frowned upon , but all are legitimate ways of seeing the Olympics online .
Official Coverage
NBC Olympics
American residents will be able to watch over 2,200 hours of coverage live on NBCOlympics.com .
The success of the coverage will be used as a yardstick to see whether the Web is a legitimate location for hosting coverage of events such as this .
However , with severe restrictions it is alienating a larger potential audience .
BBC Olympic Coverage
The the BBC ’s Olympic coverage looks like the best deal with fair and wide coverage of the events .
Unfortunately it is only available within the UK .
TVTonic
TVTonic ‘s service allows US residents to watch Olympic events in full , even after broadcast and while you ’re offline .
However , the service is n’t recommended for users of metered Broadband Internet .
Proxy
While the coverage of the above services may be locked to a specific country , anyone overseas can get around this fact by use of a proxy server based in right country .
Essentially this makes it appear as if you are accessing the coverage from the correct country .
However , with proxy servers being quite unreliable and slow it is unlikely you ’ll be able to watch anything without jitters .
YouTube & Live Streaming Video Sites
YouTube has a dedicated Olympics channel , but it will only be viewable by people resident in the 77 countries where the IOC failed to make exclusive Web deals .
Using a proxy server can again get around this obstacle .
There is also likely to be a multitude of amateur footage finding its way on to live streaming video sites like Ustream , Stickam , and Justin.tv .
Live Olympic Streaming
Using uStream the Olympic Games are being streamed online live .
The quality is not brilliant and it can be a bit stuttery but its better than nothing .
Share This Live Video :

Embed : ( copy code to your website )
High Quality Olympics Stream
Just came across this high quality stream .
Clicking this link should open up the stream in your default video player .
P2P Streaming
P2P streaming is huge in China , and PPLive is officially licensed to show the Olympics in China .
A Chinese - based proxy server may help , or alternatively , PPStream , PPMate , Sopcast , TVUPlayer , and TVKoo may be worth trying .
Personally out of all of those I recommend TVUPlayer as it is the easiest to use .
Torrents
Last but not least are torrent sites , with the big Olympic moments likely to turn up in force on the high - profile sites such as The Pirate Bay , and Mininova .
However , since you have to download the content first using torrents then you wo n’t be able to get any live coverage this way , but it will be great for recapturing classic moments from the Olympics
An alternative to torrents is the easy - to - use video downloading program Graboid which provides access to hundreds of thousands of videos and will no doubt have a lot of Olympic coverage .
TiVo and DVRs
The Olympics TV schedule can’t rule your life and by using TiVo or your preferred DVR you can record all the events to watch at a later date .
A relatively simple solution which allows you to easily watch the Olympics on your regular TV set .
Whichever means you choose to watch the Olympics online from Beijing , it ’s clear that the Web is now a serious player in delivering footage of such a huge event to the masses .
On a separate not why not check out the hottest girls of the Olympics .

At the end of a cold and stormy winter , the country has just 12 days of coal reserves at most power stations .
Some provinces , including Hebei , bordering Beijing , have less than a week 's coal left .
This is a record low , the state electricity regulatory commission revealed on Tuesday .
In recent days a series of media articles surfaced pointing to a concerning situation in China .
The New Scientist reported :
It continues :
China relies on burning coal for 70 % of its electricity .
Even though Chinese coal production in the first quarter of this year was up almost 15 % on the same period last year , it has apparently not been enough to meet rapidly growing demand . [...]
The coal mining industry , and the rail network needed to bring the coal to the power plants , are both struggling to keep up with the drive to build ever more generating capacity .
The strains raise questions about how much longer China 's breakneck industrialisation can continue .
China Stakes presents even grimmer details :
The Vice - President of the State Electric Power Supervisory Commission , Wang Yeping , said that in Hebei , Anhui , and Chongqing , the stockpile of coal for power generation was not even enough to last 7 days .
This situation is quite similar to the one that existed in January 2008 .
Theoretically , a stockpile that is smaller than 7 days supply has reached an “ urgent level ” .
This scenario is even more concerning coming during the Spring when electricity demand is at the lowest .
Air conditioning is not needed yet and most of the country should by now be through with home heating .
The coming Summer can indeed have some hardships reserved for China .
While the hard winter brought all sort of disruptions to the regular life of Chinese folk during the weeks prior to the New Year festivities , production kept strong during the first months of 2008 , setting new records .
These facts show that the difficulties felt during January and early February were mainly caused by shipping disruptions .
While cold weather continued for the rest of the Northern Hemisphere , China was granted some relief in March with some warm temperatures :
Temperature anomalies in March of 2008 .
Source University of Alabama in Huntsville .
Although out of season frosts returned to China in April , the southern provinces of the country are now well into Spring .
So why these dwindling stocks now ?
China Daily have it by the numbers :
The General Administration of Customs said on Thursday that China exported 8.75 million tonnes of coal for $ 630 million [ during January and February ] , up 13.5 percent and 39.7 percent , respectively , year - on - year .
Prices averaged $ 72.2 per tonne .
For February only , exports were 3 million tonnes , down 32.1 percent .
Imports were 7.06 million tonnes , down 18.2 percent year - on - year .
These shipments were valued at $ 450 million , up 13.1 percent .
The average price was $ 63.3 per tonne .
For February only , imports were 2.82 million tonnes , down 28.2 percent .
Putting it simply , China is importing a smaller volume of Coal than last year , but actually spending more money doing it .
Especial attention should be taken to the prices per tonne , in the order of $ 60 – 70 .
At the same time prices in Europe are well above $ 100 / tonne and Indonesian Coal is expected to reach a $ 150 / tonne , this kind of Coal was below $ 50 / tonne last year .
Apparently the international Coal market is getting tight enough for a country like China to feel the pinch .
While Europe and North America are still able to import their usual share with prices triple of those last year , China is n't .
Volumes available for export in South East Asia , Australia and New Zealand are being diverted away from local buyers with lower purchasing power .
Partially this problem is rooted on extreme weather events that have been affecting Australia 's production .
Floods during the first months of the year brought hard cooking coal prices to a spike of $ 400 / tonne [ hat tip Big Gav ] .
Still , the same article indicates long term contracts being celebrated at $ 300 / tonne , and thermal coal also bound to go over $ 100 / tonne this year .
With the Coal Crunch the world is stepping into is just another dimension of the present energy crisis that is being triggered by anaemic oil production .
Either by pushing demand up for other energy sources or supply down for minerals , food and other commodities , oil is building an economic whirlwind that has the potential to transform the face of our societies .

My jaw hit the floor tonight watching a 60 Minutes segment on the emerging neuroscience of brain - only computer interfaces .
In the clip ( included in full below ) , see how a completely paralyzed man , who could otherwise only communicate by moving his eyes , uses his mind to type out thoughts on a computer screen .
Of course , the process is very slow going — each letter takes up to 20 seconds to type .
Reporter Scott Pelley donned the controller skull cap , and watched a screen of flashing letters to try it out himself .
When the letter he was thinking of highlighted , he'd think " that 's it ! " and that signal of recognition would type the letter on - screen .
Neuroscientists have even gotten as far as to embed a chip inside a monkey 's brain , and figured out what brain activity signals that the monkey is trying to move its arm in what direction .
Hit the clip below to watch this monkey control a robotic arm with only its thoughts .

This is the seed of my most - wanted , dream computer interface , one that does n't involve pecking at keys .
Imagine a day when , like speech recognition , thought recognition becomes possible , and you can narrate your thoughts to your computer or handheld device .
Maybe 30 years down the road , our kids will be riding the subway with their iPhone - like device 's headphones plugged in , getting new email read to them , and narrating their responses back only with their minds .

Florida cop under fire for using Obama 's middle name ' Hussein ' By Jim Kouri
web posted October 13 , 2008 Sheriff Mike Scott of Lee County , Florida never expected to creat a firestorm when he used the full name of the Democrat Party 's presidential candidate " Barack Hussein Obama . "
At a rally in Estero , Florida for GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , the highly decorated law enforcement executive was the pre-rally speaker for the Palin 's appearance .
As with most political rallies , the job of pre-rally speakers is to warmup the audience .
According to GOPUSA 's editor Bobby Eberle whether the audience is cheering wildly or booing loudly , the pre-rally speakers are there to wake them up and get them going .
So Sheriff Scott stepped to the podium and said , " On November 4 , let 's leave Barack Hussein Obama wondering what happened . "
Apparently , saying " Hussein Obama " in public might just get you a visit from the FBI .
Just ask Sheriff Mike Scott who is under investigation for referring to Obama at a campaign rally by his full name .
Oh , the shock of it all !
Speaking someone 's full legal name in public !
When asked about the " incident , " Sheriff Scott responded by saying : " I absolutely , unequivocally do n't regret saying it , " Scott told the News - Press on Monday .
" In order to be a speaker at this event , I had to give my full name — Michael Joseph Scott — to the Secret Service , even though I 'm the sheriff of Lee County .
So why would I apologize ?
Is there some kind of double standard here where I have to give my full name , but I can't use his ? "
" Unless he changed his name , my position has n't changed , " said Scott of Obama .
" It seems very clear to me that people have one of three stances on this thing :
There are those who dislike it , there are those who like it , and there are those who think it 's a whole big deal about nothing , which is where I stand . "
" We have seen many changes in this great nation which have been brought about by left wing activists .
As kids , we used to say the Pledge of Allegiance .
Now , it 's being attacked in the courts .
We used to say a prayer in the morning before school or at football games .
Socialists in America have deemed that " offensive " and the practice has all but disappeared .
Christmas displays honoring the birth of Christ trigger convulsions by the Left , who say that we should n't make people feel " uncomfortable " with our manger scenes , " said GOPUSA 's Eberle .
" [ S ] heriff Scott also has a right to say what he wants to say without fear of reprisal by the government .
However , according to a local Florida NBC affiliate , Sheriff Scott 's remark has now earned him an investigation by the federal government , " added Eberle .
The NBC station reports that officials with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel have started an investigation of the Sheriff under the question of " did he use his position as sheriff to influence an election ?
If so , he could be in violation of a federal election law called the Hatch Act . "
The basis the Feds are using is whether Scott was campaigning while on duty and in uniform .
Sheriff Scott responded to the NBC story with the following statement : " I am on duty 24/7 and 365 whether in or out of uniform .
Like every other elected official , I am aware of from President to Governor to State Representatives , etc .
We engage in political activities whether for ourselves as candidates or for others .
As of this writing , I am unaware of having done anything to generate all this attention other than using the senator 's full name . "
" The question is this ...
If Sheriff Scott had not said ' Barack Hussein Obama , ' do you really think he would now be under investigation ?
If you answered " no , " then that should send a shiver down your spine , because it means that the government is imposing pressure and creating a public example of Scott for simply saying someone 's name , " says Eberle .
" Whether the investigation leads to charges or legal action is not the point .
The point is that government intimidation is being brought to bear for someone exercising his first amendment right to free speech .
This is wrong , regardless of whether you think his usage of Barack Hussein Obama was appropriate or not .
This is still America , is n't it ? " he added .

TEHRAN  More than 20 members of Parliament petitioned their colleagues on Wednesday to impeach the interior minister after investigations indicated that he did not hold several academic degrees that he had claimed .
If the minister , Ali Kordan , is impeached , Parliament will have to hold a vote of confidence on all other cabinet members .
According to the Constitution , if 10 cabinet members are dismissed , all members must face a confidence vote .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed nine cabinet members in the past three years because they disagreed with his policies .
No president has faced a confidence vote on the entire cabinet .
Parliament has not yet scheduled a vote on Mr. Kordan ’s fate .
The news of the impeachment request comes at a difficult time for Mr. Ahmadinejad , who has faced increasing pressure from the parliamentary opposition in recent months  in part because of complaints over his management of the economy  as well as a revolt by the merchant class over a new sales tax .

A secret war against the poor
The papers and letters of America 's leading eugenicists reveal that , from the start , population control was no humanitarian mission By Mary Meehan Frederick Osborn , the key American eugenics strategist , displayed his usual shrewdness in 1974 .
" Birth control and abortion , " he wrote , " are turning out to be " major eugenic steps .
But if " they had been advanced for eugenic reasons , " he added , that " would have retarded or stopped their acceptance . "
Osborn thought this showed the wisdom of the 1972 decision to change the name of the American Eugenics Society to a more academic - sounding Society for the Study of Social Biology .
That organization still exists and publishes the journal Social Biology .
Some recent board members , such as bioethicist Daniel Callahan , have deeply influenced public policy .
The Osborn notes , found in his papers at the American Philosophical Society Library in Philadelphia , help explain the deep influence of eugenics -- the effort to breed a " better " human race -- on population control .
Before World War II , the American eugenics movement had many links with racism , compulsory sterilization and even Nazi eugenics .
Its historical record was , in fact , a major reason for the name change .
While some observers say Osborn successfully pursued " reform eugenics , " others dispute that claim .
Osborn 's own papers show a long collaboration with Wickliffe Draper , a textile heir who wanted to send black Americans back to Africa .
Osborn thought that scheme impractical , but did not object to it in principle .
Other manuscript collections , in places ranging from Princeton and Harvard universities to the National Archives , also offer valuable insights into eugenics and its effects on population policy .
They show a need to rewrite the history of population control , which too often is described as a purely humanitarian venture .
Both economic self - interest and eugenics , the archives show , have enormous influence on population policy .
Contemporary eugenicists are discreet about their intentions and even about their membership in the eugenics group .
When asked about their membership , they generally say that they do n't remember it ; that they were never very active in the group ; or that it 's now a strictly scientific organization .
Michael Teitelbaum , currently a vice - chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform , was president of the Society for the Study of Social Biology from 1984 - 1990 .
He has claimed , " I have nothing to do with eugenics ; I have no interest in eugenics ; and the society has no interest in eugenics . "
In an interview last June , he suggested that the current Society for the Study of Social Biology " simply is the inheritor of the journal , " Social Biology , which " does n't publish anything on eugenics .
. . .
If you want to tar the organization by impugning its history , I suppose you can do that , but I think it 's not a reputable thing to do . "
Yet , a 1969 letter in the American Eugenics Society collection in Philadelphia indicates that Teitelbaum himself belonged to the society before its name was changed .
Moreover , in announcing the society 's name change in 1973 , Social Biology declared that this " does not coincide with any change of its interests or policies . "
Although usually avoiding the word " eugenics , " Social Biology still publishes many articles on eugenics topics .
Reducing birthrates Frederick Osborn ( 1889 - 1981 ) , an officer of the American Eugenics Society / SSSB for more than 30 years , promoted eugenics through his many connections in the great private foundations and the mega - wealthy Rockefeller family .
He helped John D. Rockefeller III establish the Population Council in 1952 , served as the council 's first administrator and was on its board of trustees for many years .
Convinced that reducing the birthrate of the poor and uneducated would help improve the human race , Osborn used the Population Council to spread birth control to such people .
The council supported abortifacient research as early as 1954 , when abortion was still illegal .
On Jan. 12 , 1966 , Osborn wrote a fellow eugenicist about the council 's work in developing new methods of birth control such as intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) .
" We have felt this could be done far more effectively , " Osborn wrote , " in the name of the Population Council than in the name of eugenics .
. . .
Personally , I think it is the most important practical eugenic measure ever taken . "
In a March 5 , 1969 , letter to Rockefeller , Osborn made a similar statement : " The best hope of improving the genetic qualities of the race lies in the universal extension of effective and easy means of birth control . "
Osborn 's good friend and eugenics colleague , Frank Notestein of Princeton University , succeeded him as president of the Population Council .
Notestein 's papers at Princeton show that he wanted to manipulate entire nations -- poor nations -- so they would drastically lower their birthrates and modernize their economies .
In 1971 notes , he said that social change does not come about through " an explicit and overt attack on the central value structure . "
Instead , he suggested , it happens through " an initial and progressively effective subversion obtained by the expansion of an existing minority tendency until it comes to be the central core position . "
Someone who " wants to get rid of the extended family , " Notestein added , " does not start by legislating against that holy of holies . "
Instead : " You strengthen the special mobility [ apparently meaning young couples ' moving away from their older relatives ] by appealing to other values and the mobility atrophies the family . "
While Notestein claimed to be working for the welfare of people in poor nations , he clearly had U.S. interests in mind .
During World War II , his Office of Population Research conducted demographic work for the State Department .
Notestein also took part in secret post - war planning by the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , a private group with major influence on public policy .
According to an index of the CFR studies , they included discussion of India and the Philippines as examples of " colonial overpopulation " and consideration of " policy toward areas of heavy population pressure . "
The CFR project also emphasized U.S. access to raw materials in the poor nations -- an issue of great interest to many wealthy businessmen who belonged to CFR .
Two of them , Hugh Moore and William H. Draper Jr. , were to become major population - control activists .
Moore and Draper believed that population control in poor nations could help prevent instability there -- and thus fight communism and maintain U.S. access to raw materials .
A wealthy colleague , Lammot du Pont Copeland , made this point in a Feb.
1 , 1960 , letter inviting key people to a Moore - Draper meeting to raise money for population control .
Suggesting that poverty is aggravated by rapid population increase , Copeland added , " With the communists capitalizing on this situation , we in the industrialized West are threatened with the loss of raw materials essential to our way of life -- and in fact vital to our defense . "
Moore and Draper established the Population Crisis Committee to lobby for government involvement in population control .
Their organization still exists , under the newer name of Population Action International , and still lobbies among the elites in Washington .
The elites apparently are easy to influence .
In a Sept. 23 , 1969 , letter , Hugh Moore recalled his recruitment of former Sen. Kenneth Keating , R - N.Y. , as chairman of the Population Crisis Committee .
" The senator knew nothing about population problems at that point , " Moore said .
" But I told him not to worry .
I would get him the best men in the field to write his speeches . " q Meehan , who writes from Maryland , has done extensive research on eugenics in many archives Advice : ' Weaken ' the Church Population controller Hugh Moore relied heavily on his aide , T.O. Griessemer .
In a Jan. 5 , 1965 , strategy memo to his boss , Griessemer suggested : " Weaken and divide the opposition to a sound U.S. population policy , the major source of which still is the Catholic Church . "
Referring to " an incipient revolution within the Catholic Church with regard to birth control , " Griessemer said that " we should encourage the rebels . "
Moore and others did that , and were generally pleased with the results .
In a Sept. 20 , 1969 , letter to William H. Draper Jr. , Moore boasted that " we have pretty well won the battle with the old men in the Vatican . "
In the same letter , however , Moore doubted that voluntary methods of birth control " can do the job in time to save civilization . "
He suggested : " Involuntary birth control would have to be approached step by step , perhaps starting in the United States by wiping out the tax benefits accorded parents of large families .
. .
And go on from there ! " -- Mary Meehan ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

When name - calling kills ( interview with William Brennan , author of " Dehumanizing the Vulnerable : When Word Games Take Lives " )
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's lawyer met Monday with the independent counsel hired by the state Personnel Board to discuss that agency 's investigation into her firing of Alaska 's public safety commissioner , campaign officials said .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is being investigated for the possibly improper firing of a state official .
Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , has been battling allegations she fired Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan for improper reasons in July .
Palin 's attorney , Thomas Van Flein , met with special counsel Timothy Petumenos to discuss documents and witness interviews , campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said .
Stapleton was asked whether Palin would agree to be interviewed by the special counsel .
" If necessary and Mr. Petumenos wants it , absolutely , " Stapleton replied .
" We believe and expect Mr. Petumenos has demonstrated that he is fair and impartial and is searching for the truth and facts behind Monegan 's reassignment , " Stapleton said .
" The governor stands ready to cooperate . "
Monegan says he was fired after he refused to fire the governor 's ex-brother - in - law , a state trooper involved in an acrimonious divorce with Palin 's sister .
Palin has denied any wrongdoing , telling Fox News last week that Monegan was " insubordinate " in disputes over budget issues .
She originally agreed to cooperate with the state Legislature 's probe of the affair , which was launched by a bipartisan committee in July .
But since she became Sen. John McCain 's running mate in August , Palin argued the legislative inquiry has become a partisan matter .
The governor now insists the Alaska Personnel Board is the " only legal form in the state for the Monegan inquiry , " as Stapleton told reporters .
Palin has asked the Personnel Board to review and dismiss Monegan 's allegations .
The three - member Alaska Personnel Board is appointed by the governor .
The current members were appointed by Palin 's predecessor , Frank Murkowski , though she reappointed one earlier this year .
Last week , Palin 's husband Todd and several top aides refused to comply with subpoenas issued by a state Senate committee on September 12 , arguing the probe was illegitimate and that the governor was protected by a state law that bars ethics investigations of candidates for state office .
The Legislature 's inquiry is scheduled to be completed October 10 .
But the lawmaker managing that probe , Democratic state Sen .
Hollis French , has been the target of GOP attacks since a September 2 interview with ABC News in which he suggested the investigation could yield an " October surprise " for the ticket .
Republican lawmakers filed suit in Anchorage , asking a judge to shut down the investigation , and a similar suit was filed by Palin supporters in Fairbanks , Alaska .
Stapleton said Petumenos , who will have subpoena power , was " truly acting independent . "
And campaign spokesman Ed O'Callaghan said the campaign was " not privy " to details of what the personnel board was seeking .
O'Callaghan , a former federal prosecutor , said he was consulting with Van Flein " as he requests . "

You are here : Home / Funny Stuff / Worldwide Places Hit by the Blue Screen Of Death
The Blue Screen of Death has visited most of us more than just a few times .
As we use our computers for office , gaming , or regular daily use , the infamous Microsoft error pops up and frustrates us again and again .
This error has many different faces and falls under various categories but the outcome is the sameâ€ ¦anger , denial , and cursing .
This recurring incident happens to beginner , intermediate , and expert tech users .
We cannot avoid the BSOD and it has become an unwanted guest in our computer .
These are worldwide places that were hit by the Blue Screen Of Death visiting our daily lives in public areas , which most of us depend upon .
Some of the following are services , some are leisure activities , but all are really annoying .
1. The Paris in Las Vegas
The Las Vegas strip is a major tourist attraction , and the lights , noise and money rolling through keeps people coming .
It is unfortunate that the Blue Screen Of Death had to appear in the Paris in Vegas bringing some bystanders down and making people blue .
â€ ˜What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegasâ€™ ?
Not when the BSOD is involved .
2. Microsoft Error invades Piccadilly Circus
London may be a city that is innovative , continually growing and a major center of the world , but even they had to suffer and be humiliated by a Windows Error .
Rosso caught this one in Piccadilly Circus , and although this particular error is not a classic BSOD , it is a major malfunction nonetheless and deserves a top spot .
3.Video Games Arcade
So here you are walking into an arcade to replace the regular computer screen , office work and are simply looking forward to some senseless arcade spending .
You come across a Fast and the Furious Arcade Game that probably charges more than a quarter to play , but something has gone array .
It seems it has fallen ill thanks to a certain Operating System , and revoked your driving privileges .
You will just have to pick a different game , for this one is here no more .
Oh wait , lib_rachel has noticed that the next game has also fallen to the hands of the enemy .
4. Fidelity Investments
If you have invested with Fidelity Investments and then saw a Bluish glow smiling at you outside their building , would you worry about your money ?
It may not be their fault , but it is still scary that your money is placed and plagued by the same errors .
5. Airports
Whether you are traveling with your own computer , using an Internet Cafe at the airport , or simply killing time before your flight , would you be worried if you saw the arrival or departure screen has fallen to a display as famous as presented ?
It may be just one computer , one screen , or just a few seconds , but it may disturb more than a few wondering if it will also hit the big birds in the sky .
The third image is the cherry on top .
It seems that no airports can get away from the BSOD .
I have been through Prague and also Heathrow on some occasions ; usually on a transfer flight .
Both are busy airports and are full with travelers looking to get from point A to point B and so on .
6. Subways
The first image may not be the from the New York Subway , but it is a subway hit by an unfortunate decoration that works beautifully with the public transportation lighting below the ground .
The trains may try to go fast and leave this embarrassment behind , unfortunately , it was caught on camera , presenting the additional victims .
7. 2008 Beijing Olympics
It has been four years since the previous Summer Olympics , and Beijing has offered a beautiful opening ceremony as we have grown to expect .
The only catch is the blue screen of death striking the birdâ€™s nest during this particular Beijing Olympics opening ceremony .
Moreover , this incident occurred during the torch lighting , so there is a major shock value involved , granting extra downtime , frustration , and disappointment .
8. The Big Apple New York
Moreover , if you wanted to get away and use the subways , PoitNarf has noticed that you would have encountered the same crash when getting a Metro Card .
9. Fast Food Restaurants
Can we ever get away from this SOB BSOD ?
Even the huge corporation of McDonaldâ€™s cannot deny the power of the Blue .
With all the health issues that surround McDonaldâ€™s food , would you consider this display beneficial for the individual by denying them their order ?
10 . Gas Stations
How are we supposed to get around without the gas for our cars ?
Is every single machine using a Windows Operating System as its foundation ?
iJustine has made sure to get a record of a Windows failure when attempting to get some fuel , and benrodian was also unable to fill up the tank .
With the the high prices of gas , could it possible be that the BSOD actually saved us money ?
11 . ATM and Parking
As expected , the Blue Screen of Death keeps infecting things that we have become dependent on besides our personal computers .
Based on james73_2007 , you wouldnâ€™t be able to use the ATM at your local mall and once you decide to leave , paying for parking was difficult for elzapp .
a Catch 22 : you cannot take out cash at the mall for shopping and cannot leave the parking place to go home .
12 . Microsoft Corporationâ€¦
It is pretty hilarious and fulfilling to see the Blue Screen Of Death bite the hand that feeds it .
Dear olâ€™ Bill Gates and Microsoft cannot deny the power of the Blue just like all of us .
The video presented shows it flat out during a Windows 98 conference with Bill Gates dumbfounded and perhaps a little afraid that the student became stronger then its maker .
Do you feel bad for Bill or does a certain satisfaction creep up ?
Oh the sweet taste of revenge !
Palin favorability rating drops ten percent in three days RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email This " When John McCain picked Sarah Palin as his running mate late last month , the Alaska governor quickly became a media phenomenon , " Newsweek wrote late Tuesday .
" Largely unknown , she existed at first in something of an information vacuum , and due to the shock of her selection -- everyone loves a surprise -- the press rushed to fill the void with whatever data was easily available .
Mostly this consisted of human interest material ; Palin had plenty to go around .
Mooseburgers .
Float planes .
Ice Fishing .
Beauty pageants .
Teen pregnancy .
Et cetera .
By the end of her first 15 minutes in the spotlight -- which included her speech at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul -- Palin existed mostly as an idea : a frontier supermom who'd triumphed over adversity ( the Ol ' Boys Club , the " liberal media " ) .
Palin spent her first week reading from a teleprompter and avoiding questions from the press -- and the public -- so as not to sully this first impression . "
Excerpts :
###
The polls reflected the early success of her strategy .
In the three days after Palin joined Team McCain -- Aug .
29-31--32 percent of voters told the pollsters at Diageo / Hotline that they had a favorable opinion of her ; most ( 48 percent ) did n't know enough to say .
By Sept. 4 , however , 43 percent of Diageo / Hotline respondents approved of Palin with only 25 percent disapproving -- an 18 - point split .
Apparently , voters were liking what they were hearing .
Four days later , Palin 's approval rating had climbed to 47 percent ( +17 ) , and by Sept. 13 it had hit 52 percent .
The gap at that point between her favorable and unfavorable numbers -- 22 percent -- was larger than either McCain 's ( +20 ) or Obama 's ( +13 ) .
But then a funny thing happened : Palin lost some of her luster .
Since Sept. 13 , Palin 's unfavorables have climbed from 30 percent to 36 percent .
Meanwhile , her favorables have slipped from 52 percent to 48 percent .
That 's a three - day net swing of - 10 points , and it leaves her in the Sept. 15 Diageo / Hotline tracking poll with the smallest favorability split ( +10 ) of any of the Final Four .
Over the course of a single weekend , in other words , Palin went from being the most popular White House hopeful to the least .
FULL STORY HERE .
Ms Nixon , 55 , said she was sad to be leaving , but was '' excited about doing other things ' ' .
She said despite offers from the Government to continue , she believes it 's time to go after nearly eight years in the top job and 36 years as a police officer .
She thanked Premier John Brumby and Police Minister Bob Cameron for their support and said she believed she was leaving Victoria Police in good order .
" I will remain with Victoria Police until the end of March next year to allow the Government to conduct a process to appoint a new chief commissioner and then I will consider a range of options for my future , '' she said .
" No decision like this is easy , however , I always believe that it 's important to know the right time to go .
" I 've watched our former premier Steve Bracks and John Stewart , the CEO of NAB , who have made smooth transitions out of their organisations with little disruption .
I 've also talked to a range of people who 've made these choices and learned a lot from their advice .
" Importantly the right time has coincided with the view that the organisation will continue to forge forward with strong and talented leadership . ''
Deputy commissioners Simon Overland and Kieran Walshe are front - runners to replace her .
Acknowledging the support of her husband and parents , who attended this morning 's media conference , Ms Nixon said the job had taken a toll on her family .
Ms Nixon said the force was outstanding at all levels and had committed , enthusiastic and energetic members who wanted to get on with the future .
She admitted she had her differences with the Police Association .
" We certainly had our ups and downs , but I think we 're on the same track , working for our members , " she said .
Speaking at the police union 's headquarters in East Melbourne this afternoon , Police Assocciateion Assistant Secretary Bruce McKenzie said there had been differences between the association and Ms Nixon .
" The Police Association has certainly had its professional differences with Chief Commisioner Christine Nixon - that fact cannot be denied or erased , " he said .
Mr McKenzie acknowldeged Ms Nixon 's contribution in regards to the success of the Purana taskforce .
He said the Police Association was looking forward to working with the new chief commissioner , who " should be a Victorian " .
" The time for interstate experimentation is over , " he said .
Shadow police minister Andrew McIntosh told Radio 3AW earlier today the State Government had failed to provide adequate resources for police to do their job .
" Christine Nixon has done the best job in the circumstance where this government has totally failed to adequately resource Victoria police over a large number of years , '' Mr McIntosh told Radio 3AW .
" A record level of violent crimes , some 43,000 crimes in the state of Victoria is an indictment of this Government and lack of resourcing to Victoria Police . ''
Ms Nixon 's seven - year tenure has involved a fraught relationship with the Police Association , the arrests of three senior officers over in an Office of Police Integrity investigation and the culmination of Melbourne 's deadly gangland war .
Just last month she reimbursed Qantas over a controversial free flight she and her husband took to Los Angeles on the A380 superjumbo .
Australia 's first woman police chief , the former NSW senior officer was the first outsider to lead the Victorian force in nearly 50 years .
She soon ran foul of the Police Association when she disbanded the drug squad following allegations of corruption , and the relationship soured further over the ensuing years .
Chief Commissioner
Nixon brought in another outsider , Simon Overland from the Australian Federal Police , to lead the Purana taskforce which successfully ended nearly a decade of gangland wars .
Two of her most senior staff were disgraced last year when an Office of Police Integrity inquiry into a chain of leaks that sabotaged a murder investigation exposed treachery and jealousy at the highest levels of the Victorian force .
Her style of leadership grates with old - school cops who say she is responsible for a breakdown in discipline .
But others say hers is a modern approach to police management .

' No shirt , no shoes , no service ' : Pro-fams nearing boycott of industry as a whole
by Jeremy Hooper
Speaking about the myriad of companies that have rightfully come out against the cruel , discriminatory , intellectually bankrupt , un-American measure known as Proposition 8 , California anti-gay activist Randy Thomasson has the following advice for his fellow biased peeps :
" Boycott and remove themselves as customers from Levi's , from Pacific Gas & Electric if possible , from AT&T which is surely possible , " ... "
I do n't even want to see Steven Spielberg movies anymore because that man donated $ 100,000 for defeat of marriage between a man and a woman . "
...
" The attack of the darkness should get the people who know what is true and [ what ] is right motivated "
But Randster is of course calling us " the darkness " in that good , loving , moral , Christian way .
Lest ye be confused or anything .
Keep an eye out for future updates on Randy 's war , when we predict he 'll announce a boycott of the water and oxygen that have been fundamental to our gay lives .
List of Prop. 8 opponents now includes Levi's [ ONN ]
** Oh , and Randy is also pissed at Google : Wingnuts Launch Google Boycott [ J.M.G ]
Your thoughts
I am so sick of the rhetoric of these anti-gay folks .
They make it sound as if traditional marriage is going to be banned if Prop 8 or any of these amendments fail .
No one is calling man-woman marriage discriminatory .
No allowing same - sex marriage is .
Geez .
Enough already .
If all it 's going to take to keep opposite - sex couples from marrying is letting same - sex couples marry , then I guess the institution was n't too strong to begin with .

Jennifer Aniston Gets Neuron Named After Her - And Maybe We Get A Clue To Mind Reading
It seems not everyone can forget the " Friends " television show .
Angelina Jolie may have gotten Brad Pitt but Jennifer Aniston is the one with her own namesake neuron .
Professor Rodrigo Quian Quiroga , neuroscientist and bio-engineer , whose research was recently cited among the top papers in the world , is to reveal details of his studies into what has been dubbed the ‘ Jennifer Aniston neuron ’ during a public presentation at the University of Leicester .
Quiroga discovered that a remarkable type of neuron in the brain fired in an ‘ abstract ’ manner to completely different pictures of familiar persons , for example Jennifer Aniston or Halle Berry .
He further discovered that given the firing of these neurons , it was possible to actually tell what the subjects were seeing far above chance – they were literally reading the mind .
Professor Quian Quiroga said : “ One of the major scientific challenges of our days is to understand how information is represented by neurons in the brain .
Although there has been spectacular progress in the last few decades , we are still far from comprehending , for example , how visual inputs are processed to create a conscious perception .
Our main research interest is to study these principles of Neural Coding .
Moreover , since complex behaviour is encoded by the activity of large populations of neurons , we are working on the development of advanced methods to extract useful information from these data . ”
Professor Quian Quiroga , of the Department of Engineering , will deliver his inaugural Professorial lecture on Tuesday 4 November .
The lecture , The Jennifer Aniston neuron :
How the brain perceives the world and forms new memories , is free and open to the public .
It takes place in Lecture Theatre 1 , Ken Edwards Building starting at 5.30 pm .
Professor Quian Quiroga said : “ I am examining how information about the external world ( what we see , hear , touch ) and our own internal representations ( e.g. memories , emotions , etc. ) is represented by neurons in the brain .
“ For example , we can easily recognize a person in a fraction of a second , even when seen from different angles , with different sizes , colours , contrasts and under strikingly different conditions .
But how neurons in the brain are capable of creating such an ‘ abstract ’ representation , disregarding basic visual details , is only starting to be known . ”
Quiroga will describe how his research has high clinical potential for the development of NeuroProsthetic devices , such as robotic arms driven by neural signals to be used by paralyzed patients .
He says his discovery has far - reaching implications not only for the development of neuronal prostheses , but for treatment of patients with pathologies involving the hippocampal formation , such as epilepsy , Alzheimers and schizophrenia and for further understanding of how perceptions and memories are represented in the brain .
Quiroga graduated in Physics at the University of Buenos Aires , Argentina , in 1993 .
After 2 years working at the Department of Physiology in the Institute for Neurological Investigations – FLENI , Argentina , and one further year at the Department of Epilepsy of the same institute , he moved to Germany and obtained his PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Luebeck in 1998 .
He was a post - doctoral fellow at the Research Center Juelich , Germany , from 1998 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2004 he was a Sloan fellow at the California Institute of Technology , USA .
He was appointed as a Lecturer in Bioengineering at the Department of Engineering of the University of Leicester in 2004 , was promoted to Reader in 2006 and to a personal chair in 2008 .
Quiroga 's main research focus is on Neuroscience and the analysis of electrophysiological data .
This research involves the use and development of advanced methods of signal processing .
In particular , he developed an automatic method for processing the neural data that is currently used by several neurophysiology laboratories .
The use of this method allowed the finding of a new type of ‘ abstract ’ ( e.g. Jennifer Aniston ) neurons in the human brain that was published in Nature , obtained the first prize at an international meeting in 2005 in Madrid and received world - wide media attention , including articles in the New York Times , Scientific American , Daily Mail , New Scientist , The Independent , etc .
It has also been selected as one of the top 100 scientific stories of 2005 by Discover Magazine .
In 2008 , his follow - up work in this line of research was selected as one of the “ Breaking news in Neuroscience ” by the european Federation of Neuroscience Societies ( fENS ) .
Quiroga is a member of the editorial board of 3 international journals .
He acts as reviewer for several international journals in the fields of Applied Mathematics , Physics , Signal Analysis , Clinical Neurophysiology and Neuroscience .
He has given more than 30 invited lectures in the last 3 years , had published more than 50 refereed journal papers and currently holds 2 EPSRC grants , 1 MRC grant and 1 grant from the Royal Society .
He is the head of the Bioengineering Research Group , at the Department of Engineering of the University of Leicester .
WASHINGTON  Before invading Iraq in 2003 , the Bush administration mounted a significant diplomatic offensive to rally international support , and officials at the White House , Pentagon and State Department went to great lengths to trumpet those nations that joined what they termed “ the coalition of the willing . ”
But historians researching those early alliance - building efforts say they are troubled by what seem to be deletions of and alterations to the early official lists of nations that supported the war effort .
The lists were posted on the White House Web site .
While administration officials acknowledged that the number of nations supporting the war changed over time , academic researchers say three official lists appear to have been changed , yet retained their original release date , making them appear to be unaltered originals .
Two other White House lists appear to have been taken off the Web site , according to a study of the documents by Scott L. Althaus and Kalev H. Leetaru of the Cline Center for Democracy at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
I 've mentioned Volatility here before and I use it in my day job doing malware analysis .
The problem is , I know it is capable of doing a lot more than I am currently using it for , but I rarely have the time to sit down and play with it and learn how to use it better .
So , I was very pleased when I noticed that Michael Hale Ligh has written 2 pieces on how to use Volatility to find DLLs that have been stealthily injected into running processes .
The first is Locating Hidden Clampi DLLs and the second is entitled Recovering Coreflood Binaries with Volatility .
Does anyone else out there have any other tools / methods they use for trying to detect and analyze these DLL injections ( or even non-stealthy ones ) ?
Let me know via the contact page and I 'll update this story .
EU energy ministers meeting last week in Luxembourg have given final approval to an EU - wide ban on incandescent light bulbs that would begin in 2010 .
The switch to energy - saving bulbs , first ordered at last year ’s Brussels summit as part of an aggressive energy policy to fight climate change , was approved at the negotiations leading up to a meeting of European heads of state , being held next week .

Traditional incandescent cost around 1/3 as much as standard compact fluorescent lightbulbs ( CFLs ) .
But the CFLs last longer and use less energy while illuminated .
Incandescent filament light bulbs use up to five times as much energy as standard CFLs .
Advocates claim that replacing the worst - performing lamps with today ’s best available technology will reduce domestic energy consumption for lighting by 60 percent ; equivalent to preventing 30 million tons of CO2 pollution every year .
The move would help EU member states meet their proposed emissions reductions of 20 % by 2020 , targets that may currently be in question because of the lingering economic crisis .
Not everyone is enthusiastic about switch the CFL technology .
Opponents to the measure argue that the fluorescent bulbs take a long time to warm up and sometimes have a tendency to flicker .
The bulbs are also too big for some ( very ) old - fashioned fittings and are generally more expensive – although the EU has vowed costs will come down before 2010 .
CFLs also carry the added baggage of potential health risks and environmental problems because of the mercury found in each bulb .
However , all of the arguments used against compact fluorescents cannot be levied against LED technology .
Light emitting diodes , are said to be brighter , safer , and longer lasting than even the best CFL technology .
However , until the cost of LEDs comes down , a large - scale switchover to that technology remains several years away .
But with directives like this latest one from the EU , it is quite likely that the price of LEDs will come down as businesses ramp - up development and production .
The new light bulb scheme will initially apply to bulbs of 75 watts and higher and the phasing out of the traditional bulbs will come into effect beginning March 1 , 2009 .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Boosted by foreclosures and plunging prices in the West , sales of pre-owned homes and condos rose sharply in September to the highest level in 13 months , an industry trade group reported Friday .
Existing - home sales rose 5.5 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.18 million , the National Association of Realtors estimated Friday .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expected sales to rise to a 5 million pace from 4.91 million in August .
See Economic Calendar .
It was the largest monthly percentage increase in five years .
Read the full report .
Sales of existing homes were 1.4 % higher in September than they were a year earlier ; it was the first year - on - year increase in nearly three years .
Housing : More Doom & Gloom Ahead
The report measures home sales closed in September on sales contracts signed one or two months earlier .
Credit became less available in late September and in October after the global credit crunch tightened .
The median sales price fell 9 % in the past year to $ 191,600 , the lowest since April 2004 .
Prices plunged 18.5 % in the West region in the past year , driven by rising foreclosures and distressed sales .
Sales surged a record 17 % in the West in September , representing about two - thirds of the growth in national home sales in the month .
Distressed sales -- such as short sales or foreclosures -- represent about 35 % to 40 % of total sales nationwide , the NAR said , and as many as half of the homes sold in California , Nevada and other former bubble regions .
Foreclosed homes sold at auction are not included in the sales figures .
The increase in sales could be a " first step " in a global recovery , said Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the real estate trade group .
" The first step is for buyers to return to the marketplace , " he said .
Later , home prices can improve , leading to more confidence in mortgage - backed securities and in financial markets overall .
" Prices do n't have to fall much more , " said Bill Hampel , chief economist for the Credit Union National Association .
" Current prices seem to be sufficient to absorb " the number of homes coming onto the market due to default .
" We have a ways to go on prices " before we 've seen the bottom , said Bob Walters , chief economist for Quicken Loans .
California still has many more painful adjustments to make , including a large number of option adjustable rate loans that will soon reset , he said .
Inventories of unsold homes on the market fell 1.6 % to 4.27 million , representing a 9.9 - month supply at the September sales pace .
Sales of single - family homes rose 6.2 % in September and are up 3.8 % in the past year .
Sales of condos were unchanged in September and are down 15.7 % in the past year .
Yun said he believed the bottom had been seen in terms of sales , but the recession made his forecast highly uncertain .
Sales soared 16.8 % in September in the West and are up 34.4 % in the past year .
Sales rose 4.4 % in the Midwest , and 2.2 % in the South .
Sales fell 1.2 % in the Northeast .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The tally of failed banks in 2008 rose to 19 as the government announced that a Texas and a California bank had been shuttered Friday night .
Franklin Bank , a Houston , Texas - based bank and Security Pacific Bank , a Los Angeles , Calif . - based bank were shut down by state regulators Friday , marking the 18th and 19th bank failures this year .
Franklin Bank ( FBTX ) had total assets of $ 5.1 billion and total deposits of $ 3.7 billion as of Sept. 30 , 2008 , according to a statement on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .'s
Web site .
Ironically , Lewis Ranieri , the 61 - year - old co-founder and chairman of parent Franklin Bank Corp. , is credited with inventing mortgage - backed securities two decades ago , the AP reported , back when he worked at Salomon Brothers , where he is a former vice chairman .
Franklin Bank Corp. just Sunday said it had received proposals for transactions to strengthen Franklin Bank 's capital position and was keeping regulators informed of the talks ' progress , according to the Associated Press .
Security Pacific Bank had total assets of $ 561.1 million and total deposits of $ 450.1 million as of October 17 , 2008 , according to the FDIC .
Prosperity Bank ( PRSP ) , based in El Campo , Texas , will assume all of the deposits of the failed Texas bank , including those that exceed the insurance limit and brokered accounts .
Depositors of the failed bank will automatically become depositors of Prosperity .
In addition to taking over the deposits of the failed Franklin Bank , Prosperity will purchase $ 850 million of assets .
The FDIC will retain the remaining assets to dispose of later .
Pacific Western Bank of Los Angeles will assume all of the deposits of Security Pacific Bank and will purchase approximately $ 51.8 million of the assets .
The FDIC will hold on to the remaining assets to dispose of later .
The failed Houston bank 's 46 offices will open as branches of Prosperity under normal hours , including Saturday hours .
The deal will give Prosperity more than 170 banking locations in Texas .
Security Pacific 's four branches will reopen on Monday as branches of Pacific Western .
Customers of both banks should continue to use their existing branches , according to separate press releases on the FDIC 's website .
Dan Rollins , president of Prosperity Bank , in a statement said records will be fully integrated during the first quarter of 2009 .
" The customers will be able to go about their business as usual ; they will be able to access their money and use their ATM / debit card , Internet banking , bill pay service or other electronic banking services beginning Saturday morning , " said Rollins .
Security Pacific customers can continue to access their funds via ATM , checks or debit cards , according to the FDIC .
In Friday 's announcement about Franklin Bank , the FDIC said that the cost of its failure to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be between $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.6 billion .
Meanwhile , Security Pacific 's failure , the third in California this year , will cost the FDIC $ 210 million .
The FDIC said that for both banks , acquisition of their deposits was the least costly resolution .
Smaller regional banks have been under pressure as the financial crisis continues to take its toll .
Prosperity Chief Executive David Zalman said in a statement that his bank was " committed to taking care of their existing and new customers during this volatile time in the financial industry . "
2 ) Fractional reserve banking vastly increases the supply of savings available for investment .
I do n't know about you , but I can't afford to lock up a chunk of my savings for six months to two years .
The money in my savings and money market accounts is there for a reason -- I do n't know when I 'll need it .
I have longer term savings in stock funds , but that 's superfluous money .
Hedge funds and private equity can demand long lockups because they are using surplus money that their investors do n't expect to need - - really need -- any time soon .
The less affluent have to have a reasonably large cushion they can get their hands on in case of emergency , such as car repairs or a really good deal on a jet ski .
Without fractional reserve banking , that would be dead money , sitting in a vault somewhere .
Indeed , they 'd probably end up paying someone to guard it for them .
Maturity - matched lending also has enormous transaction costs .
Most companies do n't want to borrow in $ 2,000 increments .
The search costs of finding someone who wants to loan the amount you want at the time period you want , or a pool of same , is huge .
There 's a reason that private equity has big minimum buy - ins , and tends not to disburse amounts in the size of an auto loan .
Trying to maturity match loans would essentially kill the market for both borrowing and lending in small amounts .
Fractional reserve banking puts that money to work .
It gives us periodic crises .
But by putting all that extra money to work in productive investments , it also gives us the wherewithal to pay for the periodic crises .
3 ) The financial market can still have big crises .
AIG went down on credit default swaps -- aka insurance ( or , if you prefer , gambling ) -- not short paper .
Huge defaults on duration - matched securities can take down institutions in a domino - like fashion ( remember Latin America ? Russia ? )
Borrowing and lending money are risky endeavors .
They are unfortunately necessary in a society where the people with the good ideas are n't always the people with the money .
Maybe I should add
4 ) It 's a political nonstarter .
Maybe in some mad moment you could prohibit fractional reserve banking .
Right up to the point where people find out that instead of getting interest on their checking account they have to pay the bank to guard their money , and can't prepay their mortgage .
I doubt even my credit hawk commenters would like to find that , like companies , they might be stuck with paying 10 % for all thirty years of their loan if they happened to borrow in a bad year .
Brazil Post Stock Market Crash Profit Plays
Martin Hutchinson writes : most other markets , Brazil has been battered by the credit crisis – the BOVESPA index is currently down 28 % in October alone and no less than 52 % from its peak as recently as May .
It now appears to represent excellent value , with a historic Price / Earnings ( P/E ) ratio of only 7.0 .
But are Brazil 's prospects good enough to justify investing there ?
Brazil was included in the “ BRIC ” ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) group of rapidly emerging markets that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS ) created in 2003 .
At that time the country did n't deserve the distinction .
Long - term growth since the 1970s had averaged less than 2 % per capita , and the country had barely avoided bankruptcy in 2002 .
Every time the world had experienced a credit crunch , Brazil had been caught up in it , chiefly because of the country 's enormous international debt load .
Brazil got lucky .
First , socialist President Luis Inacio “ Lula ” da Silva proved to be surprisingly moderate , not much to the left , economically , of previous Brazilian governments , perfectly willing to welcome foreign investment and generally friendly to the United States .
Also , in 2003 , energy and commodity prices began their long climb as part of a worldwide commodities rally that saw prices peak at astronomical levels earlier this year .
Since Brazil was not an oil exporter , there was no one single source of new wealth that the government could seize .
Instead , revenue flowed to mining companies , the oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA , better - known as Petrobras ( ADR : PBR ) , and numerous agri-business operations that benefited from the rise in agricultural prices .
It did n't hurt at all when in November 2007 Petrobras discovered about 36 billion barrels of oil in an offshore Brazilian field .
Even Brazil 's ethanol program , which had been a hopeless boondoggle for a generation since it started during the oil crisis of 1979 - 82 , suddenly became the envy of the world , as rising oil prices made Brazilian sugarcane the world 's cheapest and most economically and ecologically efficient source of newly fashionable ethanol .
With oil prices down in the $ 20 - a - barrel range , the ethanol - from - sugar program was a typical example of misguided Third World government planning .
But at $ 140 a barrel , it was a bonanza .
Even at $ 60 a barrel , it is still a useful diversification from petroleum .
Brazil 's debt position improved after 2002 in three ways :
The outstanding amount of debt has been reduced through modest repayments .
Its ratio to gross domestic product ( GDP ) has dropped sharply , as GDP in dollar terms has shot up with the revaluation of the Brazilian real against the dollar .
And its interest costs have dropped with Brazil 's improving creditworthiness and the generally low level of global interest rates .
Brazil 's ascension to “ investment grade ” status in spring 2008 appeared to cement the improvement in place ; its public sector debt to GDP ratio in June 2008 was around 40 % , lower than Britain 's , for example .
The financial crisis and economic downturn of 2008 has made life more difficult for Brazil .
Oil and other commodity prices have sharply declined , reducing the value of Brazil 's exports .
The real has declined over 30 % against the dollar , increasing Brazil 's foreign debt , which is mostly dollar - denominated .
The Brazilian stock market 's decline will undoubtedly have a substantial negative wealth effect , making it more difficult for Brazilian entrepreneurs to finance new projects .
On the other hand , a forecast by The Economist has Brazil still growing at 4.6 % in 2008 and 3.4 % in 2009 , with consumer prices rising 6.0 % .
The Central Bank of Brazil has a good grip on inflation , with its Selic short - term rate at no less than 13.75 % , while it is injecting funds into the banking system to battle the global liquidity shortage .
With continued economic growth , modest inflation , and stock prices at bargain levels for U.S. investors , Brazil is well worth considering .
There are more than 30 Brazilian companies with full American Depository Receipt ( ADR ) listings on the New York Stock Exchange , plus 40 to 50 more traded on the over - the - counter market .
A few attractive examples you might want to look include :
Banco Itau Holding Financeira SA ( ITU ) .
This stock features a Price / Earnings
There are three large banks listed on the New York Stock Exchange :
The other two are the other two are Banco Bradesco SA ( ADR : BBD ) and Uniao Bancos Brasile SA ( Unibanco ) ( ADR : UBB ) .
However , Itau is the cheapest of the three , though only slightly .
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce , now referred to only as Vale ( ADR : RIO ) .
This is one of the true global blue chips .
It has a market capitalization of almost $ 56 billion , and its stock has fallen by fully 75 % since May .
It is an iron - ore company with ancillary operations in gold , nickel , copper and other metals , and its shares are trading about four times projected 2008 earnings .
The stock features a 5.0 % yield .
As one of the world 's low cost producers of iron ore , it should bounce back once conditions become more clear .
Petroleo Brasileiro SA , better known as Petrobras ( ADR : PBR ) .
Petrobras is one of the few emerging market oil companies with access to modern technology and willingness to work with the oil majors .
Down by 60 % in the last five months , the stock 's prospective P/E ratio is now only 5.5 .
It has a dividend yield of 1.3 % .
Petrobras remains a fairly low cost oil producer , since its production comes from conventional , albeit offshore sources .
Companhia de Saneamento Basico , also known as Sabesp ( ADR : SBS ) .
This is the water - and - sewage system for Sao Paulo .
Now that 's a growth business , and is one that 's not dependent on commodity prices or on rapid Brazilian economic growth .
The shares feature a P/E ratio of only 3.1 and a yield of 8.0 % .
This one must surely be a bargain ; it has very little dependency on the economy .
Votorantim Celulose e Papel SA ( ADR : VCP ) .
This is a pulp - and - paper company , with a prospective P/E ratio of 6.0 and a dividend yield of 9.5 % .
Trees grow fast in the tropics ; VCP benefits from that !
Finally , you should consider the Brazilian ETF , the iShares MSCI Brazil Fund ( NYSE : EWZ ) .
The fund was more than $ 5 billion in size at Sept. 30 , and currently trades at a P/E of about 7.0 with a dividend yield of 3.0 % .
As I said , Brazilian stocks are currently in the bargain - basement category , and well worth a look

It ’s time to come out of the closet .
You know who you are .
May 30 , 2008 by deaconloadz

Apparently , a Japanese man recently found a woman living in his closet , according to Reuters .
After food kept disappearing from his kitchen , he found the woman out by catching her on a hidden camera .
Officers rushed to the house and found a 58 - year - old unemployed woman hiding in an unused closet , where she had secreted a mattress and plastic drink bottles , the Asahi said .
Police suspect she may have been there for several months , the paper said .
It ’s eerily similar to an experience I had as a college student at Pacific Tech when my roommate Mitch found out someone was living in our closet .
I did n’t tell the cops though .
We were too busy trying to stop a government controlled airborne laser weapon that we had developed …
A Million - user Comet Application with Mochiweb , Part 3
In Part 1 and Part 2 of this series we built a comet application using mochiweb , and learned how to route messages to connected users .
We managed to squeeze application memory down to 8 KB per connection .
We did ye olde c10 k test , and observed what happened with 10,000 connected users .
We made graphs .
It was fun , but now it 's time to make good on the claims made in the title , and turn it up to 1 million connections .
This post covers the following :
Add a pubsub - like subscription database using Mnesia
Generate a realistic friends dataset for a million users
Tune mnesia and bulk load in our friends data
Opening a million connections from one machine
Benchmark with 1 Million connected users
Libevent +
C for connection handling
Final thoughts
One of the challenging parts of this test was actually being able to open 1 M connections from a single test machine .
Writing a server to accept 1 M connections is easier than actually creating 1 M connections to test it with , so a fair amount of this article is about the techniques used to open 1 M connections from a single machine .
Getting our pubsub on
In Part 2 we used the router to send messages to specific users .
This is fine for a chat / IM system , but that there are sexier things we could do instead .
Before we launch into a large - scale test , let 's add one more module - a subscription database .
We want the application store who your friends are , so it can push you all events generated by people on your friends list .
My intention is to use this for Last . fm so I can get a realtime feed of songs my friends are currently listening to .
It could equally apply to other events generated on social networks .
Flickr photo uploads , Facebook newsfeed items , Twitter messages etc. FriendFeed even have a realtime API in beta , so this kind of thing is definitely topical .
( Although I 've not heard of anyone except Facebook using Erlang for this kind of thing ) .
Implementing the subscription - manager
We 're implementing a general subscription manager , but we 'll be subscribing people to everyone on their friends list automatically - so you could also think of this as a friends database for now .
The subsmanager API :
addsubscriptions ([ {Subscriber , Subscribee} , ... ] )
removesubscriptions ([ {Subscriber , Subscribee} , ... ] )
get_subscribers ( User )
subsmanager.erl
- module ( subsmanager ) . - behaviour ( gen_server ) . - include ( " /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/stdlib-1.15.4/include/qlc.hrl " ) . - export ( [ init / 1 , handle_call / 3 , handle_cast / 2 , handle_info / 2 , terminate / 2 , code_change / 3 ] ) . - export ( [ add_subscriptions / 1 , remove_subscriptions / 1 , get_subscribers / 1 , first_run / 0 , stop / 0 , start_link / 0 ] ) .
- record ( subscription , { subscriber , subscribee } ) . - record ( state , {} ) . % state is all in mnesia - define ( SERVER , global : whereis_name ( ? MODULE ) ) .
start_link ( ) -> gen_server : start_link ( { global , ?
MODULE } , ? MODULE , [ ] , [ ] ) . stop ( ) -> gen_server : call ( ? SERVER , { stop } ) .
add_subscriptions ( SubsList ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { add_subscriptions , SubsList } , infinity ) .
remove_subscriptions ( SubsList ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { remove_subscriptions , SubsList } , infinity ) .
get_subscribers ( User ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { get_subscribers , User } ) . % % init ( [ ] ) -> ok = mnesia : start ( ) , io : format ( " Waiting on mnesia tables . .
" , [ ] ) , mnesia : wait_for_tables ( [ subscription ] , 30000 ) , Info = mnesia : table_info ( subscription , all ) , io : format ( " OK .
Subscription table info :
~w
" , [ Info ] ) , { ok , # state {} }. handle_call ( { stop } , _ From , State ) -> { stop , stop , State } ; handle_call ( { add_subscriptions , SubsList } , _ From , State ) -> %
Transactionally is slower : % F = fun( ) -> % [ ok = mnesia : write ( S ) || S <- SubsList ] % end , % mnesia: transaction ( F ) , [ mnesia : dirty_write ( S ) || S <- SubsList ] , { reply , ok , State } ; handle_call ( { remove_subscriptions , SubsList } , _ From , State ) -> F = fun ( ) -> [ ok = mnesia : delete_object ( S ) || S <- SubsList ] end , mnesia : transaction ( F ) , { reply , ok , State } ; handle_call ( { get_subscribers , User } , From , State ) -> F = fun ( ) ->
Subs = mnesia : dirty_match_object ( #subscription { subscriber = ' _ ' , subscribee = User } ) , Users = [ Dude || # subscription { subscriber = Dude , subscribee = _} <- Subs ] , gen_server : reply ( From , Users ) end , spawn ( F ) , { noreply , State }. handle_cast ( _ Msg , State ) -> { noreply , State }. handle_info ( _ Msg , State ) -> { noreply , State }. terminate ( _ Reason , _ State ) -> mnesia : stop ( ) , ok .
code_change ( _ OldVersion , State , _ Extra ) -> io : format ( " Reloading code for ?
MODULE
" , [ ] ) , { ok , State }. % % first_run ( ) -> mnesia : create_schema ( [ node ( ) ] ) , ok = mnesia : start ( ) , Ret = mnesia : create_table ( subscription , [ { disc_copies , [ node ( ) ]} , { attributes , record_info ( fields , subscription ) } , { index , [ subscribee ]} , % index subscribee too { type , bag } ] ) , Ret .
Noteworthy points :
I 've included qlc.hrl , needed for mnesia queries using list comprehension , using an absolute path .
That can't be best practice , it was n't finding it otherwise though .
getsubscribers spawns another process and delegates the job of replying to that process , using genserver : reply .
This means the gen_server loop wo n't block on that call if we throw lots of lookups at it and mnesia slows down .
spawns another process and delegates the job of replying to that process , using .
This means the gen_server loop wo n't block on that call if we throw lots of lookups at it and mnesia slows down . rr(”subsmanager.erl ” ) .
in the example below allows you to use record definitions in the erl shell .
Putting your record definitions into a records.hrl file and including that in your modules is considered better style .
I inlined it for brevity .
Now to test it . first_run ( ) creates the mnesia schema , so it 's important to run that first .
Another potential gotcha with mnesia is that ( by default ) the database can only be accessed by the node that created it , so give the erl shell a name , and stick with it .
$ mkdir / var / mnesia $ erl - boot start_sasl - mnesia dir ' " / var/mnesia_data " ' - sname subsman ( subsman@localhost ) 1 > c ( subsmanager ) .
{ok , subsmanager} ( subsman@localhost ) 2 > subsmanager : first_run ( ) . ... {atomic , ok} ( subsman@localhost ) 3 > subsmanager : start_link ( ) .
Waiting on mnesia tables ..
OK .
Subscription table info : ... snipped ... {ok , < 0.105.0 > } ( subsman@localhost ) 4 > rr ( " subsmanager.erl " ) . [ state , subscription ] ( subsman@localhost ) 5 > subsmanager:add_subscriptions ( [ # subscription{subscriber=alice , subscribee=rj} ] ). ok ( subsman@localhost ) 6 > subsmanager:add_subscriptions ( [ # subscription{subscriber=bob , subscribee=rj} ] ) . ok ( subsman@localhost ) 7 > subsmanager : get_subscribers ( rj ) . [ bob , alice ] ( subsman@localhost ) 8 >
subsmanager:remove_subscriptions ( [ # subscription{subscriber=bob , subscribee=rj} ] ) . ok ( subsman@localhost ) 9 > subsmanager :get_subscribers ( rj ) . [ alice ] ( subsman@localhost ) 10 > subsmanager:get_subscribers ( charlie ) . [ ]
We 'll use integer
Ids to represent users for the benchmark - but for this test I used atoms ( rj , alice , bob ) and assumed that alice and bob are both on rj's friends list .
It 's nice that mnesia ( and ets/dets ) does n't care what values you use - any Erlang term is valid .
This means it 's a simple upgrade to support multiple types of resource .
You could start using {user , 123} or {photo , 789} to represent different things people might subscribe to , without changing anything in the subsmanager module .
Modifying the router to use subscriptions
Instead of addressing messages to specific users , ie router : send ( 123 , " Hello user 123 " ) , we 'll mark messages with a subject - that is , the person who generated the message ( who played the song , who uploaded the photo etc ) - and have the router deliver the message to every user who has subscribed to the subject user .
In other words , the API will work like this : router : send ( 123 , " Hello everyone subscribed to user 123 " )
Updated router.erl :
- module ( router ) . - behaviour ( gen_server ) . - export ( [ start_link / 0 ] ) . - export ( [ init / 1 , handle_call / 3 , handle_cast / 2 , handle_info / 2 , terminate / 2 , code_change / 3 ] ) . - export ( [ send / 2 , login / 2 , logout / 1 ] ) .
- define ( SERVER , global : whereis_name ( ? MODULE ) ) . % will hold bidirectional mapping between id <--> pid - record ( state , { pid2id , id2 pid } ) . start_link ( ) -> gen_server : start_link ( { global , ?
MODULE } , ? MODULE , [ ] , [ ] ) .
% sends
Msg to anyone subscribed to Id send ( Id , Msg ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { send , Id , Msg } ) .
login ( Id , Pid ) when is_pid ( Pid ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { login , Id , Pid } ) .
logout ( Pid ) when is_pid ( Pid ) -> gen_server : call ( ?
SERVER , { logout , Pid } ) . % % init ( [ ] ) -> % set this so we can catch death of logged in pids : process_flag ( trap_exit , true ) , % use ets for routing tables { ok , # state { pid2id = ets : new ( ?
MODULE , [ bag ] ) , id2 pid = ets : new ( ?
MODULE , [ bag ] ) } }. handle_call ( { login , Id , Pid } , _ From , State ) when is_pid ( Pid ) -> ets : insert ( State # state.pid2id , { Pid , Id } ) , ets : insert ( State # state.id2pid , {
Id , Pid } ) , link ( Pid ) , % tell us if they exit , so we can log them out % io : format ( " ~w logged in as ~w
" , [ Pid , Id ] ) , { reply , ok , State } ; handle_call ( { logout , Pid } , _ From , State ) when is_pid ( Pid ) -> unlink ( Pid ) , PidRows = ets : lookup ( State # state.pid2id , Pid ) , case PidRows of [ ] -> ok ; _ -> IdRows = [ { I , P } || { P , I } <- PidRows ] , % invert tuples ets : delete ( State # state.pid2id , Pid ) , % delete all pid->id entries [ ets : delete_object ( State # state.id2pid , Obj ) || Obj <- IdRows ] % and all id -> pid end , % io : format ( " pid ~w logged out
" , [ Pid ] ) , { reply , ok , State } ; handle_call ( { send , Id , Msg } , From , State ) -> F = fun ( ) -> % get users who are subscribed to Id : Users = subsmanager : get_subscribers ( Id ) , io : format ( " Subscribers of ~w = ~w
" , [ Id , Users ] ) , % get pids of anyone logged in from Users list : Pids0 = lists : map ( fun ( U ) -> [ P || { _ I , P } <- ets : lookup ( State # state.id2pid , U ) ] end , [ Id | Users ] % we are always subscribed to ourselves ) , Pids = lists : flatten ( Pids0 ) , io : format ( " Pids : ~w
" , [ Pids ] ) , % send Msg to them all M = { router_msg , Msg } , [ Pid !
M || Pid <- Pids ] , % respond with how many users saw the message gen_server : reply ( From , { ok , length ( Pids ) } ) end , spawn ( F ) , { noreply , State }. % handle death and cleanup of logged in processes handle_info ( Info , State ) -> case Info of { ' EXIT ' , Pid , _ Why } -> handle_call ( { logout , Pid } , blah , State ) ; Wtf -> io : format ( " Caught unhandled message : ~w
" , [ Wtf ] ) end , { noreply , State }. handle_cast ( _ Msg , State ) -> { noreply , State }. terminate ( _ Reason , _ State ) -> ok .
code_change ( _ OldVsn , State , _ Extra ) -> { ok , State } .
And here 's a quick test that does n't require mochiweb - I 've used atoms instead of user ids , and omitted some output for clarity :
( subsman@localhost ) 1> c( subsmanager ) , c( router ) , rr( " subsmanager.erl " ) .
( subsman@localhost ) 2> subsmanager:start_link ( ) . ( subsman@localhost ) 3 > router: start_link ( ) . ( subsman@localhost ) 4 >
Subs = [ #subscription{subscriber=alice , subscribee=rj} , #subscription{subscriber=bob , subscribee=rj} ] .
[ # subscription {subscriber = alice , subscribee = rj} , # subscription {subscriber = bob , subscribee = rj} ] ( subsman@localhost ) 5 > subsmanager:add_subscriptions ( Subs ) . ok ( subsman@localhost ) 6 > router : send (rj , " RJ did something " ) .
Subscribers of rj = [ bob , alice ] Pids : [ ] {ok,0} ( subsman@localhost ) 7 > router : login( alice , self ( ) ) . ok ( subsman@localhost ) 8 > router : send (rj , " RJ did something " ) .
Subscribers of rj = [ bob , alice ] Pids : [ < 0.46.0 > ] {ok,1} ( subsman@localhost ) 9 > receive {router_msg , M} -> io :format ( " ~s
" , [ M ] ) end .
RJ did something ok
This shows how alice can a receive a message when the subject is someone she is subscribed to ( rj ) , even though the message was n't sent directly to alice .
The output shows that the router identified possible targets as [ alice , bob ] but only delivered the message to one person , alice , because bob was not logged in .
Generating a typical social - network friends dataset
We could generate lots of friend relationships at random , but that 's not particularly realistic .
Social networks tend to exhibit a power law distribution .
Social networks usually have a few super - popular users ( some Twitter users have over 100,000 followers ) and plenty of people with just a handful of friends .
The Last.fm friends data is typical - it fits a Barabási–Albert graph model , so that 's what I 'll use .
To generate the dataset I 'm using the python module from the excellent igraph library :
fakefriends.py :
import igraph g = igraph .
Graph .
Barabasi ( 1000000 , 15 , directed = False ) print " Edges : " + str ( g . ecount ( ) ) + " Verticies : " + str ( g . vcount ( ) ) g . write_edgelist ( " fakefriends.txt " )
This will generate with 2 user ids per line , space separated .
These are the friend relationships we 'll load into our subsmanager .
User ids range from 1 to a million .
Bulk loading friends data into mnesia
This small module will read the fakefriends .
txt file and create a list of subscription records .
readfriends.erl - to read the fakefriends .
txt and create subscription records :
- module ( readfriends ) . - export ( [ load / 1 ] ) .
- record ( subscription , { subscriber , subscribee } ) . load ( Filename ) -> for_each_line_in_file ( Filename , fun ( Line , Acc ) -> [ As , Bs ] = string : tokens ( string : strip ( Line , right , $
) , " " ) , { A , _} = string : to_integer ( As ) , { B , _} = string : to_integer ( Bs ) , [ #subscription { subscriber = A , subscribee = B } | Acc ] end , [ read ] , [ ] ) .
% via : http://www.trapexit.org/Reading_Lines_from_a_File for_each_line_in_file ( Name , Proc , Mode , Accum0 ) ->
{ ok , Device } = file : open ( Name , Mode ) , for_each_line ( Device , Proc , Accum0 ) .
for_each_line ( Device , Proc , Accum ) -> case io : get_line ( Device , " " ) of eof -> file : close ( Device ) , Accum ; Line -> NewAccum = Proc ( Line , Accum ) , for_each_line ( Device , Proc , NewAccum ) end .
Now in the subsmanager shell , you can read from the text file and add the subscriptions :
$ erl - name router@minifeeds4.gs2 + K true +A 128 - setcookie secretcookie - mnesia dump_log_write_threshold 50000 - mnesia dc_dump_limit 40 erl > c ( readfriends ) , c ( subsmanager ) . erl > subsmanager : first_run ( ) . erl > subsmanager : start_link ( ) . erl > subsmanager:add_subscriptions ( readfriends : load ( " fakefriends.txt " ) ) .
Note the additional mnesia parameters - these are to avoid the ** WARNING ** Mnesia is overloaded messages you would ( probably ) otherwise see .
Refer to my previous post :
On bulk loading data into Mnesia for alternative ways to load in lots of data .
The best solution seems to be ( as pointed out in the comments , thanks Jacob ! ) to set those options .
The Mnesia reference manual contains many other settings under Configuration Parameters , and is worth a look .
Turning it up to 1 Million
Creating a million tcp connections from one host is non-trivial .
I 've a feeling that people who do this regularly have small clusters dedicated to simulating lots of client connections , probably running a real tool like Tsung .
Even with the tuning from Part 1 to increase kernel tcp memory , increase the file descriptor ulimits and set the local port range to the maximum , we will still hit a hard limit on ephemeral ports .
When making a tcp connection , the client end is allocated ( or you can specify ) a port from the range in / proc/sys / net/ipv4/iplocalport_range .
It does n't matter if you specify it manually , or use an ephemeral port , you 're still going to run out .
In Part 1 , we set the range to " 1024 65535 " - meaning there are 65535 - 1024 = 64511 unprivileged ports available .
Some of them will be used by other processes , but we 'll never get over 64511 client connections , because we 'll run out of ports .
The local port range is assigned per-IP , so if we make our outgoing connections specifically from a range of different local IP addresses , we 'll be able to open more than 64511 outgoing connections in total .
So let 's bring up 17 new IP addresses , with the intention of making 62,000 connections from each - giving us a total of 1,054,000 connections .
Safely over the 2^32 mark :
$ for i in ` seq 1 17 ` ; do echo sudo ifconfig eth0 : $ i 10.0.0 .
$ i up ; done
If you run ifconfig now you should see your virtual interfaces : eth0:1 , eth0:2 ... eth0:17 , each with a different IP address .
Obviously you should chose a sensible part of whatever address space you are using .
All that remains now is to modify the floodtest tool from Part 1 to specify the local IP it should connect from ...
Unfortunately the erlang http client does n't let you specify the source IP .
Neither does ibrowse , the alternative http client library .
Damn .
Crazy Idea ..
At this point I considered another option : bringing up 17 pairs of IPs - one on the server and one on the client - each pair in their own isolated / 30 subnet .
I think that if I then made the client connect to any given server IP , it would force the local address to be other half of the pair on that subnet , because only one of the local IPs would actually be able to reach the server IP .
In theory , this would mean declaring the local source IP on the client machine would not be necessary ( although the range of server IPs would need to be specified ) .
I do n't know if this would really work - it sounded plausible at the time .
In the end I decided it was too perverted and did n't try it .
I also poked around in OTP 's http_transport code and considered adding support for specifying the local IP .
It 's not really a feature you usually need in an HTTP client though , and it would certainly have been more work .
Note : gentcp lets you specify the source address , so I ended up writing a rather crude client using gentcp specifically for this test :
floodtest2.erl
- module ( floodtes t2 ) . - compile ( export_all ) . - define ( SERVERADDR , " 10.1.2.3 " ) . % where mochiweb is running - define ( SERVERPORT , 8000 ) . %

As an initial test I was connecting to the mochiweb app from Part 1 - it simply sends one message to every client every 10 seconds .
erl > c ( floodtest2 ) , floodtest2:run ( 20 ) .
This quickly ate all my memory .
Turns out opening lots of connections with gen_tcp like that eats a lot of ram .
I think it'd need ~ 36GB to make it work without any additional tuning .
I 'm not interested in trying to optimise my quick - hack erlang http client ( in the real world , this would be 1 M actual web browsers ) , and the only machine I could get my hands on that has more than 32 GB of RAM is one of our production databases , and I can't find a good excuse to take Last . fm offline whilst I test this :)
Additionally , it seems like it still only managed to open around 64,500 ports .
Hmm .
At this point I decided to break out the trusty libevent , which I was pleased to discover has an HTTP API .
Newer versions also have a evhttpconnectionsetlocaladdress function in the http API .
This sounds promising .
Here 's the http client in C using libevent :
#include < sys/types.h > # include < sys/ time.h > # include < sys/ queue.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < err.h > # include < event.h > # include < evhttp.h > # include < unistd.h > # include < stdio.h > # include < sys/ socket.h > # include < netinet / in.h > # include < time .h > # include < pthread.h >
# define BUFSIZE 4096 # define NUMCONNS 62000 # define SERVERADDR " 10.103.1.43 " # define SERVERPORT 8000 # define SLEEP_MS 10 char buf [ BUFSIZE ] ; int bytes_recvd =
0 ; int chunks_recvd = 0 ; int closed = 0 ; int connected = 0 ; // called per chunk received void chunkcb ( struct evhttp_request * req , void * arg ) { int s = evbuffer_remove ( req -> input_buffer , & buf , BUFSIZE ) ; // printf ( " Read %d bytes : %s
" , s , &buf ) ; bytes_recvd += s ; chunks_recvd ++ ; if ( connected >= NUMCONNS && chunks_recvd % 10000 == 0 ) printf ( " > Chunks : %d \t Bytes : %d \t Closed : %d
" , chunks_recvd , bytes_recvd , closed ) ; } // gets called when request completes void reqcb ( struct evhttp_request * req , void * arg ) { closed ++ ; } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { event_init ( ) ; struct evhttp * evhttp_connection ; struct evhttp_request * evhttp_request ; char addr [ 16 ] ; char path [ 32 ] ; // eg : " / test /123 " int i , octet ; for ( octet = 1 ; octet <= 17 ; octet ++ ) { sprintf ( & addr , " 10.224.0. %d " , octet ) ; for ( i = 1 ; i <= NUMCONNS ; i ++ ) { evhttp_connection = evhttp_connection_new ( SERVERADDR , SERVERPORT ) ; evhttp_connection_set_local_address ( evhttp_connection , & addr ) ; evhttp_set_timeout ( evhttp_connection , 864000 ) ; // 10 day timeout evhttp_request = evhttp_request_new ( reqcb , NULL ) ; evhttp_request -> chunk_cb = chunkcb ; sprintf ( & path , " / test / %d " , ++ connected ) ; if ( i % 100 == 0 ) printf ( " Req : %s \t -> \t %s
" , addr , & path ) ; evhttp_make_request ( evhttp_connection , evhttp_request , EVHTTP_REQ_GET , path ) ; evhttp_connection_set_timeout ( evhttp_request -> evcon , 864000 ) ; event_loop ( EVLOOP_NONBLOCK ) ; if ( connected % 200 == 0 ) printf ( "
Chunks : %d \t Bytes : %d \t Closed : %d
" , chunks_recvd , bytes_recvd , closed ) ; usleep ( SLEEP_MS * 1000 ) ; } } event_dispatch ( ) ; return 0 ; }
Most parameters are hardcoded as #define 's so you configure it by editing the source and recompiling .
Compile and run :
$ gcc -o httpclient httpclient .c - levent $ ./httpclient
This still failed to open more than 64,500 ports .
Although it used less RAM doing it .
It turns out that although I was specifying the local addresses , the ephemeral port allocation somewhere in the kernel or tcp stack did n't care , and still ran out after 2^16 .
So in order to open more than 64,500 connections , you need to specify the local address and local port yourself , and manage them accordingly .
Unfortunately the libevent HTTP API does n't have an option to specify the local port .
I patched libevent to add a suitable function : void evhttpconnectionsetlocalport ( struct evhttpconnection * evcon , ushort port ) ; .
This was a surprisingly pleasant experience ; libevent seems well written , and the documentation is pretty decent too .
With my modified libevent installed , I was able to add the following under the setlocaladdress line in the above code : evhttpconnectionsetlocalport(evhttp_connection , 1024+i ) ;
With that in place , multiple connections from different addresses were able to use the same local port number , specific to the the local address .
I recompiled the client and let it run for a bit to confirm it would break the 2^16 barrier .
Netstat confirms it :
# netstat -n | awk ' / ^tcp / {t [ $ NF ]++}END {for( state in t ) {print state , t[ state ] } }' TIME_WAIT 8 ESTABLISHED 118222
This shows how many ports are open in various states .
We 're finally able to open more than 2^16 connections , phew .
Now we have a tool capable of opening a million http connections from a single box .
It seems to consume around 2 KB per connection , plus whatever the kernel needs .
It 's time to use it for the " million connected user " test against our mochiweb comet server .
C1024K Test - 1 million comet connections
For this test I used 4 different servers of varying specs .
These specs may be overpowered for the experiment , but they were available and waiting to go into production , and this made a good burn - in test .
All four servers are on the same gigabit LAN , with up to 3 switches and a router in the middle somewhere .
The 1 million test I ran is similar to the 10 k test from parts 1 and 2 , the main difference being the modified client , now written in C using libevent , and that I 'm running in a proper distributed - erlang setup with more than one machine .
On server 1 - Quad - core 2GHz CPU , 16GB of RAM
Start subsmanager
Load in the friends data
Start the router
Start mochiweb app
Create 17 virtual IPs as above
Install patched libevent
Run client : ./ httpclient to create 100 connections per second , up to 1M
Run msggen program , to send lots of messages to the router
On server 2 - Dual Quad - core 2.8GHz CPU , 32 GB of RAMOn server 3 - Quad - core 2GHz CPU , 16GB of RAMOn server 4 - Dual - core 2GHz , 2GB RAM
I measured the memory usage of mochiweb during the ramp - up to a million connections , and for the rest of the day :
The httpclient has a built in delay of 10 ms between connections , so it took nearly 3 hours to open a million connections .
The resident memory used by the mochiweb process with 1 M open connections was around 25 GB .
Here 's the server this was running on as seen by Ganglia , which measures CPU , network and memory usage and produces nice graphs :
You can see it needs around 38 GB and has started to swap .
I suspect the difference is mostly consumed by the kernel to keep those connections open .
The uplift at the end is when I started sending messages .
Messages were generated using 1,000 processes , with an average time between messages of 60ms per process , giving around 16,666 messages per second overall :
[ spawn ( fun ( ) -> msggen : start ( 1000000 , 10 + random : uniform ( 100 ) , 1000000 ) end ) || I <- lists : seq ( 1 , 1000 ) ] .
The machine ( server - 4 ) generating messages looked like this on Ganglia :
That 's 10 MB per second of messages it 's pumping out - 16,666 messages a second .
Typically these messages would come from a message bus , app servers , or part of an existing infrastructure .
When I started sending messages , the load on server 1 ( hosting subsmanager and router ) stayed below 1 , and CPU utilization increased from 0 to 5 % .
CPU on server 2 ( hosting mochiweb app , with 1 M connections ) increased more dramatically :
Naturally as processes have to leave their hibernate state to handle messages , memory usage will increase slightly .
Having all connections open with no messages is a best - case for memory usage - unsurprisingly , actually doing stuff requires more memory .
So where does this leave us ?
To be on the safe side , the mochiweb machine would need 40 GB of RAM to hold open 1 M active comet connections .
Under load , up to 30 GB of the memory would be used by the mochiweb app , and the remaining 10 GB by the kernel .
In other words , you need to allow 40 KB per connection .
During various test with lots of connections , I ended up making some additional changes to my sysctl.conf .
This was part trial - and - error , I do n't really know enough about the internals to make especially informed decisions about which values to change .
My policy was to wait for things to break , check / var / log / kern.log and see what mysterious error was reported , then increase stuff that sounded sensible after a spot of googling .
Here are the settings in place during the above test :
$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf net.core.rmem_max = 33554432 net.core.wmem_max = 33554432 net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 16384 33554432 net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 33554432 net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 786432 1048576 26777216 net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 360000 net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 2500 vm.min_free_kbytes = 65536 vm.swappiness = 0 net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65535
I would like to learn more about Linux tcp tuning so I can make a more informed decision about these settings .
These are almost certainly not optimal , but at least they were enough to get to 1 M connections .
These changes , along with the fact this is running on a 64 bit Erlang VM , and thus has a wordsize of 8 bytes instead of 4 , might explain why the memory usage is much higher than I observed during the C10 k test of part 2 .
An Erlang C - Node using Libevent
After dabbling with the HTTP api for libevent , it seemed entirely sensible to try the 1M connection test against a libevent HTTPd written in C so we have a basis for comparison .
I 'm guessing that enabling kernel poll means the erlang VM is able to use epoll ( or similar ) , but even so there 's clearly some overhead involved which we might be able to mitigate by delegating the connection handling to a C program using libevent .
I want to reuse most of the Erlang code so far , so let 's do the bare minimum in C - just the connection handling and HTTP stuff .
Libevent has an asynchronous HTTP API , which makes implementing http servers trivial - well , trivial for C , but still less trivial than mochiweb IMO ;)
I 'd also been looking for an excuse to try the Erlang C interface , so the following program combines the two .
It 's a comet http server in C using libevent which identifies users using an integer
Id ( like our mochiweb app ) , and also acts as an Erlang C - Node .
It connects to a designated erlang node , listens for messages like { 123 , <<" Hello user 123 " >> } then dispatches " Hello user 123 " to user 123 , if connected .
Messages for users that are not connected are discarded , just like previous examples .

The maximum number of users is #defined , and similarly to the mochiweb server , it listens on port 8000 and expects users to connect with a path like so : / test / .
Also hardcoded is the name of the erlang node it will connect to in order to receive messages , httpdmaster@localhost , and the erlang cookie , " secretcookie " .
Change these accordingly .
Run the erlang node it will connect to first :
$ erl - setcookie secretcookie - sname httpdmaster@localhost
Compile and run like so :
$ gcc -o httpdcnode httpdcnode .c - lerl_interface - lei - levent $ ./httpdcnode
In the erlang shell , check you can see the hidden c-node :
erl > nodes ( hidden ) . [ c1@localhost ]
Now connect in your browser to http://localhost:8000/test/123 .
You should see the welcome message .
Now back to the erlang shell - send a message to the C node :
erl > {any , c1@localhost} !
{ 123 , <<" Hello Libevent World " >>} .
Note that we do n't have a Pid to use , so we use the alternate representation of {procname , node} .
We use ' any ' as the process name , which is ignored by the C - node .
Now you 're able to deliver comet messages via Erlang , but all the http connections are managed by a libevent C program which acts as an Erlang node .
After removing the debug print statements , I connected 1 M clients to the httpdcnode server using the same client as above , the machine showed a total of just under 10 GB or memory used .
The resident memory of the server process was stable at under 2GB :
So big savings compared to mochiweb when handling lots of connections - the resident memory per connection for the server process with libevent is just under 2KB .
With everything connected , the server machine claims : Mem : 32968672 k total , 9636488 k used , 23332184 k free , 180 k buffers
So the kernel / tcp stack is consuming an additional 8 KB per connection , which seems a little high , but I have no basis for comparison .
This libevent - cnode server needs a bit more work .
It does n't sensibly handle multiple connections from the same user yet , and there 's no locking so a race condition exists if you disconnect at just when a message was going to be dispatched .
Even so , I think this could be generalized in such a way that would allow you to use Erlang for all the interesting stuff , and have a C+libevent process act as a dumb connection - pool .
With a bit more wrapper code and callbacks into Erlang , you 'd hardly need to know this was going on - the C program could be run as a driver or a C - node , and an Erlang wrapper could give you a decent api built on top of libevent .
( see this post for an example Erlang C driver ) .
I would like to experiment further with this .
Final Thoughts
I have enough data now to judge how much hardware would be needed if we deploy a large scale comet system for Last.fm .
Even a worst case of 40 KB per connection is n't unreasonable - memory is pretty cheap at the moment , and 40 GB to support a million users is not unreasonable .
10 GB is even better .
I will finish up the app I 'm building and deploy it somewhere people can try it out .
Along the way I 'll tidy up the erlang memcached client I 'm using and release that ( from jungerl , with modifications for consistent hashing and some bug fixes ) , and some other things .
Stay tuned :)

Oct. 28 , 2008  --
When it comes to how we spend and save , borrow and lend , nothing in this nation will ever be the same .
I can't tell you how the financial crisis will be solved , when the Dow will return to 13,000 or if home prices will recover anytime soon .
But the events of the past two months make it clear our national money habits are in for big changes .
Given that reality , there 's one proposal you might want to keep an eye on .
A recommendation to shake up the nation 's 401 ( k ) system is gaining traction as workers and retirees gape in horror at their investment account balances .
" Four weeks ago this plan did n't have a chance , " conceded its author , Teresa Ghilarducci .
Suddenly , things have changed .
Ghilarducci's proposal to create what she calls Guaranteed Retirement Accounts is gaining attention in Washington as the nation grapples with the issue of retirement security in the wake of a 40 - percent - plus drop in the U.S. stock market this year .
" These last three weeks people are learning their 401 ( k ) plans can go down , " said Ghilarducci , an economist at the New School for Social Research in New York .
Called to testify before Congress earlier this month , Ghilarducci 's ideas are gaining wide exposure nearly a year after she published a policy paper on the subject .
She followed up that paper with a book published in May , " When I 'm Sixty - Four : The Plot Against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them . "
Her proposal calls for knocking down the 401 ( k ) plan system and replacing it with a government - run pension plan funded by employee contributions .
Participants would be guaranteed an inflation - beating return and a lifetime stream of income .
" What people want from their pensions is guaranteed income for life , " Ghilarducci said in an interview Monday .
Guaranteed Retirement Accounts
Here are the basics of her proposed Guaranteed Retirement Accounts :
• Employees would make mandatory contributions equal to at least 5 percent of their earnings .
Workers could contribute higher amounts if they wish .
• Those contributions would be offset by a $ 600 federal tax credit each participant would receive .
• As with a 401 ( k ) plan , workers would have individual accounts they could track .
The balance of each account would depend on each worker 's contributions and income level .
• The Social Security Administration would handle account management , and the Thrift Savings Plan -- a well - regarded retirement plan for federal employees -- would manage the money .
• Participants would be guaranteed a fixed rate of return that exceeds inflation by 3 percent .
For instance , if inflation stood at 2 percent , the worker would earn 5 percent ; if inflation reached 3.5 percent , the worker would earn 6.5 percent .
Participants could receive an inflation - beating return above 3 percent if the government 's investment returns were high enough .
• At retirement , participants ' account balances would be converted into a lifetime stream of income that adjusts for inflation .
There would be options to take partial lump sum payments , opt for lower payments in return for survivor benefits and , upon death , leave a portion of a financial account balance .
The intent of the plan is not to replace Social Security .
Rather , Guaranteed Savings Accounts would supplement Social Security , Ghilarducci said .
She estimated a full - time worker retiring after 40 years could expect a benefit equal to about 25 percent of pre-retirement income .
That would be on top of Social Security benefits .
The portion of Ghilarducci 's plan that has drawn the greatest criticism is her suggestion to eliminate the tax breaks received for contributing to a 401 ( k ) plan or an IRA .
Last week , conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh pilloried her ideas , but Ghilarducci said Limbaugh got some of the facts of her proposal wrong , including that the guaranteed rate of return would be 3 percent above the inflation rate , not a flat 3 percent return .
Ghilarducci now talks about maintaining some level of tax - free contributions , maybe up to $ 5,000 a year , to IRAs or 401 ( k ) s .
That 's more than most workers contribute to a retirement plan , she said , and would only cost the federal government $ 25 billion a year compared to the $ 80 billion a year contribution levels cost the federal Treasury now .
Ghilarducci said she 's not " anti- stock market " but , rather , against 401 ( k ) plans in their current iteration .
She called the 401 ( k ) " a tax shelter with very bad elements , namely hidden fees and very costly products . "
The retirement scheme simply does not work , she said .
" If current trends continue , poverty rates among the elderly will increase and middle - class retirees will find that their retirement income will not pay for the lifestyle they achieved while working , " she wrote in her original policy paper .
Ask the retirees you know if they 've begun to worry about the same trends as the Dow has fallen more than 20 percent in less than a month .
I think they might want to hear more about Guaranteed Retirement Accounts .
I 'm not ready to embrace every aspect of Ghilarducci 's plan , but it 's a plan that needs to be part of the national discussion as we deal with the fallout from easy credit , risky derivatives and a stock market decline that has devastated the retirement fortunes of millions .

Audi´s Travolution device lets drivers know how fast to drive to coast through an upcoming green light .
The company hopes the device will improve traffic flow for all drivers .
Image credit : Audi .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
If you drive down the same roads every day , you probably know the patterns of familiar stop lights - how long they take to turn green , or when the green arrow will appear .
For light - conscious drivers or anyone looking to save some fuel , Audi is developing a new device that lets you know when upcoming stop lights will turn green , and even calculates how fast you should drive in order to coast through them .
The device , called Travolution , communicates with special transmitters fitted inside traffic lights up to 300 yards away .
After calculating the car 's position , the in - car gadget determines how much time remains until a green light turns red , or red light becomes green .
If you can safely make it through the intersection , the device displays the optimum speed on a screen in your car .
In addition , if there 's no traffic nearby , the device can even make the light turn green for you .
If many cars are equipped with the system , the Travolution could serve as a communications link between cars and the traffic light , causing the light to adjust its signal based on how many cars are approaching .
The gadget works with any vehicle using Wireless Local Area Network ( WLAN ) technology , although traffic lights must be equipped with the transmitters .
The Travolution system , which was originally developed by the Technical University of Munich in conjunction with the traffic technology firm GEVAS , is intended to improve traffic flow and fuel economy , and reduce pollution .
It could also help in meeting new European Union emissions standards .
Kate Dixon of Audi UK said that if 10 percent of cars in a city were fitted with the technology , all drivers would notice an improvement in traffic flow , mainly in reduced start - and - stop driving .
However , the device would not be very helpful in extremely dense , bumper - to - bumper traffic , since drivers don´t have as much control over their speeds .
During two years of trials in Ingolstadt , Bavaria , Audi equipped 46 traffic lights with the wireless transmitters .
Tests showed that , in busy intersections , cars equipped with the device hardly ever had to stop on red .
Audi plans to perform further tests , and did not know how much the Travolution would cost if it is ever commercialized .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
When you see people at the office using such Internet sites as Facebook and MySpace , you might suspect those workers are slacking off .
A social - networking site for the world of spying officially launches for the U.S. intelligence community this month .
But that 's not the case at the CIA , the FBI and the National Security Agency , where bosses are encouraging their staff members to use a new social - networking site designed for the super - secret world of spying .
" It 's every bit Facebook and YouTube for spies , but it 's much , much more , " said Michael Wertheimer , assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analysis .
The program is called A - Space , and it's a social - networking site for analysts within the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies .
Instead of posting thoughts about the new Avenged Sevenfold album or Jessica Alba movie , CIA analysts could use A - Space to share information and opinion about al Qaeda movements in the Middle East or Russian naval maneuvers in the Black Sea .
The new A - Space site has been undergoing testing for months and launches officially for the nation 's entire intelligence community September 22 .
The Situation Room CNN 's exclusive report on how online networking helps spies share intelligence
5 p.m. ET today see full schedule »
" It 's a place where not only spies can meet but share data they 've never been able to share before , " Wertheimer said .
" This is going to give them for the first time a chance to think out loud , think in public amongst their peers , under the protection of an A - Space umbrella . "
Wertheimer demonstrated the program to CNN to show how analysts will use it to collaborate .
" One perfect example is if Osama bin Laden comes out with a new video .
How is that video obtained ?
Where are the very sensitive secret sources we may have to put into a context that 's not apparent to the rest of the world ? "
Wertheimer asked .
" In the past , whoever captured that video or captured information about the video kept it in - house .
It 's highly classified , because it has so very short a shelf life .
That information is considered critical to our understanding . "
The goal of A - Space , like intelligence analysis in general , is to protect the United States by assessing all the information available to the spy agencies .
Missing crucial data can have enormous implications , such as an FBI agent who sent an e-mail before September 11 , 2001 , warning of people learning to fly airplanes but not learning to land them .
" There was the question , ' Was that a dot that failed to connect ? '
Well , that person did this via e-mail , " Wertheimer said .
" A - Space is the kind of place where you can log that observation and know that your fellow analysts can see that . "
Even though Facebook , MySpace and other social - networking sites that inspired A - Space are predominantly the domain of young people , there apparently is no such generational divide on A - Space .
" We have found that participation in A - Space crosses every conceivable age line and experience line .
People are excited , no matter what age group , " Wertheimer said .
Of course , the material on A - Space is highly classified , so it wo n't be available for the public .
Only intelligence personnel with the proper security clearance , and a reason to be examining particular information , can access the site .
The creators of A - Space do not want it to be used by some future double agent such as Jonathan Pollard or Robert Hanssen to steal America 's 21st - century secrets .
" We 're building [ a ] mechanism to alert that behavior .
We call that , for lack of a better term , the MasterCard , where someone is using their credit card in a way they 've never used it before , and it alerts so that maybe that credit card has been stolen , " Wertheimer said .
" Same thing here .
We 're going to actually do patterns on the way people use A - Space . "
Yes , analysts can collect friends on A - Space the way people can on Facebook .
But nobody outside the intelligence community will ever know -- because they 're secret .

Scarborough :
We talk about Ayers ' because it's not relevant ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 9 , 2008
Print This Email This
When MSNBC host and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough appeared on the Colbert Report on Wednesday , Stephen Colbert immediately got him off balance by noting , " The last time you were here , you admitted that you took money from Jack Abramoff . "
" What 's with that ! " yelled Scarborough .
" This is all you have for me ? "
" That was just the preamble of the question , " Colbert explained .
" I just wanted to know if you wanted to reveal anything about your relationship with William Ayers while you were here . "
After Scarborough had denied having ever been involved in bomb - making , Colbert asked , more seriously , " No , but are you covering this whole thing , that Obama 's buddy - buddy with Ayers ? "
" We talked about it , " Scarborough acknowledged , adding , " It is not relevant to where the story is right now . "
" But that 's why you talk about it , right ? " asked Colbert .
" You 've got to talk about it even if it 's not relevant . "
" I do n't think you understand , " explained Scarborough .
" We talk about it because it 's not relevant . "
" I 've heard you guys say , like , ' We should n't be talking about this -- this is the McCain campaign making us connect the dots , " insisted Colbert .
" You get it backwards , " replied Scarborough .
" You see , what we do is we talk about it for a very long time , and then we reveal -- after the ratings come in and it helps us out -- that we should n't be talking about it . "
Colbert then asked , " How does McCain win this one , Joe ?
How does McCain bring it out of the pooper ? "
" It 's too late , " Scarborough replied , as the audience cheered .
" When there was peace and propersity you could talk about certain issues , but you can't at this point -- you have to talk about the economy . "
" Look how MSNBC has changed you ! " marveled Colbert .
" I know , " admitted Scarborough ruefully .

Posted on October 31 , 2008 in Articles
With the end of the 2008 Presidential election , a thorough retrospection of the most astonishing Sarah Palin moments is a necessity .
Providing blogs with the kind of fodder we could only have dreamed of , it ’s time to recap some of the highlights of Sarah Palin ’s efforts in the 2008 campaign :
5. IF YOU CALL JOE BIDEN OLD , I’LL CALL JOHN MCCAIN THE UNDEAD
Now , call me crazy , but did Sarah Palin just try to make a wise crack about how old Joe Biden is ?
While this did n’t garner much attention from the media , it was quite the ironic jab , as Sarah Palin ’s would - be Presidential - Overlord , John McCain , can often times be mistaken for an undead ghoul .
For the record , at the tender age of 72 , John McCain would be the oldest first - term President in the history of the United States .
4. THE ANSWER SO STUPID THAT TINA FEY REREAD IT WORD FOR WORD ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE
Under the section of “ dumbest answer to a question anyone should have seen coming ” is Sarah Palins response to a simple and completely foreseeable question on why the federal bailout should be supported by those not directly benefiting from it ( aka the lower and middle class ) .
In the end , Sarah Palin would deliver one of the most moronic replies , basically meandering from one incomprehensible assortment of words to the next :
COURIC : Why is n’t it better , Governor Palin , to spend $ 700 billion helping middle - class families who are struggling with health care , housing , gas and groceries ?
Allow them to spend more , and put more money into the economy , instead of helping these big financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess ?
PALIN : That ’s why I say I , like every American I ’m speaking with , we ’re ill about this position that we have been put in .
Where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out .
But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy .
Um , helping , oh , it ’s got to be about job creation , too .
Shoring up our economy , and putting it back on the right track .
So health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions , and tax relief for Americans , and trade — we have got to see trade as opportunity , not as , uh , competitive , um , scary thing , but one in five jobs created in the trade sector today .
We ’ve got to look at that as more opportunity .
All of those things under the umbrella of job creation .
This answer was so hilariously idiotic that Tina Fey recited it verbatim on Saturday Night Live .
3. I SPENT $ 150,000 ON CLOTHES BUT I COULDN’T FIND A SCARF WITH THE RIGHT ANIMAL ON IT
We ’ve all heard ad nauseum about Sarah Palin ’s mavericky middle - class hockey - mom Christian - oriented moose - hunting six - pack Joe just - like - every - Middle - American background .
But it turns out that the Republican party spent 3 times the median American income just to dress her for the 2 months of campaigning .
That ’s right , $ 150,000 on clothes during one of the worst economic crises in modern history .
And what could be worse than appearing as completely out of touch with your own image ?
How about showing up to events , decked out in your $ 150 k clothing , only to get the animal of the Democrats on your scarf ?
Sounds about right , but knowing Ms. Palin , she probably thought the donkeys were miniature elephants .
2. I WILL BE THE DARK LORD OF THE SENATE
Q : Brandon Garcia wants to know , “ What does the Vice President do ? ” PALIN : That ’s something that Piper would ask me ! …
They ’re in charge of the U.S. Senate so if they want to they can really get in there with the senators and make a lot of good policy changes that will make life better for Brandon and his family and his classroom .
Sadly enough , Palin had appeared on CNBC in June amid speculation of being selected to be John McCain ’s running mate , but deferred the appeal of the position , as she had to ask out loud , “ What does a Vice President do ? ” .
So between June and October , all Sarah Palin learned about the Vice President is that it ‘ gets in there ’ with the Senate .
Sounds like someone ’s been copying Dick Cheney ’s homework .
1. PUTIN ONCE INVADED MY AIRSPACE AND I SAW HIM WITH MY CREATIONIST TELESCOPE , ERGO I HAVE FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE
COURIC : Explain to me why that enhances your foreign policy credentials .
PALIN : Well , it certainly does because our– our next door neighbors are foreign countries .
They ’re in the state that I am the executive of .
And there in Russia– COURIC :
Have you ever been involved with any negotiations , for example , with the Russians ?
PALIN : We have trade missions back and forth .
We– we do– it ’s very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia as Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America , where – where do they go ?
It ’s Alaska .
It ’s just right over the border .
It is– from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation , Russia , because they are right there .
They are right next to– to our state .
The answer that makes Dan Quayle seem like John Kennedy .
Where to begin ?
First off , her statements are racked with lies .
There never were any trade missions from Alaska to Russia and Russia does n’t ‘ come over the airspace ’ of Alaska .
But most egregiously , how the fuck does living in a state that is in proximity to other countries give you foreign policy experience ?
One would typically define foreign policy experience as having been a part of diplomatic or trade related activities with other nations .
Conversely , one would not define foreign policy experience as having lived near Canada and having to occasionally drive through the 51st state to attend a gun show or rodeo .
Runners Up
In Idiocy :
Sarah Palin Doesn’t Understand Fruit Flies And / Or Science —
And you thought Sarah Palin hated science before .
It turns out that Palin hates all that ‘ unnecessary government pork ’ going to wasteful science projects , like , you know , curing the myriad diseases and conditions that plague this country :
“ Where does a lot of that earmark money end up , anyway ? [ … ]
You ’ve heard about , um , these — some of these pet projects they really do n’t make a whole lot of sense , and sometimes these dollars they go to projects having little or nothing to do with the public good .
Things like fruit fly research in Paris , France .
I kid you not ! ”
The FRENCH !!
Are stealing !
Our money !
God knows those Frogs are probably just eating the flies instead of dissecting them or whatever else scienticians are supposed to do .
Sarah Palin Makes Speech At Solar Power Start - Up — “ Drill Baby Drill ” —
In her second major policy speech , Palin made a speech on energy policy at an Ohio solar power company .
How many times did she mention clean and renewable energy ?
Zero .
But she did say ‘ Drill Baby Drill ’ a lot .
Independent Investigators Find Sarah Palin Guilty Of Gross Misuse of Power As Alaskan Governor —
As we ’ve all ( painfully ) learned , Sarah Palin is such a maverick because she shuns government funds , is a clean and honest Christian , and has been an awesome governor .
Well it turns out she also loves abusing power to get ex-relatives unjustly fired .
Oh , and she also loves redistributing government funds , as long as it ends up in her family ’s pockets .
Sarah Palin Is A Strong Advocate For Abstinence - Only Sex Education ; Has 17 Year Old Pregnant Daughter —
While I would n’t necessarily fault Sarah Palin for her 17 year old daughter being pregnant , it is the height of hypocrisy to say your family is off - limits , only to carry your pregnant teenager around like a purse .
Even odder is that Palin still clings to abstinence - only sex education policy , her own daughter becoming pregnant at a woefully young age .
After ‘ Flirtatious ’ Meeting With Sarah Palin , Pakistani President Has Fatwah Issued Against Him —
This has less to do with Sarah Palin , but who else could cause a Fatwah across the globe against a head of state ?
PITTSBURGH 
The officiating mistake and touchdown that was n't at the end of the Pittsburgh Steelers ' 11 - 10 victory over the San Diego Chargers did n't change the result .
From a betting standpoint , it was huge .
" It did n't have an effect on the outcome of the game NFL - wise , record - wise , but it definitely was a big difference for people that had ( bets on ) Pittsburgh , " says Sean Van Patten , odds maker for Las Vegas Sports Consultants , which provides point spreads to Las Vegas casinos for legal sports betting .
THE HUDDLE BLOG : Blown TD to prompt hastened rule change ?
Van Patten said the big winners to the tune of millions of dollars were the sports books , which take the wagers , because the public tends to bet on favorites .
His firm had the Steelers favored by 4½ - points .
" Say a weekend rolls in where 10 favorites cover the spread .
That 's always a bad weekend for the sports books , " said Van Patten .
" The regular Joe that walks in off the street and bets , I would say probably 85 - 90 % of the time they 're ( betting ) on the favorite . …
The professional ( bettors ) are more where you get your underdog money .
But the public money dwarfs that money . "
Trailing by a point , the Chargers had one play left from their own 21 - yard line with five seconds remaining .
Philip Rivers threw a short pass to running back LaDainian Tomlinson .
Then it got wild .
Tomlinson tossed the ball to wide receiver Chris Chambers .
When Chambers tried a toss of his own , the ball was batted away by Pittsburgh safety Troy Polamalu , who picked it up and ran 12 yards into the end zone .
The officials signaled touchdown .
Pittsburgh led 17 - 10 on the scoreboard .
Steelers swarmed the field , then returned to their sideline for an extra point kick that never came .
After a replay review and consultation by the officials , the touchdown was taken off the board .
The 11 - 10 score stood .
But after the game , referee Scott Green said the crew had made a mistake and that the touchdown should have counted .
" We should have let the play go through to the end , " said Green .
The play originally was ruled penalty - free .
No flags .
The NFL confirmed the mistake on Monday , but said the final score of the game will not change .
After the play the instant replay official buzzed down and told the crew it needed to review the toss from Tomlinson to Chambers , that it appeared to be an illegal forward pass and not a legal backward lateral .
Green looked at the replay and agreed it was forward .
" From the release point to where it was touched , it was about a yard forward , " Mike Pereira , NFL vice president of officiating , said Monday on ESPN .
Green then made the announcement that there was an illegal forward pass , that the penalty was declined and that it was a touchdown .
" Which is right , and that 's where we should have remained , " said Pereira .
Under NFL rules , had the illegal forward pass hit the ground , it would have ended the play .
The toss from Tomlinson to Chambers did not hit the ground .
The problem was the officials got together again .
Pereira said that in a moment of " confusion " they got the Chambers toss ( a legal lateral that hit the ground ) into their conversation about the Tomlinson toss ( an illegal forward pass that did not hit the ground ) .
Somehow , they applied the fact that the ball hit the ground incorrectly to the Tomlinson toss .
" That led to the misinterpretation and taking away the points , which they should n't have , " said Pereira .
Said Green : " The first pass was the one that was illegal , but it only kills the play if it hits the ground . …
There was some confusion over which pass we were talking about , and it was decided that it was the second pass that was illegal that did hit the ground , and therefore we killed the play there . "
They got it wrong .
Van Patten said that while the sports books made money , they would rather not have such complex outcomes and mistaken calls .
" They do n't really care for that situation much , " he said .
" You have a whole bunch of disgruntled bettors . …
They 've got people standing in line thinking they won and they did n't .
And they also still like to see the integrity of the game and the right call made regardless of what the result may be . "
Changes to the climate due to human activity can now be detected on every continent , following a study showing that temperature rises in the Antarctic as well as the Arctic are the result of man-made emissions of greenhouse gases .
It is the first time scientists have been able to prove the link between the temperature changes in both polar regions are down to human activity and it also undermines climate sceptics who believe the warming trend seen in the Arctic in recent decades is part of the climate 's natural variability .
The findings contradict the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which said that Antarctica was the only continent where the human impact on the climate had not been observed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The new study shows that Antarctica has been caught up in the changes to the global climate over the past 60 years and that this warming cannot be attributed to natural variations .
Using four computer models and data from dozens of weather stations sited around both the North and South Poles , the study conclusively shows that humans are responsible for the significant increases in temperatures observed in the Arctic and the Antarctic over the past half century .
" We 're able for the first time to directly attribute warming in both the Arctic and the Antarctic to human influences on the climate , " said Nathan Gillett of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , who led the study , published in the journal Nature Geoscience .
The analysis has also shown there is a significant change to the Antarctic climate caused by human activity .
Peter Stott of the Met Office Hadley Centre , who took part in the modelling analysis , said : " In both polar regions the observed warming can only be reproduced in our models by including human influences – natural forcings [ increases ] alone are not enough .
" For a long time , climate scientists have known that Arctic areas would be expected to warm most strongly because of feedback mechanisms , but the results from this work demonstrate the part man has already played in the significant warming that we 've observed in both polar regions .
" There was a clear detection in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions of a human influence on the climate .
We had shown we had detected the human fingerprint in both regions . "
In the Arctic , the most visible effect of warmer temperatures has been the disappearance of the sea ice which floats on the Arctic Ocean .
In 2007 , the sea ice reached an all - time summer minimum , which was nearly reached again this year .
In the Antarctic , global warming has had the greatest impact on coastal areas and the Antarctic Peninsula , which has seen the greatest increases in average temperatures in the region , leading to the disintegration of ice shelves and the speeding up of the flow of glaciers to the sea .
The picture in the Antarctic has also been obscured by the effect of ozone depletion , which has tended to lower temperatures and so counteract the effect of global warming within the region .
However , with the recovery of the ozone layer , scientists are expecting to see even greater increases in Antarctic temperatures in future .
Andrew Monaghan of the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , said the study clarifies human impact on two regions that are notoriously variable in terms of climate .
" The polar regions exhibit the largest climatic variability on Earth , so detecting and attributing climate changes has been more difficult than elsewhere , " Dr Monaghan explained .
" The study is important because it formally demonstrates the human contribution for the first time . "
As I was thinking about this , suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west , crossing the whole earth without touching the ground .
Petition Text : TO : Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers
House Select Oversight Panel Chairman Rush Holt During the height of the fear generated by the anthrax attacks of 2001 , ABC News repeatedly reported that the Anthrax used in the attacks could be linked to Saddam Hussein .
We now know these claims to be false , but at the time they played a key role in fanning the flames of mounting tension with Iraq , and ABC refuses to identify who fed them those fabricated reports .
Beyond that disturbing episode , there are numerous questions that remain unresolved with regard to the anthrax attacks .
Even leading members of Congress charged with oversight of the FBI -- including Sen . Pat Leahy , Rep. Rush Holt and former Sen. Tom Daschle -- have repeatedly complained that they have been " stonewalled " in their attempt to obtain basic information .
In light of the magnitude of the anthrax attacks , it is imperative that Americans be convinced that all facts relevant to these attacks have been divulged .
Only an investigative body endowed with full Subpoena power -- whether that be a specially - constituted Senate - House Committee of the type that investigated the Iran - contra scandal , or an independent Commission of the type that investigated the 9/11 attacks -- would be sufficient for ensuring that all facts are divulged .
Rep. Holt , as Chair of the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel , recently said that he supports this proposal , and as Americans who insist that facts surrounding the anthrax attacks and the subsequent investigation be fully disclosed , we urge you to support such a proposal and promptly commence a real investigation .

Where is parliament ?
When will MPs step up to defend the liberties that are seized from the British public every day in what has now become the most serious attack on constitutional rights that this country has ever suffered ?
Last week GCHQ and the Home Office were arguing that £ 12bn of taxpayers ' money should be spent to collect data from every internet connection , phone call and email made in this country .
This week we learn that police will be issued with mobile fingerprint scanners to allow offices to carry out identity checks on people in the street .
Neither has been debated in parliament and it seems certain this latest measure – like the creation of the Police National DNA database and the new Automatic Number Plate Recognition system – never will be , even though it must be obvious that the deployment of this device on the streets profoundly affects the rights of citizens to go about their business without being forced to prove who they are and what they are doing .
When ID card legislation was passed , the government assured us that police would not have the right to ask for people 's cards on the street precisely because it altered the relationship between the authorities and the citizen .
Surely demanding biometrics is going one stage further than asking for a card : it now seems certain that this will form some kind of precedent for doing so .
The police argue that fingerprint data will not be kept .
But how are we to know ?
And anyway that is not the point .
In a free society , every individual has the right to move about without being asked to prove him or herself to the state .
It is the sine qua non of a functioning democratic society yet we are letting this principle slip without a single voice being raised in parliament .
I repeat : where the hell are our elected representatives ?
Why do they not defend us ?
Labour laws are powered by the assumption of people 's guilt and their malign intentions towards society .
This is the theme which runs right through the government 's programme to convert Britain into a state of unwavering watchfulness , in which respect for citizens is replaced by suspicion .
I and several other journalists have been saying this for a long time but it seems without any galvanising effect in the legislature .
Lawyers and academics are equally concerned .
Last week the outgoing DPP , Sir Ken MacDonald , eloquently voiced his profound worries .
But with the exception of Conservative MP David Davis , we have heard little from MPs .
Even the Liberal Democrats fail to display the urgent commitment needed to address this national crisis of liberty
As Simon Jenkins remarked in his excellent farewell column from the Sunday Times yesterday , " I have been amazed at the spinelessness of Britain 's elected representatives on defending liberty and protesting against state arrogance . "
Where this will end I cannot say but I do know that historians of the future will regard the behaviour of parliament as one of the greatest abdications of responsibility that has ever taken place in a democracy .
It is as shocking as it is bewildering .
Maddow : Election system ' weak link ' in Obama strategy ?
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday November 4 , 2008
Print This Email This One of Barack Obama 's biggest strengths this campaign season has been his ability to compete in states that are not traditionally home to close presidential elections .
MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow wonders if this could also be a " weak link " in the Democratic candidate 's vaunted operation .
" If you 're counting on winning states that are n't usually in play come Election Day , then you 're counting on systems that are relatively untested under the weight of unprecedented voter turnout , " Maddow warned Monday night , noting predictions that turnout could rise as much as 15 percent compared to four years ago .
" You 're counting on states that are n't used to the pressure of close presidential elections , " she continued .
" That 's like finding out that you 're going to be your doctor 's first open heart surgery patient . "
Up to 140 million Americans are expected to cast ballots on Tuesday , and officials in some of the most intensely contested states , like Virginia , Colorado , Indiana and North Carolina , have little or no experience tabulating massive numbers of votes that could decide who becomes the next President of the United States .
" States like Pennsylvania , Florida and Ohio , they 're not necessarily good at running elections , " Maddow says , " but because they 're almost always battleground states , they are used to the pressure .
officials know what to expect . "
In contested states like Virginia and others that allow for early voting , there already have been reports of long lines , voting machine problems and other difficulties that could discourage voters from showing up to the polls .
If such problems are persistent on Election Day , Obama could find himself returning to his day job as junior Senator from Illinois on Wednesday .
" Breakdowns and chaos on Election Day are not really bipartisan , they favor the side that benefits from lower turnout -- the side that wants the least number of votes cast and counted , as possible , " Maddow says .
" And frankly , in all candor , that is the Republican side , as they and conservative activists have self - defined for more than a generation . "
To illustrate her point , Maddow noted that some precincts in Virginia are expecting up to a 40 percent higher turnout on Tuesady but have not distributed enough additional voting machines to account for the increase .
Each machine in a Norfolk , Va. , precinct will be used by about 350 voters .
Ohio , on the other hand , mandated that precincts have enough machines so that each one need not be used by more than 175 voters .
So , Maddow says , a voter may have twice the opportunity to vote in the traditional swing state as in the red state Obama is contesting .
" Is this the weak link in Obama 's grand 50 state strategy ? " she asks .
Former Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder , joining Maddow , said he worried that some polling places in his state would not have enough paper ballots to account for machine malfunctions .
He said more needed to be done to ensure elections are well run , to maintain the United States ' ability to police elections in developing countries and uphold its global reputation .
" We 've gone through some very tough times in this country ; some people have thought some things did n't happen as they should 've happened , " Wilder said , in an apparent reference to contested election results in Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004 .
" We ca n't afford to repeat that , " he continued , " particularly in this election because the eyes of the entire world are upon us . "

The Solar Electric Power Association ( SEPA ) has outlined four easy steps to a thirty fold increase in the size of the US solar power industry between 2009 and 2016 , leading to over $ 230 billion worth of investment and the creation of 440,000 permanent jobs .
The influential industry group laid out the plans at this week ’s Solar Power International conference in San Diego .
The four key recommendations to achieve this goal are as follows :
1. Utility Ownership of Solar Power Projects
“ The utility and solar industries must collaborate to find program structures , such as utility ownership of distributed photovoltaics , that provide a winning scenario for both industries , as well as for customers at large .
The solar industry can utilize this new market segment as a buffer until home and small business owners are back on more solid economic footing . ”
2. Increased Utility Engagement in Solar Markets
“ The utility and solar industries must work together to get more utilities engaged , starting by increasing the solar knowledge base of utility employees , from top executives down to distribution engineers .
We must move beyond having ninety seven percent of all grid - connected solar installations in just 10 utilities ’ service territories . ”
3. Streamlined Planning and Approval Systems
“ The utility and solar industries must work in partnership with regulators and investors to push for approval and funding of new transmission projects and the development of smart grid configurations to expedite the timeframe in which new utility - scale and distributed solar projects can come on line and provide maximum value . ”
4. Development of Innovative Approaches
“ By working in collaboration , the utility and solar industries can make great strides towards modernizing today ’s electricity infrastructure and offering customers affordable and clean power .
But the status quo will not achieve the necessary results .
We need bold new ideas developed in tandem for the mutual benefit of both industries , and society at large . ”
So that ’s all there is to it huh ?
Well , I guess we ’ll just have to wait and see .
Although , on the surface , the plan seems fairly straightforward , its achievement would require leadership and foresight , as well as big changes in the way that the key industry and government players interact .
However , given the major economic and environmental challenges facing us all , it ’s encouraging to see that at least someone has a plan …

THE VERDICT : Minimal risk .
Following the 0.0.1 release of Freekick and an update to 0.0.2 , I started noticing some problems in the implementation that showed a need for code refactoring .
There were certain issues that implied I should find out about the internal workings of Haskell , as in , trying to figure out how the language and the implementation I use ( Glasgow Haskell Compiler ) works in general , especially with regards to threading , scheduling and performance .
The first issue I ran into was about my physics engine .
I had defined a maximum velocity for my players of 8 m/s , but after some measurements I found out they were instead quite a bit slower .
( A tip for the future : implement a debug panel for having such information when you need it .
Measuring something like that should n’t be necessary . )
This implies that the physics engine has serious flaws .
I improved the engine slightly and it works slightly better now ( but still not as well as it should ) , but the improvements lead not only to faster players , but also to strange twitching , a flicker - kind of effect on my SDL client .
To figure out what causes the flicker , I needed to check the code for networking .
The way my networking code works at the moment is that the server ( physics engine ) only sends the positions of the players to the clients but no velocity or acceleration , and my SDL client does n’t calculate the velocity of the player but only places the player where the server tells the client to .
This is the simple method used in Quake that lead to problems back in 1996 when 56 k baud modems were fast : with a lag of 200 milliseconds and occasional packet loss the client would spend most of the time not knowing where the moving objects ( a.k.a. targets ) were exactly located .
The remedy that id came up with ( a technique that was also used in Duke Nukem 3D ) was brought to life in QuakeWorld , where the client would “ assume ” where the players would be located in based on their current / last known position and velocity .
This made Quake playable ( and a huge online success ) even with slower connections ( at the time I had a mere 14.4 k modem ) .
The technique is called client side prediction and there ’s a small section written about it in Wikipedia .
Now , since I do n’t expect a crowd of modem using people starting to play Freekick over the Internet , I did n’t implement client side prediction .
Since I have the Freekick server and client running on the same computer lag should n’t be the cause for twitching anyways .
But to make sure the client was receiving updates about the match state fast enough , I raised the server refresh rate , that is , the frequency with which the physics engine sends the match data to the client ( s ) .
The delay between refreshes was 40 milliseconds ( using threadDelay ) , which should actually be enough , but I dropped it to 20 milliseconds for testing .
Now , with the lightweight threads that Haskell offers ( using forkIO ) the refresh rate went up indeed , but the flicker stayed .
I tried compiling with the “ - threaded ” parameter , which made the situation only worse , as the minimum thread delay time using “ threadDelay ” went up to 40 milliseconds on my computer .
In the end I stayed with the lightweight threads , which does n’t really affect my single core anyways , but this points out a problem when optimising the engine for multiple cores .
However , the problem persisted .
Since my CPU was still nowhere near 100 % , I figured the problem has something to do with how Haskell handles high precision timing .
I ’ve tried Frag ( a 3D shooter written in Haskell ) on my computer , and while I was overall impressed by the game , it was hard not to notice how Frag was twitching with regular intervals as well .
As I do n’t know if there exists a remedy for the problem , nor if the cause indeed is something Haskell specific or just some obscure bug in SDL or in my client , I wanted to go for a completely different approach .
That ’s where C++ comes into play .
I ’ve actually had quite negative opinions about object oriented programming as well as C / C++ in the past , but on the other hand there are some rather impressive and useful libraries available where bindings to Haskell do n’t exist and can only be implemented with a lot of work .
The library that I thought of first was OGRE , the massively powerful 3D graphics library written in C ++.
There are actually a couple of articles about calling C++ functions from Haskell ( see here and here ) , but binding a library like OGRE to Haskell using the described methods is not really something I ’d like to spend my free time with .
I know that using OGRE for the client side would
a ) make the client run faster and with no flicker , and
b ) maybe even look a bit nicer
than the current client implementation using SDL , Haskell and 2D pixel - by - pixel drawing methods .
The middle way would be to use the apparently very well written Haskell bindings to OpenGL , but I did n’t really enjoy OpenGL very much the last time I used it five years ago and after seeing OGRE in action and realising using OGRE is actually easier than using OpenGL I do n’t really have the motivation .
Of course , the biggest reason to use OpenGL would be that I could keep on writing the client in Haskell , but in the end it ’s probably easier and more effective using C++ and OGRE .
That being decided , the next thing to do was to freshen up my C++ knowledge .
I actually never had much of formal education to C++ , instead I was using it much like “ C with classes ” .
Even though that was the primary objective of C++ in the beginning , modern C++ is a completely different subject that I somehow had failed to miss until now .
So I went and got me the book The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup and studied it through .
I can imagine that a lot of people who have no or very little experience with C or object oriented programming find the book confusing , but for me as someone with good knowledge in C and some idea what C++ is about the book was perfect : it explained all the ways C++ can be used to make programming more efficient and less error prone .
I think it ’s time for a small analysis about programming languages .
After using C and assembly language I ’ve gotten a pretty good picture about what the lower - level job of compilers is : shuffling around with the registers , allocating and keeping track of memory , testing for bits and so forth .
Languages like C build on top of this , making the whole resource and control flow management easier to write and read .
On the other hand , Haskell approaches the problem from the other side .
Haskell is designed from a mathematical point of view while trying to improve the efficiency of the programmer without clinging to the requirements and constraints of the machine , making Haskell code elegant and robust .
To me , writing code in Haskell is almost like using a perfect programming language .
Between C and Haskell , there ’s C ++.
My impression about C++ was originally ( unsurprisingly ) that it is not far away from C , but after seeing how C++ improves on C and adds language features that allow the use of completely new programming paradigms ( to C ) , C++ seems more and more Haskell - like to me .
With Haskell I learned to love the fundamental functional programming features that first seemed a little strange to me ( like currying , higher order functions , lambdas etc. ) .
I thought with C++ I ’d be giving them away in exchange for pointer arithmetic , buffer overflows and unsafe typing , but fortunately I could n’t have been more wrong .
Nearly all of the C features that do n’t seem to fit to modern software development are completely unnecessary in C++ , and a lot of functional concepts and other features I ’d miss from Haskell are brought in either as built - in C++ features ( e.g. safer typing , better mutability control ) , the standard library ( lists , currying , higher order functions ) and Boost libraries ( smart pointers for memory management , lambdas , serialization ) .
If you check out the Programming Language Shootout , you ’ll see that C++ is ( as expected ) usually faster than Haskell ( but the difference is not tremendous ) .
As is also very well known , there exist about ten thousand times more libraries for C++ than for Haskell .
In my opinion , those are pretty much all the aspects where C++ is “ better ” than Haskell .
On the other hand , Haskell code is easier to reason about , significantly shorter and therefore easier to read ( in my opinion , at the very least ) and the concept of type classes is something C++ and the templates still have a lot to learn from , making generic programming far easier and simpler in Haskell than in C ++.
However , when writing a client for Freekick , performance as well as external libraries do play an important role in the end , and therefore I ’ll go for C ++.
I ’m glad I ’ve seen Haskell as the finest example on how elegant code can be written , and I ’m also glad it ’s easy to use the same concepts in C ++.
The next thing I ’m going to do is read some more about object oriented design ( I ’ve got Design Patterns waiting for me ) and then go and implement a simple Freekick client using OGRE .
For that I need to reimplement the Freekick library in C++ as well , which is a nice exercise for OO design ( you should plan to throw the first one away anyway , right ? ) .
Having the library in C++ would in theory also make it possible to rewrite the server part in C++ , in which case I could use a top notch physics library like Bullet as well .
But first we ’ll see how the client turns out …

The US government has stepped in to rescue some struggling institutions
The FBI has begun an investigation into four major US financial institutions caught up in the current financial crisis , US media say .
Investigators are reportedly examining possible fraud by mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the failed bank Lehman Brothers and insurer AIG .
Top managers at those firms are also being investigated , the reports say .
In the past year , as the US housing market slumped , the FBI began a broad inquiry across the financial sector .
It was prompted by concerns over the way high - risk , " sub - prime " mortgages were being sold .
The FBI has been looking at lenders who sold home loans to buyers on low or unpredictable incomes and also the investment banks that packaged these loans and sold them on .
Bankruptcy
Investigations into the four companies were at an early stage , officials told the Associated Press news agency .
ABC News , citing unidentified sources , said the probes were assessing whether company officials systematically misled investors about the financial strength of their institutions .
The slump in the US housing market has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for these banks and turmoil in world credit markets .
Last week FBI director Robert Mueller said more than 20 large financial firms were already under investigation .
Bail - out
Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae and AIG are all being bailed out by the US government .
And the government recently announced a $ 700 bn bail - out plan that would enable banks to offload their bad debt .
But both Democrat and Republican politicians have voiced concerns that taxpayers could be paying a high price for the risks initially undertaken by banks .
Democrats want help for individuals who stand to lose their homes , as well as limits on pay for the bosses at the firms in question .
It ’s not surprising at all that the Washington Post ’s David Broder would prefer to see the presidential candidates stick to responsible , substance - driven campaigns .
It ’s also not surprising that Broder would enjoy a series of town - hall “ debates ” between the two candidates .
What ’s odd , though , is seeing Broder try to connect the two , suggesting the lack of the latter has a causal relationship with the lack of the prior .
The first question I asked John McCain and then Barack Obama was :
How do you feel about the tone and direction of the campaign so far ?
No surprise .
Both men pronounced themselves thoroughly frustrated by the personal bitterness and negativism they have seen in the two months since they learned they would be running against each other .
“ I ’m very sorry about it , ” McCain said in a Saturday interview at his Arlington headquarters .
“ I think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings ” together , as he had suggested , during the summer months .
First , it ’s interesting that McCain is “ very sorry ” about the tone of the campaign now , given that it was just one week ago when McCain told reporters , “ I ’m proud of the campaign that we have run .
I ’m proud of the issues that we have been trying to address with the American people . ”
Second , the notion that the campaigns “ could have avoided … some of this ” if there ’d been 15 debates instead of three does n’t make any sense .
It ’s a classic non sequitur — whether McCain runs a relentlessly negative , substance - free campaign has nothing to do with his proposal for extra debates .
And yet , Broder really seems to think there ’s something to this .
Since the idea of joint town meetings was scrapped , the campaign has featured tough and often negative ads and speeches . [… ]
When I asked Obama how he thought the campaign could be returned to the issues , he said he hoped that the two conventions would “ offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas ” and that the three scheduled presidential debates then “ will allow people to see Senator McCain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because you ’re standing there face to face . ”
I told Obama that McCain made exactly that point in arguing for the early joint appearances .
What McCain actually said was : “ When you have to stand on a stage with your opponent , as I ’ve done in other campaigns , you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship … .
When you have to spend time with somebody , I think it changes the equation . ”
Let ’s not brush past this too quickly .
McCain seems to have told Broder that he ’s running a negative campaign because he has n’t built up a strong enough rapport with his Senate colleague .
He wants to “ improve the relationship , ” and “ spend time with ” Obama , but since there have n’t been extra debates , McCain feels justified launching a series of ridiculous attacks ( which he ’s “ very sorry about ” ) .
This is terribly silly .
If McCain wanted to run a substantive , grown - up campaign , he could .
Whether there are three debates or 300 is irrelevant .
It ’s not like McCain and Steve Schmidt got together one day on Cindy McCain ’s private jet and said , “ Well , I was n’t going to accuse Obama of wanting to lose a war and of being responsible for high gas prices , but since there are only going to be three debates , we might as well . ”
Why would Broder find this message compelling ?
When Broder pressed the point with Obama , he responded , “ I think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances , Senator McCain felt obliged to suggest that I ’d rather lose a war to win a campaign does n’t automatically follow .
I think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns , and we have to take responsibility for that . ”
What a concept .
The ultra-small bacteria species , Chryseobacterium greenlandensis , has tiny bud - like structures on its surface , which could play a role in the organism 's survival in the Greenland glacier where it was found .
We all came from hermaphrodites , organisms with both male and female reproductive organs .
And though the origin traces back more than 100 million years , biologists have scratched their heads over how and why the separate male and female sexes evolved .
Now , research on wild strawberry plants is providing evidence for such a transition and the emergence of sex , at least in plants .
And the results , which are detailed in the December issue of the journal Heredity , likely apply to animals like us , the researchers say .
The study showed that two genes located at different spots on a chromosome can cast strawberry offspring as a single sex , a hermaphrodite or a neuter ( neither male nor female , and essentially sterile ) .
The researchers suspect the two genes could be responsible for one of the earliest stages of the transition from asexual to sexual beings .
" All of the animals and plants that are bi-sexual , or have two sexes , are theorized to have evolved according to a particular set of steps , " said researcher Kim Lewers , a plant geneticist at the USDA 's Genetic Improvement of Fruits and Vegetables Lab in Maryland .
" Until now , no example had been found of the very earliest steps .
Therefore , those steps were undemonstrated to be true . "
She added , " Finding this example of the very earliest stage allowed us to say the theory is probably right . "
Sex chromosomes , which are the cellular basis for the male and female sexes , for placental mammals ( a group that includes humans ) and marsupials likely originated between 166 million and 145 million years ago .
Flowering plants ( plants equipped with reproductive organs ) were n't around until about 140 million to 180 million years ago .
" Within flowering plants , separate sexes is thought to have evolved from hermaphroditism independently and repeatedly among lineages , " said researcher Rachel Spigler , a postdoctoral student at the University of Pittsburgh , " so there is no one specific date for the evolution of sex chromosomes in plants . "
Lewers , Spigler and their colleagues spotted the genetic mutation in a wild strawberry species , Fragaria virginiana , in which the evolution of separate sexes is not complete .
So in addition to male and female strawberry plants , there are also some hermaphrodites and neutered individuals .
Through lab work , including genetic mapping , the researchers figured out how the wacky mix of sexes , or no-sexes , worked .
The plants each have two proto -sex chromosomes .
Two spots on each proto - sex chromosome contain sex - determining genes , one that controls sterility and fertility in males and another that does the same in females .
Offspring that inherit both fertility versions are hemaphrodites and can self - breed , while plants that inherit one fertility and one sterility version become either male or female .
( A female would result from a sterile male and fertile female combination of genes . )
Those that get both sterility versions of the genes are considered neuters and can't reproduce , so they ultimately die out .
While the two sex - determining genes are close to one another on the proto - sex chromosomes , the researchers say they are not completely linked .
That 's why the strawberry offspring can get such a wild mix of the genes .
On our sex chromosomes , for instance , this mixing and matching is not possible ( or at least very rare ) , because the female chromosome is one unit and so is the male sex chromosome .
This is n't the first time we 've heard that Toyota might spin off the Prius as a separate brand much like Scion .
But we now have the most concrete news about the automaker 's plans we 've seen yet .
Micheline Maynard of The New York Times talked with James E. Lentz , president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. recently who said he was actively lobbying Toyota for the Prius brand spinoff and that the company was working on future models to expand the lineup .
Lentz said he was pushing for a Yaris - sized Prius and a " Prius on steroids . "
He would n't comment on rumors of a Prius crossover , however .
Lentz also said the new line would be sold alongside Toyota vehicles instead of separately like the company 's Lexus brand .
When might this new Prius brand be approved by Toyota ?
Lentz would only say that he has a meeting in Japan next month .
Maynard writes that in all her years covering Toyota , " ... I can say that executives rarely talk this much about an idea unless it is under active discussion , so the chances of a Prius brand are probably pretty good . "

Barack Obama will try to close the deal with American voters tonight with an extraordinary half - hour , prime - time television address – the first advertisement of this duration to be broadcast by a presidential candidate since the early 1990s .
The Democratic candidate can afford to make his ambitious pitch because he has already surpassed all expectations by raising more than $ 600 m ( £ 380 m ) .
He is spending the money in an attempt to reach the 25 per cent of US voters who are registered as independent .
His " infomercial " reflects the increasing assurance of the Illinois senator in the final days of the campaign .
The content has been kept under lock and key , it will air on three networks and will cost an estimated $ 1 m per network .
Fox , CBS and NBC have all cleared their 8 pm schedules to broadcast it .
Mr Obama has used his cash and regular campaign visits to target Republican - voting states such as Montana and has broken through in states which previous Democratic candidates ignored .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There is a plenty of hand - wringing about the excessive influence of money in US elections , but not , for a change , among the Democrats .
Although they have long complained about Republican access to corporate money , they are staying quiet this time and are in no mood to surrender the huge advantage they have developed .
Any attempt at reform is also complicated by loopholes that allow well - funded single - issue groups to influence elections through so - called " 527 groups " , which can accept unlimited contributions for political advertising .
The Obama campaign 's secret weapon has been the perfection of micro-donations which have come from more than three million supporters .
The effective use of online fund - raising has helped Mr Obama tear up the rule book under which candidates for both parties used public finances while shaking down corporate America and wealthy donors to fund their campaigns .
The Democrat 's campaign is now so flush with money that advertisements are all but blotting out the light for John McCain , whose campaign had to accept $ 85 m in taxpayers ' money to continue to make his case to the electorate .
He has tried to make up for the lack of funds by putting himself and his running mate Sarah Palin on national television as often as possible , even when it has meant that she was lampooned as out of her depth .
Mr McCain 's cash shortfall has been more than compensated for with money raised by the Republican National Committee , which finished last month with $ 77 m in the bank .
But he has still been outspent by three - and - a - half - to - one on television , according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group .
Mr Obama has steered clear of public finances , which has enabled him to keep raising phenomenal amounts of money throughout his campaign .
His campaign manager David Plouffe recently send a video message to supporters revealing that 632,000 new donors signed up in September , bringing the total to 3.1 million .
And the campaign has been spending money as fast as it has hit his account .
He is believed to have shelled out $ 250 m on television over the past five months , and has already dwarfed the $ 188 m that George Bush spent getting re-elected in 2004 .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska --
There are two things people here remember about Sarah Palin 's debating style during her race for governor two years ago .
One is the stack of color - coded cue cards she took to the podium for help whenever she was asked a policy question .
The other is how quickly she was able to shuck those props , master the thrust - and - parry of jousting with her opponents and inquisitors , and project confidence to an audience of television viewers watching from home .
" That 's the Sarah Palin I remember from the 2006 debates : positive , confident and upbeat , " recalls Libby Casey , an Alaska public - radio reporter who served as a debate moderator on two occasions that year .
That 's a contrast from the image projected by Gov. Palin in recent TV interviews in which she has seemed shaky on basic facts -- performances that have made even many of her fellow Republicans nervous about the vice - presidential debate scheduled for Thursday .
Her Democratic opponent , Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware , is a veteran of three decades of congressional deliberations , as well as two rounds of presidential - nominating contests with their own sets of debates .
And it may take more than style points to reassure viewers rattled by relentless news this week of economic dislocation .

" Nixon said in 1970 that we were importing 20 % of our oil and that by 1980 it would be 0 % .
That did n't happen , " Pickens says .
" It went to 42 % in 1991 with the Gulf War .
It 's just under 70 % now .
Where do you think we 're going to be in 10 years when our economy is busted and we 're importing 80 % of our oil ? "
Finding solutions to other major issues , including health care , are important , he concedes .
But " If you do n't solve the energy problem , it 's going to break us before we even get to solving health care and some of these other important issues . "
And it has to be done with the same sense of urgency that President Eisenhower had when he pushed the rapid development of the interstate highway system during the Cold War .
Of course , Pickens also has a particular solution in mind .
Wind .
And natural gas .
Last week , Pickens loaded up his $ 60 million , top - of - the - line Gulfstream G550 corporate jet with reporters and a few associates from his Dallas - based BP Capital energy hedge fund and related companies and flew here to illustrate just how big — and achievable — his vision is .
There 's not much to Sweetwater except for wild grasses , scraggy mesquite trees and rattlesnakes ( Sweetwater hosts its famous Rattlesnake Roundup each spring ) .
The gently rolling terrain and vegetation make it ideal for raising cattle , which is what its first settlers did in the 19th century , and what their descendants do today .
A regional oil boom in the 1950s and 1960s poured money into the area 's economy , as have two oil revivals since : one in the 1980s and one now .
But the exciting new industry in town is wind energy .
You can drive for 150 miles along Interstate 20 and never be out of sight of a giant wind turbine , claims Sweetwater Mayor Greg Wortham , who does double duty as executive director of the West Texas Wind Energy Consortium .
Were it a country all by itself , Nolan County , Texas , would rank sixth on the list of wind - energy - producing nations , says Wortham .
Year - round wind conditions , the terrain , low land prices and a small population make it an ideal location for wind farms .
It already produces more wind - generated electricity in a year than all of California .
And the business is growing so fast that he struggles to define it by numbers .
By year 's end , there 'll be more than 1,500 turbines in Nolan County , representing a $ 5 billion investment .
In the multicounty Rolling Plains region , there are already 2,000 operating turbines .
Add those operating further west , the Permian Basin region around Midland and Odessa , and the entire area has more than 3,000 turbines operating , producing about 6,000 megawatts of electricity — about equal to the power produced by two to three nuclear power plants .
Growth potential
The growth potential is , well , electrifying .
New turbine towers are going up at a rate of three to four a day in the Sweetwater area , Wortham says .
" It depends on the ( Texas ) Public Utility Commission , but the number could be 20,000 ultimately , " Wortham says .
Pickens , who over the past two years has become the USA 's biggest wind - power booster , is quick to note that " there could be lots of Sweetwaters out there , " especially in the nation 's midsection , where winds are ideal for power generation .
Indeed , though Sweetwater is a windy place , plenty of locations farther north in the Great Plains are even better suited to wind farming .
One is about 250 miles north of Sweetwater , near Pampa , northeast of Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle .
That 's where Pickens is building what would be the world 's largest wind farm , four times larger than the current titleholder near here .
So far , he has spent $ 2 billion on the project , including a record purchase of nearly 700 wind turbines this year from General Electric .
He expects to spend up to $ 10 billion on the project and to begin generating electricity in 2011 .
Though Pickens does n't own a single wind turbine in the Sweetwater area , Wortham was eager to play host to the oil baron and the reporters traveling with him .
Sweetwater , he says , is proof that wind power has much more potential than its many skeptics believe .
" People hear about the 8 - foot - tall wind turbines at Logan airport in Boston or the five turbines at Atlantic City and think ' interesting , ' " Wortham says .
" But they do n't see how we can get to the 300,000 - megawatt - production level " established by the Bush administration as a national goal for 2030 .
" Once you come to Sweetwater , you see that it can be done , and be done pretty easily , not only here , but … anywhere there are prime wind conditions .
None of this existed seven years ago .
Now , we produce enough electricity in this one county to power a large city , and we do it cheaply and cleanly . "
Getting lots more electricity with wind is only half of the Pickens Plan .
Increasing wind - power production by itself wo n't reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil because most of that oil is consumed as gasoline .
The key , Pickens says , is that wind energy can be used as a substitute for natural gas now burned to generate electricity .
That , in turn , will make far more natural gas available for use as a transportation fuel .
Pickens ' plan is to produce enough wind power within 10 years to divert 20 % of the natural gas now used to fuel power plants for use in cars and trucks .
That 's much more aggressive a growth plan for the development of wind energy than envisioned by the Department of Energy , which does n't expect the USA to be getting 20 % of its total energy needs from wind until at least 2030 .
Pickens foresees as many as a third of the vehicles running on natural gas within only a few years .
Julius Pretterebner , director of the Global Oil Group at Cambridge Energy Research Associates , says getting 15 % to 20 % of the USA 's cars to run on natural gas — in some cases , in mixtures with other fuels in dual - fuel vehicles — by 2020 would be an outstanding achievement , and doing that will require federal support to expand the necessary infrastructure .
Powering vehicles with compressed or liquefied natural gas , CNG or LNG , has been Pickens ' pet project since the late 1980s .
Yet the concept has been very slow to catch on .
Distribution is a major problem .
CNG drivers can , like Pickens , install inexpensive equipment to fill up at their homes .
But with fewer than 800 natural gas filling stations around the USA , drivers can't count on being able to fill up wherever they go .
So , for the most part , CNG , or LNG , has remained limited to fleet operators , such as local bus companies or big-city police departments .
And that 's where David Friedman , research director in the vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists , says most natural - gas - powered vehicles will continue to be operated because of the distribution problem , the lack of vehicles made specifically to run on CNG , and the cost of converting conventional vehicles to run on CNG .
" I honestly think ( natural gas ' ) role will be in medium - to heavy - duty vehicles and fleets — and as a stepping stone to hydrogen fuel - cell - powered vehicles in the future , " Friedman says .
Only one car , a version of the Honda Civic , is available from the factory ready for CNG fuel , he says , and only at a significant premium over the price of a conventionally fueled version .
If you build it … Pickens aims to shout down the skeptics by taking his case to the people via his TV ad campaign .
If the nation is to break its addiction to foreign oil , a network of CNG stations could be built along interstates and in major cities for a relatively small investment , he says .
Some gasoline retailers have told him they would add CNG pumps to their stations once they 're certain there 'll be enough vehicles capable of running on natural gas to justify costs .
Washington , Pickens adds , can encourage the move to natural - gas - powered vehicles by providing modest economic incentives for fuel retailers to invest in CNG pumps at their stations , for automakers to build CNG - powered cars and for individuals to convert their existing vehicles to CNG use .
And it should continue to provide tax incentives for another 10 years to encourage wind energy 's rapid development as part of an overall plan to wean the nation from foreign oil , he says .
" It certainly would be cheaper than what they 're doing already for nuclear , " Pickens adds .
But he 's also in favor of developing more nuclear energy , and every form of alternative energy to reduce oil imports .
" Try everything .
Do everything .
Nuclear .
Biomass .
Coal .
Solar .
You name it .
I support them all , " he says .
" But there 's only one energy source that can dramatically reduce the amount of oil we have to import each year , and that 's ( natural ) gas . "
Pickens is an outspoken believer in the so - called peak oil theory that holds that maximum world production has peaked at about 85 million barrels a day — vs. current demand of about 86 million barrels a day — and will never rise much above that even with lots of new drilling and production .
" Even people who continue driving gasoline - powered cars and trucks will benefit " from his plan , he says .
Critics could easily accuse Pickens of advocating a major new public policy initiative that will line his own pockets .
He is , after all , a big player in both the wind power and natural gas businesses .
Pickens says while his hedge fund will earn money for its investors , earning more money personally is meaningless : " I 'm 80 years old and have $ 4 billion .
I do n't need any more money . "
He 's more concerned that his efforts to make reducing foreign oil dependency the No. 1 issue on the national agenda will be dismissed by the public and , therefore , by Washington .
So he says he 's carefully steering his plan clear of partisan bickering .
He 's already enlisted an unlikely supporter : the Sierra Club .
" I will be in the front row of the chorus cheering " him on , says Carl Pope , its executive director , who flew with Pickens to Sweetwater .
Pope sees wind and solar energy as inexpensive sources of power that , along with other non-carbon forms , can be pooled to greatly reduce the need for oil - and coal - fired electric - generating plants .
" When it 's cloudy in Dallas and the wind 's not blowing in Sweetwater , but the sun 's blazing in the ( Western ) deserts , solar energy can run all those air conditioners in Dallas .
When it 's windy in Sweetwater and cloudy in the desert , wind energy from Sweetwater can heat homes in Chicago .
" Mr. Pickens and I probably do n't see eye - to - eye on some other matters , " Pope concedes .
" But he 's right on this one . "
Setting goals , clearing roadblocks Washington 's role , Pope said , should be in setting the goal and clearing roadblocks such as the patchwork of state , regional and federal regulations that block the creation of a true national grid that can shift electricity from anywhere in the country to anywhere that it 's needed .
Getting support from groups and people not ordinarily aligned with his conservative political views is important to Pickens .
A lifelong Republican , he 'll vote for McCain .
But he 's not involved with McCain 's campaign , largely to keep his plan from being dismissed as mere campaign rhetoric .
" This has to be a bipartisan effort , " says the man who four years ago offered $ 1 million to anyone who could disprove the charges made against Democrat nomine Sen.
John Kerry by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
" This is not about Republicans vs. Democrats , " Pickens says .
" This is about saving our country from the ruination of spending $ 700 billion a year on oil imports .
Ninety days after the oil hits our shores , it 's all burned up , and we 've got nothing to show for it .
But they ( foreign oil producers ) still have our money .
It 's killing our economy . "

“ All of this happened because of you , ” the e-mail message said .
“ We just made history . ”
With that simple “ we ” in millions of in - boxes , the post - baby - boomer era seems to have begun .
The endless “ us versus them ” battles of the ’60s , over Vietnam , abortion , race and gender , at least for a moment last week , seemed as out - of - touch as a rotary phone .
Of course , that was Mr. Obama ’s goal .
In his book , “ The Audacity of Hope , ” he was explicit in his desire to move beyond “ the psychodrama of the Baby Boom generation  a tale rooted in old grudges and revenge plots hatched on a handful of college campuses long ago . ”
Mr. Obama ’s victory was greatly helped by his young allies .
More 18 - to 29 - year - olds went to the polls this year than in any election since 1972  between 21.6 million and 23.9 million , up from about 19.4 million in 2004 , according to preliminary estimates from the Center for Information and Research of Civic Learning and Engagement .
And 66 percent voted for Mr. Obama , according to exit polls by Edison / Mitofsky .
These young voters and those slightly older , who together may forever be known as Generation O , were the ground troops of the campaign .
They opened hundreds of Obama offices in remote areas , registered voters and persuaded older relatives to take a chance on the man with the middle name Hussein .
They saw in Mr. Obama , 47 , who was born at the tail end of the baby boom era , the values that sociologists and cultural critics ascribe to them .
Government under Mr. Obama , they believe , would value personal disclosure and transparency in the mode of social - networking sites .
Teamwork would be in fashion , along with a strict meritocracy .
* U.S. auto sales drop to lowest level in 25 years * GM U.S. sales down 45 pct , Toyota off 29 pct * Sales in Spain , Italy , France also tumble in October
DETROIT , Nov 3 ( Reuters ) - U.S. auto sales plunged near 25 - year lows in October , led by a 45 percent drop at General Motors Corp GM.N , with no sign the industry 's year - long slump had hit bottom and doubts persisting that all the major automakers can survive .
Hurt by tighter credit and deepening uncertainty about the strength of the economy , U.S. sales fell to their weakest monthly level since 1983 , based on early sales results .
European auto sales also tumbled for October , with sales declines of 40 percent in Spain and 19 percent in Italy .
Adjusting the figures for the population of the United States , GM said October was the industry ’s weakest month since the end of World War Two .
Sales for Toyota Motor Co < 7203 .
T dropped 23 percent , Ford Motor Co F.N was off 29 percent , Honda Motor Co 7267 .
T fell 25 percent and Nissan Motor Co 7201 .
T tumbled 33 percent .
“ The financial crisis has generated an abrupt constraint on economic activity , ” said Ford economist Emily Kolinski Morris , who added that the No. 2 U.S. automaker did not think the third quarter represented the bottom of the downturn .
Ford said it could reduce production of passenger cars and crossover vehicles in the coming weeks by cutting overtime and suspending work at some of its plants .
Industry - wide U.S. sales of cars and light trucks were on track to come in below 900,000 units in October after dropping below the 1 million threshold in September for the first time in 15 years , according to initial sales data .
That raised the stakes for a more aggressive round of discounting in November and December as automakers prepared to clear remaining 2008 model - year inventory in exchange for cut -rate financing and other incentives .
GM said it would roll out a “ Red Tag ” sale with lower vehicle prices and cash - back offers starting on Tuesday .
Toyota , which has overtaken GM as the global auto sales leader , launched a zero percent financing offer in October backed by a high - profile ad campaign aimed to take advantage of the relative strength of Toyota ’s financing arm .
Nissan launched its own zero percent financing offer for November and December , and expressed confidence that would help its own results move higher from October levels .
“ I think there ’s a lot of consumer uncertainty , but you ’ve also got real - world stories from dealers about how credit has tightened up all around , ” Nissan division U.S. sales chief Al Castignetti said .
GM , CHRYSLER REMAIN IN FOCUS
GM ’s North American sales chief Mark LaNeve said auto sales were suffering from the fallout of an “ unprecedented credit crunch . ”
“ It was like someone turned off the lights in the month of October , ” said LaNeve , who estimated that tighter consumer credit standards at GM ’s affiliated finance company GMAC had cost the automaker up to 60,000 vehicle sales in the month .
The near - freefall in October sales represented the first results since word emerged last month of merger talks between GM and Chrysler LLC , owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management .
GM had sought some $ 10 billion in government aid to support the merger , a request the U.S. Treasury Department rebuffed last week .
That put the focus on whatever support the industry can win from the incoming White House after Tuesday ’s presidential vote , people familiar with the talks have said .
Chrysler Chief Executive Bob Nardelli said on Monday that while Chrysler had been in talks with other parties , its recent cost - cutting actions were needed to emerge from the downturn .
“ The difficult actions we have taken in the past , and those that we have just announced , are for one purpose and one purpose only : helping Chrysler survive this economic trough , ” Nardelli said in a message to staff obtained by Reuters .
[ ID : nN03333601 ]
Meanwhile , auto sales were expected to fall by at least 10 percent in Germany , Europe ’s largest economy , when official figures are released .
[ ID:nL3700856 ]
In France sales fell 7.3 percent .

How and Why to Use Split Screen on Mac
Everyone who uses a computer these days is a multi-tasker .
Perhaps you ’re old enough to remember the times when desktops and laptops could only operate with one window at a time because they did n’t have much memory ?
Today , we have more computer power in our laptops than was used to launch space ships into space .
One of the key features of these modern computers is just how easy they make multitasking , which brings us to the ability to split - screen on Mac .
This is an especially useful feature if you have just purchased a new 16 - inch MacBook Pro .
Here ’s how to split - screen on Mac .
What is Split - Screen ?
Split - screen is the ability to have two windows open at once on your desktop , generally equally split , side - by - side .
It ’s a great way of multi-tasking and working on two projects at once .
It ’s also a great way of making it easier to work on one task at once .
Imagine you have interviewed someone for a magazine or a report and you are trying to type it up .
Working on One Task with Multiple Programs
Split - screen allows you to have a Word or Pages document open on one half of the screen where you can transcribe the interview and the recording of the interview in the other window .
This means that you do n’t have to keep minimizing your Word document to pause the interview , which can get irritating and might mean you lose your place and have to backtrack .
If you also want to watch television and make notes on your favorite show or it ’s an educational show and you need to pay close attention then split - screen is for you .
Multi-Tasking
The possibilities for multitasking with split - screen are endless .
You can talk to friends using Facebook Messenger on a web browser while also watching television or changing the song on Spotify or Apple Music .
You could even download the Kindle App and read while talking to friends or read and watch Netflix at the same time .
Those Magic Traffic Lights
Before starting to learn how to split screen on a Mac , be sure to install the latest version of Mac OS .
Having the most up - to - date version of Mac OS will ensure you have access to all the correct features and will help to keep your computer secure from viruses and hackers .
The latest version is Mac OS 10.15 – Catalina .
After you have done this , the way to get split - screen to work on Macs is to make use of the three traffic light buttons in the top left - hand corner of your window : one red , one amber , and the other green .
Hold down on the green button or hover your cursor over it .
When you do this you should be given three options .
The first is to enter full - screen mode so that the dock and menu bar are both no longer visible .
The other two options are to move your screen to take up half of the space of your screen , either to the left or the right .
Once you have selected which option you want , your window will only take up half the screen .
The other half of the screen will appear blank allowing you to select one of your remaining windows to fill up this space .
Now you can use two programs at once !
Compatible Split - Screen Programs
Remember that not every program is compatible with split - screen .
Some programs such as VPN servers or smaller programs may not work with split - screen .
Also do note that you will need to have the programs open first before you can select them in split - screen .
If it ’s a program that is n’t in your dock and you want to use split - screen often , consider pinning the program to your dock to save yourself time .
Exiting Split- Screen
When you finish using one program , you will no doubt want to exit split - screen so that your screen is not too cluttered .
In order to do that , click on the program you want to continue using and hover and press the green button again .
You need to press the exit full - screen option .
The other window you are using will disappear back into the dock .
The window that you want to keep will then fill up the whole screen once again .
You need to use this process and start the entire split - screen process again if you want to change one of the windows .
Remember you can also readjust the size of windows by pressing on the corners and selecting the diagonal arrows to manually arrange your windows so that perhaps one window fills three - quarters of the screen and other fills the other quarter .
Split - Screen on Mac Is Great For Multi-Tasking
If you are thinking about multi-tasking on a Mac computer then you ca n’t go wrong with the split - screen view .
It enables you to work on two documents at the same time or to transcribe an interview without having to continuously switch from one program to the other .
You can also reply to Facebook messages or emails while watching a documentary or a film on Netflix .
Using split - screen is also dead easy .
You simply have to select and open the windows you want .
Then you can proceed to press the green button – one of the three traffic lights – in the top left - hand corner .
You will then be presented with the option of splitting the screen to the left or the right .

I had to read this one twice because , I know it is illegal for a Presidential Candidate to receive money from a foreign government .
The irony is that McCain , just the other month , was shooting off his mouth about Russia and they fired back with their own round of insults after his knee jerk criticisms .
The Washington Post has the excuse from their spokesman over the “ mix - up ” and the letter that the U.N. Russian Ambassador received from the McCain Campaign .
The Russian mission to the United Nations furnished a copy of a Sept. 29 campaign letter it received urging U.N. ambassador Vitaly I. Churkin to contribute up to $ 5,000 to “ stop the Obama Democrats from seizing control of the entire federal government . ”
“ Please know this — we will not concede any region to the Democrats , ” the letter states .
The Russian mission issued a statement saying “ we have received a letter from Senator John McCain with a request for a financial donation to his presidential election campaign .
In this respect we have to reiterate that neither Russia ’s permanent mission to the United Nations , nor the Russian government or its officials finance political activities in foreign countries . ”
It is illegal for an American political candidate to accept campaign contributions from a foreign government .
“ It was just a mistake .
We do n’t solicit folks who ca n’t give , ” said McCain - Palin spokesman Brian Rogers .
Asked whether there were any other ambassadors that they planned to solicit , Rogers laughed and said , “ I hope not .
Maybe we ’ll find out tomorrow . ”
Diplomats from several other powerful nations said that they do not believe that they had receive any financial appeals from either Obama or McCain .
“ He must have been really desperate , ” said one European official , when informed of McCain ’s Russian appeal .
Couric vs. Palin , round 17
Score another one to Couric , with that much - awaited Supreme Court question :
COURIC : What other Supreme Court decisions [ than Roe v. Wade ] do you disagree with ?
PALIN : Well , let 's see .
There 's -- of course -- in the great history of America rulings there have been rulings , that 's never going to be absolute consensus by every American .
And there are -- those issues , again , like Roe v Wade where I believe are best held on a state level and addressed there .
So you know -- going through the history of America , there would be others but -- COURIC : Can you think of any ?
PALIN : Well , I could think of -- of any again , that could be best dealt with on a more local level .
Maybe I would take issue with .
But you know , as mayor , and then as governor and even as a Vice President , if I 'm so privileged to serve , would n't be in a position of changing those things but in supporting the law of the land as it reads today .
UPDATE : While the exchange above is a bit painful , it seems as much a matter of simply blanking as having never heard of another decision .
Indeed , she 's spoken at length on the recent Exxon Valdez ruling reducing damages in that case .
But legally - minded readers point something that really is a truer gaffe .
COURIC ( to Palin ) :
Do you think there 's an inherent right to privacy in the Constitution ?
PALIN : I do .
Yeah , I do .
COURIC : The cornerstone of Roe v Wade .
PALIN : I do .
And I believe that -- individual states can handle what the people within the different constituencies in the 50 states would like to see their will ushered in in an issue like that .
As Couric notes in the exchange , Palin appears actually to support Roe .
Or , rather , to be a results - oriented conservative -- she 's against abortion rights -- rather than having even the ability to pretend to base it on Constitutional law .

VICE PRESIDENTIAL QUESTIONS ” ON TONIGHT’S
“ CBS EVENING NEWS WITH KATIE COURIC ”
“ Vice Presidential Questions ” with Sen. Joe Biden and Gov. Sarah Palin debuts tonight ( 1 ) on the CBS EVENING NEWS WITH KATIE COURIC .
Following is the transcript from tonight ’s broadcast .
The series continues tomorrow ( 2 ) on the CBS EVENING NEWS .
Mandatory Credit : the CBS EVENING NEWS WITH KATIE COURIC
COURIC : Joe Biden and Sarah Palin have put in some very long days , preparing for tomorrow night 's debate .
Tonight , to give you a better sense of who they are and their views on a number of issues , we 're beginning a new series , " Vice Presidential Questions . "
We begin with an issue that 's divided this nation for decades .
COURIC ( to Biden ) :
Why do you think Roe v Wade was a good decision ?
BIDEN : Because it 's close to a consensus that can exist in a society as heterogeneous as ours .
What does it say ?
It says in the first three months that decision should be left to the woman .
And the second three months where Roe v Wade says well , the state , the government has a role .
Along with the women 's health
They have a right to have some impact on that .
And the third three months they say the weight -- of -- of the government 's input is on the fetus being carried .
That 's sort of reflected as close anybody is ever going to get in this heterogeneous , this multicultural society of religious people as to some sort of not consensus but as close it gets .
I think the liberty clause of the 14th amendment is -- offers a right to privacy .
now that 's one of the big debates that I have with my conservative scholar friend that they say you know unless a right is enumerated unless it 's actually , unless uses the word privacy in the Constitution , then no such constitutional right exists .
Well , I think people have an inherent right .
COURIC : ( to Biden ) : What are the Supreme Court decisions you disagree with ?
BIDEN : You know , I 'm the guy who wrote the Violence Against Women act .
And I said that every woman in America if they are beaten and abused by a man should be able to take that person to court .
Meaning you should be able to go to federal court and sue in federal court the man who abused you if you can prove that abuse .
But they said no that a woman , there 's no federal jurisdiction and I held , they acknowledged , I held about 1,000 hours of hearings proving that there 's an effect in interstate commerce .
Women who are abused and beaten and beaten are women who are not able to be in the work force .
And the Supreme Court said there is an impact on commerce but this is federalizing a private crime and we 're not going to allow it .
I think the Supreme Court was wrong about that decision .
COURIC ( to Palin ) :
Why , in your view , is Roe v Wade a bad decision ?
PALIN : I think it should be a states issue not a federal government -- mandated - - mandating yes or no on such an important issue .
I 'm in that sense a federalist , where I believe that states should have more say in the laws of their lands and individual areas .
Now foundationally , also , though , it 's no secret that I 'm pro life that I believe in a culture of life is very important for this country .
Personally that 's what I would like to see further embraced by America .
COURIC ( to Palin ) :
Do you think there 's an inherent right to privacy in the Constitution ?
PALIN : I do .
Yeah , I do .
COURIC : the cornerstone of Roe v Wade
PALIN : I do .
And I believe that -- individual states can handle what the people within the different constituencies in the 50 states would like to see their will ushered in in an issue like that .
COURIC : What other Supreme Court decisions do you disagree with ?
PALIN : Well , let 's see .
There 's -- of course -- in the great history of America rulings there have been rulings , that 's never going to be absolute consensus by every American .
And there are -- those issues , again , like Roe v Wade where I believe are best held on a state level and addressed there .
So you know -- going through the history of America , there would be others but --
COURIC : Can you think of any ?
PALIN : Well , I could think of -- of any again , that could be best dealt with on a more local level .
Maybe I would take issue with .
But you know , as mayor , and then as governor and even as a Vice President , if I 'm so privileged to serve , would n't be in a position of changing those things but in supporting the law of the land as it reads today .
COURIC : Thomas Jefferson wrote about the First Amendment , building a wall of separation between church and state .
Why do you think that 's ( so ) important ?
PALIN : His intention in expressing that was so that government did not mandate a religion on people .
And Thomas Jefferson also said never underestimate the wisdom of the people .
And the wisdom of the people I think in -- in this issue is that people have the right and the ability and desire to express their own religious views -- be it a very personal level , which is why I choose to express my faith in a more public forum .
And the wisdom of the people , thankfully , engrained in the foundation of our country is so extremely important .
And Thomas Jefferson wanted to protect that .
BIDEN : The best way to look at it is look the every state where the wall 's not built .
Look at every country in the world where religion is able to impact the governance .
Almost every one of those countries are in real turmoil .
Look , the founders were pretty smart .
They had gone through -- you know -- several hundred years of wars .
Religious wars .
And they were in the midst of religious wars in Europe .
The best way to do this is to keep the government out of religion .
They took religion out of government .
But they did n't mean religion could n't be in a public place .
In the public square .

Once again , Republican presidential candidate John McCain has issued a statement rejecting the remarks of one of his supporters .
This time Pastor Arnold Conrad said during the invocation that he delivered before McCain ’s speech in Davenport , Iowa that other gods , including Allah , are praying for an Obama win .
According to Marc Ambinder , here is what Conrad said , “ I also would also pray , Lord , that your reputation is involved in all that happens between now and November , because there are millions of people around this world praying to their god–whether it ’s Hindu , Buddha , Allah–that his opponent wins , for a variety of reasons .
And Lord , I pray that you will guard your own reputation , because they ’re going to think that their God is bigger than you , if that happens .
So I pray that you will step forward and honor your own name with all that happens between now and election day . ”
For the second time this week the McCain campaign had to issue a statement rejecting the comments of one of their supporters .
McCain aide Wendy Reinmann said , “ While we understand the important role that faith plays in informing the votes of Iowans , questions about the religious background of the candidates only serve to distract from the real questions in this race about Barack Obama ’s judgment , policies and readiness to lead as commander in chief . ”

Of course , Conrad was implying the other religions want Obama to win because he is the non-Christian candidate .
Besides the fact that this so called man of faith completely lied about Obama ’s religion , this is the kind of thing that happens when politics get preached from the pulpit .
I also think that the Republican Party is now paying the price for letting the radical social conservative wing dominate .
Comment ’s like Conrad ’s are common in evangelical circles , where political campaigns are viewed as a holy war , but many non evangelical or social conservatives voters find these kinds of remarks radical and frightening .
McCain started out this campaign by moving away from his maverick image and more to the right .
I think that the Arab / terrorist slurs play into the views of the radical element of the GOP , but McCain has come to the conclusion that they are too far out there for him .
The dilemma for McCain is that the evangelicals and social conservatives are the grass roots operation of the party .
McCain and the evangelical right were always an incompatible fit , and what were are seeing now is a candidate who is on the verge of open war with part of his own party .
What we are watching is the implosion of the Republican Party .
Darrel J. Vandeveld was in despair .
The hard - nosed lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve , a self - described conformist praised by his superiors for his bravery in Iraq , had lost faith in the Guantanamo Bay war crimes tribunals in which he was a prosecutor .
His work was top secret , making it impossible to talk to family or friends .
So the devout Catholic -- working away from home -- contacted a priest online .
Even if he had no doubt about the guilt of the accused , he wrote in an August e-mail , “ I am beginning to have grave misgivings about what I am doing , and what we are doing as a country .
. . .
“ I no longer want to participate in the system , but I lack the courage to quit .
I am married , with children , and not only will they suffer , I ’ll lose a lot of friends . ”

Two days later , he took the unusual step of reaching out for advice from his opposing counsel , a military defense lawyer .
“ How do I get myself out of this office ? ” Vandeveld asked Major David J.R. Frakt of the Air Force Reserve , who represented the young Afghan Vandeveld was prosecuting for an attack on U.S. soldiers -- despite Vandeveld ’s doubts about whether Mohammed Jawad would get a fair trial .
Vandeveld said he was seeking a “ practical way of extricating myself from this mess . ”
Last month , Vandeveld did just that , resigning from the Jawad case , the military commissions overall and , ultimately , active military duty .
In doing so , he has become even more of a central figure in the “ mess ” he considers Guantanamo to be .
Vandeveld is at least the fourth prosecutor to resign under protest .
Questions about the fairness of the tribunals have been raised by the very people charged with conducting them , according to legal experts , human rights observers and current and former military officials .
Advertisement
Vandeveld ’s claims are particularly explosive .
In a declaration and subsequent testimony , he said the U.S. government was not providing defense lawyers with the evidence it had against their clients , including exculpatory information -- material considered helpful to the defense .
Saying that the accused enemy combatants were more likely to be wrongly convicted without that evidence , Vandeveld testified that he went from being a “ true believer to someone who felt truly deceived ” by the tribunals .
The system in place at the U.S. military facility in Cuba , he wrote in his declaration , was so dysfunctional that it deprived “ the accused of basic due process and subject[ed ] the well - intentioned prosecutor to claims of ethical misconduct . ”
Army Col. Lawrence J. Morris , the chief prosecutor and Vandeveld ’s boss , said the Office of Military Commissions provides “ every scrap of paper and information ” to the defense .
Morris said that Vandeveld was disgruntled because his commanding officers disagreed with some of his legal tactics and that he “ never once ” raised substantive concerns .
Advertisement
Morris said last week that he had no idea why Vandeveld had become so antagonistic toward the tribunal process , adding that the lieutenant colonel ’s outspokenness angered him because it was unfair and was a “ broad blast at some very ethical and hardworking people whose performances are being smudged groundlessly . ”
Vandeveld , who was prosecuting seven tribunal cases -- nearly a third of pending cases -- has declined to be interviewed about the particulars of the Jawad case .
But he did engage in a series of e-mails with The Times about his general concerns , before being “ reminded ” last week that he could not talk to the press until his release from active duty was final .
In the future , he said , he plans to speak out .
“ I do n’t know how else the creeping rot of the commissions and the politics that fostered and continued to surround them could be exposed to the curative powers of the sunlight , ” he said .
“ I care not for myself ; our enemies deserve nothing less than what we would expect from them were the situations reversed .
More than anything , I hope we can rediscover some of our American values . ”
Some tribunal defense lawyers are preparing to call Vandeveld as a witness , saying that his claims of systemic problems at Guantanamo , if true , could alter the outcome of every pending case there -- and force the turnover of long - sought information on coercive interrogation tactics and other controversial measures used against their clients in the war on terrorism .

For years , defense lawyers and human rights organizations have raised similar concerns in individual cases .
“ But we never had anyone on the inside who could validate those claims , ” said Michael J. Berrigan , the deputy chief defense counsel for the commissions .
--
Before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , Vandeveld led a relatively placid life outside Erie , Pa. , with his wife and four children .
He worked as a senior deputy state attorney general in charge of consumer protection in the region , and he served on his local school board in Millcreek Township .
Anyone who knows him , Vandeveld , 48 , told The Times , “ will probably tell you that I ’ve been a conformist my entire life , and [ that ] to speak out against the injustice wrought upon our worst enemies entailed a weather shift in my worldview . ”

Mark Tanenbaum , an English teacher whose children are friends with Vandeveld ’s , remembers talking to him while sitting around campfires at high school gatherings .
“ We talked a lot about religion .
I ’m Jewish .
We ’d talk about faith , value - based philosophy .
We were kindred spirits in this .
“ With him , it is all about doing the right thing . ”
Vandeveld , called to active duty after 9/11 , received glowing evaluations as a Pentagon legal advisor and judge advocate in Bosnia , the Horn of Africa and Iraq .
“ An absolutely outstanding , first - class performance by an extraordinarily gifted , intelligent , knowledgeable and experienced judge advocate , whose potential is utterly unlimited , ” his commanding officer , Gen. Charles J. Barr , wrote in his June 2006 evaluation .
“ One of the corps ’ best and brightest .
Save the very toughest jobs in the corps for him . ”
From his Iraq assignment , Vandeveld went to Guantanamo , where he began locking horns over the Jawad case with Frakt -- a law professor at Western State University in Fullerton and a former active - duty Air Force lawyer who volunteered for the tribunals .

Frakt believed that his Afghan client was , at worst , a confused teen who had been brainwashed and drugged by militant extremists who coerced him into participating in a grenade - throwing incident with other older -- and more guilty -- men .
He insisted that the prosecution was withholding key information or not obtaining it from those at the Pentagon , CIA and other U.S. agencies that had investigated and interrogated Jawad .
Vandeveld believed that Jawad was a war criminal who had been taught by an Al Qaeda - linked group to kill American troops and , if caught , to make up claims he had been tortured and was underage .
Vandeveld insisted that he had been providing all evidence to the defense .
But by July , Vandeveld told The Times , he had grown increasingly troubled .
He kept finding sources of information and documents that appeared to bolster Frakt ’s claims that evidence was being withheld -- including some favorable to the defense , such as information suggesting that Jawad was underage , that he had been drugged before the incident and that he had been abused by U.S. forces afterward .
Vandeveld also was having difficulty obtaining authorization to release documents in his possession to the defense .

On Aug. 5 , he e-mailed Father John Dear , a well - known Jesuit peace activist .
Dear , who boasts of being arrested 75 times in protests , encouraged him to act , saying he might “ save lives and change the direction of the entire policy . ”
With Frakt pressing for the charges against Jawad to be dismissed due to “ outrageous government misconduct , ” Vandeveld proposed a plea agreement under which Jawad , now thought to be 22 , could return to Afghanistan for rehabilitation .
But his superiors rejected it , Vandeveld said .
By late August , he had told Frakt that there were other “ disquieting ” things about Guantanamo and that his superiors were refusing to address them or to let him quietly transfer out , Frakt said in an interview .
“ Now might be a good time to take a courageous stand and expose some of the ‘ disquieting ’ things that you have alluded to , whatever they may be , ” Frakt replied in a Sept. 2 e-mail , noting that there would soon be a change of administrations in Washington .
Advertisement
“ It would n’t be a bad idea to distance yourself from a process that has become largely discredited , or at least distinguish yourself as one of the good guys , an ethical prosecutor trying to do the right thing , ” Frakt wrote .
On Sept. 9 , Vandeveld e-mailed Dear to say he had resigned from the Guantanamo military tribunals : “ The reaction was the expected outrage and condemnation .
I have and will maintain my equanimity and , while scared for me and for my family , know that Christ will watch over me . ”
That , however , was only the beginning .
In late September -- after the military , according to Frakt , initially tried to block it -- Vandeveld testified by video link for the defense , saying he believed that insurmountable problems with the tribunals might make them incapable of meting out justice fairly .
Morris said that Vandeveld is not qualified to speak about systemwide problems at Guantanamo .
But Frakt said that he is and that Vandeveld ’s testimony and declaration only scratched the surface of his concerns , judging by their extensive conversations and hundreds of e-mail exchanges .

“ There is a lot more that he knows , ” Frakt said .

Freddie tackles Stephen Fry for advocating the misuse of words :
Words have value in their ability to distinguish and to discriminate .
And they are only ever damaged in one direction : they become more abstracted , more broad , less specific , less forceful , less memorable , less powerful , more middling , less individual .
When people misuse " anticipate " to the point where it is identical to " expect , " there 's nothing to cheer for anyone .
Why ?
Because where we once had two words for two concepts , we now have two words for the same concept -- and no word that means " anticipate " .
You and I are rapidly losing that wonderful word .
In it 's place is a vague shell .
Irony is a fantastic concept , wonderfully precise .
The word " ironic , " at this point , is close to having no individual meaning whatsoever .
When " ironic " can mean any kind of sort of strange , sort of funny happenstance , we no longer use that word to access a specific and incisive idea .
Orwell was right .
There are some core underpinnings for Anglo - American democracy .
One of them is the constant struggle to use plain English directly .
As a language , its breadth and concreteness are its strengths .
And yet we speak increasingly like Germans .
' Enhanced interrogation techniques " my ass .
It really did sound better in the original German .
In English , we say torture .
Like Englishmen .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

According to the international space agencies , " space weather " is the single greatest obstacle to deep space travel .
Radiation from the sun and cosmic rays pose a deadly threat to astronauts in space .
New research shows how knowledge gained from the pursuit of nuclear fusion research may reduce the threat to acceptable levels , making humanity 's first mission to Mars a much greater possibility .
The solar energetic particles , although just part of the ' cosmic rays ' spectrum , are of greatest concern because they are the most likely to cause deadly radiation damage to the astronauts .
Large numbers of these energetic particles occur intermittently as " storms " with little warning and are already known to pose the greatest threat to man .
Nature helps protect the Earth by having a giant " magnetic bubble " around the planet called the magnetosphere .
The Apollo astronauts of the 1960's and 70's who walked upon the Moon are the only humans to have travelled beyond the Earth 's natural " force field " – the Earth 's magnetosphere .
With typical journeys on the Apollo missions lasting only about 8 days , it was possible to miss an encounter with such a storm ; a journey to Mars , however , would take about eighteen months , during which time it is almost certain that astronauts would be enveloped by such a " solar storm " .
Space craft visiting the Moon or Mars could maintain some of this protection by taking along their very own portable " mini " - magnetosphere .
The idea has been around since the 1960's but it was thought impractical because it was believed that only a very large ( more than 100 km wide ) magnetic bubble could possibly work .
Researchers at the Science and Technology Facilities Council 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory , the Universities of York , Strathclyde and IST Lisbon , have undertaken experiments , using know - how from 50 years of research into nuclear fusion , to show that it is possible for astronauts to shield their spacecrafts with a portable magnetosphere - scattering the highly charged , ionised particles of the solar wind and flares away from their space craft .
Computer simulations done by a team in Lisbon with scientists at Rutherford Appleton last year showed that theoretically a very much smaller " magnetic bubble " of only several hundred meters across would be enough to protect a spacecraft .
Now this has been confirmed in the laboratory in the UK using apparatus originally built to work on fusion .
By recreating in miniature a tiny piece of the Solar Wind , scientists working in the laboratory were able to confirm that a small " hole " in the Solar Wind is all that would be needed to keep the astronauts safe on their journey to our nearest neighbours .
Dr. Ruth Bamford , one of the lead researchers at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory , said , " These initial experiments have shown promise and that it may be possible to shield astronauts from deadly space weather . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Parts of the United States , struggling with high jobless rates , seem to be in recession , but the government ’s plan to support credit markets will help , President George W. Bush ’s top economic adviser said on Sunday .
Edward Lazear , Chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , speaks to the press at the White House in Washington February 11 , 2008 , after President George W. Bush signed the 2008 Economic Report .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
“ We are seeing what anyone would characterize as a recession in some parts of the country , ” Edward Lazear , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors , told CNN .
Unemployment in some areas is running “ much higher ” than the 6.1 percent national level , he said .
Lazear said the administration “ has taken the right steps ” to thaw out credit markets and get loans flowing to businesses and consumers .
Although it will take a few months for a significant impact from the Treasury ’s $ 700 billion credit market rescue plan , the first signs of response are already apparent , Lazear said .
“ Banks are now willing to lend to one another .
That ’s a huge plus for the economy because the big problem has been that banks have been unwilling to trust one another , ” he said .
As lending picks up , the flow of money through the economy will be “ amplified immediately . ”
Certain benchmark credit spreads have shrunk over the past week as new liquidity measures by global central banks and governments have started to kick in .
Those spreads have been at unusually high levels , a reflection of risk aversion among banks .
“ If you look at the numbers that we ’ve seen this week ... it looks it is working .
All the numbers have been going in the right direction . ”
Lazear said the U.S. budget deficit would grow because of the cost of the bailout plan , but declined to say how high .
“ The deficit is important ( but ) the main focus is turning the economy around , ” he said .
Banks failed , stock prices collapsed , and panic descended on Wall Street .
Americans were holding their collective breath as a rescue plan was hastily drafted .
The 2008 financial crisis ?
Nope - it was the Panic of 1907 , and again in 1929 , 1987 , and so on .
Since its independence more than 230 years ago , the United States has grown to have the largest economy in the world ( GDP of $ 13.8 trillion as of 2007 , by the way .
That 's $ 13,800,000,000,000 ) .
But we did n't get there without quite a few bumps on the road .
To put today 's economic trouble into perspective , let 's take a look at the 10 financial disasters in the United States in the past century :
1. The Panic of 1907

Background :
At the time , the young US stock market was in a decline - it was off 25 % since the beginning of the year and Wall Street was jittery over the tight money supply .
Trigger :
Then along came Otto Heinze with his get - ( even ) - rich ( er ) - quick scheme .
In October of 1907 , Otto , along with his brother , a copper magnate named Augustus Heinze , and the ice king ( yup , he sold ice - remember , this was before the age of household refrigerators ) Charles W. Morse , aggressively bought shares of United Copper , thinking that they could corner the market on the stock .
Their plan failed spectacularly , and immediately bankrupted the trust companies and banks that provided the financing .
Runs on banks immediately ensued as depositors pulled their money from banks that had dealings ( or rumored to have dealings ) with the trio .
In a little less than two weeks in the Panic of 1907 , a chain reaction had left 9 trust companies and banks bankrupt .
The Solution :
At the time , the United States had no central bank ( President Andrew Jackson had abolished the Second Bank of the United States some 6 decades earlier ) , but we had J.P. Morgan .
The 70 - year - old financier stepped in to bail out , er ... save trust companies worth saving and let those who were too far gone to fail .
The infusion of cash helped stop the domino effect of failing trust companies , but more money was needed .
So here 's what he did :
Morgan gathered 50 trust company presidents at his library , told them to come up with $ 25 million on their own and left them in a large room .
He withdrew to his librarian 's office .
At 3 a.m. , he called in one of his sleep - deprived lieutenants , Ben Strong , for a review of a trust company 's books .
Strong gave his report , then headed to the library 's front doors and found them locked .
Morgan had the key in his pocket .
No one would leave until the trusts ponied up .
The presidents continued to talk .
At 4:15 , Morgan walked in with a statement requiring each trust company to share in a new $ 25 million loan .
One of his lawyers read it aloud , then set it on a table .
" There you are , gentlemen , " said Morgan .
No one moved .
Morgan drew Edward King , head of the Union Trust , to the table .
" There 's the place , King , " he said , " and here 's the pen . "
King signed .
The other presidents signed .
They set up a committee to handle the loan and supervise the final - stage bailouts of endangered trusts .
At 4:45 , the library 's heavy brass doors swung open and let the bankers out .

Aftermath :
The government realized that only having people like J.P. Morgan in charge of saving the entire country 's economy was kind of a bad idea , so it created the Federal Reserve System .
2. Wall Street Crash of 1929
The trading floor of the NYSE right after the crash .
Background :
In the Roaring Twenties , optimism was everywhere : the Great War , as World War I was called back then , was over and advances in technology seemed limitless .
Along with that optimism was an incredibly speculative bull market : stocks went up four fold in value in that decade .
Hundreds of thousands of Americans borrowed money to play the stock market .
They bought stocks with just a fraction of the value in cash and financed the rest by borrowing from the broker ( " buying on margin , " if you 've never heard it before ) .
Needless to say , stocks became overvalued fast .
The Crash :
What goes up , must come down - but it does n't have to come down all in one day .
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 came in forms of three " black " days .
In the morning of October 24 , 1929 - later nicknamed " Black Thursday " - a massive sell - off happened .
More than 3 times the normal amount of shares were traded and stock prices tumbled .
Richard Whitney of J.P. Morgan and Company came to the trading floor ... and instead of halting trading like everyone expected , he started buying confidently and the market recovered .
The market actually went up the subsequent Friday and a little down on Saturday ( back then , they traded on Saturdays ) .
And then ... the bottom fell off .
On Monday , October 28 , 1929 , nicknamed Black Monday , the market fell 13 % and the next day , nicknamed Black Tuesday , the market fell another 12 % .
Financiers like General Motor 's William C. Durant and the Rockefeller family stepped in and bought stocks to show confidence , but their efforts failed to stop the slide .

That week ( with heaviest losses over the first two days ) the market lost $ 30 billion , ten times more than the annual budget of the government and more than what the US had spent in all of World War I .
Over the next few weeks , the stock market suffered sharp declines though the true bottom was n't reached until July 1932 .
Over three years , the stock market dropped a staggering 89 % .
It would take about 25 years for the stock market to recover and re-attain the 1929 level .

Aftermath : The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led directly to ...
3. The Great Depression

( Source )
Background : Stung by heavy losses on Wall Street , consumers began cutting expenditures .
With lowered demand , businesses started laying off people ( US unemployment rate rose to 25 % by 1933 ) - which fed an ever - worsening cycle and plunged the US economy into a depression .
As debtors defaulted on their loans , banks began to fail , which led to bank runs as depositors attempted to withdraw their money en masse , triggering even more bank failures .
Today , your deposit is insured in the event of a bank failure , but in 1930s , there was no such thing : when a bank failed , its depositors lost all of their money .
In the first 10 months of 1930 , 744 US banks failed and their depositors lost more than $ 140 billion .
Before the decade was over , about 9,000 banks failed .

Hooverville : Many people thought that President Herbert Hoover did nothing to save them from the Great Depression .
That 's just not true : Hoover did a few things , including deporting about 500,000 Mexicans to Mexico ( half of which were actually born in the US and thus were legal citizens ) and increasing tariffs on imports - which caused other countries to retaliate and US exports to plunge by more than half , but nothing worked .
Hard Times Are Still " Hoover " ing Over Us , photo of two children in a Hooverville ( Source )
Many of the people made homeless by the Great Depression lived in makeshift shantytowns called Hoovervilles .
They used " Hoover blanket " ( old newspaper ) to keep warm , wave " Hoover flag " ( an empty pocket turned inside out ) and drink " Hoover soup " at restaurants ( poor people would pour ketchup , salt and pepper into their drinking water at restaurants , then tell the waitress that they did n't see anything they wanted on the menu ) .
Those who were relatively better off drove " Hoover wagon " ( a car pulled by a horse because the owner could n't afford gas ) .
( Source )
Solution :
In 1933 , the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the New Deal , which included work relief program for the jobless , financial aid to farmers and business reform , including setting minimum wages and maximum weekly hours .
Roosevelt encouraged trade unions and forced businesses to work with the government to set prices ( later found to be unconstitutional ) .
In Roosevelt 's first term , unemployment fell by two third and the economy stabilized ; full recovery , however , did n't occur until the start of World War II .
Aftermath : The Great Depression had a far reaching effect , even until today .
Social Security , the Tennessee Valley Authority , the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , and the Federal Housing Authorities are direct products of the New Deal that are still active today .
4. 1973 Oil Crisis

Photo : Warren K. Leffler , Library of Congress
Background : In October 1973 , Syria and Egypt launched a surprise attack on Israel on the Jewish day of atonement or Yom Kippur .
This set off a twenty day war known as the Yom Kippur War ( or Ramadan War ) , in which the Arab forces were defeated .
The embargo : Angry over Western nations ' support of Israel , members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) as well as Egypt and Syria shut off oil export to the United States , Western Europe , and Japan .
The crude oil price immediately quadrupled to $ 12 per barrel ( I know .
Twelve bucks .
How quaint when compared to today 's prices ! ) which led gasoline price at the pump to jump 40 % from 38.5 cent to 55 cent per gallon in 1974 ( again , I know ) .
The oil shock led to a huge drop in the stock market .
The New York Stock Exchange lost $ 97 billion in value in just six weeks .
US Government responded by rationing gasoline .
Long gas lines formed at the pump .
In many places , motorists with even - numbered license plates were allowed to buy gas only on even - numbered dates and those with odd - numbered plates could buy only on odd - numbered dates .

Aftermath :
To help reduce consumption , the federal government imposed a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph and mandated fuel efficiency standards for car manufacturers .
The government also created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Department of Energy .
5. Black Monday ( 1987 )
The Crash : On Monday , October 19 , 1987 , the US stock market crashed .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 508 points or 22.6 % , the largest one - day percentage decline in the stock market history .
At one point during the day , so many shares were being sold that " the New York State Stock Exchange ticker fell behind and TV newscasters could n't tell how much the market had fallen . "
( Source )
The Culprits :
The most popular culprits for the 1987 Black Monday were program trading and a new financial hedging method called portfolio insurance .
These two things caused massive stock sell offs and drove down the stock price ( note that other factors such as the weak dollar , large US trade deficit , and overvaluations of stock values might have played a role as well ) ( Source )
Program trading is easy to explain : in the early 1980s , the use of computers became increasingly popular in Wall Street .
Traders began to use computers to execute rapid trades based on a pre-determined condition ( say , sell when a stock price dropped to a certain point ) .
Dropping stock prices trigger these automated trades , which flood the market with stock shares and caused an even steeper decline in stock prices .
Portfolio insurance is a little bit ( okay , a lot ) more complex .
In 1976 , two young Berkeley finance professors named Hayne Leland Mark Rubinstein thought of a way to " insure " a portfolio investments of stocks similar to the way insurance protects an asset .
For a price ( a kin to an insurance premium ) , their trading system can guarantee that an investment never loses more than a pre-set ( and relatively small ) amount .
To do this , portfolio insurance uses financial instruments called derivatives .
Most people understand buying and selling stocks - if you buy a share of stock for $ 1 and sell it for $ 3 , then you 've made a profit of $ 2 .
Derivatives , on the other hand , let you speculate on the future price of a stock ( or a commodity , or really anything at all ) without ever owning a single share .
For example , you can buy a futures contract , essentially an agreement to purchase a stock say a week from now for $ 1 .
If the price of the stock is greater than $ 1 , then you 've made money .
If the price of the stock is less than $ 1 , then you 've lost money .
At no point in time do you actually buy the stock !
In the case of portfolio insurance , say you have $ 1000 in stocks that you want to safeguard from falling in value by next week .
Then you sell a futures contract for the stocks .
If the value of your stocks dropped , you 've lost value in your stocks but gained money from the the futures contract .
( Yes this is simplistic , but that 's the basic idea ) .
Without getting into mind boggling technical details , suffice it to say that the portfolio insurance method linked stock prices to the futures index .
The whole thing would work but for one teensy flaw : during a panic sell off , there is little market liquidity - you can try to sell stocks , but without any buyer , you effectively can't sell it at any price .
Aftermath :
In response to Black Monday , the New York Stock Exchange instituted trading rules ( the so - called " circuit breakers " ) to pause trading if the market fell precipitously .
The Federal Reserve also get to play a really big role in ensuring liquidity by pumping billions of dollars into the banking system .
Remember the term derivatives .
We 'll see that again , soon enough !
6. Savings & Loan Crisis ( 1989 )
Lincoln Savings and Loan , back in its heyday of 1965 ( Source )
Background : A Savings and Loan institution is kind of like a bank : people deposit their money in it in the forms of savings , and the S&L gives out mortgages ( or loans ) to the local community .
S&Ls have existed since the 1800s and they were tightly regulated until the late 1970s .
In the late ' 70s , the newly available money market funds offered much higher interest rates than the S&L , so people started pulling their money out of S&Ls .
As a response , S&Ls asked for government deregulation ( which they got * ) - effectively , S&Ls could then raise interest rates on deposits and make way more loans than before with little oversight .
There was a regulatory body , the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ( FHLBB ) , but it was understaffed and its officers were accused of being chummy with the industry .
The S&L Crisis :
In the real estate boom of the early ' 80s , many S&L grew extremely large , extremely fast .
Between 1982 and 1985 , S&L assets ( many of which were speculative real estate holdings and commercial loans ) grew 56 % .
In Texas , 40 S&Ls tripled in size , with some doubling each year .
( Source ) Needless to say , many were overextended ( some were technically bankrupt , but according to the new deregulation rules , they could remain open and thus continued to make bad loans ) .
By 1987 , 505 S&L institutions failed .
Some , like those in Texas , failed spectacularly - losses in just that one state comprised more than half of all S&L losses nationwide .
The deposits were guaranteed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ( FSLIC , just like the FDIC guaranteed bank deposits ) - but because of the amount , it turned out that the FSLIC itself was bankrupt !
All in all , by 1995 , 747 S&Ls or half of all the S&L institutions in the United States went bankrupt .
The Keating Five :
You may have heard of the term " Keating Five , " here 's the story in a nutshell .
In 1984 , construction magnate Charles Keating bought Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine , California .
Before then , Lincoln S&L was a profitable yet conservatively run Savings and Loan institution .
Keating fired the existing management and loaded up Lincoln 's investment portfolio from $ 1.1 billion to $ 5.5 billion by buying land and junk bonds .
In 1986 , the FHLBB initiated an investigation on how Lincoln was doing business .
Keating , who was politically connected , asked 5 US senators , for whom he had made large contributions , to intervene ( which they did ) .
In 1989 , Lincoln went bankrupt and more than 21,000 mostly elderly investors lost their life savings ( Lincoln had misled them to switch their FDIC - insured holdings to bonds that were n't guaranteed ) .
The five senators , namely Alan Cranston , Dennis DeConcini , Donald Riegle , John Glenn , and John McCain , were investigated by the the Senate Ethics Committee .
Cranston was reprimanded , Riegle and DeConcini were criticized for acting improperly , whereas Glenn and McCain were cleared of impropriety but criticized for poor judgment .
The Solution : In 1989 , newly elected President George H.W. Bush announced that he would rescue the troubled Savings and Loan industry .
The bailout was priced at a shocking $ 60 billion , which actually turned out to be overly optimistic .
The total cost of the S&L mess was closer to $ 153 billion , of which $ 124 was footed by the taxpayers .
( Source )
Aftermath : A whole bunch of reform , including the dissolution of the FHLBB and the FSLIC , to be replaced by other regulatory bodies .
Freddie Mac , which had been under control of FHLBB , was put under the US Department of Housing and Urban Development , which gave it one additional goal : to buy subprime mortgages to enable low - income families to afford buying houses ( we 'll see this again ) .
* Note : The deregulation of the Savings and Loan industry happened with the Garn - St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 .
The bill was very popular - one of its provisions was allowing adjustable rate mortgages or ARMs .
( Yup , you 've guessed it - we 'll see ARMs again )
7. Long Term Capital Bailout ( 1998 )
Background :
In 1994 , legendary bond trader John Meriwether left Salomon Brothers and founded his own hedge fund .
He attracted the top financial minds at the time , including two Nobel Prize economists , Myron Scholes and Robert Merton .
The hedge fund was named Long Term Capital Management .
Meriwether raised $ 1.25 billion in capital from investors to start .
It was the largest funding raised for a hedge fund in history .
LTCM , as the hedge fund was commonly known , wanted to make money the scientific way : in leveraged arbitrage .
At this point , it 's probably necessary to define the terms for some people .
Hedge fund is a private investment fund that aims to make money using a variety of ( often exotic ) financial instruments .
These funds typically do n't buy stocks or bonds , instead they trade derivatives ( see " Black Monday " above ) .
The " hedge " in hedge fund comes from their habit of " hedging " their portfolio - meaning that if they hold an asset , they will also place a bet that the value of the asset would go down .
If their asset did go down in value , that " hedge " bet would pay off to offset the loss .
In theory , this allows the fund 's investments to be risk - free .
In practice , as we shall see , that 's obviously not the case .
Arbitrage is a fancy name for a simple concept : the way to make money by exploiting price differences in two different markets .
For example , say that you spot a vase selling for $ 10 in one swap - meet and for $ 15 in another .
If you buy that vase for $ 10 , then go to the other swap - meet and sell it for $ 15 , you 've just made a profit of $ 5 ( less cost of gas , of course ) .
Leverage is another fancy name for a simple concept , namely borrowing .
For example , instead of paying $ 100 to buy $ 100 worth of stock or derivatives , you can pay $ 10 ( i.e. 10 % ) and borrow the rest .
So , if you have $ 100 in your pocket , you can " buy " $ 1,000 worth of stock or derivatives .
Say that a week after you bought that stock , it rose to $ 130 .
If you bought 1 share at $ 100 , then you 've made $ 30 .
But if you leveraged your purchase , you would 've " bought " $ 1,000 worth of stock and you would 've made $ 200 ( that 's $ 300 - $ 100 capital , and of course less borrowing cost ) .
So leveraging lets you amplify your profits but if you lost , it also amplifies your losses .
The arbitrage that LTCM dealt with was in government bonds .
Their strategy was complex , but suffice it to say that Myron Scholes famously summarized that LTCM would make money by being " a giant vacuum cleaner sucking up nickels that everyone else had overlooked . "
( Source )
From 1994 to 1997 , LTCM could do no wrong : it returned 40 % in profit per year .
In early 1998 , LTCM 's managed portfolio grew to well over $ 100 billion , with net asset of $ 4 billion , and it was hard - pressed to find enough profitable deals in bond arbitrage .
So , with over $ 1 trillion - worth of arbitrage , LTCM started to look at emerging markets , specifically in Russian bonds .
The Collapse of LTCM : In August of 1998 , faced with their own financial crisis , the Russian government did something that no one thought they would : they defaulted on 281 billion rubles ( US $ 13.5 billion ) of its Treasury bonds .
This resulted in a fiscal panic and a massive loss for LTCM .
In two weeks , it lost $ 1.9 billion in equity .
( Source )
That 's a rate of about $ 95,000 a minute !
Then things started to go really bad for LTCM .
It had thousands of derivative positions that it could n't sell without incurring massive losses .
But LTCM was n't alone in this : for every deal it made , there was a counterparty that held the opposite position ( for every buyer , there is a seller , and vice versa ) .
If LTCM failed , then it would drag down everybody .
In September 1998 , just weeks after the whole thing started to unravel , a consortium of banks and investment firms bailed out LTCM .
Under guidance from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , J.P. Morgan , Morgan Stanley , Salomon Smith Barney , UBS , Deutsche Bank , Lehman Brothers ... virtually all who's who in banking contributed to the $ 3.6 billion bailout ( no government money was used ) .
Aftermath : LTCM was n't supposed to fail .
It was managed by the rocket scientists of the financial world , and theoretically , in a rational market , it would always turn a profit .
Indeed , after the bailout , the market calmed down and the positions formerly held by LTCM were eventually liquidated at a small profit .
But , as economist John Maynard Keynes famously said , " the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent . "
8. Dot-com Bubble ( 2000 )
Background :
In 1995 , the Internet burst into the public 's consciousness .
The Internet brought with it a new frontier to do business and everyone and their uncle wanted in on the new gold rush .
Venture capitalists poured money into start up firms with poorly thought out business plan ( other than " get big fast " ) , then took them public in an Initial Public Offering .
For a while , it worked : stocks in dot - coms went only one way from 1995 to 2000 and that is up .
NASDAQ , the trading market that lists a lot of technology companies , went from 750 in January , 1995 to a peak of 5132 on March 10 , 2000 .
Despite the warning by the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996 about the market 's " irrational exuberance " and the then - dowdy - but - now - prophetic refusal of legendary investor Warren Buffet to invest in dot - com stocks , companies with no profit and even those without any viable plan to profitability were valued in the millions .
The Bubble Popped : Then , the party was over .
Fueled with easy money from venture capitalists and IPOs , dot - com companies spent their way to bankruptcy : Boo.com spent $ 188 million in just 6 months in attempt to create a global fashion store .
Pets.com raised $ 82.5 million in an IPO only to go bankrupt nine months later .
Computer.com spent $ 3.5 million , or more than half of its budget , in 90 seconds ads during the Super Bowl .
That 's a staggering $ 38,889 a second !
The biggest dot - com company that crashed and burned was , hands down , WebVan .
The company aimed to deliver groceries to homes and businesses .
It raised $ 375 million in an IPO , expanded to 8 cities ( with plan to expand to 26 cities ) , built $ 1 billion - worth of infrastructure in forms of high - tech warehouses , and spent lavishly on pretty much everything ( they bought 115 Herman Miller Aeron chairs at over $ 800 a piece ! ) , all before turning a dime in profit .
( Source )
WebVan forgot that it was actually in the grocery business , which has razor thin margins to begin with .
In a mere 18 months the company had spent itself to bankruptcy .
From March 2000 to October 2002 , the dot - com bubble crash wiped out $ 5 trillion in market value of tech companies and more than half of all dot - com companies went out of business .
9. California Electricity Crisis ( 2001 )
Background :
In 1996 , state lawmakers decided to deregulate California 's energy market .
In the old system , prices were set so consumers faced stable prices but because of the price cap , energy companies did n't find it profitable to invest in new power plants .
The deregulation was supposed to lower electricity price in the long term by attracting new competitions .
Indeed , companies proposed new power plants that would 've increased California 's capacity by almost 50 % .
But because of the cumbersome approval process , no new plants were actually built .
The deregulation plan , however , was flawed from the beginning : utilities were forced to sell power plants to the private sector ( to companies like Enron and Reliant Energy ) and then buy back electricity from them to distribute to homes and businesses .
Worse , the utilities were n't allowed to negotiate long - term contracts - rather , they had to buy on the " spot market " where the prices were very high .
Furthermore , the utilities could n't pass on the cost to the consumers as retail prices of electricity were still regulated .
The Manufacturing of the Crisis : In June 2000 , the market condition was ripe for manipulations .
A drought reduced the amount of electricity supplied to California by dams in the Pacific Northwest .
At the same time , the demand for electricity rose during the hot summer months .
Enter Enron .
Traders at the Texas - based energy company manipulated the electricity market by persuading power plants to shut down for unnecessary " maintenance , " laundering electricity ( basically , shipping electricity out of California and then charging a higher price by selling it back from out of state ) , and creating artificial congestions over power transmission lines .
The traders called their manipulation strategies by colorful names like " Fat Boy , " " Richocet , " " Get Shorty , " and even " Death Star . " ( Source )
By these means , traders increased the wholesale price of electricity from $ 45 per megawatt to over $ 1,400 !
The Crisis : Utilities like Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison were hit hard .
On one hand , they had to pay Enron upwards of 50 cents per kilowatt hours wholesale but could only charge 6.7 cent to their retail customers ( Source ) .
PG&E and SoCal Edison racked up $ 20 billion in debt ( PG&E later filed Chapter 11 protection under bankruptcy laws ) .
As a result , rolling blackouts affected millions of households .
Political Fallout : The California Electricity Crisis ended Governor Gray Davis ' political career .
Though he inherited the deregulation mess , people blamed him for being too slow to act during the energy crisis .
In 2003 , he was recalled and Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected Governor to replace him .
The Bankruptcy of Enron : In late 2001 , a scandal involving Enron was brewing .
Investigations into the company on its role in the crisis revealed that the company had created offshore entities to hide its debt and made it look much more profitable than it actually was .
( Again , like the trading manipulations , Enron gave its offshore entities really colorful names like " Jedi " and " Chewco . " ) ( Source )
Enron 's stock imploded and the company brought down the accounting firm Arthur Andersen , who was found guilty for its role in auditing the company .
10 . Subprime Mortgage and Credit Crisis ( 2007 - )
Photo : respres [ Flickr ]
Background :
To understand the ongoing subprime mortgage and credit crisis , let 's go back a few years .
The end of the Dot -Com Bubble was the start of another , even larger bubble : the housing bubble .
From 2000 to 2005 , the median sales price of existing homes increased year over year and speculative investment in properties skyrocketed .
" Flipping " or buying a house , doing some quick renovation or repair , then selling it for a handsome profit , became sort of a national pastime , with cable TV shows dedicated to it .
In 2005 we saw the launch of not one but two shows , one called Flip This House and another - completely unrelated - called Flip That House .
When property values kept on increasing , home loans became very easy to get ( after all , if the borrower defaulted on the mortgage , then the bank got the house - which value kept on increasing anyway ! ) .
New mortgage products became popular : subprime loans for borrowers who otherwise would n't qualify for loans because of their lack of creditworthiness ( hence the term " subprime " ) and adjustable - rate mortgage , which , as its name implies , have a variable interest rate .
In addition to ARMs , there were also interest only loan - which let the borrower pay only the interest and not the principal on the loan for a period of time , and negative amortization loan ( or NegAm ) which let the borrower pay a portion of the monthly payment ( the rest got added to the total amount borrowed - in this type of mortgage , the amount you owe gets larger year after year ! ) .
How easy was it to get a mortgage ?
One mortgage provider , HCL Finance ( motto : " Home of the ' no doc ' loan " - no doc refers to no documentation of income required ) had a product called the NINJA loan .
It stood for No Income , No Job ( and ) no Assets ! ( Source )
In 2006 , home prices started to go down and a year or so later , borrowers of subprime mortgages started to default on their loans .
In 2007 , almost 1.3 million properties were being foreclosed - a jump of 75 % over the year before .
( Source )
As late as March 2008 , it was estimated that 8.8 million homeowners ( about 10.8 % of total homeowners ) have zero or negative equity in their homes , meaning they owe more than their houses are worth .
( Source )
Had that been it , the crisis probably would 've been isolated .
Sure some banks would undoubtedly fail because they made bad loans , but the subprime crisis had since spread to the credit markets and created a massive credit crunch that is larger and far more dangerous than the subprime crisis .
Securitization :
To understand the current credit crisis , it 's important to understand something called " securitization . "
Securitization is an old process by which an asset that generates a cash flow can be converted into a security ( like a bond ) , that can then be bought and sold in the market just like any other security .
A great example is the Bowie Bond .
In 1997 , musician David Bowie issued a bond ( basically a loan note ) secured by the current and future royalty revenues of his first 25 albums ( a total of 287 songs ... here it was the " asset " ) .
The 10 - year Bowie Bonds were bought for $ 55 million by Prudential Insurance Company , who then would collect on the royalties for ten years .
So David Bowie got $ 55 million up front , and Prudential could either keep the bond ( and get the song royalties ) or sell the bond for profit .
( Source )
Back to the topic at hand .
Traditionally , banks hold mortgages until maturity , with profits being interest of the loan .
But Wall Street had an idea : why not do to mortgages what David Bowie did to songs ?
So they ( and by they , I mean Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae , and 12 Federal Home Loan Banks ) pooled together mortgages and bundled them up into asset - backed securities ( ABSs ) and sold the package to get up front money ( the investor would get the monthly mortgage payments from all of the homeowners whose mortgages got bundled ) .
But wait - these mortgages all had different risks .
Some were safe , stodgy 30 - year mortgages whereas others were subprime loans that though were more risky , also had higher interest rates and thus were more profitable .
Not to worry : Wall Street split the ABSs into " tranches " ( just a fancy word meaning sections or classes ) : the safest were rated AAA ( by rating agencies whose sole job was to gauge how risky something was ... and got paid by those whom it rated - talk about a conflict of interest ! ) , the rest were medium and low - rated tranches .
The logic was this : one borrower might default on his loan , but if you bundled them together , there 's safety in number : it 's unlikely that ALL borrowers would default all at once .
But wait - there 's more .
The medium and low - rated tranches were riskier investments , but it 's unlikely that all of them would default at the same time .
So let 's take all those medium - to - low rated ABSs and pool them together to create something called collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) .
And through the magic of rating , we once again could turn some of these risky securities into - tada ! - A-rated securities fit for pension funds .
Repackage these CDOs a few more times and pretty soon you would n't know how much subprime loans were actually in them .
( Source )
The Credit Crisis :
So how did the housing downturn infect the credit markets ?
Well , when the housing price dropped , a large number of borrowers began to default on their mortgages .
Suddenly , ABSs and CDOs looked very suspicious as no one knew how much exposure to the subprime mortgage mess these securities actually had .
The market for ABSs and CDOs dried up and holders of these securities could n't sell them .
In many cases , these companies leveraged their purchase of these securities , which really amplified their losses .
Just as the market worsened and investment firms and companies found that their holdings of ABSs and CDOs were worth far less than they had paid for them ( and thus had to write off that loss in their books - causing a number of hedge funds to collapse ) , another domino fell : Credit - default Swaps ( which took down AIG ) .
Credit - default Swap : Credit - default Swap ( or CDS ) is basically insurance on debt .
Say that a bank buys a large amount of bonds from a company .
As with any debt , there is a risk of the debtor fail to pay the money back .
To protect against the company defaulting on its bond payments , the bank would buy CDS .
In case of a default , the bank go to the insurer and cash in its CDS .
American International Group or AIG was the creator and the largest seller of CDS .
It thought that CDS was an insurance product just like a homeowner 's policy , but obviously it was wrong .
" Any one house burning down does n't increase the likelihood that lots of other houses will burn down , " explained Adam Davidson of NPR , " That does n't apply to bond insurance . "
( Source )
In case of bonds , a default can create a domino effect : as investors lose confidence and sell , the price of bonds go down and the interest rates go up .
Borrowers who can't find capital to meet their obligations would start to default on their bonds and the cycle deepens .
( Photo : Gone - Walkabout [ Flickr ] )
To make sure that AIG would actually pony up and pay the CDS in case of a bond default , it had to post a collateral .
This collateral depended on their credit ranking - as their credit was downgraded , it had to post more collateral .
Because of its worthless mortgage - backed securities assets , AIG 's creditworthiness would be downgraded - which meant that it would need to post as much as $ 250 billion , which of course it did n't have laying around , in collateral in a matter of weeks !
Why Bail Out AIG ?
Over the years , the CDS market has grown into a $ 70 trillion a year business .
And since no one knew who has CDS from AIG , the failure of AIG would mean that a lot of companies are holding bonds that are significantly riskier than they first thought .
Companies that had " hedged " their bets by buying CDS would find their books suddenly unbalanced , which means they have to sell off assets to cover their risks or they would become insolvent .
This failure would propagate throughout the entire economy and create a " systemic failure . "
That , by the way , was what the government was trying to avoid by bailing out AIG .
( Source )
The Credit Crunch :
The basic essence of the credit crunch is this : banks wo n't lend because they can't be sure that they 'll be paid back .
Companies with excellent credit ratings found themselves unable to get a loan ( after all , all those ABSs and CDOs had excellent ratings , so who 's to say that the ratings are worth anything ? ) .
Even some banks find themselves unable to borrow money from other banks !
The Solution ?
As you well know by now , the White House requested , and the Congress passed a $ 700 billion bailout program .
The idea is to for the government to buy distressed asset , especially mortgage - backed securities , from the nation 's banks , which would inspire banks to lend again .
The bailout remains unpopular with the general public , who perceive it as bailing out Wall Street , who caused this mess in the first place .
Whether the bailout will work or not remains to be seen .
________________
I 'll be the first to acknowledge that this article greatly oversimplifies many things that are very , very complex ( like derivatives ) .
We 've also skipped many subjects ( like the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers , the bailout of Freddie Mac , and so on ) .
We did n't talk at all about the international aspects of some of these crises .
In all fairness , it is not meant to be a treatise on these economic failures .
Even the experts can't come to an agreement on some of these stuff .
Despite having over 50 years to analyze the Great Depression , economists still can't agree on what caused it !
This evening 's statistics on U.S. monetary statistics show that MZM fell sharply in the week to October 6 , from $ 8693.3 billion to $ 8638.6 billion ( My own calculations based on numbers available here .
To calculate MZM , you subtract small time deposits from M2 and then add Institutional Money Funds ) .
That 's a decline of more than 0.6 % in a week .
It is now down 1.2 % from its peak in July .
Even M1 and M2 fell back last week , though they ( particularly M1 ) are unlike MZM still up significantly compared to late July .
This provides an explanation of the massive combined stock - and commodity price sell - off in recent weeks .
As long as this monetary contraction continues , we will likely see a continued bear market in stocks and commodities .
This decline has happened despite the record fast expansion of the monetary base created by the Fed 's various schemes to prop up the banking system .
It thus seems that at least for now , the inflationary effects of the Fed 's various schemes have been overwhelmed by the deflationary effects of the increased risk premiums created by the recent financial distress .
One thing interesting to note is that even as the quantity of deposit money is declining , traditional paper and metal money ( aka cash aka currency in circulation ) is increasing at a record fast pace , being up nearly $ 10 billion or 1.25 % in 3 weeks .
This mirrors the development during the Great Depression when currency in circulation increased rapidly even as overall money supply fell fast , as popular mistrust in banks caused people to withdraw their deposit money and hold them as notes and coins .
These numbers indicate a similar development ( although so far much less dramatic , but that might change ) .
Political Fallout of Financial Crisis Helps Democrats
A new CNN poll shows that voters blame the Republicans rather than the Democrats for the financial crisis by 2 to 1 .
Forty - seven percent blame the Republicans , 24 % blame the Democrats , 20 % blame both equally and 8 % say neither party is to blame .
With the economy front and center now , this is an ominous development for John McCain and also downticket Republicans .
The poll also shows Obama with a 10 - point lead on the question of who would handle the economy better .
Also problematic for McCain is that 53 % said he will carry out George Bush 's policies , which are toxic ( Bush 's approval is now at 19 % ) .
Bailout Is Running into Headwind
Not everyone is enthusiastic about giving the treasury secretary Henry Paulson $ 700 billion to spend as he sees fit with no oversight from Congress and no judicial review .
Politico asked a number of influential people what they thought of the deal and collected their opinions here .
It is already clear that the Paulson bill is going to have competition from a bill being drafted by Sen.
Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , which does more for Main St. and provides oversight .
President Bush has said that there will be dire consequences if the Paulson plan is not adopted immediately .
However , even legislators who were easily cowed during the run-up to the Iraq war are beginning to show something that might , given enough time , possibly , eventually develop into something resembling a proto - spine .
And this holds for both parties .
Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - AL ) , ranking member of the Senate banking committee and one of the most loyal Bush allies in the Senate said he was concerned the bailout plan " neither workable nor comprehensive , despite its enormous price tag . "
Some senators are insisting that in return for giving the banks $ 700 billion in taxpayer money , the taxpayers should get something in return , such as stock in the banks or at least warrants to buy stock later , so after the dust has settled the government can sell the stock and recoup some of the money .
It is truly amazing that a body ( Congress ) that holds all the cards is so easily intimidated .
It can pass any law it wants to , tell Bush " take it or leave it , " and then adjourn .
If Bush vetoes the bill , nothing will happen until after the election and probably not until the new Congress convenes .
Older Voters Scared by Market Turmoil
People who are 45 tend to react to the market jitters with a shrug saying " it will come back " and given a few years they are probably right .
But people just about to retire or already retired are very worried according to this story in the NY Times .
What we do n't really know yet is whether older voters , one of the key elements of McCain 's support , will turn against him .
As mentioned above , polls have generally shown that more people have faith in Obama to manage the economy .
If the President is the only one between you and a nice bowl of dog food every day , you may weigh your vote very , very carefully this year .
Intrade Map
The betting site www.intrade.com is now running a map every day showing who the bettors think is going to win every state .
Here is this morning 's map .
In general , the betting sites are lagging indicators with respect to the polls .
When new polls come in , the bettors see that and adjust their bets accordingly .
It does n't work the other way ( people responding to pollsters do n't do so on the basis of what they saw on Intrade ) .
Like the polls , the betting sites have a mixed record .
For example , bettors thought the Republicans would win the Senate in 2006 .
Did n't happen .
Nevertheless , this is a new data point to toss into the hopper .
Today we see the following differences between the polling data ( this site ) and the betting data ( Intrade ) .
Polling puts McCain ahead in Nevada but the bettors are saying Obama will take the Silver State .
In contrast , polling puts Obama ahead in Virginia but the bettors think McCain will win Old Dominion in the end .
Polling is neutral on Ohio but the betters give the Buckeye state to McCain .
Based on the polling data , Obama wins the election 282 to 236 with Ohio too close to call .
Intrade says it will be Obama 278 to 260 .
Congessional Committees Fundraising for August Swing State Project has the reports of the Senate and House fundraising efforts .
Here are the numbers .
Committee August Receipts Disbursements Cash - on - Hand DSCC ( est. ) $ 4.4 million $ 13.7 million $ 33.7 million NRSC ( est. ) $ 5.2 million $ 3.8 million $ 26.8 million DCCC $ 5.1 million $ 7.6 million $ 54.0 million NRCC $ 3.4 million $ 3.3 million $ 14.4 million
While the Democrats are still way ahead , the Republicans have come back from nowhere to at least get closer .
Earlier in the year the Senate Democrats led 2 to 1 and the House Democrats led 8 to 1 .
Nevertheless , it is very unusual for the Democrats to have more money than the Republicans for the congressional races .
Another Look at a 269 - 269
Tie A couple of weeks ago we looked at the consequences of a 269 - 269 tie in the electoral college .
Here is another take on the subject .
While the chances of an exact tie are small , they are definitely not zero .
Today 's Polls
We have 17 presidential polls today including a number of swing states .
In Florida and Ohio , McCain is ahead by 5 points and 4 points respectively .
Nevada and New Hampshire are essentially tied .
Virginia is hard to say , with three polls , but is probably close to a tie .
Surprisingly North Carolina is close , too , with McCain ahead only 50 % to 47 % , well within the margin of error .
Obama has been registering voters like crazy there , which may be part of the reason .

The national polls all have Obama ahead as follows : Gallup ( Obama + 4 ) , Hotline ( Obama +5 ) , Opinion Research ( Obama + 4 ) , Rasmussen ( Obama +1 ) .
We have four Senate polls today .
One is very surprising .
State senator Kay Hagan ( D ) has taken the lead over Sen. Elizabeth Dole ( R - NC ) , 51 % to 45 % .
The DSCC has been running ads all over the state showing that Dole is 93rd in effectivity in the Senate .
The ad is apparently having an effect .
In Minnesota , it is getting very close .
Initially , a lot of people laughed at Al Franken ( a former comedian ) , but he is getting more serious now .
The latest poll puts Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) ahead 48 % to 47 % .
Independent Dean Barkley is at 3 % and does n't appear to be much of a factor .

RSA , the security division of EMC , likes to commission wardrivers to cruise the streets of London , New York City , and Paris each year to see whether folks have gotten clued in when it comes to WiFi security .
This year 's results surprised them :
They found that , of the networks they identified as belonging to businesses , 94 percent in Paris and 97 percent in New York were secured in some fashion ; for unknown reasons , London lagged at 76 percent .
In Paris , most private personal and business
networks were secured .

Sean Kline , an RSA director who deals with identity and access security , said , " It seems to me that there have been many more articles about the importance of securing wireless access in the past year than in past years . "
He attributed a hunk of the improvement to the apparent improved ease with which consumer gear allows encryption to be turned on .
" The consumer - oriented products are absolutely getting easier to use as they have to , " Kline said .
" People are scared , probably , of putting up wireless access points , yet if the companies make it easy , they feel comfortable . "
The company that has driven the router around over the last few years , WiFoo , reported to RSA that a tiny sliver of companies are using the gold standard of enterprise protection : 802.1X in the form of WPA / WPA2 Enterprise .
( This standard requires a form of authentication before a device can gain access to the network : a certificate , a user name and password , an RSA token , or other methods .
Each authenticated user is then assigned a master key distinct from all other users on the network . )
Perhaps less surprising , despite the high levels of encrypted and protected networks the wardrivers found , the long - broken WEP ( Wired Equivalent Privacy ) was in use on about half of all secured networks ( combined consumer and business ) in New York and London , but only a quarter of the networks in Paris .
Most networks employing improved encryption were using WPA Personal ( WPA - PSK ) , although a good subset were using the combined WPA / WPA2 Personal mode in which the better encryption would be used if available .
( WPA , a Wi-Fi Alliance certified standard , supports the TKIP algorithm ; WPA2 supports either TKIP or the more secure AES . )
New York 's networks , personal and corporate ,
nearly half of all secured networks relied on
the broken WEP standard .
( Image : RSA )
" WEP is absolutely no longer a viable security mechanism , and we need to continue to raise awareness here , " Kline said .
Effective WEP cracks started to appear in 2001 , and simple and fast cracking was available perhaps as early as 2004 .
Kline said that companies were apparently relying on internal security methods , and disregarding external access to its wireless networks , which violates RSA 's " defense in depth " strategy .
" It 's one thing to take action and think that you 're secure , but what I think we 've uncovered here : you may think that you 're secure , but you 're not really . "
Kline noted that the company 's surveys showed that Paris had the biggest jump in WiFi hardware along the route , which has been driven consistently over the last four years .
In 2006 , the WiFoo writers found 573 access points ; 825 , in 2007 ; and a whopping 4,481 in 2008 .
About three quarters of those access points were used for business .
RSA 's interest in this market is in promoting its security solutions , which involve two - factor authentication — typically a password plus a token entered manually or automatically from a device that constantly generates a new code .
This can be used with 802.1X / WPA Enterprise , or with VPNs that tunnel over WiFi networks into enterprise networks .

Today Fujitsu Laboratories Inc. announced a new video - processing technology that gives a driver a complete wraparound view of their vehicle ’s perimeter in real time , eliminating blind spots and reducing the number of small animals they accidentally back over .
As well as providing a complete 360 degree view of what ’s around their vehicle , the technology also allows a driver to choose a specific point of view that ’s most appropriate for their current activity , like backing up or parallel parking .
The system uses video captured by 4 cameras installed around the vehicle that is processed and projected onto a virtual 3D curved plane , kind of like Quicktime VR .
However , Fujitsu Microelectronics actually developed a new OpenGL graphics chip ( the MB86R01 SoC ) specifically for processing the video feeds that allows them to be stitched together with smooth , instant transitions no matter what perspective the driver chooses .
The only downside I can see is that the driver might become too reliant on a small dashboard mounted LCD , so perhaps this technology could be further enhanced with a slick heads - up display of some sort .

I 've got news for the Christians who are upset about atheist billboards , bus advertisements , greeting cards , and the like .
It is not about trying to take " Christ " out of Christmas .
In fact , none of this is even about you and your jealous god .
It is about letting millions of other atheists know that they are not alone .
Nobody likes feeling alienated from the culture in which they live , and the constant reminders ( by you ) that we are outsiders get old .
These billboards , ads , and other campaigns are about normalizing atheism and letting atheists know that there are many others like them .
If the idea of atheists feeling free to be themselves threatens you for some reason , that 's too bad .
We have been silent for far too long , and many of us are no longer willing to do so .
We are here to stay , and we are not willing to keep our opinions to ourselves any more than you are .
If you are going to talk about your religion in public , we are going to comment on it .
Atheists are slowly becoming more visible , and this is likely to continue .
You can expect to hear more from us .
Many atheists live fulfilled , ethical , and often joyful lives without any need for monsters , ghosts , or gods .
It is unfortunate that you have n't been able to do this yet .
We have not given up on you and hope that you will someday be able to set aside your belief in gods .
We also understand how you feel about us and why you feel that way .
Many of us are ex-Christians or former religious believers in other traditions .
We are familiar with much of what you have been taught about us .
This allows some of us to empathize with you and even experience compassion for your struggle .
But we will not apologize for our existence , and we will not stop working to promote education , reason , and skepticism .
Nor will we exempt your religious beliefs from criticism .
Sadly , there are still places ( even here in Western democracies ) where being an atheist means a much higher likelihood of being lonely and experiencing negative social consequences at the hands of the religious majority .
We are offered conditional acceptance : believe as we do , and you can be part of this .
The reality is that most of us could not believe in your gods even if we wanted to .
As long as we are going to be rejected on this basis , you will see us doing what we can to reduce the resulting isolation and promote social connectedness among atheists .
Sharing the simple message with atheists that they are not alone is part of this .
Atheists , you are not alone .
I know this can be hard to believe at times .
Depending on where you live , you may not know any other atheists or feel comfortable letting anyone else know that you are an atheist .
It should n't be that way , but this is reality for some of us .
I suspect there are other atheists around you who are going through the same thing .
You do n't know they are atheists because , like you , they worry about the negative repercussions they 'd face for being open about it .
It may not be a sufficient substitute , but going online and connecting with other atheists there may help get you through some dark times .
We are easy to find there , especially on social media platforms like Twitter .
An early version of this post appeared on Atheist Revolution in 2008 .
It was revised and expanded in 2019 because there is still much work that needs to be done around this issue .
While I was writing a python daemon , I noticed that my application process memory usage is growing over time .
The data was n’t increasing so there must have been some memory leak .
It ’s not so easy for a Python application to leak memory .
Usually there are three scenarios :
some low level C library is leaking your Python code have global lists or dicts that grow over time , and you forgot to remove the objects after use there are some reference cycles in your app
I remembered the post from Marius Gedminas , in which he traced his memory leaks , but I have n’t noticed before that he published his tools .
The tools are awesome .
Just take a look at my session :
$ pdb ./myserver.py > /server.py ( 12 ) ( ) -> import sys ( Pdb ) r 2008 - 11-13 23:15:36,619 server .py INFO Running with verbosity 10 ( > =DEBUG ) 2008-11-13 23:15:36,620 server.py INFO Main dir= './ server ' , args= [ ]
After some time , when my application collected some garbages I pressed Ctrl+C :
2008-11-13 18:41:40,136 server .py INFO Quitting ( Pdb ) import gc ( Pdb ) gc.collect ( ) 58 ( Pdb ) gc.collect ( )

Let ’s see some statistics of object types in memory :
( Pdb ) import objgraph ( Pdb ) objgraph.show_most_common_types(limit=20 ) dict 378631 list 184791 builtin_function_or_method 57542 tuple 55478 Message 48129 function 45575 instancemethod 31949 NonBlockingSocket 31876 NonBlockingConnection 31876 _socketobject 31876 _Condition 28320 AMQPReader 14900 cell 9678
Message objects definitely should n’t be in the memory .
Let ’s see where are they referenced :
( Pdb ) objgraph.by_type(' Message ' ) [ 1 ] < amqplib.client_0_8.Message object at 0x8a5b7ac > ( Pdb ) import random ( Pdb ) obj = objgraph.by_type(' Message ') [random.randint( 0,48000 ) ] ( Pdb ) objgraph.show_backrefs ([obj ] , max_depth=10 )
Graph written to objects .dot ( 15 nodes )
Image generated as objects.png
This is what I saw :
Ok .
A Channelobject still has references to our Message .
Let ’s move on to see why Channel is not freed :
( Pdb ) obj = objgraph.by_type(' Channel') [random.randint ( 0,31000 ) ] ( Pdb ) objgraph.show_backrefs ([obj ] , max_depth=10 )
Graph written to objects .dot ( 35 nodes )
Image generated as objects.png
Channel object references are much more interesting – we just caught a reference cycle here !
There is also one other class that ’s not being freed – NonBlockingConnection :
( Pdb ) obj = objgraph.by_type('NonBlockingConnection ') [random.randint ( 0,31000 ) ] ( Pdb ) objgraph.show_backrefs ([obj ] , max_depth=10 )
Graph written to objects .dot ( 135 nodes )
Image generated as objects.png
Here ’s the cycle we ’re looking for :
To fix this issue it ’s enough to break the reference loops in one place .
This is the code that fixes the reference loops :
# we do n't need channel and connection any more channel.close ( ) connection.close ( ) # remove the reference cycles : del channel .
callbacks del connection .
channels del connonection.connection

The spacewalk is the ultimate space experience .
And among skywalkers , a few have risen above the rest and set the bar high for extravehicular activity .
Here are my picks for the five greatest spacewalks of all time .
1st Untethered Spacewalk — Astronaut Bruce McCandless :
( above ) In March 1984 NASA tested out their Manned
Maneuvering Unit .
Although the units were only used on three Shuttle flights , this iconic image is one of the most famous from the Space
Shuttle era .
1st Spacewalk — Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov :
A true hero of mine , Leonov performed the original spacewalk in 1965 with an inflatable airlock .
At the end of the extravehicular activity , or EVA , tense minutes went by as he struggled to get back into the spacecraft eventually bleeding air out of his suit to pass through .
An avid artist , Leonov fastened colored pencils and a notepad to his suit leg to sketch from inside the capsule .
He went on to command the Soviet side of the Apollo - Soyuz mission .
__
1st American Spacewalk — Ed White : __Three months after Leonov 's historical EVA , U.S. astronaut Ed White followed suit .
The image of this spacewalk is still memorialized on Texas phonebooks — usually with a ten - gallon hat and spurs added .
An extra suit glove that floated out of the open capsule door made for some interesting space debris .
White said the saddest moment of his life was when he was ordered to return into the capsule .
Two years later , White ,
Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee perished in the Apollo 1 fire during a capsule egress test .
1st American Woman to Spacewalk — Kathryn Sullivan :
Being October 1984 , selecting the soundtrack to her spaceflight meant picking what cassettes to bring for her Walkman .
I met Sullivan at the
NASA 50th Anniversary on Wednesday watching Quincy Jones direct the
Space Philharmonic .
I asked her what music she listened to on orbit .
" Classic music and instrumentals , you do n't want any lyrics to get in the way when you are staring out the window getting ready to drift to sleep , " she said .
Sullivan , who now inspires kids with science at COSI , also said the music developed for the IMAX Blue Planet was the one thing that most - vividly brought back her experience of being in space .
Hubble Repair EVA — Story Musgrave : Perhaps the most maverick of them all is Story Musgrave .
He would sleep hanging upside down like a bat to prepare for space missions and has six academic degrees ranging from medicine , to math to literature .
One of the best EVA astronauts of all time , Musgrave performed three of the five spacewalks on the first Hubble repair mission in 1993 which he described as being " like a ballet . "
Indeed , the
Hubble repair EVAs are some of the most elaborately choreographed activities in space , involving up to 300 different tools and huge instruments , that while weightless still have plenty of inertia .
On his final flight , Story opted to stay up on the flight deck and ride out the landing standing up looking out the forward windows rather than strapping in downstairs .
At 61 years old , standing in 1.7 Gs after 18
days in space , without your cooling suit plugged in , for five to 10
minutes straight is pretty wild .
In the end though , Story was likely too much for NASA and after six Shuttle flights , he " left to pursue private interests . "
Now as the Chinese prepare to enter into the spacewalking club , and the fourth Hubble servicing mission prepares for an October 14th launch , we wish them both luck and remind them that they will be in very good company .

In the eight years he ’s been in charge of the nation , George W. Bush ’s approval ratings have hit all - time lows .
That sentiment has , of course , been manifest into song , as well .
To help us prepare to say goodbye to eight of the most disheartening years in the country ’s history , here are 10 of the biggest anti-Bush songs of the era .
Beastie Boys : “ In a World Gone Mad ”
Internet Exclusive [ 2003 ]
“ But you build more bombs as you get more bold /
As your mid-life - crisis war unfolds /
All you want to do is take control /
Now put that ‘ axis of evil ’ bullshit on hold . ”
Released in 2003 via sites including MTV , MoveOn.org and Win Without War , Beastie Boys ’
“ In a World Gone Mad ” takes aim at the Bush administration ’s resolve to send American troops to Iraq .
It may include one of the most ridiculous Beastie Boys lyrics of all time ( “ George Bush , you ’re looking like Zoolander / Trying to play tough for the camera ” ) , but it also has one of the most poignant : “ Now how many people must get killed /
For oil families pockets to get filled /
How many oil families get killed /
Not a damn one , so what ’s the deal ? ”
LL Cool J & Wyclef Jean : “ Mr. President ”
Exit 13 [ Def Jam , 2008 ]
“ Mr. President , truth or dare / Terrorist is hiding .
Do you know where ? ”
Released on LL Cool J’s 13th and final Def Jam album , “ Mr. President ” finds the MC taking a nonpartisan look at the reality of the past eight years , ultimately asking for the truth on where the country stands .
For the most part he uses nonaccusatory statements , something that is a rarity on this list , but ultimately “ Mr. President ” paints a similarly bleak picture : “ I ’m not Republican or Democratic / I ’m independent ; I want the facts /
When are the soldiers come back ?/
Are we prepared for a terrorist attack ? ”
Pearl Jam : “ Bu$hleaguer ”
Riot Act [ Epic , 2002 ]
“ He ’s not a leader , he ’s a Texas leaguer / Swinging for the fence , got lucky with a strike / Drilling for fear , makes the job simple / Born on third , thinks he got a triple . ”
Roughly two years into the Bush administration , Pearl Jam released “ Bu$hleaguer , ” a wordy chop at the faltering president .
Comparing his competency as leader of the nation to the ability of a minor league baseball player , Eddie Vedder criticizes Bush ’s credentials and path to the presidency before fading off into a wasteland of poetic commentary .
It ’s a little easier to make the squad when your dad runs the team .
James McMurtry : “ We Ca n’t Make It Here Anymore ”
Childish Things [ Compadre , 2005 ]
“ Will work for food /
Will die for oil /
Will kill for power and to us the spoils /
The billionaires get to pay less tax /
The working poor get to fall through the cracks . ”
A commentary on the state of the nation , James McMurtry ’s “ We Ca n’t Make It Here Anymore ” is exponentially true four years after he first wrote the song .
Throughout the story McMurtry delivers examples of things that break his heart — eventually pointing the finger at the source of the trickle down , “ if the president wants to admit it or not . ”
In 2005 the economy was relatively solid compared to today ’s , but now more people are hurting and more fingers are being pointed .
A lot of people are looking at the administration and saying , “ We ca n’t make it here anymore . ”
Bright Eyes : “ When the President Talks to God ”
[ iTunes , 2005 ]
“ When the president talks to God / Are the conversations brief or long ?
Does he ask to rape our women ’s rights / And send poor farm kids off to die ?
Does God suggest an oil hike / When the president talks to God ? ”
Conor Oberst ’s poetic protest , “ When the President Talks to God ” caustically chastised Bush for the conflicts between his outspoken Christian beliefs and his administration ’s policies .
Oberst performed the acoustic song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in May of 2005 , pausing momentarily before stepping into one of the song ’s most infamous lines , “ When the president talks to God / Does he ever think that maybe he ’s not ?
That that voice is just inside his head / When he kneels next to the presidential bed / Does he ever smell his own bullshit / When the president talks to God ? ”
While Oberst faded the song out of his live rotation by mid-2006 , the track would still go on to win Song of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards .
Zack de la Rocha and DJ Shadow : “ March of Death ”
MarchofDeath.com [ 2003 ]
“ Here it comes the sound of terror from above / He flex his Texas twisted tongue /
The poor lined up to kill in desert slums /
For oil that boil beneath the desert sun . ”
For the many looking for a glimpse of some ( even then ) long - overdue Zach de la Rocha solo material , “ March of Death ” was a gift .
Distributed for free via MarchofDeath.com , the song focused de la Rocha ’s anger and frustration into roughly four minutes of pounding beats .
Co-opting a one of the last solid tracks DJ Shadow produced before his dreadful The Outsider album , “ March of Death ” is as much a banger as it is a fierce commentary .
The openly outspoken de la Rocha accompanied the song ’s release with this message : “ Lies , sanctions , and cruise missiles have never created a free and just society .
Only everyday people can do that .
Which is why I ’m joining the millions worldwide who have stood up to oppose the Bush administration ’s attempt to expand the U.S. empire at the expense of human rights at home and abroad .
In this spirit I ’m releasing this song for anyone who is willing to listen .
I hope it not only makes us think but also inspires us to act and raise our voices . ”
NOFX : “ Idiot Son of an Asshole ”
Rock Against Bush , Vol. 2 [ Fat Wreck Chords , 2003 ]
“ Cocaine and a little drunk driving / Does n’t matter , when you ’re the commander in chief . ”
A B-side from 2003 ’s War on Errorism that was also released on the Rock Against Bush compilation , “ Idiot Son of An Asshole ” does n’t hold back in explaining how Fat Mike and NOFX feel about George W. Bush .
It is n’t poetic , it is n’t overly thoughtful and it ’s a little too dense for its own good .
But then again , all of those characteristics apply to Bush , as well .
Green Day : “ American Idiot ”
American Idiot [ Reprise , 2004 ]
“ Well , maybe I ’m the faggot America / I ’m not part of a redneck agenda / Now everybody do the propaganda /
And sing along to the age of paranoia . ”
“ American Idiot ” was released as the lead single for Green Day ’s 2004 politically focused “ rock opera ” of the same name .
The hugely successful single propelled Green Day back into the spotlight , raising the profile of the band not just because of its energetic hooks but also because of the political leanings of the songs .
Criticizing the administration ’s stance on gay rights is nothing new , but to call a conservative minority out on its own sickening rhetoric was a step in the right direction .
Neil Young : “ Let ’s Impeach the President ”
Living With War [ Reprise , 2006 ]
“ Let ’s impeach the president / For hijacking our religion and using it to get elected /
Dividing our country into colors /
And still leaving black people neglected . ”
The Grammy - nominated song was released on Neil Young ’s Living With War album , primarily taking focus on the Patriot Act , Al Qaeda , New Orleans and the seemingly innumerable contradictions made by George W. Bush during his presidency .
Blatantly calling for his impeachment , Neil Young closes the song by chanting “ Thank God , ” poking at the skepticism behind the President habitually putting his “ born again ” values ahead of the law , the nation and the world .
Eminem : “ Mosh ”
Encore [ Shady / Interscope Records , 2004 ]
“ Rebel with a rebel yell , raise hell we gonna let ’em know / Stomp , push , shove , mush , Fuck Bush , until they bring our troops home . ”
The single from Eminem ’s 2004 album , Encore , proved controversial for both its lyrics and the accompanying Ian Inaba - directed video .
Opening to a sequence depicting Eminem surrounded by newspaper articles condemning Bush ’s administration , the video depicts a nation lost and angry and on the verge of an uprising .
“ And assemble our own army / To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction /
That we call our president , for the present /
And mosh for the future of our next generation . ”
The closing scene of the video , which accompanies those words , depicts citizens standing in a voting line , all bitterly wearing masks of dissent .
Here , four years later , the only thing that has changed is that the line is a lot longer .
Canadian authorities have released a prisoner known as Big Mike who was found to be too fat to fit in his cell .
Michel Lapointe is a convicted drugs gang member arrested in 2006 who weighs 450 lb ( 205kg ) .
He could not fit on the chair in his Montreal prison cell and his body protruded six inches on either side of his bed , press reports said .
Officials ruled that Lapointe 's prison conditions were " difficult " because of his health .
The Journal de Montreal newspaper quoted a letter from the authorities to Mr Lapointe saying : " You have been detained for more than 25 months and your prison conditions are difficult because of your health . "
They also cited the refusal of two other facilities to accept the 37 - year - old , who was handed a five - year sentence in May this year .
Mr Lapointe was freed late on Tuesday .
" I 'm going to have a proper bed and finally have a chair I can sit in , " he told the paper outside the prison .
" I want a normal life .
I 've done some stupid things and I 've paid for them , " he added .
In its justification for the early release , the Quebec Parole Board also cited Mr Lapointe 's good behaviour , his non-violent crime and the support of his wife and mother .
Science has given humanity more than its share of letdowns .
It has set limits to our technology , such as the impossibility of reaching the speed of light ; failed to overcome our vulnerabilities to cancer and other diseases ; and confronted us with inconvenient truths , as with global climate change .
But of all the comedowns , the second law of thermodynamics might well be the biggest .
It says we live in a universe that is becoming ever more disordered and that there is nothing we can do about it .
The mere act of living contributes to the inexorable degeneration of the world .
No matter how advanced our machines become , they can never completely avoid wasting some energy and running down .
Not only does the second law squash the dream of a perpetual - motion machine , it suggests that the cosmos will eventually exhaust its available energy and nod off into an eternal stasis known as heat death .
Police in the Croydon area where two officers were attacked by a mob
Two police officers were attacked by a mob in south London after they asked a 15 - year - old girl to pick up her litter .
One officer was dragged to the ground and kicked while the other was bitten by a girl who jumped on his back .
Up to 30 people took part in the attack , which happened in North End , Croydon , on Wednesday afternoon .
Trouble flared when the 15 - year - old threw her food wrapper back on to the ground and became aggressive .
The two officers are currently on sick leave .
One eyewitness said he saw two police officers struggling with a girl before a group of youths joined in and began pushing and shoving the officers .
It was disgusting the way they treated the police
Eyewitness Lawen Karim Lawen Karim , 19 , said : " The girl got violent , her friends got really violent .
" The police - there were only two of them - they were really outnumbered and all these yobs were just pushing them out of the way .
" I did n't see any punch being thrown but it was disgusting the way they treated the police . "
A girl who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assault has been released on bail .
CCTV footage
Two men , aged 34 and 38 and both from South Norwood , south London , have been arrested on suspicion of assault and violent disorder .
Police said the girl initially picked up the fast food wrapper when asked by the patrolling officers , but immediately dropped it again sparking the confrontation .
Both officers , aged 34 and 29 , suffered bruising and knee injuries and the officer who received the bite wound required hospital treatment .
Police have been examining CCTV footage from the area .
Insp Simon Ellingham said : " We have heard from several retailers in the area who were horrified at the level of violence used by the crowd against the officers . "

The five best - paid hedge fund managers – who between them made $ 12.6 bn last year , even as the financial world began to crumble around them – were hauled before the US Congress yesterday and assailed over their huge salaries , their tax perks and their contribution to the credit crisis that has engulfed the globe .
In a piece of public theatre that reflected not just the present crisis , but also a decade or more of vastly increased income inequality , the five men declared themselves innocent of causing the market meltdown and insisted that their riches reflected hard work and investment insight .
As one Congressman , Elijah Cummings , put it , " these are five citizens who have more money than God " , and he proceeded to tear into them over rules that have allowed them to pay a fraction of the tax an ordinary teacher , firefighter or plumber might pay .

Philip Falcone , whose Harbinger Capital is one of the world 's biggest hedge funds , stressed his humble beginnings as one of nine children living in a three - bedroom home in Minnesota .
" My father was a utility superintendent , my mother worked in a local shirt factory , " he said .
" I take great pride in my upbringing and it is important for people to know that not everyone who runs a hedge fund was born on Fifth Avenue . "
Although many hedge - fund managers live lives of conspicuous consumption , they prize their privacy as tightly as they cling to the rules – or lack of them – that enable them to keep their trading strategies secret .
Their testimonies under oath in the giant , high - ceilinged , oval committee room on Capitol Hill yesterday took them out of their natural habitat , and for all their status as masters of the universe , several seemed intimidated .
John Paulson – who suddenly joined the ranks of billionaires after betting in 2005 that Wall Street was awash with overpriced investments in mortgages that millions of Americans would ultimately be unable to pay – was told more than a dozen times to speak up so he could be heard .
Jim Simons , the mathematical genius whose Renaissance Technologies is among the most respected fund groups in the world , was told to stop " mumbling " .
The hearing was the latest in what wags on Wall Street are calling the Waxman Witch Trials .
The House oversight committee , whose chairman , Henry Waxman , has subpoenaed all the main players in the crisis , previously humbling Dick Fuld , chief executive of collapsed Lehman Brothers , and the bosses of credit rating agencies who , according to Mr Simons , " allowed sow 's ears to be sold as silk purses " .
Mr Waxman said yesterday : " Our four previous hearings have looked at failure .
Today 's hearing has a different focus .
The five hedge fund managers who will testify today have had unimaginable success . "
Across the world , hedge funds have been blamed for their role in the collapse of banks , many of which suffered in their final stages from a crisis of confidence which some managers said was caused by short - selling of the company shares .
Yesterday 's panel , to a man , described the hedge funds who sell short ( that is , place bets on a share price going down ) as helping bring efficiency to markets by highlighting bad companies , but most agreed more regulation of the industry would be desirable , as would greater disclosure of their positions .
But the pugnacious Ken Griffin , of Chicago - based Citadel group , held out against the tide .
Disclosing more would " be like asking Coca - Cola to disclose its secret formula " .
And he told Congressmen not to repeat mistakes from the past , when political talk of greater regulation pushed the derivatives market largely overseas .
" It breaks my heart , " Mr Griffin said , " when I go to Canary Wharf and look at the thousands and thousands of highly paid jobs in the London derivatives market , jobs that belong in America . "

George Soros , one of the hedge fund industry 's elder statesmen , said he had come out of retirement to manage his fund , in the face of a financial tsunami that was threatening substantial losses to his personal fortune .
The philosopher , the geek , the quiet man , the player and the buyer :
The men behind the hedge funds
George Soros
Soros Fund Management
Paid last year – $ 2.9 bn
Famed as " the man who broke the Bank of England " , after netting more than $ 1bn by betting the pound would fall out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992 , the 78 - year - old has attacked unfettered free market capitalism as being at the root of today 's crisis .
Jim Simons
Renaissance Technologies
Paid last year – $ 2.9 bn
The world 's most expensive hedge fund manager , 70 , charges clients 5 per cent a year , plus a whopping 44 per cent of returns beyond a certain level .
His fund runs " black box " programmes that harvest tiny profits from millions of automated trades .
John Paulson
Paulson & Company
Paid last year – $ 3.7bn
Having run an obscure fund for 14 years , the 52 - year - old last year made what rivals called " the greatest hedge fund trade of all time " .
As a result he traded up in the Hamptons , the upstate playground for New Yorkers , and bought a lakeside compound for $ 41 m ( £ 27.8 m ) .
Philip Falcone
Harbinger Capital Partners
Paid last year – $ 1.7bn
The 47 - year - old made his fortune trading junk bonds in the Eighties .
His firm was founded in 2001 and made another fortune last year betting against sub - prime mortgages .
His two funds boasted 114 and 176 per cent returns in 2007 .
Ken Griffin
Citadel Investment Group
Paid last year – $ 1.5 bn
Last year , it looked as the 40 - year - old might become one of the world 's biggest financial players after buying up so many distressed funds , banks and brokers .
Now he is fighting to save his fund after losing 35 per cent of it this year .
With the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 800 points Monday as the credit meltdown pushes the world ’s economy into a recession , how should prudent investors respond ?
More likely than not , the value of the stocks and bonds held in your company ’s retirement savings account or your IRA are down .
If you ’ve invested in a stock index fund based on the Standard & Poor ’s 500 , you ’ve suffered a loss of roughly 35 percent since last October , the date economists agree the bear market began .
Depending on how long you ’ve held your stocks , the average cost of shares in your account may be less than what you paid for them over time ( the average cost basis ) .
That ’s enough to make you want to cut your losses now and hold only cash or to cut back on what you ’ve been setting aside as tax - deferred for retirement .
But before you rush into these potentially disastrous decisions , consider the following :
Risk flattens over time .
The worst one - year return for small company stocks over the past eight decades was nearly 60 percent .
As you move out 20 years , the worst - case scenario for those stocks is a positive six percent , according to Ibbotson Associates , Inc .
True , although it has taken the S&P 500 on average 13 months to recoup losses completely , you may have to wait as many as three years for stocks to rebound and enter bull territory if past history is any guide .
Even still , over time , those who are willing to commit to a diversified , consistent long - term investment program will see their capital grow .
Why ?
As in life , so too , with investing .
How many times have you been right — even with the most rigorous analysis to support your decision ?
Timing the market is impossible .
Though many hardcore investors think they can do this , the facts say otherwise .
Studies show that investors who bail out of the market and then re-invest when the market recovers to pre-bear market levels do worse than those who remained fully invested .
Given that shares have likely priced in all available information about their worth , it ’s unlikely that you have an edge in stock picking .
That ’s the point Princeton University Professor Burton G. Malkiel makes in his book , A Random Walk Down Wall Street .
Malkiel builds a strong case for index investing .
Transactions costs are low , which can cut deeply into returns .
All my investments are in index funds because Malkiel ’s argument convinced me .
The one time I saw an outsized gain with a stock pick was wiped out by a loss from what appeared to be a sure win until a lawsuit hit .
Through dollar cost averaging , too , your costs are spread out over time , benefiting from market dips .
You buy more shares when the price is low and fewer shares when the price is high .
Diversification is a hedge against market irregularities .
Given the turbulence in the markets , now is a good time to look at your portfolio ’s diversity .
A general yardstick to determine the percentage of stocks and bonds you want to hold is based on age .
If you ’re 25 , you may want to hold 75 percent in equities , with a good portion in the more risky small size companies that tend to experience the greatest gains and losses compared to blue chip stocks .
Investing a percentage , too , in an international stock fund , will help you to profit from a global economy that is shifting away from the US .
Investment advisers differ about this formula though , with some arguing recently that you may want to hold a disproportionately higher level in fixed - income given the equity markets ’ volatility , which one is today above historic peaks ( CBOE volatility index ) .
The mix of stocks and bonds that you ’ll choose will depend on your tolerance for risk .
So , looking ahead , here ’s a checklist :
Review your holdings now to determine if you are adequately diversified and if your holdings are appropriate given your tolerance for risk and your financial goals .
Do n’t give up saving , particularly if your employer matches your contribution to a retirement plan .
Your nest egg will likely be your largest source of retirement income .
Resist the temptation to cash out .
Stocks over the long term , and I emphasize long , outperform other investments .
But you may have several years of a bear market before you see any bounce in your portfolio ’s performance .
Seek out advice .
Understanding how markets perform over time is important to help you make decisions .

The definition of a professional astronomer is one who gets paid to do it .
But the difference between that and an amateur , who technically does it for fun , is getting hard to tell .
Take this image of Pluto and its moon Charon taken by so - called amateur astronomers Antonello Medugno and Daniele Gasparri from Italy :
The bright blob on the right is Pluto , and Charon is on the left .
The separation is 0.7 arcseconds , an incredible feat ( the Moon is 2500 times wider than this in the sky ) .
This is definitely Charon ; it 's at the correct position , separation , and brightness .
They nailed it .
Mind you , Charon was n't even discovered until 1978 by a pro , using a 61 inch telescope !
The image above was using a 14 " telescope , and is in fact much better than the discovery image .
In 30 years of progress , a much smaller commercial telescope can do better than a professional setup could .
Wow .
Also , an amateur used an iPhone ( and a telescope ) to capture this image of Jupiter :
Sure , it 's not the best , but c'mon , it was taken with an iPhone .
We live in the future .
Still no flying cars , but we live in the future .
Edited to add : I did not include any of the technical descriptions of the Charon image , and I should have .
Equipment : Meade L200 GPS 14 " at f/25 , with a Starlight Xpress SXV - H9 CCD Image scale : 0.15 " / pixel , unbinned Exposure : 6 seconds / frame Filters : R + Ir ( Baader ) Final image : 21 frames , median combined , deconvolved to enhance sharpness
At the time , Pluto was 31 AU away , at a mag of 13.9 and Charon was mag 15.5 .
The images were taken on August 19 , 2008 .

Tip o' the dew shield to Davide De Martin and Anthony Bossuyt .
After the initial media support for a potential GM – Chrysler hookup ( e.g. Jalopnik.com ’s Ray Wert ) , the bandwagon began to roll like a snowball down the proverbial mixed metaphor hill , and everybody soured on the deal .
We even charted how individual commentators changed their positions and eventually “ threw Chrysler to the Wolves . ”
In Monday ’s New York Times , Andrew Ross Sorkin said that GM CEO Rick Wagoner ’s continued employment is a “ minor miracle . ”
But the commentatorati are still behind the curve re : the government ’s rumored $ 10 b “ intervention ” in the GM – Chrysler merger .
In the main , they have’t even acknowledged that the bailout is happening .
That , and the critical fact that it ’s structurally designed to fail .
Let ’s start with the likely government strings .
This is after all , common sense .
If the merged GM / Chrysler is going to enjoy the benefits of our largess , they should be held accountable for what happens next .
He who owns the gold makes the rules .
At least in theory .
In theory , you and I might demand that the entire executive floor of the Renaissance Center be fired .
But the U.S. government does n’t see it that way .
All indications are that the men who ’ve gutted GM will keep their jobs and eviscerate what ’s left of the American automaker (s ) .
But it gets worse .
One of the politically - fueled requirements of this politically - fueled bailout : Chrysler - GM must keep as many jobs intact for as long as possible .
That ’s 97 k union jobs that someone ’s duly elected officials want to protect .
But any analyst with a high school diploma or better knows that both GM and Chrysler are currently too big to survive ; too many managers , brands , factories , dealers and workers .
Unless the new entity makes job cuts , merging the two automakers makes no sense whatsoever .
How do you achieve any benefits if you ca n’t replace two jobs with one ?
At this point , the bailout request from GM and Chrysler is a $ 10 b package ( in addition to the $ 25 b previously allocated for plant retooling for more fuel - efficient cars ) .
The combined debt of GM and Chrysler is $ 52b .
GM alone is burning through $ 1b per month , just to keep the lights on .
Even if their collective debt vanished or could be put on hold ( a process we once referred to as bankruptcy ) , bailout number two only provides enough cash to keep GM - Chrysler ( a.k.a. American Leyland ) rolling for another two years– at best .
The automotive business runs on a five - year cycle .
From a product perspective ( remember products ? ) , General Motors and Chrysler ca n’t do anything significant during those two federally - subsidized years .
We know exactly what will be on the showroom floor in two years ’ time .
GM ’s “ great hopes ” were the Chevy Cruze and Volt .
While the Volt ’s feasibility is debatable , the Cruze ( a much easier to build conventional car ) is slated to go on sale as a 2011 model some time in 2010 .
That ’s it .
Time ’s up for GM .
Giving them money without restructuring is like heading into the bottom of the ninth , losing , and insisting the other team takes its turn at bat .
So why will the government attempt the bailout anyway ?
Because “ something must be done . ” GM and Cerberus ( Chrysler ’s owner ) have powerful friends in Washington .
The United Auto Workers may be a shadow of its former self , but it still knows how to deliver votes .
And American government officials have always loved dumping cash into the economy right before an election ( see Edward Tufte ’s 1978 book Political Control of the Economy ) .
Second , class warfare .
This bailout makes up for the first “ thief in the the night ” raid on the public purse for Wall Street fat cats .
This one ’s about protecting “ real jobs ” for “ middle class working stiffs ” who “ build stuff , ” thus protecting our “ industrial base . ”
If GM filed for bankruptcy and the government sat back and watched , people would be angry at the “ failure to respond . ”
So they will take a futile action instead , with $ 10 b or more , lots more , to make the problem a little less grave ( or at least look that way ) .
It ’s a cover - your - ass play on an epic , tragic scale .
As a result , it ’s unlikely anyone in Congress or the lame - duck White House will oppose a bailout .
Nobody wants to be the first to oppose the bailout when their election opponents are in favor of it .
Nor does anyone have a strong desire to go toe - to - toe with the UAW weeks before a local , state and presidential election .
From any rational perspective , it makes far more sense for the government to do something else with the money headed for Detroit .
The feds could simple hand every blue collar at GM and Chrysler worker a $ 100 k tax - free check .
They put it into schools ; provide health care for a pile of people .
Or give the American people a tax break .
Or simply not spend money they do n’t have .

Team coverage Prosecutors today filed charges against a father for leaving his son in a locked car Saturday so he could make the late - night showing of " The Dark Knight . "
The 23 - year - old man turned down our interview request , so he is not talking with the media .
But a YouTube video clip , which runs about four minutes , speaks for itself .
In it , Farnham talks about how he finished college but did n't do the necessary paperwork to graduate saying he was " too lazy to do it . "
The entire clip is an odd assortment of musings and , sadly , a prediction .
Farnham says , " Just want to give you guys an introduction , so later on , you guys can actually have something to reference back to when you guys are like , ‘ Who the hell is this guy ? ' "
At one point he also said , " Be warned , be prepared , because if there 's anything I know , it 's how to get attention . "
On his MySpace page , he says he 's working on a screenplay and stealing Internet using a neighbor 's unsecured wireless network .
David Farnham was booked into the Salt Lake County jail on second - degree felony child abuse , but formal charges have since been filed today by the District Attorney 's Office .
Farnham has been charged with a class A misdemeanor child abuse .
Robert Parrish , deputy district attorney for Salt Lake County , said , " What we look at is :
What were they aware of ?
Did they know of the risk ?
Did they disregard the risk and proceed to do whatever it was they wanted to do even though they knew about the risk ?
Or was it truly just an accident ?
" Our child abuse statute specifically has a definition for inflicting condition upon the child that impinges on the child 's health , safety , or welfare .
If you do it intentionally it 's a class A misdemeanor . "
Robert Parrish
If found guilty , Farnham could face up to a year in jail .
He 's certainly been the target of quite a bit of public humiliation ; others had found the YouTube video before us and posted nasty remarks about Farnham allegedly leaving his child in a car .
Police also tell us as they were arresting him , moviegoers were yelling obscenities at him .
Police say they do n't know why Farnham left his son in the car , only that he did .
Earlier today , Farnham 's video blog on YouTube had a little more than 40 hits .
Tonight , he 's gotten more than 200 .

The owner of a firm hired to register thousands of Republican voters in California has been arrested for alleged registration fraud , officials said .
The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that Mark Jacoby was arrested in Ontario , Calif. , by state and local investigators late Saturday .
California and local investigators charge that Jacoby fraudulently registered himself to vote at a childhood California home , but does n't live there any longer .
They allege he registered fraudulently so he could meet the requirement that signature gatherers be registered in California , the Times said .

The California Republican Party had hired Jacoby 's firm , Young Political Majors , to register new GOP voters in the state .
However , dozens of voters said they were duped into registering as Republicans by the firm , saying they were told they were signing a petition to toughen penalties against child molesters .
The Times said the firm was paid up to $ 12 for every state resident registered as a Republican .
The Los Angeles County district attorney 's office and several other agencies have begun investigations , the newspaper said .
The Times said it was unable to reach Jacoby for comment .
The New Jersey councilman who allegedly urinated on a crowd of concertgoers from the balcony of a Washington , D.C. nightclub swore off booze on Sunday -- two days after he was busted for the embarrassing stunt .

He went on to say that the incident was " deeply humiliating , very embarrassing " and troubling , " the Daily News reported .
The 44 - year - old Democratic councilman refused to admit to the lewd stunt .
" I can't comment on that , " he told Fox5 News .
" I 'm going to continue to do all the good things , and I 'm not going to let this overshadow me . "
Lipski was in D.C. to see a Grateful Dead tribute band and was spotted relieving himself by one of the club 's staffers around 9:50 p.m. , club sources told the Daily News .
He was charged with simple assault .
Messages left at Lipski's council office , and a Jersey City listing under his name were not immediately returned .

Ed Jew , the former San Francisco supervisor who resigned from office in January after state and federal prosecutors accused him of corruption , pleaded guilty to federal charges this morning .
Jew admitted to mail fraud , extortion and soliciting a bribe in connection with a scheme to shake down Chinese immigrant owners of tapioca drink shops in the Sunset District for $ 84,000 in bribes .
Jew 's attorney said his client believed his actions were legal because that 's how he learned to behave in politics .
At his sentencing on Feb. 13 , Jew is prepared to name others who he says have engaged in similar actions .
Unlike past court appearances , no supporters gathered at the hearing in U.S. District Court .
Jew could spend decades in federal prison .
He also still faces state charges alleging that he lied about where he lived to vote and run for office in San Francisco .
Prosecutors say Jew lived in Burlingame while he campaigned for and represented District Four in the Sunset .
A state court hearing is scheduled later this month .
The admission of guilt in the federal case ends a large part of the saga that began in May 2007 , when FBI agents raided Jew's City Hall office , his Chinatown flower shop and two homes searching for the money prosecutors alleged he had taken from the shop owners .
Jew had been in office just six months when the raid happened .
A grand jury indicted him 11 months ago , alleging that Jew extorted money from the Quickly tapioca drink chain .
After the planning official told Jew that the chain 's stores appeared to be violating a permit ordinance , Jew told the store operators he would help them stay in business in exchange for cash payments of $ 10,000 for each of the eight businesses , the indictment said .
Following the raid , questions arose about whether Jew lived in the Sunset or with his wife and daughter in Burlingame .
The San Francisco District Attorney charged Jew with nine felonies , accusing him of lying about his residency .
He is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 21 to set a trial on those charges , but state prosecutors have said a resolution in the federal case could affect how they proceed .
If researchers at Boston University 's College of Engineering have their way , light bulbs of the future may be the highway your data gets carried along .
A team at the school is working on low - power LEDs which could utilize an optical communication system to carry data wirelessly .
Using a technique which rapidly switches the LEDs on and off data transmissions could be made via imperceptible -- yet undoubtedly brain - scrambling -- flickering patterns , and each light would be its own network entry point at speeds of 1 to 10 Mbps .
The concept is more secure than current RF techniques because it requires linked devices be in line - of - sight , and the technology would draw far less energy than conventional radios .
Says professor Thomas Little , " Imagine if your computer , iPhone , TV , radio and thermostat could all communicate with you when you walked in a room just by flipping the wall light switch and without the usual cluster of wires . "
Yes ... and talk about you behind your back .
And plot your " accidental " death after taking out a large life insurance policy on you .
You wo n't get away with this LED network !

The Ubuntu team has decided that instead of OpenOffice.org 3.0 , released last week , the default version of the office suite in the Ubuntu 8.10 release will be OpenOffice.org 2.4.1 .
It ’s not a decision that many Ubuntu fans are happy with and Launchpad is filled with discussion on the issue , with many users arguing that not including OpenOffice.org 3.0 undermines Ubuntu 8.10 .
The Ubuntu developers , however , argue that delays in the OpenOffice.org 3.0 release and insufficient time forced them to exclude it .
Ubuntu ’s Colin Watson is the man taking much of the flak for the decision .
Tectonic asked him why this decision had been taken .
Will OpenOffice.org 3.0 not be included by default in Ubuntu Intrepid ?
That ’s correct .
What will be the default OpenOffice.org application in Intrepid ?
OpenOffice.org 2.4.1 .
Could you explain briefly why the decision was taken to exclude OpenOffice.org 3.0 from the default Intrepid release ?
We ’d originally been hoping to include OpenOffice.org 3.0 in Ubuntu 8.10 .
Our original plan had been to provide packages that could be installed alongside 2.4.1 ( rather than replacing it ) once 3.0 reached the late beta or release candidate stage .
However , a couple of factors made this much harder than we originally expected .
Firstly , the 3.0 release schedule has slipped quite a bit .
At the beginning of May , the release candidate was due on 25 July with the gold release on 2 September .
By the end of July , release candidate was due on 8 August and gold on 16 September .
Throughout August the release candidate was gradually pushed back until it eventually landed on 5 September , a week after our feature freeze for 8.10 .
There were then a series of release candidates until the gold release finally came out on 13 October .
If the original release schedule had held then including 3.0 would n’t have been a problem , but on a six - month release schedule with many other applications involved we have to place an absolute premium on predictability .
Secondly , parallel packages turned out to be infeasible due to a number of technical problems .
( In any case , we had only ever intended this as a stopgap measure so that we could test out 3.0 in Intrepid without having to be completely committed to it . )
The bottom line is that we wanted to avoid shipping anything other than a gold release of OpenOffice.org , and by the time we had a reasonable assurance that we would be able to include a gold release of 3.0 in Ubuntu 8.10 and shake out any new bugs , we were already well past beta and beginning to prepare for our release candidate , so it was too late .
We ’ve learned that sometimes it is better to wait and deliver a well - tested product rather than trying to cram everything in at the last minute .
With a six - month release cycle , it is never all that long for users to wait until the next one along ; we fully expect 3.0 to be part of Ubuntu 9.04 .

Finally , one of the headline features of OpenOffice.org 3.0 that many people have asked about is support for Microsoft Office 2007 documents .
Thanks to our use of the Go-oo patch set , we already support this important feature with 2.4.1 .

Overview
A rectovaginal fistula is an abnormal connection between the lower portion of your large intestine — your rectum — and your vagina .
Bowel contents can leak through the fistula , allowing gas or stool to pass through your vagina .
A rectovaginal fistula may result from :
Injury during childbirth
Crohn 's disease or other inflammatory bowel disease
Radiation treatment or cancer in the pelvic area
Complication following surgery in the pelvic area
The condition may cause emotional distress and physical discomfort , which can impact self - esteem and intimacy .
Talk with your doctor if you have signs and symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula , even if it 's embarrassing .
Some rectovaginal fistulas may close on their own , but most need surgical repair .
Symptoms
Depending on the fistula 's size and location , you may have minor symptoms or significant problems with continence and hygiene .
Signs and symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula may include :
Passage of gas , stool or pus from your vagina
Foul - smelling vaginal discharge
Recurrent vaginal or urinary tract infections
Irritation or pain in the vulva , vagina and the area between your vagina and anus ( perineum )
Pain during sexual intercourse
When to see a doctor
See your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms of a rectovaginal fistula .
A fistula may be the first warning of a more serious problem , such as an infected , pus-filled area ( abscess ) or cancer .
Identifying the cause of the fistula can help your doctor determine a treatment plan .
Causes
A rectovaginal fistula may form as a result of :
Injuries during childbirth .
Delivery - related injuries are the most common cause of rectovaginal fistulas .
This includes tears in the perineum that extend to the bowel , or an infection of an episiotomy — a surgical incision to enlarge the perineum during vaginal delivery .
These may happen following a long , difficult , or obstructed labor .
These types of fistulas may also involve injury to your anal sphincter , the rings of muscle at the end of the rectum that help you hold in stool .

Crohn 's disease .
The second most common cause of rectovaginal fistulas , Crohn 's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease in which the digestive tract lining is inflamed .
Most women with Crohn 's disease never develop a rectovaginal fistula , but having Crohn 's disease does increase your risk of the condition .

Cancer or radiation treatment in your pelvic area .
A cancerous tumor in your rectum , cervix , vagina , uterus or anal canal can result in a rectovaginal fistula .
Radiation therapy for cancers in these areas can also put you at risk .
A fistula caused by radiation usually forms within six months to two years after treatment .

Radiation therapy for cancers in these areas can also put you at risk .
A fistula caused by radiation usually forms within six months to two years after treatment .
Surgery involving your vagina , perineum , rectum or anus .
Prior surgery in your lower pelvic region , such as removal of your uterus ( hysterectomy ) , in rare cases can lead to development of a fistula .
The fistula may develop as a result of an injury during surgery or a leak or infection that develops afterward .

The fistula may develop as a result of an injury during surgery or a leak or infection that develops afterward .
Other causes .
Rarely , a rectovaginal fistula may be caused by infections in your anus or rectum ; infections of small , bulging pouches in your digestive tract ( diverticulitis ) ; long - term inflammation of your colon and rectum ( ulcerative colitis ) ; dry , hard stool that gets stuck in the rectum ( fecal impaction ) ; or vaginal injury unrelated to childbirth .
Complications
Physical complications of a rectovaginal fistula may include :
Uncontrolled loss of stool ( fecal incontinence )
Hygiene problems
Recurrent vaginal or urinary tract infections
Irritation or inflammation of your vagina , perineum or the skin around your anus
An infected fistula that forms an abscess , a problem that can become life - threatening if not treated
Fistula recurrence
Among women with Crohn 's disease who develop a fistula , the chances of complications are high .
These can include poor healing , or another fistula forming later .
Outside her Bel - Air home , Nancy Reagan stood arm in arm with John McCain and offered a significant -- but less than exuberant -- endorsement .
“ Ronnie and I always waited until everything was decided , and then we endorsed , ” the Republican matriarch said in March .
“ Well , obviously this is the nominee of the party . ”
They were the only words she would speak during the five - minute photo op .
In a written statement , she described McCain as “ a good friend for over 30 years . ”
But that friendship was strained in the late 1970s by McCain ’s decision to divorce his first wife , Carol , who was particularly close to the Reagans , and within weeks marry Cindy Hensley , the young heiress to a lucrative Arizona beer distributorship .
The Reagans rushed to help Carol , finding her a new home in Southern California with the family of Reagan aide Edwin Meese III and a series of political and White House jobs to ease her through that difficult time .

McCain , who is about to become the GOP nominee , has made several statements about how he divorced Carol and married Hensley that conflict with the public record .
In his 2002 memoir , “ Worth the Fighting For , ” McCain wrote that he had separated from Carol before he began dating Hensley .
“ I spent as much time with Cindy in Washington and Arizona as our jobs would allow , ” McCain wrote .
“ I was separated from Carol , but our divorce would not become final until February of 1980 . ”
An examination of court documents tells a different story .
McCain did not sue his wife for divorce until Feb. 19 , 1980 , and he wrote in his court petition that he and his wife had “ cohabited ” until Jan.
7 of that year -- or for the first nine months of his relationship with Hensley .

Although McCain suggested in his autobiography that months passed between his divorce and remarriage , the divorce was granted April 2 , 1980 , and he wed Hensley in a private ceremony five weeks later .
McCain obtained an Arizona marriage license on March 6 , 1980 , while still legally married to his first wife .
Until McCain filed for divorce , the Reagans and their inner circle assumed he was happily married , and they were stunned to learn otherwise , according to several close aides .
“ Everybody was upset with him , ” recalled Nancy Reynolds , a top aide to the former president who introduced him to McCain .
By contrast , some of McCain ’s friends , including the Senate aide who was at the reception where McCain first met Hensley , believed he was separated at that time .

Albert “ Pete ” Lakeland , the aide who was with McCain at the reception in Hawaii in April 1979 , said of the introduction to Hensley : “ It was like he was struck by Cupid ’s arrow .
He was just enormously smitten . ”
As the pair began dating , Lakeland allowed them to spend a weekend together at his summer home in Maryland , he said .
The senator has acknowledged that he behaved badly , and that his swift divorce and remarriage brought a cold shoulder from the Reagans that lasted years .
In a recent interview , McCain said he did not want to revisit the breakup of his marriage .
“ I have a very good relationship with my first wife , ” he said .
In his autobiography , he wrote : “ My marriage ’s collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity .
The blame was entirely mine . ”

Tucker Bounds , a McCain campaign spokesman , said : “ Of course we will not comment on the breakup of the senator ’s first marriage , other than to note that the senator has always taken responsibility for it . ”
Carol McCain did not respond to a request for an interview .
About all she has ever said is this to McCain biographer Robert Timberg : “ John was turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again . ”
After leaving the White House , Carol McCain worked in press relations in the Washington area , retiring about five years ago after working for the National Soft Drink Assn .
She now lives in Virginia Beach , Va. , and has not remarried .
She has two sons from an earlier marriage :
Andy , a vice president at Cindy McCain ’s beer distributorship , and Doug , a commercial airline pilot .

Carol and John McCain had a daughter , Sidney , who works in the music industry in Canada .
John McCain , who calls himself “ a foot soldier in the Reagan revolution , ” said in his memoir : “ My divorce from Carol , whom the Reagans loved , caused a change in our relationship .
Nancy . . . was particularly upset with me and treated me on the few occasions we encountered each other after I came to Congress with a cool correctness that made her displeasure clear .
“ I had , of course , deserved the change in our relationship . ”
Joanne Drake , spokeswoman for Nancy Reagan , did not return phone calls seeking comment .

The first Mrs. McCain
McCain met Carol Shepp through a mutual friend and fellow midshipman at the Naval Academy , from which McCain graduated in 1958 .
That friend , Alasdair E. Swanson , married her in 1958 .
In the early 1960s , the Swansons lived in Pensacola , Fla. , where Alasdair Swanson and McCain served as Navy pilots .
But that marriage ended in June 1964 after Carol sued for divorce , alleging that her husband had been unfaithful .
Advertisement
According to McCain , he started seeing Carol shortly afterward .
They were married in Philadelphia , her hometown , in July 1965 .
McCain adopted her two sons , and they had a daughter together .
Then in October 1967 , McCain ’s plane was shot down and he was captured by the North Vietnamese .
She became active in the POW - MIA movement .
A former model , she dedicated herself to her children and kept the family together , friends said , while awaiting his return .
“ She had the perseverance to carry on , ” said Melinda Fitzwater , a cousin of McCain ’s who later worked with Carol McCain at the White House .
“ She had a little baby and small kids .
She was a great , unique person . ”
On Christmas Eve 1969 , while she was driving alone in Philadelphia , Carol McCain ’s car skidded and struck a utility pole .
Thrown into the snow , she broke both legs , an arm and her pelvis .
She was operated on a dozen times , and in the treatment she lost about 5 inches in height .

After John McCain was released in March 1973 and returned to the U.S. , he told friends that Carol was not the woman he had married .
Reynolds , working for then - California Gov. Ronald Reagan , said she first met the couple in San Francisco at a reception for ex-prisoners .
She later introduced them to the Reagans at their home in Pacific Palisades .
“ They were just an attractive couple , ” Reynolds said .
“ The Reagans had great admiration and respect for John . ”
In 1974 , Reagan invited McCain to speak at a governor ’s prayer breakfast in Sacramento .
The former prisoner of war told the story of a fellow captive who had scratched a prayer on a cell wall .
Ronald and Nancy Reagan were reduced to tears .
It was “ the most moving speech I had ever heard , ” Reynolds said .
Advertisement
In the next few years , family and friends said , there was no sign that McCain was unhappy in his marriage .
Fitzwater recalled visiting the family on Thanksgivings , and McCain seemed content barbecuing a turkey on his outdoor grill near Jacksonville , Fla .
Navy officers in the squadron McCain commanded in 1977 said they did not know anything was wrong .
“ When I went to parties at their home , everything seemed fine , ” said Mike Akin , a naval flying instructor .
“ They seemed to be a happily married couple . ”
But two years later , while on a trip as a Navy liaison with the Senate , McCain spied Hensley at the Honolulu reception .
In a recent television interview with Jay Leno on the “ Tonight Show , ” Cindy McCain joked about how the Navy captain had pursued her .
“ He kind of chased me around . . . the hors d’oeuvre table , ” she said .
“ I was trying to get something to eat and I thought , ‘ This guy ’s kind of weird . ’
I was kind of trying to get away from him . ”
John McCain was 42 ; she was 24 .
During the next nine months , he would fly to Arizona or she would come to the Washington area , where McCain and Carol had a home .

Carol McCain later told friends , including Reynolds and Fitzwater , that she did not know he was seeing anyone else .
John McCain sued for divorce in Fort Walton Beach , Fla. , where his friend and fellow former POW , George E. “ Bud ” Day , practiced law and could represent him .
In the petition , he stated that the couple had “ cohabited as husband and wife ” until Jan. 7 , 1980 .
His wife did not contest the divorce , and Day said that the couple had reached an agreement in advance on support and division of property .
By then she was living in La Mesa , in San Diego County , with the family of Meese , a close Reagan aide and future attorney general .

“ We knew John and Carol both since he came back from Hanoi in 1973 , ” Meese said recently .
“ They have been friends of ours ever since .
“ She was with us for maybe four or five months .
Their daughter and our daughter were friends , and they went to school together . ”
Carol McCain was distraught at being blindsided by her husband ’s intention to end their marriage , said her friends in the Reagan circle .
“ They [ the Reagans ] were n’t happy with him , ” Fitzwater said .
Carol McCain “ was this little , frail person .
. . .
She was brokenhearted . ”

By that time , Nancy Reagan had come to Carol McCain ’s aid , hiring her as a press assistant in the 1980 presidential campaign .
When the Reagans moved to Washington , she was named director of the White House Visitors Office .
“ Nancy Reagan was crazy about her , ” Reynolds said .
“ But everybody was crazy about Carol McCain . . . .
And the Meeses were very generous and helpful and comforting to her . ”
Fitzwater said that living in Southern California and working on the Reagan campaign helped Carol McCain move past the loss of her marriage .

“ It was perfect for her .
She was traveling , and it took her mind off a very , very sad time for her . ”

A young woman recently stoned to death in Somalia first pleaded for her life , a witness has told the BBC .
" Do n't kill me , do n't kill me , " she said , according to the man who wanted to remain anonymous .
A few minutes later , more than 50 men threw stones .
Human rights group Amnesty International says the victim was a 13 - year - old girl who had been raped .
Initial reports had said she was a 23 - year - old woman who had confessed to adultery before a Sharia court .
Numerous eye - witnesses say she was forced into a hole , buried up to her neck then pelted with stones until she died in front of more than 1,000 people last week .
Meanwhile , Islamists in the capital , Mogadishu have carried out a public flogging .
Islamists are becoming increasingly open in the capital , Mogadishu Mogadishu is nominally under the control of government forces and their Ethiopian allies , who face frequent attacks by Islamist and nationalist insurgents .
The BBC's Mohammed Olad Hassan in the city says the flogging was a show of strength .
He says two men accused of helping to kill a man and torture his mother , who they accused of theft , were each given 39 lashes in the north - eastern suburb of Suqa - hola .
The man who actually killed the alleged thief was released , after agreeing to pay his family 100 camels in compensation .
Before the flogging , hundreds of Islamist fighters performed a military parade , our reporter says .
Death threats Cameras were banned from the stoning in Kismayo , but print and radio journalists who were allowed to attend estimated that the woman , Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow , was 23 years old .
People were saying this was not good for Sharia law , this was not good for human rights , this was not good for anything
Witness However , Amnesty said it had learned she was 13 , and that her father had said she was raped by three men .
When the family tried to report the rape , the girl was accused of adultery and detained , Amnesty said .
Convicting a girl of 13 for adultery would be illegal under Islamic law .
A human rights activist in the town told the BBC on condition of anonymity that he had received death threats from the Islamic militia , who accuse him of spreading false information about the incident .
He denies having anything to with Amnesty 's report .
' Crying '
Court authorities have said the woman came to them admitting her guilt .

She was asked several times to review her confession but she stressed that she wanted Sharia law and the deserved punishment to apply , they said .
But a witness who spoke to the BBC's Today programme said she had been crying and had to be forced into a hole before the stoning , reported to have taken place in a football stadium .
" More than 1,000 people arrived there , " he said .
" After two hours , the Islamic administration in Kismayo brought the lady to the place and when she came out she said : ' What do you want from me ? ' "
" They said : ' We will do what Allah has instructed us ' .
She said : ' I 'm not going , I 'm not going .
Do n't kill me , do n't kill me . '
" A few minutes later more than 50 men tried to stone her . "
' Checked by nurses '
The witness said people crowding round to see the execution said it was " awful " .
" People were saying this was not good for Sharia law , this was not good for human rights , this was not good for anything . "
But no - one tried to stop the Islamist officials , who were armed , the witness said .
He said one boy was shot in the confusion .
According to Amnesty International , nurses were sent to check during the stoning whether the victim was still alive .
They removed her from the ground and declared that she was , before she was replaced so the stoning could continue .
The port of Kismayo was seized in August by a coalition of forces loyal to rebel leader Hassan Turki , and al - Shabab , the country 's main radical Islamist insurgent organisation .
Mr Turki is on the US list of " financers of terrorism " .
It was the first reported execution by stoning in the southern port city since Islamist insurgents captured it .
The BBC had a reporter in the area , but he was shot dead in Kismayo in June .

Like the Large Hadron Collider ?
Feel like you ’ve been reading the same LHC articles or watching the same videos over and over again ?
Then check out the latest addition to the YouTube pantheon of LHC videos , the Large Hadron Rap .
The rap is the brainchild of Kate McAlpine , a .k.a. alpinekat , a freelance science writer and one of the editors of the ATLAS e- News .
Having just produced her first physics rap , McAlpine was already planning an LHC rap when she arrived at CERN in October for a six - month stint in U.S. LHC communications .
“ I 'd just finished a rap about a neurochip , and my head was filled with information about the LHC and its goals , ” said McAlpine .
“ I had access to experimental halls as well as stock footage .
To not rap would have been a wasted opportunity . ”
The dancing and rapping segments were filmed on location at CERN and in the LHC ’s underground areas .
While actors , musicians and even a dance troupe had visited the LHC , this was the first time it had starred in a rap video .
“ The response was dubious when we were trying to get permission to film and intrigued once people found out what we were up to , ” she said .
McAlpine ’s newest venture has been attracting much more attention than she expected – she 's been interviewed by the BBC , and in the video 's first dozen hours on YouTube it attracted more than 1,300 views .
" You know what the status was eight hours after uploading N3UROCH ! P [ her first rap ] ?
14 people had seen it , " she added .
While alpinekat has n’t yet signed with a record label , she ’s already planning her next physics rap .
According to an Associated Press investigation , Gov. Sarah Palin ’s signature accomplishment — a contract to build a 1,715 - mile pipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the Lower 48 — emerged from a flawed bidding process that narrowed the field to a company with ties to her administration , an Associated Press investigation shows .
Beginning at the Republican National Convention in August , the McCain - Palin ticket has touted the pipeline as an example of how it would help America achieve energy independence .
“ We ’re building a nearly $ 40 billion natural gas pipeline , which is North America ’s largest and most expensive infrastructure project ever , to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets , ” Palin said during the Oct. 2 vice presidential debate .
Despite Palin ’s boast of a smart and fair bidding process , the AP found that her team crafted terms that favored only a few independent pipeline companies and ultimately benefited the winner , TransCanada Corp .
And contrary to the ballyhoo , there ’s no guarantee the pipeline will ever be built ; at a minimum , any project is years away , as TransCanada must first overcome major financial and regulatory hurdles .
In interviews and a review of records , the AP found :
_ Instead of creating a process that would attract many potential builders , Palin slanted the terms away from an important group — the global energy giants that own the rights to the gas .
_ Despite promises and legal guidance not to talk directly with potential bidders , Palin had meetings or phone calls with nearly every major candidate , including TransCanada .
_ The leader of Palin ’s pipeline team had been a partner at a lobbying firm where she worked on behalf of a TransCanada subsidiary .
Also , that woman ’s former business partner at the lobbying firm was TransCanada ’s lead private lobbyist on the pipeline deal , interacting with legislators in the weeks before the vote to grant TransCanada the contract .
Plus , a former TransCanada executive served as an outside consultant to Palin ’s pipeline team .
_ Under a different set of rules four years earlier , TransCanada had offered to build the pipeline without a state subsidy ; under Palin , the company could receive a maximum $ 500 million .
“ Governor Palin held firmly to her fundamental belief that Alaska could best serve Alaskans and the nation ’s interests by pursuing a competitive approach to building a natural gas pipeline , ” said McCain - Palin spokesman Taylor Griffin .
“ There was an open and transparent process that subjected the decision to extensive public scrutiny and due diligence . ”
___
ONLY ONE VIABLE BIDDER
There were never more than a few players that could execute such a complex undertaking — at least a million tons of steel stretching across some of Earth ’s most hostile and remote terrain .
TransCanada estimates it will cost $ 26 billion ; Palin ’s consultants estimate nearly $ 40 billion .
The pipeline would run from Alaska ’s North Slope to Alberta in Canada ; secondary supply lines would take the gas to various points in the United States and Canada .
The pipeline would carry 4.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily , about 8 percent of the present U.S. market .
Building such a pipeline had been a dream for decades .
The rising cost and demand for energy injected new urgency into the proposal .
So too did the depletion of Alaska ’s long - reliable reserves of oil , which are trapped in the same Arctic Circle reservoirs as clean - burning natural gas .
Not only does that oil provide jobs , it pays for an annual dividend check to nearly every Alaska resident .
This year ’s payment was $ 2,069 , 25 percent higher than 2007 — plus a $ 1,200 bonus rebate to help offset higher energy costs .
Palin was elected as governor two years ago in part because of her populist appeal .
Promising “ New Energy for Alaska , ” she vowed to take on Exxon Mobil Corp. , ConocoPhillips and BP , the multinational energy companies that long dominated the state ’s biggest industry .
Oil interests were particularly unpopular at that moment : Federal agents had recently raided the offices of six lawmakers in a Justice Department investigation into whether an Alaska oil services company paid bribes in exchange for promoting a new taxing formula that would ultimately further the multinationals ’ pipeline plans .
Palin ousted fellow Republican Gov. Frank Murkowski , who pushed a pipeline deal he negotiated in secret with the “ Big Three ” energy companies .
That deal went nowhere .
With Alaskans eager for progress and sour on Big Oil , Palin tackled the pipeline issue with gusto , meeting with representatives from all sides and assembling her own team of experts to draw up terms .
Palin invited bidders to submit applications and offered the multimillion - dollar subsidy .
Members of Palin ’s team say that without the incentive , it might not have received any bids for the risky undertaking .
___
TIES THAT BIND
Palin ’s team was led by Marty Rutherford , a widely respected energy specialist who entered the upper levels of state government nearly 20 years ago .
Rutherford solidified her status when , in 2005 , she joined an exodus of Department of Natural Resources staff who felt Murkowski was selling out to the oil giants .
What the Palin administration did n’t tell legislators — and neglected to mention in its announcement of Rutherford ’s appointment — was that in 2003 , Rutherford left public service and worked for 10 months at the Anchorage - based Jade North lobbying firm .
There she did $ 40,200 worth of work for Foothills Pipe Lines Alaska , Inc. , a subsidiary of TransCanada .
Foothills Pipe Lines Alaska Inc. paid Rutherford for expertise on topics including state legislation and funding related to gas commercialization , according to her 2003 lobbyist registration statement .
Palin has said she was n’t bothered by that past work because it had occurred several years before .
But Rutherford would n’t have passed her new boss ’ own standards :
Under ethics reforms the governor pushed through , Rutherford would have had to wait a year to jump from government service to a lobbying firm .
Rutherford also has downplayed her work for Foothills .
“ I did a couple of projects for them , small projects , ” she told a state Senate committee examining the TransCanada bid earlier this year .
While a partner , Rutherford said , she “ realized that my heart was not in the private sector , it was in the public sector , and I sold out for the same amount of money I bought in for . ”
At one point , Palin ’s pipeline team debated Rutherford ’s role , but concluded there was no problem .
“ We were looking at it in terms of is this an actual conflict or is there the appearance of impropriety of Marty ’s participation , ” said Pat Galvin , the commissioner of the Revenue Department and another top team member .
“ It was determined that there was none , and so we moved forward . ”
Patricia Bielawski , Rutherford ’s former partner at Jade North , spent last summer in Juneau , the state capital , serving as TransCanada ’s lead private lobbyist on the pipeline deal .
While the Legislature debated — and ultimately approved — the TransCanada deal , Bielawski met with lawmakers and sat in on the public proceedings , several legislators said .
Bielawski told AP earlier this month that Rutherford ’s employment at her firm was irrelevant .
She said Rutherford never directly lobbied the Legislature for Foothills , and that Rutherford broke no rules based on 2003 state ethics guidelines .
“ There ’s no statutory or regulatory prohibition that extends to things that many years ago , ” Bielawski said .
“ So there ’s no issue . ”
But others say it ’s a legitimate question .
“ I ’m not saying someone ’s getting paid off for a sweetheart contract , but it ’s very hard to ignore that this is your former partner and your former client standing there before you , ” said Republican Sen .
Lyda Green , a Palin critic who in August was among the handful of lawmakers who voted against awarding TransCanada the license .
“ Every time it was mentioned to the governor or to the commission , it was like , ‘ How could you question such a wonderful person ? ' ”
Tony Palmer , the TransCanada vice president who leads the company ’s Alaska gas pipeline effort , rejects the suggestion that his company benefited .
“ We have gained clearly no advantage from anything that Ms. Rutherford did for Foothills some five years ago on a very much unrelated topic , ” he said .
Rutherford did not respond to interview requests made directly to her and through the governor ’s office .
But Griffin , the spokesman for the McCain - Palin campaign , said Rutherford “ had no decision - making role or authority , ” and contended that such matters were handled by others on the Palin pipeline team .
TransCanada also had a connection to the team hired by the Palin administration to analyze the bid .
Patrick Anderson , a former TransCanada executive , served as an outside consultant and ultimately helped the state conclude that TransCanada ’s technical solution for shipping gas through freezing temperatures would work .

NARROW SET OF RULES
In January 2007 , Palin spoke the first of at least two times to Vice President Dick Cheney , the Bush administration ‘s point person on energy issues , according to calendars obtained by the AP through a public records request .
Cheney ’s staff pressed the Palin administration to draw in the energy companies , said current and former state officials involved in those discussions .
As the governor ’s approach unfolded in the spring of 2007 , there were signs it was skewed in a different direction .
Palin said she saw problems if the firms that own the gas also owned the pipeline .
They could manipulate the market or charge prohibitive fees to smaller exploration firms , discouraging competition .
Several important requirements in the legislation were unpalatable to the big oil companies .
In the talks under Murkowski , the firms asked that the rates for the gas production tax and royalties be fixed for 45 years ; Palin refused to consider setting rates for that long .
Under the Palin process , the pipeline firms had an advantage because they simply pass along taxes paid by oil and gas producers .
Oil company officials warned lawmakers they would n’t participate under those terms .
Still , in a near unanimous vote , the Legislature passed the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act in May 2007 , generally as written by Palin ’s pipeline team .
Once the state issued its request for proposals on July 2 , 2007 , the level of communication between the government and potential bidders was supposed to decrease drastically , so that no one would be accused of gaining unfair advantage .
State lawyers advised public officials to keep their distance , and bidders were told to submit questions on a Web site where answers could be seen by all .
Several of the state ’s gas line team members interviewed by AP said they had no contact with possible bidders .
But Palin had conversations with executives at most of the major potential bidders during that period , according to her calendars .
While the calendars do n’t detail what was discussed , the documents indicate that the pipeline was the subject of the discussions , or that the conversations occurred immediately after a briefing with Palin ’s pipeline team .
When she was in Michigan for a National Governors Association summit in late July 2007 , Palin and her team met executives from Williams Co. , a pipeline builder that ended up not bidding .
“ The purpose of the meeting was to more fully understand the details of the project , which we were still evaluating at the time , ” company spokeswoman Julie Gentz said in a statement .
TransCanada ’s Palmer described communication with state officials as nonexistent .
According to the governor ’s official schedule , however , Palin called TransCanada President and CEO Hal Kvisle on Aug. 8 , 2007 .
Asked about that call , Palmer said it was to clarify the bidding process .
Griffin said that in keeping with legal guidance , Palin never spoke in any of the meetings about the competitive bidding process .
By the Nov. 30 submission deadline , there were five applications .
But the state disqualified four for failing to satisfy the bill ’s requirements .
That left TransCanada .
The Canadian giant had been pursuing an Alaska pipeline since at least 2004 , when the company negotiated a deal with Rutherford that the state ended up shelving .
While the details remain confidential , six people familiar with the terms told the AP that TransCanada was willing to do the work then without the large state subsidy .
In testimony this July before the state Senate , Rutherford herself confirmed such a willingness , but described the 2004 deal as presenting a different set of trade - offs .
A state lawyer warned her not to say more , lest she violate a confidentiality agreement .
Others who reviewed the deal think much of the $ 500 million will be wasted money .
“ Most definitely TransCanada got a sweetheart deal this time , ” said Republican Sen. Bert Stedman , who voted against the TransCanada license .
“ Where else could you get a $ 500 million reimbursement when you do n’t even have the financing to build the pipeline ? ”
The next president and vice president of the United States are supposed to go to Washingtone and clean up the den of thieves .
The American people are tired of all pork barrel projects and underhanded dealings which only benefit a select few and leave out the average American .
Sarah Palin is supposed to be a reformer , but she would fit right in if John McCain were elected president .
At TicosLand.com we wonder , is she really true to her message ?
In Costa Rica and all over the world , we are wondering who would actually go to Washington and at least try to change the way things are done ?

It ’s not just families that are getting together for Thanksgiving .
The three brightest objects in the night sky -- Venus , Jupiter and a crescent moon -- will crowd in for an unusual group shot .
Starting tonight , Jupiter and Venus will begin moving closer together , so that by Sunday and Monday they will appear 2 degrees apart .
That ’s about a finger width held out at arm ’s length , said Alan M. MacRobert , senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine .
On Monday night , they will be joined by a crescent moon , he said .
Look in the southwestern sky around twilight -- no telescope or binoculars needed .
The show will even be visible in cities if it ’s a clear night .
“ It ’ll be a head - turner , ” MacRobert said .
“ This certainly is an unusual coincidence for the crescent moon to be right there in the days when [ Venus and Jupiter ] are going to be closest together . ”

The next time the three will be as close and visible as this week will be Nov. 18 , 2052 , according to Jack Horkheimer , director of the Miami Space Transit Planetarium and host of “ Star Gazer ” on PBS .
This is the second year I 've been lucky enough to take part in the cross- platform software engineering conference JAOO .
Like last year , I was very fortunate to get to sit down with a few key players in the programming languages design field and watch several technical presentations that span the industry and problems we face as software developers .
One of the truly great things about JAOO is that it is not a product - focused conference : it 's about programming first and foremost and enables the sharing of perspectives and ideas among the world 's best and brightest programming minds .
As you can imagine , I , like many technical types here at Microsoft , am a huge fan of JAOO .
Thank you Trifork !!!
In this conversation Microsoft Technical Fellow and Chief Architect of C# Anders Hejlsberg sits down with programming language design legend and computer scientist Guy Steele ( creator of Scheme and expert in several languages ranging from LISP to Java ) .
I think Guy is one of the smartest people I 've ever met .
The topic of conversation is the elephant in the modern general purpose programmer 's living room : Concurrency .
With today 's widely - used general purpose languages like C++ , Java , C# , VB , Ruby etc it 's hard to express parallelism in productive ways .
Anders et al are working on both language enhancements to C# and VB.
NET and BCL support ( Parallel Extensions to . NET for example ) .
Today , Guy is working on a mathematical language ( domain specific as opposed to general purpose ) and runtime , Fortress , that is so concurrent it makes it hard for programmers to even write sequential code !
Listen in to two of the programming industry 's most successful thinkers and get a sense of their perspectives on the future of general purpose programming languages now that Concurrency and Parallelism are entering the development status quo .
Enjoy .
More JAOO coverage to come .

Central banks around the world have unleashed a new assault on the global economic downturn , with Wednesday 's interest - rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve accompanied by cuts in China and Norway and several other central banks expected to follow suit .
The Federal Reserve , already more than a year into a rate - cutting campaign that has been ...
I can’t believe a new feature from Google is n’t getting more notice , because it converts already - existing links to your site into much higher quality links , for free .
The Google webmaster blog just announced that you can find the pages that link to 404 pages on your site .
Let me back up and give you a little history .
When someone comes to your site ’s webserver and asks for a page that does n’t exist , like http://www.mattcutts.com/asdfasdfasdf , most web servers are configured to return an HTTP status code of 404 , which means that the page was “ Not Found . ”
If someone links to a page on your site that does n’t exist , most webservers give a pretty sucky experience : visitors usually land on a pretty useless page , and search engines might not give you full credit for those 404 errors .
Now Google ’s webmaster portal lets you see who is linking to your 404 pages .
Once you register your site , click on Diagnostics , then Web crawl , and select “ Not found ” .
You ’ll see something like this :
See that red oval ?
If I click on it , I ’ll see all the urls that link to that 404 page :
Why would you care about this ?
The simple reason is that if someone is linking to a non-existent page on your site , it can be a bad experience for users ( not to mention that you might not be getting credit for that link with search engines unless you ’re doing extra work ) .
Some of the easiest links you ’ll ever get are when people tried to link to you and just messed up .
It would be trivial to mail some of these people and say “ Hey , I noticed you linked to my site ( thank you ! ) but the link is broken , so users will get a 404 page .
Would you mind changing your link on page A to point to the right page , which is url B ? ”
When the other site fixes their link , their visitors find your site directly , plus all search engines can follow those links and give you credit for them .
Converting 404 links to links to the right pages converts sucky links to free direct text links for all .
You can also download this data as a convenient CSV file .
Just click on Diagnostics , then Web crawl , and then click on “ Download all sources of errors on this site . ”
P.S. Here ’s a bonus tip : if your webserver does cruddy things on 404 pages , Google ’s webmaster portal will help you create better 404 pages with about 14 lines of JavaScript that you can copy / paste into your 404 page template .
Because it ’s just some code to add to the HTML template for your 404 page , it works for Apache or IIS .
TERRI KRIVOSHA , a partner at a Minneapolis law firm , logs three miles each workday on a treadmill without leaving her desk .
She finds it easier to exercise while she types than to attend aerobics classes at the crack of dawn .
Brad Rhoads , a computer programmer and missionary in Princeton , Ill. , faces a computer monitor on a file cabinet and gets in about five miles a day on a treadmill while working in his home office .
“ After a while , your legs do get kind of tired , ” said Mr. Rhoads , 40 , who started exercising in March , when doctors advised him to lose weight after open - heart surgery .
Ms. Krivosha and Mr. Rhoads are part of a small but growing group of desk jockeys who were inspired by Dr. James Levine , an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic .
In 2005 , Dr. Levine led a study showing that lean people burn about 350 more calories a day than those who are overweight , by doing ordinary things like fidgeting , pacing or walking to the copier .
Introduction and Specifications
In the conclusion of our coverage of the Radeon HD 4850 and 4870 launch , we made this statement , " ... dare we say a $ 300 graphics card represents an excellent value , from a price point perspective ?
These cards are definitely going to put significant price pressure on NVIDIA 's GTX 200 series . "
At the time , the GeForce GTX 280 and GTX 260 were selling for upwards of $ 650 and $ 400 respectively , and ATI 's newly released Radeon , which performed somewhat better than the GTX 260 , was introduced at " only " $ 299 .
Of course , NVIDIA quickly responded with a hefty round of price cuts that brought the GTX 280's price down considerably and put the GTX 260 and Radeon HD 4870 on roughly equal footing , but it turns out NVIDIA was n't quite done .
Today NVIDIA is introducing an updated GeForce GTX 260 card with more stream processors and texture filtering units than its predecessor .
The name of the new GPU is the GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 , due to the GPU 's allotment of 216 stream processors -- up from 192 in the first - gen GeForce GTX 260 .
We 've got a couple of the new GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 cards in - house from EVGA and Zotac , and plan to show you what they 're made of on the pages ahead .
For now , let 's check out the specs and get some of the particulars out of the way .
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 Specifications and Features
General Precautions :
If it seems too good too be true , it likely is !
If you 're dealing with someone for the first time , do n't be afraid to ask and check references .
But remember , references are easy to fake .
Be wary if all references come from the same service provider ( this is especially true of AOL ) or from free mail services ( such as hotmail.com , yahoo.com , etc. )
Always ask for a phone number and if you 're uneasy about a transaction , give them a call .
It 's a lot easier to scam someone through e-mail than over the phone .
Always send packages insured .
It protects both the buyer , seller , or trader .
Communication , COMMUNICATION , COMMUNICATION !!!
This is the number one thing to keep in mind when buying , selling or trading online .
Save all e-mail messages and PM box history .
If a future problem arises , these e-mail messages may prove invaluable in proving the conditions of the transaction .
It 's not a good idea to post personal information , such as your address or phone number , or the other party 's personal information , on the Internet .
Although there are a lot of great people online , there are also people who would use the information maliciously .

Just when I think I can predict a disease ’s deadly outcome , along comes someone to remind me how little we truly know about cancer .
Sometimes , a patient survives against all probability , and I am left not knowing why .
“ Sal Wittgen ” ( not his real name ) was a poet .
When I first saw him in my examination room , I noticed his shock of white hair and the wild look in his eye .
Back in 1994 , I discovered his liver tests were elevated then found he had hepatitis C , using the new blood test that had just become available .
His ultrasound showed that his liver had the beginnings of cirrhosis .
A liver specialist prescribed the anti-viral treatment alpha interferon , but it made him fatigued and he quickly stopped it .
In 1997 , when Sal was feeling fairly well , I sent him for a routine ultrasound of his abdomen that showed a mass in the liver .
A liver biopsy revealed hepatocellular carcinoma , a vicious type of cancer that is very difficult to cure .
Its five - year survival rate with conventional chemotherapy was only 4 % .
I suggested a liver transplant .
Advertisement
I wo n’t survive it , Sal insisted .
Instead , he chose what was then a new kind of treatment : chemoembolization , in which chemotherapy is administered through the artery that feeds the tumor and then the artery is destroyed .
Since 1997 , this treatment has been used effectively for more than 1 million patients in more than 30 countries .
But back in 1997 , no one knew how well it would work .
His tumor shrank in response to the treatment , and though I kept waiting for the cancer to regrow and spread , his follow - up CT scans continued to be negative .
But the hepatitis C virus continued to eat away at his liver .
Enough of poisons , Sal said .
Instead , he turned to a heretical alternative medicine physician , Emanuel Revici , who was 100 years old and still practicing medicine .
Advertisement
Revici was born in Romania in 1896 .
He received a medical degree from the University of Bucharest in 1920 .
He moved to Paris , then Mexico City , where he began experimenting with drugs to treat cancer , then to New York in 1947 , where he started the Institute of Applied Biology and conducted experimental cancer research .
Professional cancer societies soon began to consider him anything but a scientist .
In the 1980s , he received more than a dozen patents for chemical formulations to use on cancer patients .
But New York state soon challenged and restricted his medical license , and found him guilty of professional misconduct in 1988 .
Sal was very impressed with Revici ’s philosophy of healing and his belief that cancer was due to an imbalance of fat in the body .
Rather than crediting the lasting effects of that single chemoembolization , Sal began to credit the Revici purges and enemas and mystery combo chemicals for prolonging his life .
As time went on , I began to wonder if Sal really was in remission .
Looking at his bloated belly on the examining table and smelling the ammonia - laced breath from his liver failure , it was difficult to believe he was doing better .
But CT and MRI scans continued to show that he was clear of cancer .
Advertisement
I feel better than I look , Sal said .
Revici’s “ guided chemotherapy ” was based on a urine analysis followed by a secret formula made of some combination of alcohols , caffeine , zinc , lithium , iron , selenium , magnesium , sulfur and fatty acids .
A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. in 1965 found that of 33 patients who were referred to Revici after they failed conventional treatment , 22 died , eight showed no improvement and the remaining three showed progression of disease .
But Sal had faith .
He believed it was difficult to scientifically study Revici ’s methods because each patient was different .
And certainly , it is true that response to a particular cancer treatment is often unpredictable , even with standard chemotherapy .
Genetics clearly play a role in this variability in response : Tumors may look the same from outside , but they can arise from variations in many different genes , making them more or less responsive to drug A , drug B or drug C .
For example , a study from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard , published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine , reported a genetic pattern in liver tissue that correlates with survival and lack of recurrence of liver tumors .
Advertisement
As long as I keep writing my poems and see a great healer like Revici , I will stay alive , Sal said to me on several occasions .
There is little scientific evidence to support this idea , though plenty of popular books that espouse it .
In 1986 , alternative medicine guru Dr. Bernie Siegel ( no relation ) wrote in his book “ Love , Medicine , and Miracles ” : “ When a human being suffers an emotional loss that is not properly dealt with , the body often responds by developing a new growth . ”
Siegel saw people ’s cancers as challenges that a proper healer could help them vanquish with the help of positive emotions .
But a follow - up study of Siegel ’s patients published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 1993 found that women with breast cancer who went through his program died at the same rate as those who had n’t .
Sal ’s case would seem to run counter to conventional science .
Was this just luck ?
In all studies of cancer , there are some patients who simply survive no matter how grim the prognosis .
Advertisement
Did that single chemoembolization save him or did he have a genetic predisposition to remission ?
Patients such as Sal fuel the myths of the Siegels and Revicis of the world without providing any real evidence to support their fringe treatments .
I am intrigued that Sal appeared to respond to the quackery dispensed by that aging huckster and his followers , but in the end , I stop far short of believing in it or recommending it to anyone else .
In late 2005 , when Sal was finally admitted to the local Veterans Affairs hospital for a serious infection and out - of - control diabetes , obscured in the unpleasantness of his dying was the miracle of his cancer remission .

When you learn that your opponent is unbeatable , you ought to adjust your strategies .
On April 29 , 2007 , a team of computer scientists at the University of Alberta announced that they had solved the game of checkers ( 8 x 8 draughts ) .
Human checkers players no longer have any hope of defeating this program and regaining the World Checkers Championship title , which the program has held since 1994 .
The Chinook Project , as it is called , began in 1989 .
Multiple computers worked around the clock , analyzing opening variations and pushing the analysis deep into the middle game in order to produce a database that proves that checkers , assuming perfect play by both sides , is a draw .
[ 1]
The Chinook checkers program refers to this proof - tree database during the opening and middle game ; it simply refers to its database and finds the correct reply , which has been calculated in advance .
The Chinook program also makes use of an endgame database that contains the win / loss / draw result for 39 trillion positions with 10 pieces or fewer left on the board .
In order to reduce the needed disk space , the Chinook program does have to " think " for itself in some variations between the opening proof tree and the endgame database , but all variations in which calculation is necessary lead to either a forced win or a forced draw .
Economists of the Austrian School have been analyzing the science of human action in a somewhat analogous manner to the Chinook Project , for over 200 years .
Austrian economists have been using an a priori deductive approach to develop a mature body of economic theory since Menger wrote his Grundsätze in 1871 .
As with researchers of the Chinook Project , Austrian - school economists ( more precisely Misesian Austrians ) begin their analysis at a known true starting position — in the Austrian case , with the axiom that " humans act . "
According to Murray Rothbard ,
It is this fundamental truth — this axiom of human action — that forms the key to our study .
The entire realm of praxeology and its best developed subdivision , economics , is based on an analysis of the necessary logical implications of this concept .
The whole of economic theory can be deduced from the fundamental axiom of human action , together with a few subsidiary postulates :
What are these propositions ?
We may consider them in decreasing order of their generality : ( 1 ) the most fundamental — variety of resources , both natural and human .
From this follows directly the division of labor , the market , etc. ; ( 2 ) less important , that leisure is a consumer good .
These are actually the only postulates needed .
Two other postulates simply introduce limiting subdivisions into the analysis .
Thus , economics can deductively elaborate from the Fundamental Axiom and Postulates ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ( actually , only Postulate 1 is necessary ) an analysis of Crusoe economics , of barter , and of a monetary economy .
All these elaborated laws are absolutely true .
Rothbard ’s two additional postulates are that " indirect exchanges are being made " and " that every firm aims always at maximizing its psychic profit . "
Like checkers players who now face an unbeatable opponent , politicians also face an infallible and timeless foe — economic law .
Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk dealt with this problem in his posthumously published essay , " Control or Economic Law . "
In this essay , he emphasizes ,
It [ power ] can never effect anything in contradiction to the economic laws of value , price and distribution ; it must always be in conformity with these ; it cannot invalidate them ; it can merely confirm and fulfill them .
In conclusion , Böhm - Bawerk reminds the reader that " the influence of social control does , and must operate through the formulas and laws of pure economic theory . "
The rulers of the Soviet Union played a known losing strategy and , as Mises predicted , eventually lost .
In 1920 , Mises wrote :
Without economic calculation there can be no economy .
Hence , in a socialist state wherein the pursuit of economic calculation is impossible , there can be — in our sense of the term — no economy whatsoever .
In trivial and secondary matters rational conduct might still be possible , but in general it would be impossible to speak of rational production any more .
There would be no means of determining what was rational , and hence it is obvious that production could never be directed by economic considerations .
In America , President Herbert Hoover played a losing move when he signed the Smoot - Hawley Tariff into law .
Against the recommendation of " almost all the nation 's economists , " the enactment of this legislation helped to usher in an era of protectionist policies that would continue and escalate under the Roosevelt administration .
Today , many economists consider the Smoot - Hawley Tariff a major contributing factor to the Great Depression becoming deeper and more protracted than it otherwise might have been .
Today , politicians will soon be enacting " change " in Washington , but this change will lead the country in either one of two directions .
Change in one direction leads toward socialism ; change in the other direction leads to laissez - faire capitalism .
But , does a " third way " exist ?
Fortunately , a great mind has already devoted attention to this issue .
Ludwig von Mises , in a speech given to the University Club of New York on April 18 , 1950 , addressed this very topic .
This essay , Middle - of - the - Road Policy Leads to Socialism , provides the definitive answer that no such " third way " exists :
" The middle - of - the - road policy is not an economic system that can last .
It is a method for the realization of socialism by installments . "
Economic law is immutable ; it will have its way for better or for worse .
Politicians would do well to align public policy with what is natural , true , and unbeatable .
These reports are in German , but I believe they are saying the German government has guaranteed all deposits ( update : apparently all deposits by private individuals ) .
From Reuters : Staat übernimmt Garantie für Einlagen
From Focus : Bund sichert private Spareinlagen komplett
This is probably related to the collapse of the bailout for Hypo .
Executives at the bank , which is Germany ’s second largest commercial property investor and has extensive holdings across Europe , are now locked in crisis talks with the German government and central bank in an attempt to deliver an alternative plan before the stock markets open on Monday .
The German Finance Ministry has urged the private sector consortium to rethink its decision .
The collapse of the € 35 billion ( £ 27.3 billion ) bail - out will provide an immediate test to the pledge made on Saturday by leaders from the biggest European Union countries that they will ensure that no major European financial institution will be allowed to fail .
Silicon Valley insiders call it the O’Reilly Radar : Tim O’Reilly ’s uncanny ability to spot a technology revolution before it happens .
But lately the entrepreneur , investor and book publisher has been busier trying to incite the next one .
He is urging young entrepreneurs and engineers to stop making some of the sillier software that lets Facebook users throw virtual sheep at their friends or download virtual beer on iPhones , and instead start making a real difference in the world .
He says it ’s not just the right thing to do , but also the smart thing to do -- especially as the credit crunch spreads to Silicon Valley , venture financing becomes scarce and start - ups have to retrench .
When this grizzled , 54 - year - old tech - industry veteran talks , Silicon Valley tends to listen , if only to argue with him .
Advertisement
After all , this is the guy who understood the power and significance of the Internet before most people were aware it existed .
In 1992 , he published “ The Whole Internet User ’s Guide & Catalog , ” the first popular book about the medium , which was later selected by the New York Public Library as one of the most significant books of the 20th century .
He now runs O’Reilly Media , an influential book publishing empire in Sebastopol , Calif. , which has snagged a significant share of the computer book market with series such as “ The Missing Manual ” and “ Hacks . ”
Early this decade , O’Reilly helped coin the term “ Web 2.0 " to refer to the current phase of the Internet , which relies on collective intelligence and action from the bottom up ( think social networks such as Facebook and photo - sharing sites such as Flickr ) .
He is perhaps best known for putting on packed conferences headlined by some of the tech industry ’s brightest .
Now he is using those conferences as a bully pulpit .
Advertisement
The theme of his Web 2.0 conference here next month is “ Web meets world . ”
It will showcase activists such as former Vice President Al Gore , cyclist - philanthropist Lance Armstrong and Larry Brilliant , who , as head of Google.org , has reinvented philanthropy by setting up a foundation without tax - exempt status to invest in for - profit and nonprofit efforts .
O’Reilly argues that Silicon Valley has strayed from the passion and idealism that fuel innovation to instead follow what he calls the “ mad pursuit of the buck with stupider and stupider ideas . ”
Flush with money and opportunity following the post - dot - com resurgence , he says , some entrepreneurs have cocooned in a “ reality bubble , ” insulated from poverty , disease , global warming and other problems that are gripping the planet .
He argues that they should follow the model of some of the world ’s most successful technology companies , including Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. , which sprang from their founders ’ efforts to “ work on stuff that matters . ”
Not everyone is convinced that business is the right vehicle to tackle social or environmental ills .
But Jim Schorr , who lectures on social entrepreneurship at UC Berkeley ’s Haas School of Business , says he can’t imagine “ a higher calling for the next generation of tech entrepreneurs . ”
Advertisement
“ The opportunity to focus technology and tech entrepreneurs on the unaddressed , underserved segments of society is enormous , ” Schorr said .
“ Developing and extending technologies with limited profit potential , using market - driven approaches , can deliver both social and financial impact and sustainability . ”
Though the Web 2.0 generation has a reputation for indulgence and narcissism , O’Reilly can point to a number of ventures using Silicon Valley ingenuity to deliver on Schorr ’s ideal .
The Omidyar Network , created by EBay Inc. founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife , Pam , makes grants to and investments in worthy causes .
Benentech.org , started by former rocket scientist Jim Fruchterman , creates software for human rights activists , environmentalists and people with disabilities .
The Wildlife Conservation Network -- started by software engineer Charles Knowles , conservationist John Lukas and Akiko Yamazaki , wife of Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang -- uses technology and a venture capital model to help save endangered species .
Advertisement
A growing number of businesses are turning to social networking tools to encourage people to get more politically active and drum up donations for charities .
Causes , started by Sean Parker and Joe Green , created the popular Causes application on Facebook and MySpace .
Its 14.5 million users have created 110,000 campaigns .
O’Reilly also singles out two other Web 2.0 stars for providing social benefit .
Twitter , an instant digital communications service , has helped coordinate disaster response .
YouTube , the video sharing website now owned by Google , has helped activists fight repressive regimes in other countries .
“ Simply providing technology that can be used for positive causes can have an enormous impact , ” he said .
So how has O’Reilly ’s message gone over with the Web 2.0 crowd ?
Advertisement
“ I ’ve had a whole bunch of people tell me they were super - inspired , ” O’Reilly said .
“ I ’ve had a few people act like I am raining on their parade . ”
Michael Arrington , founder of the influential technology blog TechCrunch , says he appreciates the effort to get entrepreneurs and engineers to consider doing more , such as volunteering in schools to teach kids how to program computers .
But he says O’Reilly ’s lament trivializes the good work done by Silicon Valley .
“ It ’s good to be aware that there are big problems out there that could be very profitable for companies to solve , ” Arrington said .
“ That does n’t mean that entrepreneurs who do n’t decide to tackle those problems are n’t valuable to society . ”
O’Reilly says he respects those contributions -- and makes a nice living showcasing them in his books and conferences .
But , he says , “ we have a tech generation that thinks that ’s all there is . ”
Advertisement
“ The real Web 2.0 , the web of collective intelligence applications , is going to be stronger as a result of any downturn , ” he said .
“ Heck , figuring out more transparent financial markets alone will be a hotbed of opportunity . ”

Anti-gays rise ' above the hate ' ( that they started )
by Jeremy Hooper
But do n't you dare think these folks are encouraging hate .
In fact , they are " above the hate . "
Do n't believe us ?
Well , consider this :
In a move that quite literally constitutes the LEAST they could to prove their " peace - loving " ways , the aforementioned folks have put themselves down among the first 43 signers to a web petition called " Above The Hate , " which they say was created so anti-gay folks can " stand together to say " Enough ! " to the campaign of hate and intimidation being waged against the LDS Church and other supporters of California 's Proposition 8 . "
Here , Focus on the Family will fill you in more :
The National Organization for Marriage has launched a petition drive in response to incendiary attacks from gay activists in California and around the U.S. AboveTheHate.com has collected nearly 1,500 signatures of people thanking the Mormon Church for its support of Prop.
8 , California 's marriage - protection amendment
Good News : Hundreds Thank Mormon Church for Supporting Marriage [ CitizenLink ]
You know , because it's not the climate of fear , misinformation , persecution , discrimination , and harassment that they have dedicated their lives to fostering that makes people hate .
No , no --
It 's the marriage - deprived gays who are sick and tired of having their civil equality stifled by faith .
Why it 's a wonder these folks are able to get out of bed every morning knowing that there are loads of gays out there standing up for the " radical " idea that they have a right to share their own beds with the person they truly love !

Sometimes I just do n't feel worthy of all the interest they direct at us .
They spend so much of their time and money on us .
I wish I knew how I could return the favor with equal zeal .
Any ideas ?

Nope , sorry ... MILK did it , we can do it .... This from neat ' report ' on MILK , not really review .

( In l983 she had interviewed him about AIDS : " and he read me a list from a green notebook of 37 friends who had died . " )
“ DON ’T WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE RIGHTS ? ” he e-mailed back , blessedly cantankerous .
“ I AM ASHAMED OF YOU THAT YOU HAD TO ASK ME THAT QUESTION . ”
That 's us ' blessedly cantakerous ' and more so every minute .
The HOLY ROLLERS can take their Victorian morals right back to England ... and let us get on with making this a better country .

The thing about Maggie Gallagher is that while she bends over backwards to avoid making arguments that are founded in obvious bigotry , she has no problem ( and how could she , since she'd be standing alone otherwise ) associating herself with some of the most despicable elements of the anti-marriage equality folks .
Second only to the actual concrete benefits , the thing I 'm most looking forward to about achieving full marriage equality in the US is that she 'll have to get a real job and we wo n't have to think about her and her daffy arguments ever again .

Did anyone else notice that Jim Garlow is listed twice ?
He 's toward the top of the list as Dr. Jim Garlow and toward the bottom of the list as just Jim Garlow .
Is that a typo , or did he really sign twice ?
Posted by : Michael | Nov 25 , 2008 11:07:54 AM
Michael : Garlow 's name does appear twice on the website , so it 's not Jeremy 's typo .

I am definitely boycotting the companies whose owners helped back Prop 8 .
I found some info on wiki about Stuart Matis , a homosexual in the Mormon community who committed suicide .
Read his words below .
I 'm not just fighting for the rights of the LGBT community that is with us today .
I 'm fighting for people like Stuart Matis who are n't with us anymore .
Stuart Matis , a celibate homosexual , stated " Straight members have absolutely no idea what it is like to grow up gay in this church .
It is a life of constant torment , self - hatred and internalized homophobia . " [ 74 ]
Stuart later committed suicide at an LDS chapel in Los Altos , California . [ 75 ]
After two of his gay friends also committed suicide , Affirmation members began to hold suicide vigils around the country to raise awareness about suicide prevention and the destructive consequences of homophobia .
Suicide victims are posted on its website . [ 76 ]
Matis ' story is described in the book In Quiet Desperation : Understanding the Challenge of Same - Gender Attraction [ 77 ] and was later inspired and created into the play " Missa Solemnis or The Play About Henry " written by non-Mormon playwright Roman Feeser . [ 78 ]

Barack Obama has begun advertising on billboards within the virtual world of an online video game in what appears to be a first for a presidential campaign .
Players of the online racing video game Burnout Paradise on the Xbox 360 Live network noticed billboards promoting Barack Obama and the website VoteForChange.com , which helps people determine how to register to vote and where to vote .
This was later confirmed by a representative for the game 's publisher , Electronic Arts , who said :
" Like most television , radio and print outlets , we accept advertising from credible political candidates .
Like political spots on the television networks , these ads do not reflect the political policies of EA or the opinions of its development teams . "

Voters split in many ways on gay marriage ban Tight battle over Prop. 8 highlights differences in geography , age , religion , race and ideology

Nearly 100 people gathered in a deserted parking lot under a gray Central Valley sky , ready to knock on doors and tell perfect strangers why they should vote to ban same - sex marriage in California .
" Just be friendly and say what you know is important , " Bill Doughty , a volunteer organizer for the Yes on 8 campaign , told the crowd .
Stockton is only 90 miles east of San Francisco , but the Central Valley is worlds apart from coastal California , and the tight ballot battle over same - sex marriage highlights the distinction .
" There 's an increasing divide between the coastal view of the political world and the Central Valley 's view , and you can see that in Proposition 8 , " said Mark DiCamillo , director of the Field Poll .
" But the same - sex marriage question splits voters in a lot of ways , by party , by religion , by age , by region . "
In a Field Poll in June that showed Prop. 8 losing statewide , only 37 percent of likely voters in California 's voter - rich coastal counties were backing the same - sex marriage ban , compared with 54 percent in the less - populous inland section of the state .
In the Bay Area , the center of the nation 's gay rights movement , support for the measure skidded to 26 percent .
Those numbers might have changed slightly since the summer .
Some recent polls showed the race tightening after a flood of TV ads by proponents of the measure .
While opponents of the initiative are holding events in San Francisco , Santa Cruz , Los Angeles and Guerneville , it 's no coincidence that a weeklong bus trip by Prop.
8 supporters is making stops in Chico , Bakersfield , Indio ( Riverside County ) and Modesto .
' Yes ' bus visits Oakland
At the bus tour 's lone Bay Area stop , in East Oakland on Tuesday , about 100 sign - waving supporters heard from campaign officials and local black ministers speaking in front of a bus decorated with ads running the length of the vehicle urging people to " Say ' I Do ' to Traditional Marriage . "
" This is not about taking away rights from anyone , " said Frank Schubert , campaign consultant for the Yes on 8 campaign .
" It 's about standing up for rights . "
Opponents of the measure are putting out a different message .
Stephanie Stolte of Turlock ( Stanislaus County ) , an organizer for a Unitarian Universalist group that is part of the " No on 8 " coalition , is asking clergy from Lodi to Fresno to sign on to the effort to block the same - sex marriage ban , which she describes as " a blatant attempt to rob ( people ) of their fundamental rights and freedoms . "
She also has put together a small Modesto phone bank that calls undecided voters two days a week , urging them to oppose Prop .
8 . Stolte and other phone bank operators recognize the demographic differences that are driving the debate .
Martina Virrey , a Stockton organizer with the " No on Prop. 8 " effort , has five to 10 people making calls one night a week .
Her callers are targeting what she says are the " young , occasional voters " who might show up on election day to vote for Democrat Barack Obama for president but who also are likely to vote against Prop .
8 .
" I think age has a lot to do with how people will vote on Prop. 8 , " she said .
" Many young voters in our area feel they need more information , but once we explain Prop.
8 to them , they tell us , ' Of course I 'm voting no on that . ' "
Families , friends disagree
That 's not the way Myrna Elias , a 29 - year - old student from Stockton , sees it .
" A lot of friends had a hard time coming out to their parents and others , and I 'm sympathetic to what they went through , " she said .
" But I can still love those persons and still be for Prop. 8 . "
Religion plays a major role in the Central Valley 's campaign against same - sex marriage , which is n't surprising when much of the financial and volunteer support for Prop.
8 has come from churches across the state .
Nearly two - thirds of likely voters who identify themselves as evangelical Christians back the same - sex marriage ban , the Field Poll showed .
" Proposition 8 does n't promote or support hate , " said Rebecca Whitman , a Stockton mother of five .
" We 're putting out the word of God . "
Ken Boyd , a volunteer organizer for the Yes on 8 campaign from Kerman ( Fresno County ) , said he had more than 3,500 volunteers working from Porterville ( Tulare County ) to Modesto - but he estimated that the coalition of church groups provided nearly twice as many .
The volunteers have either visited or called about 80 percent of the registered voters in that part of the Central Valley , with promising results , Boyd said .
" We 're not seeing the type of opposition we would in San Francisco , " he said .
The demographic split does n't mean that Prop. 8 does n't have supporters on the coast or that the Central Valley is n't home to voters who believe strongly that marriage should be a right for all Californians .
Dems seek opposition
The state Democratic Party is against Prop. 8 , and party groups including the Young Democrats of America are knocking on doors in the Central Valley , looking to drum up opposition to the initiative .
" We 're pleased with what we 're seeing , " Virrey said .
" We 're going out with ' No on 8 ' signs to busy intersections in places like Tracy , Manteca and Stockton and seeing lots of people honk and wave . "
Ron Heinzen , an engineer from Stockton , is a Prop. 8 supporter who has put in his time on the streets , making his pitch each weekend through half - opened doors to people who do n't always want to see him there .
On a recent Saturday , he made his way through a down - at - the - heels Stockton neighborhood , talking to people who were n't registered , were n't voting or had already had cast mail ballots against Prop .
8 .
But there were others who listened to his talk , took the campaign brochure and promised to vote for Prop .
8 .
Heinzen said the last time he went door - to - door was eight years ago when he walked for Prop. 22 , a law that banned same - sex marriage in California .
When the state Supreme Court overturned that initiative earlier this year , he knew he had to work to pass Prop.
8 , a constitutional amendment that would trump the court ruling .
" I just want to get the message out , " he said .
Focus on black churches : Proposition 8 's supporters and opponents seek backing from a critical voting bloc .

A portfolio website is an essential marketing tool for any creative professional .
Whether you ’re a designer or a photographer , potential clients will judge your capabilities by what they see at your portfolio site .
In many cases , your portfolio site will be one of the most significant factors that a client considers when they are deciding who t hire .
Photographer portfolio sites showcase work , provide biographical information regarding the photographer , often include a contact page , and are perfect for inspiration and creative influence .
Below are 25 portfolios with different styles and approaches .
Web designers often browse through portfolio websites of other designers for inspiration and ideas that can be used in their own work .
Photographers , like designers , need to display an attractive portfolio for their website visitors , and many photographers have excellent portfolio sites .
In this post , I ’d like to take a look at some of the best .
Here you ’ll find photography sites that are well designed and also showcase amazing photos .
You ’ll see a few different styles and approaches .
Many use a large background image or a large slider to showcase the photos at their best .
Others use many smaller thumbnail images to fill the screen .
A minimalist design style is also common because it allows the photos to be the center of attention rather than being overpowered by the design details of the site .
If you use WordPress , one resource we ’ve come to love for photographers is Photocrati .
It ’s a WordPress theme that is specifically made for photographers .
Using their theme will help you create a stunning and responsive photography website .
You can also see our collection of the best WordPress photography themes for more ideas and options .
The website of Jen Huang Bogan features large photos on the homepage ( you can scroll down the page to see more ) .
The navigation menu is simple and located in the left sidebar .
This site is different from most others showcased on this page because of the sticky footer navigation menu .
Pedro on the World , the site of Pedro Oliveira , uses a splash page that leads to the nice portfolio page shown below .
Dave Hill ’s homepage features thumbnails of several photos and films .
The design utilizes a white background and minimal styling with a navigation menu in the header .
A clean , minimal layout and design that puts focus on the photos .
Peter McKinnon ’s site is currently a one - page site that directs visitors to a few different projects .
The portfolio site of Theron Humphrey uses a light background color and a minimalist style .
The front page showcases medium - sized versions of several different photos .
Clean design and layout with a slide to showcase photos on the homepage .
Photographer Giles Clement uses full - screen photos and a unique design to create a portfolio site that really stands out while showcasing his work .
The site of Eric Ryan Anderson uses a clean design and layout with a white background and very basic navigation menu .
The photos take center stage .
Deanie Chen also uses a white background and a simple design with a left sidebar .
The main area of the homepage uses a slider to showcase the photos .
JUCO , the site of Julia Galdo and Cody Cloud , stands out from the crowd with many bright and colorful photos on the homepage .
Clean design that showcases several photos above the fold .
This site features a video on the homepage and a clean , elegant layout .
A large background photo is the most prominent aspect of this website ’s homepage .
Gavin Gough ’s website is unique .
While it showcases photos , it uses an approach of showcasing different stories or themes .
The full - size background photo takes center stage in this design .
This is another site that makes excellent use of large background images to show off the work .
Beautiful showcase of photos in a grid .
This design complements the black & white photos that are on display .
Morgan Norman ’s site uses a splash page with a large image that leads to the portfolio page shown below .
A splash page allows visitors to choose to enter the website or view details about Brandon ’s book , Ultraviolet .
If you choose to enter the website , you ’ll see the portfolio shown below .
Horizontal scrolling is used to showcase the photos on this site .
Another example of a clean design / layout that makes use of horizontal scrolling .
A clean design and layout with a white background and two columns of photos .
Emilee McGovern ’s homepage uses a full - screen background with links to the two different sections of her portfolio : photojournalism and editorial .
Many thumbnails are used to showcase a variety of photos on this homepage .
Ben
Yan ’s site uses horizontal scrolling to showcase the photos .
Deb Schwedhelm ’s site features a clean design and a large slideshow on the homepage .
Peter FIsher ’s site uses a white background and a simple layout with minimal styling .
The homepage features two columns of photos .
Take note of the obvious and subtle differences in how photographers manage their layout and site organization .
The design of the site should serve the style and purpose of your portfolio .
While there are a number of different approaches used by the sites in this showcase , one thing they all have in common is a simple or clean layout .
In order for the photos to stand out , the design and layout should be simple .
Photographers will have thousands of photos to choose from for their home image (s ) .
It might take some time to decide what imagery you want visitors to see first , but quality is better than quantity .
You want to give each photograph the space it needs on screen .
Try to pull them in with one or two striking images that will encourage more exploration .
Many photography sites use a toggle feature that allows for viewing photos one - by - one , or seeing a thumbnail grid for a quick overview .
A scrolling grid with mid to large - sized images is a great , simple way to encourage visitors to keep viewing , plus this will feel familiar to anyone who uses Instagram .
Use text wisely .
If your portfolio is journalistic or story - based , it might make sense to include some context or explanation with the photos .
Testimonials or price information makes sense in some cases , too .
Just make sure that the text does n’t overwhelm the page and detract from the impact of the photography .
Convention Thoughts
By ROB FINCH
Almost every photograph we see from the political conventions is an illustration of perfection .
Perfect light .
Perfect backdrops .
Our political leaders stand on stage , their arms outstretched , perfect smiles on their faces , confetti gently floating around them .
It 's high - stakes theater .
This year I photographed both the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention and witnessed this manipulated circus firsthand .
The perfection is custom built .
Photographers are given specific locations from which to take pictures .
The bigger the media outlet , the more opportunity you have to get the " best " location .
It takes a lot of luck or a lot of determination to make unique pictures , and getting those photographs published is yet another challenge .
As I perused national websites and newspapers , including this one , I saw that almost everyone published the scripted pictures .
It 's that perfect gesture , that look of determination in the eye , all captured with the conveniently placed party signs in the background .
I am sure that campaign managers from both the right and the left were elated .
The one time I got behind the scenes during two weeks of coverage , I listened to a professional speech coach explain what words to emphasize and where to look .
Every word was dissected and analyzed to make sure that it fit the party 's message .
But , most importantly he stressed that everything was done for the cameras , not the people in the audience -- they are already the converted .
I was one of the few people lucky enough to witness these two events in real time .
I had the ability to look around , choose what I wanted to see , just as if I were at a football game or a play .
Most people were only able to look and listen through the filter of television or photographs .
I have to ask , are we being led by the nose ?
Are we drones , satisfied to accept the sanitized view of our next president that has been presented ?
Do n't believe what you see .
We have 52 days left until we elect our next president .
It 's time to pop the balloons and burn the script .
It 's time to get down to business , to ask the tough questions and to find the real moments -- if you can .

Open-Xchange Secures Funding , Charts Plans for Growth
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 03 , 2008
With the economy as volatile as it has been , there has been a good deal of speculation ( both positive and downright pessimistic ) about how open source companies will negotiate the ups and downs to come .
Today , Open - Xchange must be feeling quite optimistic , as it announced it 's just closed a round of venture funding totaling $ 9 million and has four times the number of paid mailboxes now than it did last year .
The company is focusing on a decidedly rosy looking future .
Open -Xchange offers open source email and groupware solutions , with packages , configurations , and support options designed to accommodate organizations of nearly any size , with or without in - house IT departments .
Recently , Open - Xchange has teamed with O3SIS and Funambol to enable ISPs , web hosting companies , and businesses using Open - Xchange on their servers to offer customers and employees access to email with mobile devices .
Open -Xchange runs on Linux ( it ships with Univention Corporate Server bundled on its editions ) and is designed to make connecting with Windows systems on the network infrastructure simple .
Open - Xchange also offers a software - as - a - service option through its partners for companies wishing to use an open source solution that are unable to administer or maintain the software and hardware themselves .
Open -Xchange CEO Rafael Laguna is looking forward to what next year brings .
He says that the company , founded in 2005 , is growing faster than ever before and that the funding it has just received will be used to add another ten million mailboxes to the system .
He says that the email and collaborative tools are the lifeblood of any organization , and that it is undergoing a " phase of dramatic change " that could make software - as - a - service an increasingly attractive option .
Open -Xchange is available in various editions with an included Linux operating system , or can be installed on alternate distributions through supported or community - supplied packages .
Haylie Duff and Sarah Jessica Parker Kissing Cousins ?
We know that the age difference of twenty years makes it impossible that23 , and , 43 , were twins separated at birth .
We 've opted instead to believe that they are first cousins who have n't shared the truth about their obvious familial ties .
SJP is married to actor Matthew Broderick and they have a son James Wilkie .
Haylie , a singer and actress , is the younger sister of actress Hilary Duff and is in a relationship with actor Nick Zano .

Suppose you have these files in a directory .
What do you think has happened here ?
Well , it looks like someone tried to download the php interpreter , and for some reason that did n't work , because the file is empty .
Then we have two copies of the ruby distribution , and both have the same size .
So it looks like that download did complete successfully , but maybe the person downloaded it once and then forgot about it ?
Finally , there are three files that contain the python distribution , but they are all different sizes .
Since we know that wget adds extensions like .1 to avoid overwriting files , it looks like the first two attempts at this download failed , and the third succeeded .
Three types of redundant files
These three cases demonstrate classes of redundant files :
Empty files .
The filename hints at what the intended content was , but since there is no data , there 's no way to tell .
Duplicate files .
Multiple files have the exact same content .
Incomplete / partial files .
The content of one file comprises the partial content of another , larger file .
The smaller file is a failed attempt at producing the larger one .
Now look back at the first screenshot and tell me how quickly would you detect these three cases if a ) the files did n't have descriptive names ( random names , say ) , and b ) they were buried in a directory of 1000 other files ?
More importantly , how long would you even bother looking ?
What if you had a tree of directories where you wanted to eliminated duplicate or incomplete files ?
Even worse .
How to proceed ?
Finding empty files is trivial .
Finding duplicate files is also relatively easy if you just look for files that have the same size .
But to be sure that they are equal , you have to actually examine their contents .
One way is to compute checksums ( md5 , for instance ) and compare them .
But that does n't help with partial files , because any file that is smaller than another file could potentially be incomplete relative to the larger one .
I set out to solve this without expecting that it would be very hard , but it turns out to be complicated .
The code is rather ugly and I wonder if there is an easier way .
In a nutshell , we read sequential chunks from all the files in the directory , hashing the data as we go along .
The hashes then become keys in a dictionary , which will put files whose chunks hash to the same value in the same bucket .
And that 's how we know they are identical .
As long as any bucket has more than two files ( ie. so far they are the same ) , we keep on going .
All in all , we keep reading chunks from those files ( beginning with all ) whose data produce a hash that belongs to more than one file .
In other words , we have to read all the common bytes in all the files + one extra chunk from each ( to determine that the commonality has ended ) .
The size of a chunk is set to 100 kb , but will be determined by how far we can read into a file depending on the size of the other files " in the running " .
Suppose we are at position ( offset ) 100 kb , where one file is 300 kb and another is 110 kb , then we can only read 10 kb from each to check if the data is the same .
Whatever the outcome , we do n't need to read any more than that , because we 've reached the end of the smaller one .
Obviously , this wo n't work on files that are n't constructed sequentially ( torrent and whatever ) .
The nitty gritty
The center piece of the code is a hash table called offsets .
The keys , indeed , represent offsets into the mass of files we are working on .
The values are themselves hash tables which contain hashes of chunks read from the files .
So we start out in offsets [ 0 ] , which is a hash table with only one item , containing all of the files .
We read up to 100 kb from each file , until we reach the chunk size or the end of the smallest file .
The size read is captured in readsize , which determines new_offset .
We will now have a new entry called offsets [ new_offset ] .
We how hash ( with md5 ) a readsize number of bytes of data from each file , so that each hash becomes an entry into the new hash table at offsets [ new_offset ] .
As the value we store the file that produced it .
And so it continues .
Every iteration produces a new offset and a new set of hashes , in each case the new hash combines the old hash with the new data .
In the end , we have a number of lists indexed by hash at every offset level .
If there are multiple files in such a list , then they have all hashed to the same value up to this point in the file ( they are the same so far ) .
The interesting lists are those where at least one file has reached eof .
Because that means we have read the whole file and its full contents is equal to that of another file .
If they are the same size ( both have reached eof ) , they are duplicates of each other .
If not , the smaller is incomplete relative to the larger .
How lazy are we ?
Unfortunately , it 's hard to predict how many bytes have to be read , because that depends entirely on how much the files have in common .
If you have two copies of an 700 mb iso image you might as well md5sum them both , we can't do any better than that .
But if they are n't the same , we stop reading chunks as soon as they become distinct , which is likely to be at the very beginning .
Equally , memory use will be highest at the start since we 're reading from all of the files .
Performance
The slowest part of execution is obviously disk io .
So what if we run it on a hot cache so that all ( or most ) of the blocks are already in memory ?
In the worst case , we have two 700 mb files that are identical ( populated from / dev/urandom ) .
5.6s md5 sum testfile *
9.4s killdupes.py ' testfile *'
Slower , but not horribly slow .
Now let 's try the best case .
Same files , but we delete the first byte from one of them , displacing every byte by one to the left relative to the original .
6.2s md5 sum testfile *
0.02s killdupes.py ' testfile *'
And there it is !
No need to hash the whole thing since they 're not equal , not even at byte 1 .
On the other hand , a rougher test is to set it free on a directory with lots of files .
For instance , in a directory of 85 k files , there are 42 empty files , 7 incomplete and 28 duplicates .
We had to read 2 gb of data to find all these .
Not surprisingly , md5 sum did n't enjoy that one as much .
41 m md5sum
36 m killdupes.py
So that 's pretty slow , but can you make it faster ?

Of all the different types of photography showcased on Smashing Magazine , underwater pictures are probably the most difficult to get .
They require a very specialized equipment and the knowledge of some advanced techniques to get a perfect picture .
You need to get the correct exposure , accurate focus , controlled movement of your subject and a pleasing color balance ; you also have to deal with low light .
Underwater photos offen suffer from loss of color and contrast when taken at a significant depth .
Such photos are always adjusted with color balance to help offset the blueish tint of the water .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Because underwater photography is a specialized art , relatively few photographers attempt it .
But it offers many exciting and rare photographic opportunities for fresh and truly different vivid images .
Most often , photographers use a traditional film or digital camera covered in a watertight casing .
Professionals prefer to use special underwater cameras .
Below , we present over 50 beautiful examples of underwater photos , created by artists and professional photographers .
All works featured below have the artists and photographers ’ names linked to their portfolios or websites .

Does Anybody Have Some New Coping Techniques ?
Posted on by Mountain Mary
It is a beautiful fall day in Colorado : but I am sitting here trying to decide whether my symptoms are more anxiety or depression , or both .
FEAR , for sure .
Sometimes this all seems like a dream : how there could exist the real possibility that a Muslim Socialist with ties to a domestic terrorist and an America hating pastor , can be on the brink of becoming our next President : not to mention his inexperience , dishonesty and far left liberal ideas .
I find myself being afraid for our country : for our liberties and the democratic principles that we hold so dear .
I made the mistake of watching George Snuffalufagas this morning .
He and the libs on his panel talked briefly about the election but they kept saying " when " ( he takes office ) instead of " if " when they referred to Zerobama .
Newt ( yes , our NEWT ) predicted a McCain loss unless something turns around and soon .
George Will , who seems to have abandoned his Conservative beliefs of late , just looked depressed .
THEN , they went on to other topics .. just like there was n't really anything more to say about the election cuz it 's OVER !
I want to ask you Freepers what coping skills are working for you right now :
Mine are the following : 1 . Turn off the MSM , and unfortunately , that includes Fox News , with the exception of Fox and Friends in the am , Greta ( she 's had great exposes on ACORN ) , Hannity and Colmes and Huckabee .
O'Reilly is totally losing it : he told Laura Ingraham the other night that he has no problem with Obama , not to mention his abrasiveness and the way he uses his hands all the time is creepy .
2 . Listen only to Rush , Mark Levin , Laura Ingraham and Hannity on the radio .
3 . Exercise : it gets the endorphins going .
4 . Prepare and eat comfort food : I made soup today , 5 . Stay on Conservative or Republican websites only .
6 . Do something useful for your local McCain / Palin campaign :
Make the dreaded phone calls , distribute lit , yard signs and the like .
it will make you feel good and you can hang out with like minded people .
I would like nothing better than to see those pearly whites of Nobama 's disappear in anger and disbelief .
And Mabelle has her dress already .
Wonder if it can be returned to TJ Maxx !
The lobster and champagne at the Waldorf Astoria is what really got me :
The BO 's are already celebrating !
a $ 350 lunch .
Makes me want to hurl .
Please advise me of any other techniques you freepers have for getting through the next two weeks .
But do n't suggest drinking : I gave it up !
Thanks , MM :)

It was a $ 450 lunch ... which I guess could go a long way to making anybody feel better !
But since we do n’t generally run in the $ 450 lunch circles , I suggest praying a lot .
I am also trying to work on GOP campaign projects so at least Í’ll feel that I tried to stop this horror .

Thank you Fox news .

Now when will Obama be grilled like that ?
Wallace is a pussy .
What a joke .

Volunteer to make phone calls for McCain .
There are more supporters out there than the media would have you believe .
Also , catch a live stream of a Palin rally whenever possible and attend one if she is near you .
I do n't usually have problems “ coping ” but if I did , I doubt I 'd watch O’Reilly .

I copied this from an earlier post I made to someone else that had pretty much the same problem .
Maybe it will help ... maybe not .
But , I say this to you in all love .
************************************************************
I dont listen to the media and polls or most dims .
They all lie .
Propaganda ... pure and simple ...
Look unto the Lord .
He has peace and contentment and every good gift .
The evil one kills , steals and destroys everything in his path .
Only faith in the risen Savior will give you sustenance .
It sounds so simple ... but its the truth .
Turn off tv and stop reading the negative stuff on FR .
Do good deeds and honor and walk with God , who is the God of love and mercy .... then .... LIVE !
Look at what God has given me / you and rejoice .
God tells us in Joshua 1:7 - 9 to be strong and not to look at the things around you .
Also in Mark 11:20 - 25 .
Just simply obey his command to be strong and of good courage .
Do not tremble or be dismayed .
And trust Him to rule the day .
We , as a nation of believers need to practice this ........ all the while keeping on our toes !
Being wise , to whats happening .
God sent the nation of Israel in to fight these same kinds of people ..... pagans .
Those that dont serve God.
And He said
He would be with Israel as they fought their battles and He would rout the enemy .
Sadly , a lot of folks think that God is just ,  the big man upstairs .
And a lot of other euphemistic words .
Well Scripture says
He is a consuming fire .
Deuteronomy 4:24
 For the LORD your God is a consuming fire , a jealous God . 
And it is the unrighteous that He comsumes .
WE MUST TRUST HIM , UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES !!!
I can do nothing else but this .
And remember , this election is not over .
We still have to vote .
God bless you and yours in Jesus love , AMEN and AMEN !!!!!

Gallup poll on Georgian attitudes
Gallup just released some fresh analysis from its polling in Georgia that shows that , as of April / May 2007 , the overwhelming majority of Georgians were seeing their relations with Russia worsening as their relations with Ukraine and the United States were improving :
I ’ll be surprised if , when the dust settles down from this week ’s fighting , Georgians still see the United States in such a friendly light .
It must be a deeply embittering experience for them to learn that the 82nd Airborne is not parachuting to the rescue .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday April 10 2008
The report about the need to reduce CO2 limits that James Hansen , head of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York , co-authored with eight other climate scientists is posted on the arXiv.org website - not the Archive website as we said in the article below .
This has been corrected .
One of the world 's leading climate scientists warns today that the EU and its international partners must urgently rethink targets for cutting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere because of fears they have grossly underestimated the scale of the problem .
In a startling reappraisal of the threat , James Hansen , head of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York , calls for a sharp reduction in C02 limits .
Hansen says the EU target of 550 parts per million of C02 - the most stringent in the world - should be slashed to 350 p pm .
He argues the cut is needed if " humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed " .
A final version of the paper Hansen co-authored with eight other climate scientists , is posted today on the arXiv.org website .
Instead of using theoretical models to estimate the sensitivity of the climate , his team turned to evidence from the Earth 's history , which they say gives a much more accurate picture .
The team studied core samples taken from the bottom of the ocean , which allow C02 levels to be tracked millions of years ago .
They show that when the world began to glaciate at the start of the Ice age about 35 m years ago , the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere stood at about 450 ppm .
" If you leave us at 450 ppm for long enough it will probably melt all the ice - that 's a sea rise of 75 metres .
What we have found is that the target we have all been aiming for is a disaster - a guaranteed disaster , " Hansen told the Guardian .
At levels as high as 550 ppm , the world would warm by 6C , the paper finds .
Previous estimates had suggested warming would be just 3C at that point .
Hansen has long been a prominent figure in climate change science .
He was one of the first to bring the crisis to the world 's attention in testimony to Congress in the 1980s .
But his relationship with the Bush administration has been frosty .
In 2005 he accused the White House and Nasa of trying to censor him .
He has steadily revised his analysis of the scale of the global warming and was himself one of the architects of a 450 ppm target .
But he told the Guardian : " I realise that was too high . "
The fundamental reason for his reassessment was what he calls " slow feedback " mechanisms which are only now becoming fully understood .
They amplify the rise in temperature caused by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases .
Ice and snow reflect sunlight but when they melt , they leave exposed ground which absorbs more heat .
As ice sheets recede , the warming effect is compounded .
Satellite technology available over the past three years has shown that the ice sheets are melting much faster than expected , with Greenland and west Antarctica both losing mass .
Hansen said that he now regards as " implausible " the view of many climate scientists that the shrinking of the ice sheets would take thousands of years .
" If we follow business as usual I can't see how west Antarctica could survive a century .
We are talking about a sea - level rise of at least a couple of metres this century . "
The revised target is likely to prompt criticism that he is setting the bar unrealistically high .
With the US administration still acting as a drag on international efforts , climate campaigners are struggling even to get a 450 ppm target to stick .
Hansen said his findings were not a recipe for despair .
The good news , he said , is that reserves of fossil fuels have been exaggerated , so an alternative source of energy will have to be rapidly put in place in any case .
Other measure could include a moratorium on coal power stations which would bring the C02 levels to below 400 ppm .
Hansen 's revised position will pile yet further pressure on Britain over plans to build a new generation of coal power stations .
Last year he wrote to Gordon Brown urging him to block the first such power station ; the Royal Society has made similar suggestions to the government .
Other investors will face similar squeezes , said Seymour Zises , who runs Family Management Corporation , a firm that manages money for wealthy families .
“ I believe that the predominant selling will be among hedge funds themselves and executives who control their own companies , ” Mr. Zises said .
Because margin loans are private transactions between banks and borrowers , it is difficult to know exactly how many executives or hedge funds may face margin calls as a result of the stock market ’s plunge .
Corporate executives must report stock sales within two days of making them .
But hedge funds do not have to disclose margin calls  and in some cases the first sign that they face calls may be their abrupt collapse .
Hal Vogel of Vogel Capital Management said he was taken aback when he learned that Mr. Redstone and his privately held company , National Amusements , were so heavily leveraged .
“ That suggests that there may be other cases where chief executives who are controlling shareholders or the company ’s major shareholder with the same problem , ” Mr. Vogel said .
“ These people present themselves as financially savvy and not subject to great risk associated with debt .
But in fact it seems that that is not always the case . ”
Knowing exactly how many firms used those strategies is all but impossible .
But margin debt increased steadily from late 2002 to 2007 , according to the New York Stock Exchange , which requires its member firms to report their margin loans outstanding .
It peaked at $ 381 billion in July 2007 , just before stocks peaked .
Since then , margin loans have fallen .
In August , the most recent month for which data is available , they were $ 292 billion .
But those figures do not fully account for loans made internationally , or for other strategies that funds use .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- America may soon get a whole lot of new stuff .
As part of a new , massive spending plan designed to jumpstart the economy , there 's talk of spending hundreds of billions of dollars on new roads , bridges , trains , schools , power plants , transmission lines and energy - efficient homes .
Details on the plan are few .
Numbers tossed around range anywhere from $ 300 billion to $ 700 billion , and include other measures aimed at stimulating the economy such as tax cuts and money for businesses .
On Monday , President - elect Barack Obama said the measures would be " creating and saving 2.5 million jobs - jobs rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges , modernizing our schools , and creating the clean energy infrastructure of the twenty - first century . "
While the " saving " part of Obama 's jobs pledge leaves plenty of wiggle room - it 's nearly impossible to say how many jobs would be lost if the stimulus is n't enacted - experts say the next president is generally on target .
" It sounds big , but this is not an unrealistic number he 's throwing out there , " said Jim Glassman , a senior economist at J.P. Morgan , noting that an economy not in recession generates 1.5 million to 2 million jobs a year anyway .
Although Glassman thinks the tax cut portion of the plan will generate the most jobs , plenty of others have high hopes for the infrastructure part .
Planes , trains and automobiles
On the transportation side , last year 's disaster in Minnesota is a stark reminder of what needs to be done on the nation 's highways .
" Repaving the roads and strengthening the bridges are very important things to do , " said Martin Wachs , director of transportation , space and technology at the Rand Corp. , a research outfit .
" It 's like addressing a backlog of needs . "
The backlog is certainly there .
Some 3,000 projects , estimated to cost over $ 18 billion and supporting over half a million jobs , could be under contract in less than 90 days , according to the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials .
The federal government would merely have to release money to the states and these things could be up and running .
Longer term , some argue that creating transportation corridors that bundle together highways , high - speed rail links , pipelines , utility lines and other infrastructure projects would prime the economic pump - not only by creating the jobs during construction , but by speeding up commerce afterwards .
" If you 're going to spend money , I can't think of anything better to spend it on , " said John Cogan , Houston - based head of global energy and infrastructure projects at the law firm McDermott , Will & Emery .
" It would make this economy and enormous engine you could n't stop . "
This opinion is not unanimous .
Ever since the Great Depression , economists have debated what makes a better stimulus during recession - government spending or tax cuts and rebates .
It 's not that the country does n't need more roads and schools .
It 's just that these projects take too long to get up and running to create jobs in the short term .
Moreover , they tend to last several years , so if the economy does bounce back in short order they can become inflationary - tying up money and labor .
" It 's a sledgehammer , not a scalpel , " said Martin Regalia , chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , a business lobby group .
" There 's just one thing that works for the economy , and that 's cash in the hands of consumers . "
Green power
The other major part of the infrastructure plan is energy , and it 's something Obama has been touting since early in his presidential campaign .
He has long called for an an alternative energy project similar to the Apollo Project that put a man on the moon .
During the campaign , he pledged to spend $ 150 billion over 10 years on renewable energy , originally paid for by a tax on carbon dioxide .
Al Gore has called for far more - $ 400 billion over 10 years on the electricity grid alone .
Although the Obama team could n't be reached for comment , it now seems his energy plan may become a central part of a stimulus package .
It may be run out of existing agencies such as the Department of Energy , or it could fall under a new " climate and energy tsar " that Obama is reportedly considering .
To generate the jobs quickly - Obama 's 2.5 million pledge is supposed to happen in two years - experts say the government will need to focus on energy efficiency .
This includes things like wrapping water heaters in insulation , caulking or replacing windows , and switching to more efficient appliances .
" There 's an army of unemployed construction people , and it could be done quickly , " said George Sterzinger , head of the Renewable Energy Policy Project , an advocacy group .
Long term , Sterzinger said the government needs to establish both stable tax credit policies for people who buy renewable power , as well as provide incentives to encourage domestic manufacturers to retool and employ Americans making cutting edge solar , wind and other renewable energy products .
America , he said , used to lead in designing and building renewable energy systems , but has since lost that manufacturing edge - not to countries with cheap labor costs such as China , but to places such as Germany and Denmark where the government supports these industries .
" There is such a focus on projects that you miss the discussion on the best way to develop the industry , " he said .
" We can still get back in that game . "
Transmission lines also need improving .
While some argue that entire new lines need to be built , it 's possible to create jobs and efficiency simply by upgrading what 's already there , said Edward Guinness , co-manager of the Guinness Atkinson Alternative Energy Fund .
Installing wires capable of carrying more power and alleviating bottlenecks in several areas of the country are things that can be done now , said Guinness .
' It 's a bit like road building , and it 's quite labor intensive , " he said .
Analysts were reluctant to say how many jobs a massive government push into alternative energy might yield , but did say renewables could go a long way in meeting Obama 's 2.5 million goal .
" The amount of capital that would be deployed could create those jobs , " said Bruce Kahn , a senior analyst Deutsche Bank 's climate change research division .
' It can happen within two years .
It is a short - term thing . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
As the U.S. presidential candidates sprint toward the finish line , the Bush administration is also sprinting to enact environmental policy changes before leaving power .

Whether it ’s getting wolves off the Endangered Species List , allowing power plants to operate near national parks , loosening regulations for factory farm waste or making it easier for mountaintop coal - mining operations , these proposed changes have found little favor with environmental groups .
The one change most environmentalists want , a mandatory program to cut climate - warming greenhouse gas emissions , is not among these so - called “ midnight regulations . ”
Bureaucratic calendars make it virtually impossible that any U.S. across - the - board action will be taken to curb global warming in this administration , though both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama have promised to address it if they win Tuesday ’s U.S. presidential election .
Even some free - market organizations have joined conservation groups to urge a moratorium on last - minute rules proposed by the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency , among others .
“ The Bush administration has had eight years in office and has issued more regulations than any administration in history , ” said Eli Lehrer of the Competitive Enterprise Institute .
“ At this point , in the current economic climate , it would be especially harmful to push through ill - considered regulations in the final days of the administration . ”
John Kostyack of the National Wildlife Federation , which joined Lehrer ’s group to call for a ban on these last - minute rules , said citizens are cut out of the process , allowing changes in U.S. law that the public opposes , such as rolling back protections under the Endangered Species Act .
WHAT ’S THE RUSH ?
The Bush team has urged that these regulations be issued no later than Saturday , so they can be put in effect by the time President George W. Bush leaves office on January 20 .
If they are in effect then , it will be hard for the next administration to undo them , and in any case , this may not be the top priority for a new president , said Matt Madia of OMB Watch , which monitors the White House Office of Management and Budget , through which these proposed regulations must pass .
“ This is typical , ” Madia said of the administration ’s welter of eleventh - hour rules .
“ It ’s a natural reaction to knowing that you ’re almost out of power . ”
Industry is likely to benefit if Bush ’s rules on the environment become effective , Madia said .
“ Whether it ’s the electricity industry or the mining industry or the agriculture industry , this is going to remove government restrictions on their activity and in turn they ’re going to be allowed to pollute more and that ends up harming the public , ” Madia said in a telephone interview .
What is unusual is the speedy trip some of these environmental measures are taking through the process .
For example , one Interior Department rule that would erode protections for endangered species in favor of mining interests drew more than 300,000 comments from the public , which officials said they planned to review in a week , a pace that Madia called “ pretty ludicrous . ”
Why the rush ?
Because rules only go into effect 30 to 60 days after they are finalized , and if they are not in effect when the next president takes office , that chief executive can decline to put them into practice -- as Bush did with many rules finalized at the end of the Clinton administration .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto denied the Bush team was cramming these regulations through in a hasty push .
Fratto discounted reports “ that we ’re trying to weaken regulations that have a business interest , ” telling White House reporters last week the goal was to avoid the flood of last - minute rules left over from the Clinton team .
There is at least one Bush administration environmental proposal that conservation groups welcome : a plan to create what would be the world ’s largest marine wildlife sanctuary in the Pacific Ocean .
That could go into effect January 20 .
After being in beta for about a year and having more than 1 million downloads , the Java SE 6 Update 10 ( 6u10 ) , dubbed the “ Consumer JRE ” has been released .
With this release which is primarily focused on the Java Plug - In , Sun is trying to deliver on its promise for an enhanced rich client user experience and paves the way for the upcoming JavaFX Desktop 1.0 .
In Java 6u10 the Java Plug - In has a completely redesigned architecture .
Instead of executing applets in the same operating system process as the web browser , it runs one or more Java virtual machine instances which connect back to the browser for full interoperability with the surrounding web page .
This architectural change offers many advantages and enables several new features :
Improved reliability .
The JVM running the applet is isolated from the web browser at the operating system level .
If something should go wrong while running the applet , or if an uncooperative applet refuses to shut down , the new Java Plug - In detects and handles the error condition gracefully ; the web browser is unaffected .

Built - in JNLP support .
The new plug - in offers the capability to launch applets directly from JNLP files , unifying deployment of Java content both in the browser and out of the browser ( via Java Web Start ) .
Developers can now reuse JNLP extensions for advanced functionality including the JavaFX run-time libraries , 3D graphics via OpenGL , and planetary - scale terrain visualization within applets .
Applets can now access JNLP APIs for persistent data storage , local file system access , and other useful functionality from sandboxed code .

Per - applet command - line arguments .
JVM command - line arguments may be specified on a per-applet basis , providing fine - grained control over options such as the heap size and Java 2D hardware acceleration features .
JNLP - launched applets simply incorporate the command - line arguments and / or system properties into the JNLP file .
Old - style applets can embed these arguments in the HTML of the web page .

Multiple JRE version support .
Each individual applet instance may request a different JRE version on which to run .
This feature is designed for enterprise customers which prefer to qualify their applets against either a particular JRE version or a particular JRE family .
Both selection of a specific JRE version , or any in a particular family , are supported in the new plug -in .

Improved Java / JavaScript communication .
The bridge between the JavaScript engine in the web browser and the Java programming language has been completely reimplemented .
The new implementation is backward - compatible and features improved reliability , performance and cross - browser portability , for both Java calling JavaScript as well as JavaScript calling Java .
Formerly Mozilla - specific " LiveConnect " functionality , such as the ability to call static Java methods , instantiate new Java objects and reference third - party packages from JavaScript , is now available in all browsers .

Improved applet lifecycle management .
Calls to the applet lifecycle methods init , start , stop , and destroy are more deterministic and cross - browser behavior has been improved .
The applet class loader cache and the legacy applet lifecycle , required for backward compatibility , are fully supported and the behavior of both has been improved .

Better large heap support .
Historically , the maximum heap size that could be specified for applets via the Java Control Panel has been limited .

Better Windows Vista support .
Signed applets running in Protected Mode Internet Explorer on Microsoft 's Windows Vista now have the same privileges as normal user applications , eliminating a portability barrier to this platform .
The Java Plug - In is available for Internet Explorer 6 & 7 as well as Firefox 3 on Windows XP , Windows Vista , Solaris and Linux .
It is not available for Mac users and Kirk Pepperdine thinks it ’s going to be a while :
While one from Sun or apparently from Apple , can speak for when the 6u10 may make to Mac land , recent history has demonstrated that we could be waiting for some time .
Jim Weaver has managed to run JavaFX applets inside of Google Chrome beta .
It seems that Chrome requires Java 6u10 :
According to Google , Java SE 6 Update 10 is the version that must be used in order to run Java in the Chrome browser .
As I 've mentioned previously , one of the objectives of Java SE 6 Update 10 is to solve the JRE and Java / JavaFX deployment issues .
Because Google Chrome is destined to be a great , cross - platform browser , and because it requires the version of Java that makes rich - client Java / JavaFX programs feasible , this will increase the adoption rate of JavaFX applets and applications .
With the JRE reaching the size of 14.5MB in previous versions , its distribution was a problem often criticized in the Java community .
With 6u10 Sun has delivered enhanced deployment .
The Java Kernel online installer lets first time Java users run applets and Java Web Start applications quicker without waiting for the whole Java Platform to be downloaded since the default Kernel is about 4 - 5 MB .
This installation is expected to satisfy the requirements of most Java applets and applications , and any additional libraries that may be required at runtime are downloaded to complete the Java Kernel installation .
Additionally the Java auto - updater has also been improved , using a patch - in - place mechanism that allows users to update specific components of their Java platform instead of having to download and install a whole new JRE every time .
Also the Java Deployment Toolkit supplies Java based web applet / application deployers with a simple JavaScript interface that helps detect the users '
Java environment and makes sure the correct version of Java is used :
The following HTML code is all it takes to ensure that Java 1.6 is installed and then a Java applet is launched : < script src= " http://java.com/js/deployJava.js "></script> < script > deployJava.runApplet({codebase : " http://www.example.com/applets/ " , archive : " ExampleApplet.jar " , code : " Main.class " , width : " 320 " , Height : " 400 " } , null , " 1.6 " ) ; </ script >
You can see deployJava.js for detailed description of the deployJava object .
One of the main features that were added to Java 6u10 was the Java Quick Starter ( JQS ) , which improves initial startup time for most Java applets and applications :
JQS is enabled by default in Windows XP and Windows 2000 operating systems and is not necessary on Windows Vista as Vista offers its own pre-loading mechanisms .
A process called jqs.exe will run in the background in order to allow quick startup .
jqs.exe will be loaded after a Windows restart .
The startup performance improvement is achieved by periodically pre-fetching some of the most heavily used Java files into memory ( occupying no more than 20 Mb of RAM ) .
Later , when Java is launched , much less disk I/O is required which makes startup much snappier and noticeably faster .
Also regarding performance Java 6u10 features a fully hardware accelerated graphics pipeline based on the Microsoft Direct3D 9 API , translating into improved rendering of Swing applications which rely on translucency , gradients , arbitrary transformations , and other more advanced 2D operations .
Moreover Java 6u10 offers a new cross platform look and feel that is drawn with 2D vector graphics and is named Nimbus .
Nimbus is based on Synth which is part of Java since version 1.5 and tries to provide a polished - modern look to Java UIs .
Since Nimbus is drawn entirely using Java 2D vector graphics , rather than static bitmaps , it 's only 56KB and can be rendered at arbitrary resolutions .
You can activate the Nimbus look and feel either by invoking UIManager.setLookAndFeel or by passing the - Dswing .
defaultlaf command line option when running the Java application .

But it took cheap video cameras , YouTube and some desperate corporations to show him what it was .
Mr. Levinson ’s skill is turning out homemade corporate commercials  what advertisers call a form of “ user - generated content . ”

September 23rd , 2008 | Published in code , erlang , HTTP , python , REST , Ruby , services | 4 Comments | Bookmark on Pinboard .in
If you ’re writing RESTful web services , you need to be able to parse HTTP Accept and Content - type headers .
The Accept header tells you what media types the client can handle , and Content - type tells you what the client is sending when it invokes PUT or POST .
Several years ago Joe Gregorio wrote a really nice article explaining how to properly handle such parsing , and he implemented his ideas in the form of the mimeparse Python module .
Later , others added Ruby and PHP versions .
In my Erlang web services work I ’ve been doing just enough to parse my Accept headers , knowing full well my approach had holes in it and would eventually need to be done right .
When I recently stumbled on Joe ’s article and code , I decided to port it to Erlang and use it .
Joe ’s code is very clean and has accompanying unit tests , so the port was pretty easy .
However , in the process of plugging it into my system I found a reasonably common case where the best_match function would return a wildcard match in preference to an exact match , so I added unit tests for that case and repaired the problem for all four languages .
I also found that Java ’s URLConnection class , or maybe it ’s HttpURLConnection , sends a plain “ * ” as a wildcard MIME type , which I do n’t believe is legal ( please correct me if I ’m wrong ) , but since I figure there ’s probably more than a few clients out there based on that code , I modified the four mimeparse implementations to handle that as well , treating it as “ */* ” .
Being a console developer , I can say that these claims are false .
There 's a dedicated technical requirements check by Nintendo ( just as with Sony and Nintendo ) called the " Lotcheck " , which is the process of getting the game licensed , which in turn is the prerequisite for the seal .
The Lotcheck requirements list things like standardized Home Button behaviour , Wii Strap reminder screen behaviour , Scratched / Dirty Disc behaviour , etc .
It 's not about game content .
Polls show Barack Obama gaining in several battleground states .
Nervous GOP urges McCain to attack
John McCain ’s fade in recent polls , combined with a barrage of negative news coverage during the financial crisis , has leading Republican activists around the country worrying about his prospects and urging his campaign to become much more aggressive against Barack Obama in the remaining month before Election Day .
A flurry of new polls shows Barack Obama gaining in several battleground states – most notably Florida , Pennsylvania and swing states throughout the West .
Officials worry early voting , which is under way in important states such as Ohio , is likely to favor Obama in this toxic political climate .
Advertisement
Several state GOP chairmen in interviews urged the McCain campaign to be more aggressive in hitting Obama ’s vulnerabilities , such as his past relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and other problematic associations from Chicago .
But as September turns to October — Wednesday marks 34 days to the Nov. 4 election — it is clear McCain himself is to blame for the most urgent problems .
His snap decision to throw himself into the bailout debate has proven disastrous , since his efforts looked late and half - hearted , and many in the GOP ignored his pleas in Monday ’s House vote .
And his selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate , initially a political boon , has become a distraction inside and out of the campaign , with top staff now sidelined trying to avoid a debate disaster on Thursday night , officials close to the campaign say .
But some fundamental troubles are outside his control .
The forceful emergence of the sour economy as a dominant issue has Republicans worried in general .
Jeff Frederick , chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia , said he was disappointed with McCain ’s early performance in the debate when the focus was on the economy .
“ He really left a lot on the table while Barack Obama was really kind of hitting him . ”
If this election has taught the campaigns and the press anything , it 's to expect the unexpected .
So momentum could easily swing suddenly back in McCain ’s favor , especially if Palin and then McCain do well in the final debates .
A top McCain campaign official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said : " Polls will move and change — especially as interest grows .
It ’s a hard week to judge because of the dramatic shifts in the economy .
We continue to be in a very fluid environment . "
GOP officials also believe that a sustained attack on Obama ’s ties to his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , scandal - stained businessman Tony Rezko and former radical war protester William Ayers could sway undecided voters .
Among those goading McCain to be more aggressive is Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Robin Smith , who said that “ people need to see a gladiator who ’s willing to defend what exactly he stands for . ”
“ We ’re not talking , for instance , about the radical associations that Barack Obama has , with Mr. Ayers , Tony Rezko and so on , ” Smith said .
“ More could be done . ”
Murray Clark , the chairman of the Indiana Republican Party , said he is eager for Obama ’s “ troubling relationships ” to be aired in his state .
“ I think those things will come up in Indiana again and they do have an impact on mainstream voters in Indiana .
You call it going negative , [ but ] whoever ... is in a position to point out these relationships , I think it ’s helpful . ”
But right now the economic situation is very troubling for McCain .
A Washington Post - ABC
News poll taken Monday night found that more than twice as many people blamed Republicans for the defeat of the Wall Street rescue as blamed Democrats ( 44 percent to 21 percent ) .
Further , the financial crisis will only exacerbate a right track / wrong track split – one of the statistical north stars of the public mood – that Republicans hoped would n’t get worse .
" For the first time in American history , at least since Valley Forge , the right track of the country will be in single digits tonight , ” predicted one longtime GOP strategist after Monday ’s debacle .
Sure enough , this strategist said that surveys taken since Monday in one of the reddest of red states showed that the right track number there had plummeted to single digits .
Moreover , the saturation attention to the economy – always a weak spot for McCain and for the administration he ’s tied to – has thwarted his effort to make the race a referendum on Obama , as public attention turns toward a global crisis and away from partisan attacks .
McCain ’s first signs of life only came after his campaign mocked Obama as a celebrity and sought to make the best of a race that had increasingly been defined by the Illinois Democrat .
Then , thanks in part to Palin , McCain pulled even or took a lead in some polls after a convention that savaged Obama and featured only a brief video from President Bush and no appearance at all by Vice President Cheney .
Now , with the financial crisis front and center , Bush has reappeared on the landscape and the race is no longer an Obama referendum .
The damage is registering powerfully on the electoral map and in state and national polling , the officials say .
McCain has lost ground in at least eight key swing states , and the officials say his path to victory is so narrow that it allows virtually no room for error .
Recent polls have shown Obama ahead in Colorado , Michigan and Pennsylvania , with gains in Florida , Virginia , North Carolina , Indiana and New Mexico .
Two recent national tracking polls – from Gallup and The Hotline – both show Obama enjoying a six - point lead .
A Washington Post - ABC
News poll out Tuesday night showed Obama with a four - point advantage among likely voters ( 50 to 46 ) , down from an anomalous nine points the week before .
Some Republicans say they are uncertain of McCain ’s electoral strategy , wondering why , for example , he ’s back in Iowa this week , a state few independent analysts see as being in play and where public polls this month show Obama enjoying a double - digit lead even before the economic meltdown .
Asked why McCain was in Iowa , one veteran Republican there replied : “ Because he ’s running a senseless , non-strategic campaign .
Why else would he come here ? ”
Despite the grumbling , McCain ’s political hands say they ’re making progress on the ground and are nearing or exceeding the apparatus they had in place in 2004 .
A top Republican National Committee aide said field staffers and volunteers made more phone calls and door knocks last week than at the same point four years ago .
The joint campaign - committee Victory effort has over 400 offices in place .
“ We have hit every goal we have set , ” said the aide .
“ We ’re on offense in New Hampshire , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota , ” five states that were in the Democratic column in 2004 .
It is also possible the bailout will pass , the economy will stabilize and the campaign will shift to other issues .
But GOP officials are increasingly pessimistic that the contest will turn away from pocketbook issues .
The two biggest concerns they expressed in private : that the economy will dominate voting and that McCain has botched the issue from day one .
That has had the effect of neutralizing what these officials saw as his greatest strength : providing hard - nosed leadership in hard - luck times .

Science reporter , BBC News , Liverpool
Everyone , it seems , has a memory associated with Liverpool 's finest
The world 's largest catalogue of Beatles - related recollections will be unveiled in Liverpool this week .
The 3,000 memories , from 69 nations , could help scientists better understand how music can help humans tap into the long forgotten events of their lives .
A link between positive feelings and music could explain why tunes trigger memories , suggests the UK - based team .
The study is ongoing , and people can add their Beatles - related memory by visiting www.magicalmemorytour.com.
" For a long time people have noticed that music can help people remember events from their lives , [ but ] this is the first real data that shows this , " said Dr Catriona Morrison , a cognitive psychologist from the University of Leeds .
Preliminary results from the study , devised by Dr Morrison and her colleague Professor Martin Conway , are being presented to the British Association Science Festival .
Happy times
The research explores the vast repertoire of human autobiographical memories .
" [ Autobiographical ] memories are formed from the events of our lives ; we need them in order to have a sense of self , " the Leeds - based team explained .
The researchers invited people to recount a memory that relates to the Beatles .
Participants were told to think of the first thing that came to mind - a vivid memory relating to a particular album , song , news story or even a band member .
The study found that the recounted memories are almost always positive , that people remember particular episodes very vividly - sounds , smells and sights of the memory were often recounted .
" The memories were equally split between men and women , and came from all ages - the youngest was 17 and the eldest was 87 , " Dr Conway told BBC News .
He explains that what he finds interesting is that there was no difference between men and women in terms of the sense of emotion that the memories evoked .
Dr Morrison explained that it was assumed that a failure to retrieve a memory was the result of that memory not being recorded properly in the first place .
The fact that music cues long - forgotten events suggests the problem is not so much with storage as with retrieval , the researcher argued .
Whether certain types of music ( or certain songs ) can act as better aids for remembering the past remains unclear .
But in a world where the UN predicts that by 2010 , one in five people will be over 60 , and failing memory is likely to become an important challenge for society , more rigorous research into the link between music and memory is much needed , says the team .

On Tuesday I offered 08 reasons why John McCain might still pull off an upset in next week ’s `08 presidential election .
1. Obama ’s supporters are more energized .
A recent USA Today / Gallup poll
These jazzed Obama supporters do n’t see their vote as the weary , defensive choice of the lesser of two evils , but as an exciting chance to create a brighter future .
Obama draws enormous crowds wherever he goes and has energized young and first - time voters in a way that will surprise pollsters relying on traditional turn - out models .
found 74 percent of Obama voters saying they are more enthusiastic about voting this time than in previous elections .
Only 48 percent of McCain voters said the same .
These jazzed Obama supporters do n’t see their vote as the weary , defensive choice of the lesser of two evils , but as an exciting chance to create a brighter future .
2. Obama has a superior ground game .
In part because Sen. Hillary Clinton challenged him deep into the primary season , Obama is better organized at the neighborhood level than any Democratic presidential candidate in history .
His campaign is also making landmark use of technology –-- using e-mail , text messages and social networking sites to keep in touch with supporters and urge them to the polls .
3. Obama has a superior air game .
Obama is so flush with cash he ’s able to saturate TV and radio in key markets at the end of the campaign with ads that counter McCain ’s criticisms of him and launch attacks on McCain .
It ’s not just the money – which he was able to raise oodles of after opting out of the public financing system --- but the determination to respond rapidly and vehemently inside the space of a single news cycle .
4. McCain has lost his brand
Yes , he ’s a volatile man running in sensitive times under the banner of troubled party .
But he started off with the image of a bi-partisan straight - shooter with a clear , selfless sense of proportion .
Yet he ’s campaigned like a crank .
His scattershot , over - the - top assaults on Obama ’s character ( or , rather , the character of Obama ’s associates ) have seemed like an effort to change the subject from important issues .
And now that McCain ’s finally settled on conservative tax policy as his theme down the stretch , his campaign is so desperate for traction that it ’s going schoolyard – channeling Joe McCarthy and calling Obama a socialist , a Marxist and even a communist .
5. Sarah Palin is turning out to be the disasta ’ from Alaska .
I ’m confident historians will rank McCain ’s decision to choose a rookie governor from a low - population state to be his running mate as his biggest miscalculation .
Palin ’s youth , spunkiness and conservative bona fides fired up the Republican base , sure .
But her ignorance , on display in early TV interviews , mortified the rest of us , and polls now show her as a distinct drag on the ticket .
McCain ’s appalling judgment in selecting Palin has been cited by Colin Powell , several high - profile conservative intellectuals and scores of newspaper editorial boards as a reason to support Obama .
( Obama leads 231 - 102 in the endorsement derby )
6. Obama has n’t lost his cool .
Historians will also note the textbook discipline of the Obama campaign , which stuck to a set of fairly simple “ change ” messages while the McCain campaign kept trying out new themes .
This steadiness has been mirrored by Obama ’s own equanimity , particularly during the debates in which he looked and sounded far more presidential than the twitchy , simpering McCain .
The more people saw of Obama , the less he seemed like the frightening , radical , terrorist sympathizer in McCain ’s cartoonish rhetoric .
7. McCain has n’t been able to fight the Bush headwinds .
No matter how many times McCain said “ maverick , ” he still could n’t create enough distance from the deeply unpopular president to make the sale to voters hungering for new leadership .
8. Obama ’s been lucky
Things have been relatively quiet all year on the terror and national security fronts – McCain ’s strengths .
And the major crisis of the campaign season – the economic meltdown – not only played into one of Obama ’s perceived strong suits , it also caused McCain to appear impulsive and indecisive in the face of a sudden challenge .
This is not a taunt or a guarantee , but I expect that luck to hold at least through Tuesday night .

The series so far :
It 's a Whole Different Game ( ABC News blog , Oct. 22 ) :
Listen to this from one top Republican campaign official who says Barack Obama 's ground game is unlike anything we 've ever seen before :
This is the greatest ground game they 've ever put together , " he told ABC News on the condition of anonymity .
" It 's scary . "
Sarah Palin : Rock star or cement weight ?
( The Swamp , Oct. 22 )
" Sarah Palin appears to be a continuing - if not an increasing - drag on the GOP ticket , '' the Pew Research Center 's Andrew Kohut reported this week of his new polling showing Obama with a double - digit advantage over McCain this week .
" Palin 's favorable ratings have declined sharply since mid-September , especially among women under 50 - Sixty percent now express an unfavorable view of Palin , up from 36 percent in mid-September ....
A new NBC News and Wall Street Journal poll reported Tuesday night finds that 55 percent of those surveyed say Palin is not qualified to serve as president .
It shows McCain 10 points down , behind Obama .
Obama rules the TV ad airwaves ( BBC News , Oct. 29 )
[ Obama ] is likely to spend more than $ 100 millon on TV advertising in October alone , more than Senator McCain 's entire campaign budget , which is limited to $ 84 million because he opted to accept federal funds .
Obama is running 7,700 commercials per day , twice the number of the McCain campaign , and he can afford to run some spots of a minute or more , while all of McCain 's commercials are 30 seconds long .
Liberal Dems Top Conservative Reps in Donations , Activism ( Pew Research Center , Oct. 23 )
More than a third of liberal Democrats ( 34 % ) say they have contributed money to any of the presidential candidates during course of this campaign , which is more than double the percentage of conservative Republicans who say they have made donations ( 13 % )

Obama Widens Swing State Advertising Gap -- ( Neilsen Wire , Oct. 27 )
When the future of our planet ’s environment is concerned , one of the groups that we hope are paying attention is those currently attending college .
They will be the leaders , the decision makers , the discoverers and changers of the future .
But at the moment , they are simply learning the value of calculus and being exposed to copious amounts of beer .
But thanks to the National Wildlife Federation ’s just released Campus Environment 2008 report card , conducted in partnership with Princeton Survey Research Associates International , we can at least be certain that , in addition to learning about beer and the opposite sex , our college students are getting a lesson in green .
The report follows up on its first run , back in 2001 , by providing a review of programs at 1,068 institutions , grading them on an A to D scale for collective , national performance on a range of issues such as energy , water , transportation , waste reduction and environmental literacy .
27 % of US colleges responded to the survey , making this the largest survey of its kind .
“ The 2008 report finds that campus leaders value sustainability .
They speak about it , plan for it , hire staff to support it , and the campuses they lead are steadily becoming greener models for the wider society , ” said Julian Keniry , NWF ’s senior director of campus and community leadership .
“ At the same time , the educational curricula to prepare students for a post - college world influenced by climate change are not keeping pace .
On most campuses , the business leaders and facilities managers appear to be making greater strides towards sustainability than their faculty peers . ”
The biggest step forward made by the colleges is in water conservation .
Faculty and students have been instrumental in creating efforts to conserver not only water , but energy as well , and increasing the amount of clean energy powering the campuses .
However there has been little progress made in troubleshooting the issues thrown up by commuting .
Maybe the college campuses of the US should take a look at the Google campus .
Sadly , as mentioned , academics are lagging behind operations .
“ This Report Card tells us there is a widening gap between where higher education actually is on teaching sustainability versus where it should be , ” said Kevin Coyle , vice president of education for National Wildlife Federation .
“ Given the environmental challenges and opportunities this generation will face , I find this cause for deep concern and am committed to working with our partners to address this on both state and federal levels . ”
Nevertheless , only a few years in to the supposed environmental crisis being a public awareness issue , this is good news .
Colleges will be providing businesses and governments with the next generation of employees , and growing this level of awareness in that next generation can only be a good thing .

George Lopez : Next Late Night Talk Show Host
Comedianis in talks to have his own late night talk show .
Word is the show is slated to begin next fall , although it has yet to be picked up by a network .
The George Lopez Show was canceled in 2007 after airing for 5 years .
Lopez has been keeping himself busy with roles in Reno 911 , The Naked Brothers Band , Beverly Hills Chihuahua and hosting duties on several HBO network specials .
We wonder how Jay Leno feels about this development .
George , who was once a friend of Jay's , let slip on WOMX - FM radio that Leno is " the biggest two - faced dude in TV . "
Those seem like fighting words but he did n't stop there .
He also added that Leno is a " backstabber . "
Personally , we think George would do a great job and hope to see the show get a good time slot and network .
Hey , we have an idea .... Lopez should take over for Jay !

You could jump into your wookie onesie , pull the armchair right up close to your TV and put all eight films on repeat , but you 're still going to be light years away from really feeling like you 're living in the Star Wars universe .
Disney thinks it can go better than cosplaying in front of a projector – it's signed a deal to bring an all - new Star Wars VR experience to its theme parks before the end of the year .
Called Star Wars : Secrets of the Empire , it 's set to be a large scale multiplayer VR adventure , put together by The Void – the company also responsible for the Madame Tussauds Ghostbusters experience – and ILMxLab , Lucasfilm 's immersive entertainment arm .
Bringing a galaxy far , far away to Disneyland
“ We want people to step inside the worlds of our stories , ” said ILMxLab ’s exec Vicki Dobbs Beck .
“ Through our collaboration with The Void , we can make this happen as guests become active participants in an unfolding ‘ Star Wars ’ adventure . ”
The Disneyland Resorts in Southern California and Orlando Florida will house the new VR centers .
It 's a growing area for amusement destinations , particularly cinemas who are seeing a slump in 3D movie interest , and are looking to sure up their profits .
If you can't make it to the US theme parks , you can still bring a slice of Star Wars VR magic home – PC virtual reality enthusiasts can jump into the ' Trials on Tatooine ' app , while PlayStation 4 PSVR players can fly an X - Wing in Battlefront 's virtual reality segment .
The leaders of the most wired country on Earth are seeking to curb online anonymity and debate , with laws that many say will fail
While governments around the world try to make sense of the internet and wonder how to curb some of its darker incarnations , all eyes should now be on South Korea , which is one of the first democracies planning to use the law to hold the internet to account .
Many believe that the government 's attempt to impose rules on internet users will fail .
What it is seeking to do is bring websites in line with traditional media : to make them accountable , subject to laws of libel and so forth .
This is a risky strategy for Seoul : if it fails , the government will face the kind of online rebellion that nearly ended the ruling government 's tenure only a few months ago .
South Korea is possibly the most wired nation on Earth : 97 % of South Korean households have high - speed broadband access .
In the UK , by comparison , 35 % of homes have no access to the web at all .
Bad manners
Some observers say this growth in internet access has brought out the worst in South Koreans .
" Internet behaviour in South Korea is somewhat of a low culture .
I 'm often disgusted or even offended by the manners on the net , " says Dr Youngmi Kim , a professor of sociology and politics at the University of Edinburgh whose research is focusing on issues of governability in Korea , Taiwan and Japan .
She is against any outright censorship , but would like to see some sort of campaign encouraging better web manners .
The South Korean government is ahead of her .
Along with laws controlling internet postings , which are due to be passed in November , Seoul also plans to introduce internet etiquette and ethics lessons in schools this year for children aged seven and older .
The question is , can you police the internet ?
British MPs seem to think so .
Members of the Commons select committee for culture , media and sport , which has made the case for centralising controls , say they want " a tighter form of self - regulation , under which the industry would speedily establish a self - regulatory body " .
South Korea is going much further .
Not only will all sites that publish news be liable to the same restrictions as newspapers , TV and radio , they will be answerable to a government regulatory body - the Korean Communications Standards Commission .
The rules extend beyond websites to individuals .
All forum and chatroom users will be required to make verifiable real - name registrations , while internet companies will have to make their search algorithms public to improve " transparency " .
Most controversial of all , the commission will be given powers to suspend the publication of articles accused of being fraudulent or slanderous , for a minimum of 30 days .
During this period the commission will then decide if an article that has been been temporarily deleted or flagged should be removed permanently .
However , Seoul 's previous experience with such censorship suggest that unless the government hires thousands more people to staff the commission , which is already behind in processing some 2,000 internet - related objections , just addressing the initial complaints will be unworkable , untenable and unenforceable .
Professor Jonathan Zittrain , co-founder of Harvard 's Berkman Centre for Internet & Society , says other aspects of the new laws are unworkable .
" There are genuine worries about misinformation that can be spread online , but a regime of requiring real - name registrations for all message boards and chatooms would represent a sweeping law - enforcement effort - and one that could not be readily accomplished without filtering out overseas sites that decline to implement the requirement . "
Jean K Min of OhmyNews International , South Korea 's leading citizen -
journalist - based portal , says that the new controls smack of Big Brother .
" The approval rating of president Lee fell below 20 % after the fiasco of US beef imports and poor handling of other sensitive diplomatic issues .
Many here suspect the ruling party lawmakers and government officials are actually trying to save the deeply unpopular government by intimidating netizens from posting free online opinions with a variety of new legislation and legal threats . "
' Excessive emotional behaviour '
Myung - bak Lee , South Korea 's president , defends the proposed measures as checks against " a society rampant with excessive emotional behaviour , disorderliness and rudeness " .
In a recent speech , he said : " We have to guard against ' infodemics , ' a phenomenon in which inaccurate , false information is disseminated ; prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic . "
That speech followed internet - orchestrated protests in August that spilled over into candlelit rallies and vigils in protest at Seoul 's decision to restart beef imports from the US .
Composed mostly of the young , the protests emptied schools and colleges and brought cities to a standstill ; many ended in violence .
The Seoul government blamed the disruption on rumours and lies spread by internet users .
It went on to accuse internet service providers of failing to police the content they host and of providing a platform for hate , libellous claims and cyber - bullying .
Providers have heeded the warnings .
Korea 's biggest portal , Naver , says it will drop all its news output while its rival , Daum , has offered an olive branch to old media .
Daum says it will share revenue from its banner advertisements on news stories with newspapers , TV and other media outlets providing the articles .
There is an irony in the fact that South Korea , with its focus on giving its citizens access to the high - speed internet , is now seeking to curb how its people use the internet .
But will it stick ?

The CIA sent its agents into Uzbekistan torture chambers to observe the abuse of alleged Islamic terrorists , acc-ording to a dissident member of the Uzbek security services who is now seeking political asylum in the UK after fleeing Tashkent .
Ikrom Yakubov , a former major in the National Security Service ( SNB ) , accused the CIA of involvement in torture sessions in the central Asian republic in an exclusive interview with the Sunday Herald , during which he made a series of startling claims .
These include claims that : l Britain ’s Richard Conroy , the UN ’s co-ordinator in Uzbekistan , was assassinated on the orders of Islam Karimov , the president of Uzbekistan .
Karimov has been described as one of the world ’s worst dictators and his rule , since 1991 , has been characterised by allegations of torture ( including claims that victims were boiled alive ) , media control , fake elections and brutality against human rights organisations and pro-democracy activists ; a series of bomb attacks in the capital , Tashkent , in March 2004 were organised by the SNB in order to tighten Karimov ’s dictatorial rule and ramp up the threat from Islamic terror groups ; l Karimov ordered the notorious Andijan massacre in May 2005 , when Uzbek security forces fired on protesters , killing anything up to 1500 people ; l Karimov ’s regime routinely framed innocent Muslims on charges of involvement in Islamist terror and invented bogus terror threats to maintain his grip on the country , and l the CIA used a secret detention facility in Uzbekistan where suspects in the “ war on terror ” were taken from around the world to be tortured by SNB interrogators .

Shirtless Katie Holmes is STILL dressing like Posh ... even though their friendship has cooled
When Katie Holmes stepped out in a masculine - styled three - piece suit last night , she was again following in the wake of her former best pal Victoria Beckham .
But now that the pair are no longer friends , it must surely infuriate Posh that her former friend is still emulating the dress sense .
The navy blue pinstripe suit was almost identical to one Victoria was seen in last week at the launch of her clothing line in Germany , which Katie also wore without a shirt .
Double take : Katie Holmes stepped out in a look strikingly similar to old friend Victoria Beckham despite the fact that they are no longer pals
As they were : Similarly - dressed Katie and Victoria at Paris Fashion Week in 2006
And her hair also looked suspiciously shorter , and more elfin - like , just like Posh's .
The Cruises famously welcomed the Beckhams with open arms upon their high - profile arrival in Los Angeles in July last year after David signed for LA Galaxy .
Katie and Posh have n't been seen together for five months , when the Beckhams attended the Cruises ' housewarming party .
Posh was noticeably absent at the preview performances or the launch night of Katie 's Broadway debut in All My Sons .
Despite their spokesman claiming they are all still the best of friends , only Tom has been seen with David Beckham , at one of his football games for team LA Galaxy .
The fashionable friends apparently fell out after the former Dawson 's Creek actress became jealous when Posh was asked to appear on the front cover of Vogue magazine .
This post was originally published in 2008
The tips and techniques explained may be outdated .
Continuing from a recent tutorial , Create a Vibrant Blog Design in Adobe Photoshop , we 'll now look at taking the concept and implementing it into an actual webpage constructed in xhtml and css .
By exporting the imagery from Photoshop and coding up the page we 'll produce a working example of the overall blog design .
At the end of the last tutorial , we had created a complete mockup of the front page including overall layout , colour and design , proposed typography and sample content .
Now it 's time to review the concept and plan out which elements can be created in pure xhtml and css , and which parts require the use of images .
The first element to be exported is the large background .
All other layers are hidden and a large selection of the document is exported through the Save for Web and Devices option .
On first impressions it 's easy to think that such a large image is going to be too large in filesize for website design , but in actual fact the outcome is only 30 kb with optimised jpeg compression , balancing between image quality and overall file weight .
The main content area is then exported , making another large selection including the whole centre panel along with the visual effects such as shadow and transparent border effect .
The upper sidebar is also included in this area due to the complex use of transparency
To allow the webpage to expand vertically , a section of the lower content area is exported that will repeat vertically .
To finish off the layout of the webpage the footer area is exported , a selection around the image is made that matches the overall width and includes the grey gradient of the graphic .
In order to export the sidebar , the main content area is temporarily stretched vertically .
Because the concept makes use of individual sidebar sections the graphic will make use of two images – an upper section that is long enough to accommodate more than the sections will ever be realistically , and a small bottom section that crops off the long section into the individual panels .
This is a similar approach to the sliding doors techniques used on menus .
The long slip is exported , including the transparency effects of the border in the selection .
Next up is the thin bottom section that finished off the sidebar section .
A thin slip is exported from the menu background , this is another image than can be repeated horizontally depending on the length of the menu text .
The transparency of PNG files is taken advantage of here to allow the menu to be overlaid on the varied colours of the background .
The individual post areas on the concept use the same border effects as the sidebar , but because they do n't overlap onto the background and do n't have any complex transparency they will be made purely with css .
The lower section of the content panels however use a slight blue gradient , this can simply be exported as a thin strip that will be repeated horizontally .
The little comment bubble , arrow , rss and email icons are then individually exported along with the blog logo .
The complete concept has now been separated into individual images , a total of 13 images will make up the page , five of which are layout specific .
The complete size of the combined images comes to 95 kb , which even for the minority still on dial up will soon download when viewing the webpage .
A html webpage is setup to contain the structure of the layout .
A separate css style sheet is linked from the document which will include visual rules for the design .
A div with an id of container is added which will allow the content to be centred and one of the backgrounds to be fixed to .
Remember we also have a thin background image that will repeat vertically , until CSS3 is more widely supported a second div is required to place this image onto .
A H1 tag is used to state the website name , and will also be the base for the logo .
The upper navigation and rss / email subscription options are laid out as unordered lists .
The CSS for the layout of the page is then written , starting with a reset to remove any browser defaults .
The large background image is attached to the body and global font style setup .
The container , content and footer divs are also styled with the appropriate background images .
Continuing with the CSS styling , the code for the design of the individual elements is then added , setting up the header one and unordered lists to display the appropriate images and colours .
With this initial coding in place the html can be previewed in the browser , so far the layout is displayed centrally on the page with logo and navigation in place .
Next up is to flesh out the post snippets , using a container around the post will allow the styling of the panel as we mentioned earlier , instead of using images .
CSS styling for this section of the page adds the colours and border to the panel and sets up the styling of the post title and paragraph text .
With the site being related to web development , the majority of the viewers are likely to be Firefox users , this means we can use the moz - border - radius to display rounded corners on the panel as per the original concept .
For other browsers this will simply degrade to a square corner .
Testing this in the browser then shows this styling for real , showing how the use of CSS background color and border can recreate the original effect from Photoshop .
The html structure for the sidebar is then laid out , using a container on the sidebar sections allows the use of the two background images that make up the sliding doors technique for the expanding of the sidebar content .
More CSS styling is added to manipulate the html elements , customising the sizing , colour and typography .
The sidebar styling can then be seen in the browser , notice how the long image used for the sidebar sections is cropped shorter depending on the length of the content within them .
Next up is to quickly go back to the post snippet and add the read more option and comments information .
Styling for these elements is then added , using specific classes on the two paragraphs allows the comment bubble and read more arrow icons to be added as background images .
The panel is then complete and viewable in the browser , the repeating of the thin background image gives the impression of a solid panel on which the text is set .
The overall layout is then complete , although still in concept stages the page can now be viewed in the browser in order to gain a feel of how it will display at varied resolutions as well as simulating the hover effects of the links .
As always with web design , once the site is created the work never stops there .
Testing in Firefox , Opera and Safari went without issue , however Internet Explorer had other intentions .
A few modifications to the CSS styling soon ironed out the problems .
Changing the styling of the navigation from an inline block to it 's default block format and adjusting the floating did the job .
The subscription options seemed to be suffering from the stepping problem as commonly experienced in IE , this is simply fixed by adding display : inline to the list items .
Soon after implementing these changes the site was back to normal and ready for construction as a WordPress theme , where a little more styling will be required to cover the generated coding and of course , the inner page with comment area .
While it would have been nice to explain every line of code in more detail , the article would have lasted forever and probably become quite repetitive .
Hopefully by viewing the complete html and css you 'll be able to see how each element is constructed .

When a banana ripens , it turns yellow — unless you look at it under a black light , in which case , it appears bright blue , a new study has found .
The banana 's blue glow was discovered by scientists at the University of Innsbruck in Austria and Columbia University in New York , the first team to look for this phenomenon in bananas .
The researchers think the coloring is related to the degradation of chlorophyll that occurs as the banana ripens and could aid animals who eat bananas and can see in the ultraviolet range of the spectrum Chlorophyll is the green pigment present in plants that allows them to obtain energy from light during photosynthesis .
As the banana ripens , the chlorophyll begins to break down — a process called catabolism — and the resulting products are concentrated in the banana peel .
Under ultraviolet light , more commonly known as black light , these breakdown products fluoresce , or glow , blue .
" Surprisingly , this blue luminescence has been entirely overlooked , " said study team leader Bernhard Kräutler of the University of Innsbruck .
Before the team 's discovery , detailed in the Oct. 10 early online edition of the journal Angewandte Chemie , fluorescing chlorophyll catabolytes , or products of breakdown , had only been found in higher plants and were short - lived .
While the banana 's blue glow does diminish as it ripens , its catabolytes are unusually long - lived .
This long duration could be due to one of the breakdown products identified in the banana peel by the team , which has a stabilizing effect and has never been seen before as a chlorophyll breakdown product .
Just why this degradation occurs differently in the banana fruit than other plants , even banana leaves , is n't completely known , but Kräutler has a couple hunches .
" In contrast to humans , many of the animals that eat bananas can see light in the UV range , " he said .
" The blue luminescence of the banana fruit could give them a distinct signal that the fruit is ripe . "
Another possibility is that the chlorophyll breakdown products also serve a biological function for the banana , as the stable products could help keep the fruit viable for longer , Kräutler said .
The Albany Project :
Now we get to see and hear " Shotgun " Randy Kuhl ( R - Hair Club for Men ) say on camera that he " firmly believes " that Democrats want the American People to suffer and to hurt . "
No , really .
Here 's the exact quote :
I firmly believe the Democratic majority wants the American public to suffer and to hurt so that they can make some political gains at election time , and I think that 's wrong .
Excuse me , Randy ?
Did you really just say that ?
The tape does n't lie , I guess .
I have just about enough of this crap from GOP dweebs nationwide , but this addition to their 2008 Hall of Shame is simply beyond the pale .
I understand that Randy is polling well behind progressive Eric Massa and that desperate times call for desperate measures and all , but this is ridiculous .
Another day , another McCarthyite .
The hate and vitriol pouring through this election is bone chilling to me .
I 'm trying to understand how we can ever go back to being an United States of America .
Kuhl is polling behind his Democratic rival , Blue America candidate Eric Massa .
( See the ad we ran in that district here )
It will be a happy day to see a progressive not insane with hate representing the 29th District of NY .
Random Sports Jerseys , I think you know the type .
It ’s that jersey of a high draft pick that never made it .
The jersey of the aging star who turned a quick trick with another team for the cash , or of the player who put together a few good games and made you excited enough to go out and buy his number to put on your back .
I ’m sure any fan who has a few jerseys , has at least one that they keep in their closet , because they are too embarrassed to wear it out in public .
The jersey of Bruce Smith in the photo to the left is an example that I recently captured on my mobile phone camera .
( yeah , it looks like ass ) Sure a Bruce Smith # 78 from the Bills is a classic , which can be worn for generations , but did you really need to invest in his Redskins Jersey ?
While he played 3 seasons with the Skins , that ended 7 years ago .
I think it ’s time to move on .
I myself have a couple of jerseys that have been retired from my regular rotation .
Being a hockey fan from Washington , I have the Jaromir Jagr sweater that I paid $ 180 for .
The only reason I was able to retire the Jagr jersey is because I have a few other Capitals jerseys to choose from .
It is for that reason that I still wear my # 56 Lavar Arrington Redskins jersey , since I have no other Redskins jersey in my collection .
It may be time to look for some new burgundy and gold to purchase , although I feel lucky that I am not one of the suckers that bought his Giants jersey .
I think the cause of Random Jersey Syndrome is pretty clear .
These things are damn expensive , so once you finally plunk down the cash to get that professional weight authentic jersey , you do n’t want to put it in the yard sale just because Heath Shuler ’s career did n’t turn out exactly as you had hoped .
I guess that is why throwbacks sell so well , you know those guys will never turn lame on you .
Of course tell that to the guy who purchased an O.J. Simpson jersey at his Hall of Fame induction .
The website , Straight Cash Homey Dot Net , has the ultimate collection of Random Jersey Photos .
Each day they feature another jersey that has been sent to them by folks like yourself on the internet .
I have put together a gallery of some of my favorites .
( The photos with people pointing really crack me up )
While you check out the gallery , please be on the lookout for any that you may have in your closet .
If you do see that Ryan Leaf jersey that you have so proudly been wearing , it may be time to look into buying something new .
Let us know in the comments section what Random Jerseys you have in your collection .
Of all the advantages Gov. Sarah Palin has brought to the GOP ticket , the most important may be that she has gotten into Barack Obama 's head .
How else to explain Sen .
Obama 's decision to go one - on - one against " Sarah Barracuda , " captain of the Wasilla High state basketball champs ?
It 's a matchup he 'll lose .
If Mr. Obama wants to win , he needs to remember he 's running against John McCain for president , not Mrs. Palin for vice president .
Michael Dukakis spent the last months of the 1988 campaign calling his opponent 's running mate , Dan Quayle , a risky choice and even ran a TV ad blasting Mr. Quayle .
The Bush / Quayle ticket carried 40 states .
Adlai Stevenson spent the fall of 1952 bashing Dwight Eisenhower 's running mate , Richard Nixon , calling him " the kind of politician who would cut down a redwood tree , and then mount the stump and make a speech for conservation . "
The Republican ticket carried 39 of 48 states .
If Mr. Obama keeps attacking Mrs. Palin , he could suffer the fate of his Democratic predecessors .
These assaults highlight his own tissue - thin résumé , waste precious time better spent reassuring voters he is up for the job , and diminish him -- not her .
This weekend the Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , told his followers he had lost hope of reaching agreement with China about the future of his homeland .
The BBC's Asia analyst Jill McGivering assesses what this means .
The Dalai Lama has championed a " middle path " policy with China For decades , the Dalai Lama 's approach to China has been cheerfully patient and optimistic .
So the announcement he is giving up attempts to persuade China to grant greater autonomy to Tibet will come as a shock to many .
He has expressed frustration before - and threatened to go into political retirement .
But the key question now is what implications this announcement will have .
Will it lead , for example , to a hardening of position by the Tibetan government - in - exile , if the Dalai Lama 's middle ground of modest autonomy within China is abandoned ?
And does it also mean that the Dalai Lama wants to extract himself personally from the political fray ?
That too is unclear .
Mounting anger
The full answers may not emerge until after a special meeting of Tibetan exiles , now scheduled for November .
It is clear that frustration in the Tibet camp has rarely been greater .
In the aftermath of the riots in Tibet and surrounding areas earlier in 2008 , China promised fresh talks .
Some Tibetans said at the time that they feared this was an empty gesture , merely designed to ease international pressure on Beijing in the run up to the Olympics .
The apparent deadlock in the talks seems to have confirmed those fears .
There is also confusion about what new strategy might emerge from the Tibetan camp .
Riots broke out in several Tibetan areas in March Despite China 's allegations , the Dalai Lama has always stopped short of a demand for full independence .
But pressure for independence has grown amongst a feistier young generation which feels years of attempts at compromise have achieved nothing .
It is unlikely the Dalai Lama would support a pro-independence policy , but there may be some hardening of the Tibetan position .
Bowing out ?
As a political ploy , the Dalai Lama 's move does help to push Tibet back into the spotlight .
Post - Olympics , many Tibetans feel forgotten .
And there is also the wider question of whether the Dalai Lama may indeed decide this is the time to extract himself from the political process in which he 's been engaged for so long .
That would have striking implications .
His international profile is one of Tibet 's strongest cards and the government - in - exile would surely be weakened without his advocacy .
But his absence would also raise the stakes for China .
Many see the Dalai Lama as Beijing 's best hope - and urge the Chinese to do business with him while they can .
They may find what comes next - in terms of policy and personality - much less acceptable .

Senator John Ensign from Nevada is the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
It ’s his job to help Republicans win Senate seats .
Tough job this year .
But , Ensign is n’t too blame .
No , he thinks Mccain is hurting the Republican Senate candidates :
“ There ’s no question the top of the ticket is affecting our Senate races and it ’s making it a lot more difficult , ” Ensign said on MSNBC .
“ It ’s a fairly toxic atmosphere out there with the financial crisis for Republicans . ”
Sure , McCain is a horrible candidate , but the GOP Senators held create that “ toxic atmosphere . ”
Like McCain , they blindly followed Bush ’s lead , which has put our nation in peril .
Yin Weimin , China 's Social Security minister , has revealed that employment is the Communist Party 's number one concern in the downturn and said the " situation is critical " .
Unemployment is expected to rise from 4 pc to 4.5 pc by the end of the year and anecdotal reports have suggested that 3 m people have already been fired in the industrial province of Zhejiang alone .
By David Shribman - October 19 , 2008
PHOENIX --
Here comes the campaign 's last offensive .
It is a massive outpouring of manpower and money , canvassing and calling , designed to get every last supporter to the polls on Election Day .
Four years ago a similar effort increased turnout by 8.3 percent in the 17 states regarded as battlegrounds .
The fact that Republican gains were greater than Democratic gains contributed to President Bush 's re-election .
Predicting turnout is only slightly less foolish than predicting the Dow Jones industrial average , but it 's likely the voting rate will be around what it was in 2004 , when 60.7 percent of eligible Americans went to the polls , the highest percentage since 1968 , when turnout was 61.9 percent .
The highest turnout ever was nearly 65 percent in 1960 -- a slightly misleading figure , because African - Americans were considered eligible to vote but were in fact almost universally prevented from doing so in the South .
Thus the real turnout figure for 1960 may be as high as 67 percent .
No one expects turnout to reach those levels in 2008 .
But it is true that how an election turns out depends in large measure on who turns out .
That said , beware the groups -- there will be dozens -- who claim they are responsible for the election of the next president ; John L. Lewis thought he and his mine workers deserved credit for Franklin Roosevelt 's victory in 1936 .
It 's never that simple .
Catholics , who voted overwhelmingly for George W. Bush against the Catholic John F. Kerry in 2004 , did not elect Bush .
Neither did evangelicals , or white men who own guns or college graduates , all of whom gave Bush majorities .
" There is no single constituency that makes a difference , " says Curtis Gans , director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate .
" It is always a combination of things . "
So here is a menu of turnout considerations .
Put them together or mix and match them to elect the next president :
Black voters
About 85 percent of the black vote customarily goes to the Democratic candidate .
Bush had unusually low levels of African - American voters , winning only 8 percent in 2000 and 11 percent four years later .
The first black presidential nominee likely can count on 90 percent of the black vote as a floor , not a ceiling .
For years , politicians have been warning Democrats not to take the black vote for granted .
This year the stakes are unusually large , for a surge in black voting in certain key states -- Virginia , where blacks represent almost 20 percent of the population , and even Indiana , where blacks are only 8 percent of the population -- could turn the tide for Barack Obama .
Other Obama targets may include North Carolina ( 21 percent black ) and Georgia ( 29 percent black ) , where the Democratic ticket faces an uphill but perhaps not insurmountable path .
Young voters
These voters -- remember that someone who was part of the youth vote in one election may graduate out of that pool in the next -- turned out heavily in 2004 , with an even higher turnout among educated young people .
Indeed , voters aged 18 to 24 increased their participation to the highest level since 1992 -- an increase bigger than any other group .
In six of the last eight elections , the Democrats have won the youth vote .
Obama may not need to take it by a larger cushion than the 54 - 45 margin John F. Kerry won in 2004 , as long as he does well in narrowly defined pockets in swing states .
In short , it does n't matter whether Obama does well among students at NYU or UCLA ; he will win New York and California in any case .
But if Obama 's get - out - the - vote efforts in Charlottesville , the Research Triangle , Boulder , Madison , and Hanover and Durham , N.H. , are strong , he could be better positioned to win Virginia , North Carolina , Colorado , Wisconsin and New Hampshire .
Reagan Democrats
These voters , traditionally Democratic but drawn into the GOP by Ronald Reagan 's toughness on national - security issues and his impatience with social liberalism , are harder to predict .
But while their economic interests in 2008 may tug them toward the Democrats , they may be skittish of Obama and his air of elitism -- which is why Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska has emphasized that theme this autumn .
Although the definition of a " Reagan Democrat " is elusive , there likely are more men than women among them .
One slice of these voters is whites who do n't hold college degrees .
McCain 's lead among them has dropped by about half between September and early this month , to about the margin President Bush won in 2004 , but not as big as Bush won in 2000 , according to the latest Wall Street Journal / NBC News Poll .
How Reagan Democrats break may tell us a lot about how Pennsylvania , Ohio , Illinois and Missouri break next month .
Niche voters
Each swing state has its own peculiar demographic and geographic composition .
Black voters , for example , are n't the only group whose turnout may make a big difference in Virginia .
Turnout in the northern part of the state , principally the Washington suburbs , which have been becoming bluer with the years , is critical , but then again so is turnout among military families near the massive Naval installations on the coast and among voters in southwestern Virginia , both of which will likely come in strongly for Sen.
John McCain .
One especially peculiar battleground for turnout and for support is the independent vote in New Hampshire .
Nationally , the movement of independent voters to Obama is strong ; the swing in the Illinois Democrat 's direction was 17 points in a two - week period ending in early October , according to the Journal / NBC survey .
In New Hampshire , the situation is far more complex .
Many independent voters sided with McCain when he won the 2000 and 2008 Republican primaries but helped contribute to the Democrats ' general election victory in the Granite State in 2004 .
( Many also voted for Ralph Nader in 2000 , depriving Vice President Al Gore of the state 's four electoral votes -- and probably the election . )
They could swing either way this year -- and each camp will try to get a larger share of its independents to the polls than its rivals .
In its last weeks , this campaign has become a ground game .

Given all the fervor over the definition of Pluto ( planet ?
dwarf planet ? snowball ? ) , let ’s hope the debate over the discovery of a planet that lies in an equally hazy area of classification is a little calmer .
The COROT satellite recently discovered an extrasolar planet named Corot - exo - 3b .
It ’s quite a curiosity as far as exoplanets are concerned , and its characteristics – such as a density twice that of lead – may force astronomers to rethink the distinction between massive planets and low - mass brown dwarfs .
Corot - exo - 3b is orbiting close to its star , and takes 4 days and 6 hours to complete one orbit .
For comparison , Mercury orbits the Sun every 88 days .
It ’s also roughly the same size as Jupiter , but far more dense , totaling a whopping 21.6 times Jupiter ’s mass .
This makes classification of the object a bit tricky .
“ COROT - exo - 3 b might turn out to be a rare object found by sheer luck .
But it might just be a member of a new - found family of very massive planets that encircle stars more massive than our Sun .
We ’re now beginning to think that the more massive the star , the more massive the planet , ” said Dr Francois Bouchy , from the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris ( IAP ) , a member of the team that discovered the object .
Because of its extreme density , Corot - exo - 3b lies in the shady area of classification between planet and brown dwarf .
Brown dwarfs are massive bodies ( between about 13 and 80 times the mass of Jupiter ) that do n’t make the cut for fusing hydrogen in their cores – and thus do n’t shine in optical wavelengths – yet are much more massive that what is normally classified as a planet .
Brown dwarfs can fuse deuterium even at lower masses ( above 13 Jupiter masses ) , and lithium in masses above 65 that of Jupiter .
Planets generally form out of a disk of dust and gas that surrounds the early star they orbit , and then are pulled in closer due to friction with the debris that lies in their orbit .
The close orbit and very short orbital period of Corot - exo - 3b was likely caused by this effect .
The COROT satellite initially discovered the planet by measuring the change in the brightness of the host star as the planet passes in front of it .
As the planet moves in front of the star , it slightly darkens the visible light , and then the star brightens once again as the planet moves behind it .
The bigger the planet , the more it will darken the light coming from the star .
The pull of a planet as it moves around its star can also redshift or blueshift the light coming from the star , and this shift can give information as to the mass of the planet .
Follow - up observations of the planet were done by a collaboration of scientists from around the world , led by Dr. Magali Deleuil from the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille ( LAM ) .
Their results will be published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics .

NASA 's MESSENGER spacecraft caught this view of the planet Mercury during an Oct. 6 , 2008 flyby .
Scientistsare tackling new oddities at the planet Mercury via images beamed home by aNASA spacecraft that zoomed past the small , rocky world earlier this month .
NASA ’sMESSENGER spacecraft returned 1,287 new views of Mercury during an Oct. 6 flyby , the second this year , which revealed nearly a third of the planet thathad never seen before .
The result : visions of Mercury ’s westernhemisphere showing an area that is 30 percent smoother than the planet ’seastern half .
“ Weneed to think hard about why that ’s actually the case , ” said MariaZuber , a MESSENGER co-investigator at MIT in a Wednesday briefing .
During thismonth ’s encounter , MESSENGER ’s cameras caught an odd feature onMercury , a so - called “ wrinkle ridge ” some 1,968 feet ( 600 meters ) high , about twice the height of similar features seen on Mars , suggesting theplanet has contracted in on itself considerably as it cooled , Zuber added .
The newphotos show some empty craters on Mercury lying next to others nearby that arefilled in by vast , solidified lava flows .
One such crater was filled with somuch solidified lava that , on Earth it would bury the Baltimore - Washington , D.C. , metropolitan area in a layer 12 times the height of the 555 - foot ( 169 - meter ) Washington Monument .
“ That ’san awful lot of volcanic material in one place for such a little planet , ” Zuber said .
“ A lot has been going on inside of it to cause melting thatthen extruded to the surface . ”
Images fromMESSENGER ’s first swing past Mercury earlier this year yielded evidencethat ancient volcanic activity , not space rock impacts , shaped theplanet ’s smooth plains .
Altogether , MESSENGER 's two flybys and NASA 's earlier Mariner 10 mission have mapped about 95 percent of Mercury 's surface , reserachers said .
Otherinstruments aboard MESSENGER found strong interactions between Mercury ’smagnetic field and the sun ’s solar wind , which led to supercharged energyexchanges equivalent to the output of about 100 medium - sized power plants on Earth , researchers said .
“ Thatwas just a knock - your - socks - off observation , ” said Brian Anderson , MESSENGER ’s deputy project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel , Md. “ We were n’t expecting itto be that intense at all . ”
Thespacecraft also spotted magnesium in Mercury ’s wispy , tenuous atmospherefor the first time .
Infrared views of the planet ’s surface revealed moreviews of material that currently defies identification , but shows up dark bluein enhanced images .
“ Wereally want to get into orbit so we can get some geochemical measurements ofthis material so I can stop saying blue material , ” said Mark Robinson , aMESSENGER co-investigator at Arizona State University , adding that the oddstuff could be some sort of opaque mineral .
MESSENGER , short for MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry , and Ranging , is thefirst spacecraft to take a close look at Mercury since NASA ’s Mariner 10 probe zipped by the planet three times in 1974 and 1975 .
But unlikeMariner 10 , the $ 446 million MESSENGER mission is destined to circle Mercury for at least a year once itenters orbit on March 18 , 2011 .
The spacecraft launched in August 2004 and flewby Earth once and Venus twice before zipping past Mercury for the first time onJan. 14 to use each planet ’s gravitational pull to tweak its flight path forthe 2011 rendezvous .
The Oct.6 Mercury flyby was MESSENGER ’s second of three planned swings pastthe planet .
The third is set for September 2009 .
As if there were not enough real enemies to fight , the United States has been at war with itself in recent years .
They call it the culture war .
It has generated more hot air than most real wars in history .
John McCain has now turned to its red army tactics to rescue himself from impending defeat - and Sarah Palin is his Katyusha .
" There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America , " declared the conservative nationalist Pat Buchanan at the Republican national convention in 1992 .
" It is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself . "
Later that year he explained that " the Bosnia of the cultural war is abortion " .
As Buchanan foresaw , this has been a war for power : not military power , but the kind that comes from shaping the norms , beliefs and values by which people live , and the meanings attached to words like liberalism , patriotism or , indeed , culture .
The two sides in this war came to be labelled red and blue , after the colouring of Republican and Democratic states on electoral maps .
No one has generated more hot air in this cause than Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly , who in 2006 published a book proudly called Culture Warrior .
He describes the culture war as a battle between traditionalists ( " T - Warriors " ) like himself and " the committed forces of the secular - progressive movement that want to change America dramatically : mold it in the image of western Europe " .
Like Europe !
God , how horrible .
O'Reilly labels these secular - progressive forces " S - P " , and identifies George Soros as " El Jefe of the S - P forces " .
In a fashion disturbingly familiar to any student of the 20th century , he illustrates this passage with an unflattering photo of the financier - philanthropist , captioned " George Soros , S - P Jefe , puppet master , and moneyman " .
" Born George Schwartz to a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930 , " he explains , " Soros assumed the identity of a gentile boy when the Nazis invaded at the start of world war II . "
This is what they call a Fox Fact .
( It was Soros 's father who changed the family name in 1936 and the Nazis did not invade Hungary until 1944 : three errors in the space of one innuendo . )
Anyway , what should that personal history have to do with an argument about cultural and social policies in 21st - century America ?
Excoriating " leftwing outfits like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the British Broadcasting Company " ( Foxy Fact - checking again : it's the British Broadcasting Corporation ) , O'Reilly pounds the hot buttons of the culture war with a ham fist : abortion , drugs , gay marriage , not celebrating Christmas , atheism , the liberal or - as he prefers - " S - P " media and elites .
The New York Times , he says in an afterword to the paperback edition , has " morphed into a brochure for secular - progressive causes " .
And so it goes on .
And on .
Does this matter ?
Over the past decade it has mattered a lot .
The framing of the political debate in cultural conservative terms - a counter - revolution against the cultural revolution of 1968 - contributed significantly to George Bush 's election victories in 2000 and 2004 .
And one way of understanding the direction taken by the McCain campaign over the past few weeks is this : only the culture war can win it for us now .
On Iraq , we lose .
On the economy , we lose .
But by caricaturing the liberal otherness of a candidate called Barack Obama , perhaps we can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat .
Enter Sarah Palin , the Katyusha rocket of red America .
( I trust she wo n't mind a Russian analogy since , as she has informed us , you - or at least she - can see Russia from Alaska . )
The selection of such an obviously under-qualified candidate for vice - president can only be explained by electoral calculation , and that calculation has everything to do with the politics of the country 's cultural civil war .
Her kind of down - home populist inveighing against Washington elites ( add " liberal " or " S - P " according to taste ) is part of the well - tried semantic armoury of the red army .
Katyusha Palin now leads the attacks on Obama .
This week she has repeatedly tried to tar - and - feather him by association with former terrorist William Ayers .
The not - even - subliminal message is : he 's not like us , he 's like them .
The others : elites , liberals , subversives , immigrants and infidels , closet Europeans !
Chapter one of O'Reilly 's Culture Warrior begins with an imagined 2020 state of the union speech by a president of the United States called Gloria Hernandez : hispanic , and a woman to boot .
Worse still , she celebrates the United States as " a diversified nation striving to be at peace with the world " .
How terrifying .
How blood - curdling .
Give us President Palin any day .
For Gloria Hernandez read Barack Obama .
Or " that one " , as McCain disrespectfully referred to him in Tuesday night 's presidential debate .
At the moment , the tactic is n't working .
This election is about the economy , stupid .
The pocketbook trumps the prayer book .
However much McCain lauds himself as a " maverick " , he can't disassociate himself from eight years of Republican rule that are ending in the biggest financial crisis since 1929 and a near - doubling of the national debt .
And Obama is better on the economy : clearer , more specific , always bringing it back to the everyday struggles of ordinary Americans .
In the instant - reaction polls , a clear majority thought Obama won that debate , as he is winning in most of the polls both nationwide and in key battleground states .
Even if the red - clawed tactics of culture war do n't pull Obama down at the last minute , an Obama victory wo n't spell the end of this war .
But perhaps it may spell the beginning of the end .
Let 's be clear : this war will not finish with a victory of blue over red , or vice versa .
It will finish with the accepted , peaceful coexistence in one society of different faiths , value systems and lifestyles - along the lines laid down centuries ago by the classical liberalism of John Locke and others , which so much influenced this country 's Founding Fathers .
It wo n't be " liberals " ( in the perverted sense in which that word is now used in the United States ) trouncing conservatives , but classical liberalism re-made for the 21st century .
It wo n't be blue obliterating red , but red , white and blue - as in Obama 's healing promise earlier in this campaign , that there are not red states and blue states , just the United States .
The world needs the United States to get over its cultural civil war , and get over it fast .
Not that these moral , cultural and social issues are unimportant .
They are among the most important things .
But they are also among the most private things .
The business of government and the law should be confined to providing a liberal ( in the classical sense ) framework in which men and women can make personal choices about private goods .
That should be only a small part of what government does .
By contrast , the central business of government is to provide public goods such as national and personal security , the regulation of markets in which private enterprise can flourish , the international development that is in all our national interests , and a clean environment using diversified , sustainable energy supplies .
That 's what the United States needs from its new president , and that 's what the world needs from the United States .

Cave Story evokes nostalgia , which is weird , considering that the game is only four years old .
The pixilated graphics and action / adventure style of gameplay are supposed to remind you of a simpler time when the only ways to go were left , right , up or down – and you started your quest with just one gun and three hearts .
At first , I mistook it for something my teenage babysitter used to play to entertain me when I was a kid ( his favorite was Bonk ’s Adventure , mine was Metroid ) .
But after listening to the demo handler discuss the details – especially the part about how hands - on the Japanese creator is with this WiiWare version – I got my story straight and started looking for reasons why gamers would want to regress to this kind of gameplay .
The thing I noticed right away was the story .
It was surprisingly deep , well - written , and it moved damn quick .
At the end of the first area , I came to a village of rabbit people arguing about what to do with an evil doctor and a chick that kept herself locked away in a room .
There was also a short , creepy scene with a guy at a computer terminal running out of food and pleading for his sister to come save him .
Heavy stuff .
I met the first boss in the rabbit village – a dude who can best be described as a suitcase .
His co-minion ( a chick ) , made off with one of the rabbit girls and he was left behind to deal with me .
He asked if I wanted to fight , and I said no .
And he left .
I did a double take .
I just talked my way out of a boss fight .
That ’s not something I remember doing in Castlevania or Contra , or any other old game that Cave Story seems to be emulating .
Everything else feels familiar , though .
The enemies , the sprites and the backgrounds all have a retro , pixilated feel to it ( although the game has gotten a full graphical overhaul for the Wii ) .
You start out without being able to shoot anything , and then you find a gun and level it up so you can shoot bigger and better kinds of blasts .
When you go under water , you have an air gauge of 100 that refills when you come up for air .
You also find keys and access cards and heart containers to expand your life .
The save points are little floppy disks ( remember those ? ) , and the entire thing will support the Classic Controller – so you can pretend you ’re playing a SNES while pretending you ’re playing a twenty year old game .
Overall , I really liked Cave Story .
You can tell that a lot of thought , time and energy went into making it and even if you ’ve never playing any game in your life that would lend it some kind of nostalgia , it just feels fun to play .
Can you really ask for more from a WiiWare title ?
Cave Story should be out in time for the holidays , unless something horrible happens and the push it to early January .

Sitting in the lobby of Washington DC's Mayflower Hotel , Bob Barr nursed a grande Starbucks and shook his head at the debate a mile away on Capitol Hill .
" People are asking : What in God 's name is happening to our economic structure and the economic underpinnings of our country ? " he said .
" How have we gotten to this point where trillions of dollars are being absolutely squandered , both currently and prospectively , on ' bail - outs ' that we know are n't going to work ? "
Barr was the Libertarian party 's 2008 candidate for president .
He entered the race in May , after trying to coax Republican iconoclast Ron Paul out of his quixotic bid against John McCain and into the small - government third party .
Paul spent $ 35 m and Barr spent $ 1.2 m on nationwide campaigns that warned Americans that government had grown too large and invasive , that the Federal Reserve had overcooked the economy and that inflation was risking America 's superpower status .
In September , the warnings of Paul and Barr seemed to come true .
An economic crisis that started with the subprime market meltdown has not been slowed , in their view or in the views of most people , by the $ 700 bn bail - out signed into law October 3 .
Both McCain and Barack Obama voted for it .
A majority of voters said , in the election exit polls , that they opposed it .
Yet Barr got only around 510,000 votes for president .
If this was n't a good time to be a libertarian politician , what would be a good time ?
It 's hard to say , because libertarians , like their fellow travellers in the conservative movement , are at a loss on how to move forward .
The growing consensus in America is that Obama must act as boldly as Franklin Roosevelt did to save industries , restore confidence in markets and reinforce the safety net for less well - off citizens .
The cover of the post- election Time magazine got literal and caricatured Obama as FDR , the steward of a New New Deal .
But libertarians were not merely opposed to the New Deal .
It was anathema to their beliefs .
It was the antithesis , they thought , to what America stood for .
" Rooseveltism , Hitlerism , Stalinism are all only local variants of the common doctrine that man has no natural rights but only such as are created for him by the state , " wrote libertarian scholar Albert Jay Nock in 1937 .
But modern libertarian thinkers and economists are not so dogmatic , or so reflexively anti-intervention , as Nock was .
Amity Shales , an economic writer and historian who last year published a blockbuster , anti-New Deal history of the Great Depression , The Forgotten Man , has endorsed the idea of bail - out money for Wall Street , as long as it does not require management from Washington .
( The current bail - out plan is a bit of a hash of both ideas . )
Megan McArdle , a libertarian editor at the Atlantic Monthly , was more conflicted .
The dogmatic libertarian position on the bail - out – the one that , as it happened , Republicans in the House of Representatives held , as they shot down the first attempt at a bail - out in late September – was to oppose it .
But McArdle chastised them for doing so .
" I find it hard to believe that they 're voting their conscience ; they 're voting their electoral interest in November .
I hope their constituencies enjoy the bank panic . "
All of this was happening as the official candidate of the Libertarian party , like previous standard - bearer Ron Paul , was denouncing the very idea of such market interference .
But even libertarians who completely opposed the idea of the bail - out , and are wary of any more government interventions , split in their reactions .
Scholars at the Cato Institute , the largest and most influential libertarian thinktank , bordered on buoyant when they told the Washington Post that they were ready for a real ideological battle again .
Over at the Ludwig von Mises Institute , an Alabama thinktank that attacks the sellouts at Cato ( the charge : they are part of a " Kochtopus " that takes money from billionaire David Koch to accommodate Washington power ) , pronounced the death of the American system and the " mother of all depressions " if the bail - out passed .
American liberals are divided about the new spirit of government intervention , too .
Most Democrats in the House of Representatives opposed the bail - out .
They , however , have reasons to be optimistic about the coming flurry of government experimentation and intervention .
Libertarians like Barr are shocked , surprised and as of right now divided on how to adapt .
SAN FRANCISCO --
Recent alarming reports of environmental damage caused by illegal marijuana farms in national forests and wilderness areas in California and elsewhere show that an entirely new approach is needed in order to solve the problem , officials of the Marijuana Policy Project said today .
" Year after year we hear from law enforcement and U.S. Forest Service officials about growing environmental damage caused by these criminal operations , even as law enforcement seizures of marijuana plants set new records every year , " said Bruce Mirken , MPP 's California - based director of communications .
" What we 've been doing is plainly not working and has actually caused the problem in the first place .
It 's time to get off the treadmill and try a new approach . "
The annual marijuana harvest season each fall brings increased discussion of the hopeless process of eradicating outdoor marijuana crops on public land .
Growers are damaging precious natural resources and their livelihood continues unabated even as police achieve record marijuana seizures each year .
Fortunately , the Marijuana Policy Project has introduced the only plan that could possibly address the problem : Seriously .
Who in their right mind could possibly contend that we are on pace to bring this mess under control ?
For decades , cops in combat fatigues have been rappelling from helicopters armed with industrial strength hedge - clippers and for what ?
Marijuana is the number one cash crop in America and that is n’t going to change no matter how many police we send off on these ridiculous drug war nature hikes .
Californians should be allowed to grow marijuana on their own property for all the same reasons that they are currently permitted to grow grapes and make wine .
Like fashion , music trends go in cycles .
Artists get nostalgic for the stuff they listened to as kids and try to bring it back .
That 's why there are music fads from the 80s and 90s due to jump back on center stage at any moment .
Ladies and gentlemen , there must be a way to stop them .
Here are trends that must remain in the past ... at all costs .

7 Child Exploitation in Rap
At an age when you were having your first wet dreams about April O'Neil ( or , in some cases , Krang ) , some kids were actually making something of their pubescence .
Perhaps due to the tragic post - 80s decline of the Jackson Five , in the 90s the world just needed children rapping .

Hillary Clinton could be named secretary of State and Clinton is among those being strongly considered .
Hillary Clinton could be sec. of state
Several Obama transition advisers are strongly advocating Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) for secretary of state , a move that would create the ultimate “ Team of Rivals ” Cabinet , according to officials involved in the discussions .
President - elect Obama has narrowed the possibilities for secretary of state , and Clinton is among those being strongly considered , the officials said .
Some even call her the favorite .

It is not known what Obama himself thinks of the idea .
But the fact that it is being entertained within his camp shows how much things have changed in the months since he defeated her for the Democratic nomination in a protracted primary marathon .
A possible clue to Obama ’s willingness to consider Clinton for chief diplomat can be found in a January interview he gave to Katie Couric , anchor and managing editor of the “ CBS Evening News . ”
As part of her “ Primary Questions ” series , she asked him what books besides the Bible he would considers essential if he were elected president .
“ Doris Kearns Goodwin 's book ‘ Team of Rivals , ’ ” Obama replied .
“ It was a biography of Lincoln .
And she talks about Lincoln 's capacity to bring opponents of his and people who have run against him in his cabinet .
And he was confident enough to be willing to have these dissenting voices and confident enough to listen to the American people and push them outside of their comfort zone .
And I think that part of what I want to do as president is push Americans a little bit outside of their comfort zone .
It 's a remarkable study in leadership . ”
Obama is exceedingly confident now , in a way that only a president of the United States can be .
And officials say that therefore the calculation is very different than it was when he was picking a vice president , and did not seriously consider her .
During the general election , she campaigned tirelessly on his behalf throughout the country .
Even officials who like the idea held up strong “ caution ” flags .
Fresh off his electoral triumph , Obama does not feel he needs the Clintons .
The president - elect has never liked the idea of former President Bill Clinton as a back - seat driver .
And the former president has had many tangled foreign business dealings that could complicate his wife ’s entry into an administration that is promising transparency .
But some Obama advisers argue that her celebrity and credibility would be a huge asset in his goal of reengaging the United States with allies .
“ You can send John Kerry or Chuck Hagel , ” said one adviser , mentioning some other candidates for secretary of state , “ or you can send Hillary Clinton .
That ’s totally different . ”
Clinton would be most attractive if Obama concludes that he will have to focus his early days in office on the domestic economy , and will have to essentially outsource heavy - duty foreign travel to his secretary of state .
The officials said Clinton becomes even more attractive if Obama retains President Bush ’s last secretary of defense , Robert Gates .
Some Obama advisers are advocated that course because he would provide cover for drawing down troops in Iraq : Gates has said he believes that is possible , and it would keep Obama out of a fight he can’t afford with Army Gen.
David Petraeus , now the head of the U.S. Central Command .
The Clinton camp refused to comment on the possibility .
Senior adviser Philippe Reines said : “ Any speculation about Cabinet or other administration appointments is really for President - elect Obama 's transition team to address . ”
An Obama adviser threw out one final rationale :
It ’s better to have the Clintons inside the tent than outside , causing trouble .

Science reporter , BBC News , The Hague
Ministers took the view that hi-tech investments would help the economy
Member states of the European space agency ( Esa ) have agreed a 10 bn - euro budget at their meeting in The Hague .
The figure , which covers the next three to five years , represents a substantial increase in funding .
Ministers said the investment in space would help European industry pull through the current economic downturn .
The new money will help build new Earth observation satellites , maintain Esa 's participation in the space station , and fund probes to the planets .
" The decisions of this ministerial conference are very important just in the middle of an economic crisis , " said Peter Hintze , the minister who led the German delegation .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Because money paid for high technology is good money for the European economy ; and I think it will help us to leave the economic crisis [ behind ] and to gain new economic strength , " he told BBC News .
It took the science ministers from Esa 's 18 member states two days of intense discussions to arrive at the budget figure .
Agency officials had drawn up a " wish list " valued at 10.4bn euros and hoped to get at least 90 % of that figure .
It the end , their expectations were exceeded , with the meeting approving a budget line of 9.9bn - over a billion more than the commitments made the last time the ministers met in Berlin in 2005 .
" I never expected that , " conceded Esa director general Jean - Jacques Dordain .
" It demonstrates that the member states , number one , believe in what space can do for the citizens ; number two , they believe in Esa as a successful organisation ; and number three , that in a period of economic crisis , this is the right time to invest into the future . "
In 2008 , Europe attached its Columbus lab to the space station
The two biggest contributors were Germany , at 2.7bn , and France at 2.3bn .
The Italians contributed just over a billion ; the UK just under a billion .

The new budget will allow Esa to grow its basic science programme , at 3.5 % a year , whilst at the same time starting a number of new programmes .
Europe 's Ariane 5 rocket , which has come to dominate the commercial launcher market , will now be upgraded to allow it to carry heavier payloads than its current nine - tonne limit .
Ministers agreed to put almost 1.4bn euros into the ongoing activities at the International Space Station - the single biggest " ticket " on The Hague agenda .
Doubts persist that this will be sufficient to meet Esa 's commitments , in particular to launch all of its contracted unmanned ATV freighters to the platform .
But ministers agreed that if more money was required , agency officials could ask for it at a later stage .

The second phase was approved of the world 's most ambitious environmental monitoring project , known as GMES .
This will take the " pulse " of the planet and requires a series new Earth observation satellites to be launched .
A project to build the next generation of meteorological satellites was also funded .
This project actually received more money than was requested , such was the interest from France and Germany .
A study will work out how a re-entry capsule can be added to Europe's ATV
In addition , Europe will now take the first step in a plan that could eventually lead to a manned spaceship based on the robotic ATV space - station cargo - vessel .
A feasibility study will be undertaken to work out how a re-entry capsule could be added to the freighter , first to bring materials safely back from the space station but eventually , also , humans .

" The configuration of the capsule would be designed taking into account the manned version , " said Simonetta Di Pippo , Esa 's director of human spaceflight .
" So once we 've done the first step with the cargo version in , say 2017 , we can move quickly towards the manned capsule because the configuration was the right one from the beginning and we wo n't have wasted time and money passing through the cargo version , " she told BBC News .
Agency officials cautioned , however , that a crew ship was a long - term goal and depended on the money being available in the future to build it , and on the need for such a spacecraft given that the objectives of European space nations could change in the next few years .
In any case , a manned ATV would not fly before the end of the next decade .
Still time
One of the key decisions for the UK at this meeting centred on ExoMars , the robotic rover Esa intends to send to the Red Planet in 2016 to search for microbial life .
The mission has been delayed because of its high cost and the meeting was asked to make good the shortfall that exists in the one - billion - euro budget .
Not all the money was promised in The Hague , but most observers here thought the funding would be made up in time .
The UK science minister Lord Drayson said the important point was that ExoMars had been accepted by member states as an important mission for Esa .

" This is a really exciting project , " he told BBC News .
" It builds again on the UK expertise in robotics .
We expect to have a key part of the technology which enables the mission to take place , and it will be fascinating to see whether we do find evidence of life on Mars . "
On the robotics theme , the meeting also saw the agreement of Jean - Jacques Dordain to put an Esa research centre in the UK .
This will focus on space robotics and climate change science .
In another significant move , Britain pledged 121m euros to the Advanced Research in Telecommunication Systems ( Artes ) programme .
This will go into the development of ever more sophisticated satellite payloads - a particular strength of the UK .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Former President Jimmy Carter said on Friday the “ atrocious economic policies ” of the Bush administration had caused the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Carter told reporters on a stopover in Brussels that “ profligate spending , ” massive borrowing and dramatic tax cuts since President George W. Bush took office in 2001 were behind the market turmoil and economic crisis .
“ I think it ’s because of the atrocious economic policies of the Bush administration , ” said the 84 - year - old Democrat , who served in the White House from 1977 - 1981 during a period of high inflation and energy crisis .
Whoever wins next month ’s U.S. presidential election would inherit economic problems that would force them to postpone implementing some of their proposed reforms , he said .
“ The economic situation is an entrenched problem .
It is going to take years to correct what has been done economically , ” Carter said , adding he hoped Democrat Barrack Obama would win and immediately improve Washington ’s image in the world .
Eight years ago , the United States had a budget surplus , low inflation and a stable , strong economy , he said .
Carter said he was astonished that the United States now owed China “ in the neighborhood of $ 1 trillion . ”
Deregulation and what he called a withdrawal of supervision of Wall Street had encouraged irresponsible elements in the U.S. financial system , enabling banks to borrow 30 times their value .
Carter was on his way back from a private peace mission to Cyprus with fellow elder statesmen Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria and Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa , intended to give a push to talks between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders on a settlement to reunite the divided island .
A boarded - up shop in Lancashire was found to have been left in exactly the same state as when it stopped trading more than 40 years ago .
[ digg - reddit - me ] John ( may I call you John ? ) :
I guess I was wrong about you planning a strategy of making Obama seem un-American after your last debate with him .
Apparently you ’ve decided to launch this attack now .
Sarah Palin said yesterday that Obama had disqualified himself from being commander - in - chief , and today that Obama was “ palling around with terrorists ” and was “ not a man who sees America as you see America and as I see America . ”
It ’s hard to see how she can escalate the rhetoric from here .
She can call him a traitor .
She can call him a terrorist .
She can call him a Muslim .
She can say he hates America .
These are the only ways to truly go further .
Make no mistake – this is a scorched - earth strategy .
This is a strategy that attempts to define America in a way that excludes many of it ’s citizens .
If this is not an explicitly racist strategy , it is as close as a mainstream candidate can get – a candidate I might add who does not seem to be personally racist himself .
If you win with this strategy , the polarization that will accompany your administration will make the polarization of the past fourteen years seem tame .
Racial tensions will be exacerbated to a point they have not been since the late 1960s .
As this strategy is not designed on a set of policy issues or an agenda , it likely will not benefit the down - ticket candidates much at all , resulting in a expanded Democratic Congress .
The feelings in this Congress will likely be as raw as your feelings were after losing to Bush – as you lost to what was previously described to be one of the dirtiest campaigns in history .
Remember – you almost became a Democrat in this period – and opposed almost everything Bush proposed ( a fact which you ’re building on now as you constantly invokes this period to call yourself a maverick ) .
Your contempt for Bush was legendary .
And your status as a martyr for the honorable campaign that refused to go negative gave you great credibility .
Now – imagine that voters elect a Congress of the party who expected to win the White House , only to have it denied them because of a national campaign that was explicitly designed to make their standard - bearer out to be a terrorist - sympathizing , un-American , menacing black man .
Democrats will not just believe you cheated to win – but that you encouraged and played on the worst aspects of America in order to do so .
And they would be right .
If you – a Republican apparently sympathetic to most of Bush ’s policies – was driven to oppose Bush , to lead the charge against him even , by bitterness over your defeat – just imagine how much more bitter , how much angrier , Democrats would be if you were to win with a similar strategy .
Imagine the deadlock .
Imagine reaching out to this Congress .
But the timing of this attack gives me hope .
It is both too late and too early .
Those who believe smear emails have heard that Obama is a secret Muslim and hates America and all that .
And those who listen to right - wing radio have too .
But for many Americans , even as they may have been vaguely aware of such charges , have not heard anyone they trust make them – and they know charges like these have been in the background about every Democratic presidential candidate since at least Bill Clinton in 1992 .
But now Palin is bringing them up .
And these people have a choice to either trust her or not .
To trust her , these people first need to distrust several things :
The media ( who must be trying to cover up for Obama ) ; Obama ( who must be hiding his true self ) ;
The millions of Americans who voted in the Democratic primaries ( because at best , they were fooled by Obama into thinking he was a red- blooded American like them ) ; Joe Biden , Al Gore , Bill Clinton , Hillary Clinton , and many of the other Democrats who vouched for Obama ( because if Obama really was a friend of terrorists not qualified to be commander - in - chief who is un-American – and these people have personally met him and subsequently vouched for him , they must at least partially agree with him ) ;
Themselves ( because many of them thought Obama was authentic and inspired a feeling of pride in America in them – that it could produce someone like Obama ) .
It is the last step which is hardest .
Because unless they have been ardently opposed to Obama from the beginning , they must admit that you were wrong – that they were made fools of – in order to believe Palin is right and that Obama stands opposed to what they believe .
They must also distrust their perception – because most people , seeing Obama debate you , saw that he held his own if he did not win outright .
Obama was a steady , strong presence .
He was confident .
He was effective .
He seemed very much a potential commander - in - chief .
But Palin is telling them that when they saw this , they were wrong .
If this attack had been launched earlier – before most Americans had gotten to know Obama , I think it would have had a greater chance of succeeding .
If it had been launched later , and Obama would not have a month to dispel the attacks , it might have swayed more people who would feel uneasy about electing someone who had been charged with such awful things .
Which is why the timing gives me hope .
It leaves just enough time for some well - justified backlash .
And it clearly is a sign that you are growing increasingly desperate – as Obama is building a lead .
The fact that these attacks have not been launched by you until now that Obama is gaining ground will make some people distrust them .
But the key point is this :
As Abraham Lincoln said ,
You can fool all of the people some of the time , and some of the people all of the time , but you ca n’t fool all of the people all of the time .
Palin and yourself – in trying to exclude people like Obama from your definition of “ American ” – are working against what all of us have been taught in schools – our textbook understanding , our Saturday morning cartoon understanding , our life - as - it - is - lived understanding of America .
It goes against this idea of America as a combination of a melting pot , Horatio Alger , Grandma , apple pie , cowboys , Martin Luther King , Jr. , FDR , Lincoln , JFK , TR , Reagan , a city shining on a hill , a place where we judge people by not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character , a tolerant nation , a unique nation , a nation blessed by God , the nation that created jazz , baseball , and the Constitution , that sent men to the moon , that defeated the Nazis and the Communists , that fought a war against slavery , where life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness are protected , where freedom rings , where tolerance reigns , where what is right with America can cure what is wrong with America – this ideal America we aspire to and sometimes seem to almost reach .
Barack Obama represents a nation that united as one on 9/11 .
Barack Obama would never have existed in an intolerant America , in a non-diverse America , in an America that would not allow a poor child to succeed on his merits .
The America that united , with pride and patriotism , with defiance and neighborly spirit on 9/11 is precisely the America that Barack Obama is part of .
John – you and Sarah Palin can attack this America only at your own risk .
And you should be careful , lest you go down in history as a villain , instead of the American hero you once were .
Sincerely ,
A former supporter of yours in 2000 ,
Joe Campbell
P.S. Why not be a good fellow and try to make up for your sins here and donate to a good cause ?

A door designed to withstand an atom bomb swung open yesterday , and as a scruffy industrial lift rattled downwards , a hidden world under the heart of London finally gave up its secrets .
There is nothing hidden any longer about the mile of tunnels 100 feet below High Holborn and Chancery Lane , which BT , the most recent owner has just put up for sale .
But old habits die hard : this has been a twilight zone for over half a century - through the end of the war when MI6 moved in , in the years after when the Public Records Office stored 400 tonnes of classified documents here , and through the cold war , when the hotline linking presidents Eisenhower and Khrushchev ran through the most secure telephone exchange in Britain .
At the bottom of the shaft , behind a nondescript facade on Furnival Street , the only remaining entrance of the three original ways in , you turn right out of the lift into a comparatively small room - the only one still full of old switchboard equipment - then left into the mouth of a long straight tunnel .
That meant that the street directly overhead must be ... " I can't tell you that , " said supervisor Richard Bamford .
" I know , but I 'm not allowed to tell you .
This place could become a secure or semi-secret store for a bank , say , and would they want you to know that ?
" The people who constructed this place would not have been able to tell you where it was - they were not English speakers , they came from some European country , and they would not have known where they were working . "
That last revelation was one of many stories , some probably true , some surely apocryphal , which emerged yesterday as former BT workers returned yesterday to guide the first outsiders invited into the tunnels .
In the 1980s the novelist James Herbert pleaded to be allowed in but was turned down flat : regardless he set the 1984 novel Domain , with its flesh - eating mutant rats , in a world instantly recognisable to the Kingsway Tunnel crew .
All the workers signed the Official Secrets
Act when they joined : yesterday they felt free to tell stories which astonished David Hay , BT 's official historian , who has pored over all the archives about the tunnels .
He 'd never heard about the foreign workers : he'd never heard that in the Cuban missile crisis the place was locked down for a fortnight , fully staffed , with maintenance crews and caterers , water from its own artesian wells , air filtered and recycled , and enough supplies to last for months .
John
Tasker shook the door of his old office : it was locked .
He came in the mid-80s as facilities manager , and stayed for eight years as all the equipment around him - including the original 1940s generators built in Lincoln , some still running yesterday - gradually became obsolete .
" It was a strange place in winter , when you came down in darkness and went back up into darkness .
I used to pick up the phone and call somebody up top to see what the weather was like , then at least you knew whether to take an umbrella . "
Officially they never had a major incident : unofficially he recalls times when the cooling and ventilation system failed , and part of the complex became so hot that the pitch waterproofing the original bored tunnel melted and seeped through the chinks in the metal sections lining it .
" Basically when you saw the engineers wandering around in shorts you knew you were in trouble .
" By then this place was n't strictly secret - but it was n't precisely not secret either .
You just got into the habit of not talking about work to anyone outside . "
Ray Gapes first came down in the lift in 1970 as an 18 - year - old apprentice , and barely saw daylight again for seven years .
" It was a fantastic place for a teenager , I found it very exciting .
I explored every inch of it , I never actually asked for permission , I just went wandering around wherever I had the chance . "
He knows Herbert was wrong : he never once met a rat .
At that stage the complex still had a fully stocked bar - with a notice warning staff to extinguish cigarettes , pipes and cigars before they returned to work - and a restaurant complete with mock windows with views of tropical gardens and pine tree fringed lakes , where as an apprentice he could buy a three course meal with a mug of tea for 2s 10d .
The restaurant was too expensive for him except on special occasions , so he took his breaks with the Tube 3 Tea Club , which was cheaper , more sociable , and half a mile less to walk , in a recreation room with a snooker table and a large tank of tropical fish which after a few years contained only piranha .
The complex began as two half - mile tunnels , dug by London Transport as the Blitz gripped London .
They were built and equipped as deep level shelters for 8,000 people , and the plan was that London Underground would take them over after the war to extend the Central Line , whose trains rumble past in their own tunnels only a few feet away .
Instead , part of MI6 moved in , a section cryptically known as The Inter Services Research Bureau , actually part of the Special Operations Executive originally set up to help resistance movements in Nazi occupied Europe .
When they left , on May 8 1945 , they took every scrap of equipment and kit with them , and it is still not entirely clear what they were up to .
In 1954 the GPO took over the complex and added new tunnels , creating Kingsway telephone exchange , which became the London terminal of the transatlantic telephone cable , TAT 1 .
Now the whole warren has almost been emptied , of tonnes of equipment - and a boat .
" My mates thought I 'd been down here too long when I told them about the boat , " Bamford said .
It was another of Kingsway 's secrets , a small boat stored in case of emergency flooding at another exchange , despite the slight difficulty of getting one up from 100 feet underground if floods bad enough to need its help hit central London .
Now only a handful of maintenance staff walk the tunnels every couple of days .
" I 've never heard of a ghost story about this place , " Malcolm Solairi said , " it 's actually very peaceful down here , I 'll miss it . "
One day after proclaiming on Meet the Press that he and George W. Bush share a common philosophy , John McCain took to a stage in Cleveland Monday to attack the President 's economic policies .
As it turns out , of course , when it comes to ideology and policy on the economy , John McCain and George W. Bush are virtually indistinguishable .
The feebleness of McCain 's effort to distance himself from Bush was revealed in its brevity .
Despite the AP 's headline that " McCain says Bush policy on economy is wrong , " McCain 's critique was limited to a single sentence .
And in those nine words and the attack on Barack Obama that followed , John McCain was n't telling the truth :
" This is the fundamental difference between Senator Obama and me .
We both disagree with President Bush on economic policy .
The difference is that he thinks taxes have been too low , and I think that spending has been too high . "
Leaving aside for the moment his dissembling on the Obama tax plan ( which the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center concluded would offer larger tax cuts to Americans at every income level below $ 112,000 ) , McCain simply lied about parting company with George W. Bush .
A quick glance at their shared approach to tax cuts , the deficit and health care confirms that George W. Bush and John McCain are joined at the hip .
The Bush Tax Cuts .
After having once criticized President Bush 's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans , John McCain reversed course for his presidential run and now supports making them permanent .
As the Center for American Progress concluded , " McCain 's tax plan will increase after - tax income of the richest 3.4 percent by more than twice the average for all households -- and offer no benefit to the poorest taxpayers and minimal savings for the middle class . "
By " doubling down " on the Bush program , John McCain is offering an even more regressive policy than his predecessor :
" The McCain plan would predominantly benefit the most fortunate taxpayers , offering two new massive tax cuts for corporations and delivering 58 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers .
The Bush tax cuts provide 31 percent of their benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers . "
The Bush Budget Deficit .
In March , McCain 's top economic adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin acknowledged the campaign 's proposals " will make deficits expand up front . "
But despite his promises of spending restraint , a war on earmarks and a rapidly thawing budget freeze , John McCain has been silent on how he 'll stem the unending flow of red ink his tax cuts will produce .
In March , ThinkProgress estimated these " costing more than $ 2 trillion over the next decade and essentially doubling the Bush tax cuts . "
By extending the Bush tax cuts , the Tax Policy Center concluded in September , by 2018 John McCain " would add $ 5 trillion to the debt . "
It 's no wonder the McCain campaign keeps vacillating on its comical first - term balanced budget pledge .
A Taxing Health Care Plan .
On health care , too , John McCain and George W. Bush are essentially interchangeable .
In June , McCain unveiled what is in essence a warmed over version of the Bush health care plan , one which was dead on arrival in Congress .
As the Miami Herald noted , both put health insurance tax credits at the center , " Bush proposed tax credits of up to $ 3,000 , but they were never enacted .
McCain has upped the ante to $ 5,000 . "
Like Bush , McCain would end the employer health care deduction and , for the first time , tax Americans ' health care benefits .
And like President Bush , John McCain would leave most of America 's 47 million uninsured without coverage and those with pre-existing conditions in jeopardy .
It 's no wonder McCain 's prescription got a chilly reception from the New England Journal of Medicine and reliably Republican business groups alike .
Opposing SCHIP Expansion .
Like President Bush , John McCain strongly opposed the expansion of the very successful - and wildly popular - State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) .
When Bush vetoed the extending the program to 3.3 million more uninsured children last year , John McCain stood by his side .
Denying coverage to more kids , McCain insisted last fall , was a " right call by the President . "
With his chances of filling George W. Bush 's seat rapidly diminishing , John McCain has been frantically trying to distance himself from the man he would replace .
Last week , a frustrated McCain used a Washington Times interview to vent against the Bush record with which he is inextricably linked .
As McCain 's water carrier Lindsey Graham put it in May , " Good luck making him George Bush . "
That 's hardly a challenge ; John McCain has already made himself George W. Bush ' natural heir .

In 1942 , German intelligence officers rounded up skilled Jewish prisoners and launched Operation Bernhardt , a clever scheme designed to counterfeit hundreds of millions of dollars worth of British Pounds and destroy the British economy by flooding it with counterfeit money .
Located in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp , Operation Bernhardt was , even by modern standards , a runaway success that resulted in the creation of forged bank notes worth 132 million British Pounds .
This “ economic warfare ” operation resulted in a devastating economic effect on the British economy .
You can read the true history of this operation here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_…
It is important to note that Operation Bernhardt was an act of war , specifically pursued for the purpose of destroying Britain ’s economy by creating so much new money that the value of the money already in circulation would plummet .
This was considered a strategic attack , just as effective as carpet - bombing tank factories or mowing down soldiers on the field with German - made MG42 machine guns .
What does all this have to do with the Federal Reserve ?
Today , the Federal Reserve is engaged in an eerily similar operation , counterfeiting trillions of dollars in U.S. bank notes and flooding the U.S. money supply with money created from nothing .
The result , of course , is the same as was intended by Operation Bernhardt in 1942 : The economic destruction of the target nation .
Only this time , the target is the United States of America .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Hilariously , the Fed claims it ’s doing this to save the economy .
Yet the laws of economics tell us that flooding the money supply with trillions of dollars in new money actually harms the economy .
And the Fed has been hard at work causing this harm : $ 250 + billion two weeks ago , $ 600 + billion last week and $ 900 billion earlier this week !
It ’s beginning to crank up the printing presses to the tune of a trillion dollars a week , and by doing so , it ’s contributing to the destruction of the U.S. economy at a pace the Third Reich could have barely imagined .
Has the Fed declared war on the working class ?
If the actions pursued by the Federal Reserve were being masterminded by Al - Qaeda , they would be denounced as acts of war .
In World War II , such actions were deliberate acts of war .
Targeting the economy for destruction by flooding the money supply with counterfeit currency is , by any measure , a threat to any nation .
So why is the Federal Reserve engaged in actions that , if committed by other nations , would warrant a military response ?
This is not an idle question .
I ’m not asking this in a satirical way .
I ’m quite serious about this :
Why is the Fed committing acts of economic warfare against the United States of America ?
( The Fed , by the way , is a private company .
It is not , as you ’ve been led to believe , part of the U.S. government . )
The answer is obvious .
You ’ve probably already figured it out : The Federal Reserve is at war with America .
It ’s an economic war , of course , not a bombs - and - bullets war .
The casualties , though , are just as real : Savings accounts , retirement funds , bank accounts , jobs , businesses , pensions and much more .
By counterfeiting trillions of dollars like a Sachsenhausen operation on steroids , the Fed is carpet - bombing the U.S. economy with an unprecedented flood of fiat currency , causing the exact same economic destruction intended by the Nazis in World War II ( but on a much more devastating scale ) .
And it ’s doing this as part of a new economic war .

In a study that could have significant consequences for neural tissue transplantation strategies , researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies report that inactivating a specific gene in adult neural stem cells makes nerve cells emerging from those precursors form connections in the wrong part of the adult brain .
Researchers , led by Fred H. Gage , Ph.D. , professor in the Laboratory of Genetics , discovered that a protein called cdk5 is necessary for both correct elaboration of highly branched and complex antennae , known as dendrites , which are extended by neurons , and the proper migration of cells bearing those antennae .
Previously described functions of cdk5 are manifold , among them neuronal migration and dendritic pathfinding of neurons born during embryonic development .
" The surprising element was that the dendrites of newborn granule cells in the adult hippocampus lacking cdk5 stretched in the wrong direction and actually formed synapses with the wrong cells , " explains Gage .
Synapses are the specialized contact points where dendrites receive input from the long processes , or axons , of neighboring neurons .
These findings offer extremely valuable , although unanticipated , input for investigators whose goal is to develop transplantation strategies to treat brain injuries or neurodegeneration .
" Our data shows that cells that fail to find their ' right spot ' might actually become integrated into the brain and possibly interfere with normal information processing , " says the study 's lead author Sebastian Jessberger , M.D. , a former postdoc in the Gage lab and now an assistant professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich , Switzerland .
Gage agrees that this is a possibility , noting that therapeutic targeting of new tissue — which would presumably be derived from stem cells — to the brain or spinal cord may demand extreme accuracy .
" Our findings reflect the need for therapeutic approaches that will assure that cells used in regenerative medicine are strategically placed so that they will make appropriate rather than promiscuous connections . "
In the study investigators first injected retroviruses into part of the adult mouse brain known as the hippocampus , which is required for memory formation , to tag and knock out cdk5 activity in newborn granule cell neurons .
Over time they observed that newborn neurons not only failed to move to their correct position in the brain but also sported stunted , mistargeted dendrites .

Jessberger explains that one might have predicted the opposite : that if immature neurons in the adult brain accidentally oriented their antennae in the wrong direction , they might fail to connect with cells in that network , or possibly even die .
That they formed synaptic contact points was highly unanticipated .
" We found that dendrites of cells lacking cdk5 seemed to integrate into the brain no matter what direction they grew in , " he says .
In fact , the inappropriate synaptic connections made by cdk5 - deficient cells persisted for months after the treatment with cdk5 - antagonizing retroviruses .
" One might have predicted that aberrant maturing nerve cells would get kicked out of the circuitry later on , " reports Jessberger , who followed the behavior of newborn granule cells in treated mice long after cdk5 activity was eliminated .
" Even after one year , some of those cells remained in the wrong part of the hippocampus . "
The PLoS Biology paper is part of an extensive body of work contributed by the Gage lab to the field of adult neurogenesis .
A decade ago Gage became one of the first investigators in the world to demonstrate the emergence of new neurons in brains of adult mammals , including humans .
The current study specifically extends a 2005 PNAS study in which the lab searched the whole genome for chromosomal hot spots associated with adult neurogenesis .
That study , which was initiated by former postdoctoral fellow Gerd Kempermann , M.D , a co-author on the PLoS Biology paper and currently professor at the Center for Regenerative Therapies in Dresden ( CRTD ) , had identified a large region of mouse chromosome 5 as an area of interest , and cdk5 was a gene embedded within that locus .
" The nice part of this story is that it emerged from a systems genetics approach , " says Gage .
" It continues our effort to apply genetic analysis to find chromosomal regions harboring genes that may play a critical role in neurogenesis . "
Also contributing to the study from the Gage lab were Stefan Aigner , Ph.D. , Gregory D. Clemenson , Jr. , Nicolas Toni , Ph.D. , and D. Chichung Lie , M.D. Özlem Karalay of ETH and Rupert Overall of CRTD also were authors on the paper .
The study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and grants from the National Institutes of Health , the Lookout Fund , the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation , the Picower Foundation , the James S. McDonnell Foundation , and the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation .
A problem with some PayPal payments being held by the company was just a glitch , not a cunning plan to claw more money out of buyers .
Earlier this year PayPal introduced a scheme to flag certain transactions it regarded as suspicious .
Payment for items where eBay determined the buyer might be dissatisfied would be held for 21 days , or until the seller received positive feedback from the buyer .
Then the funds would be transferred .
But a problem last month meant payment was not being released even after positive feedback for the seller had been posted .
Extending payment terms to 21 days did go down with some eBay sellers .
PayPay told us :
A very small proportion ( less than 1 per cent ) of PayPal transactions on eBay are regarded as potentially posing a risk to buyers .
This typically represents people who have not used PayPal before , who are selling high value items or who have recently received a significant amount of feedback from dissatisfied buyers .
These transactions are held until the buyer posts positive feedback , up to a maximum of 21 days .
Payment is released automatically after positive feedback is left , or after 21 days without any complaints from the buyer .
This approach is intended to ensure that eBay is a safe marketplace for buyers and sellers .
We communicate the policy clearly to our customers .
In September , for a few days , we experienced a glitch in the system that releases payments automatically after positive feedback has been received .
It affected a very small number of payments , all of which were subsequently released .
Only those payments normally regarded as potentially posing a risk to buyers were affected .
Forum posters and Reg readers who got in touch with us accused PayPal of deliberately sitting on the money in order to make a few weeks ' interest .
Reg reader Rob said : " By locking up the funds for 21 days after transaction , all its doing is covering the arse of PayPal and earning them interest at the expense of the sellers . "
There 's more in the eBay forums here and here .
Opinion seems quite divided - PayPal and eBay are always either going to annoy sellers who get checked before getting paid , or buyers who feel they 've been cheated because payment was made too fast .
As several posters in the forums point out , if you do n't like it , go and sell somewhere else .
The company also had recent problems with its top - up cards .
These were all fixed by 11 October . ®
GIRDWOOD , Alaska - Just 0.7 miles long , Crow Creek Road is n't a road to nowhere .
It runs straight to the Double Musky Inn , a Cajun bistro owned by a Bob Persons , a close friend of Alaska Senator Ted Stevens .
It cost taxpayers $ 2.7 million to widen and pave that road , and Alaska had higher priorities .
But an Associated Press examination of government e-mails and interviews with state transportation officials found that Stevens moved the project to the front of the line .
Persons , owner of the popular watering hole where the Republican senator frequently dines , testified as a defense witness this month in Washington , D.C. , where Stevens is on trial for corruption .
" This is a classic pork barrel project , " said David Williams , a vice president for policy at Citizens Against Government Waste .
" It 's like ' Hey , if you 're my buddy , I 'll just get you a few million dollars and make you a road to your restaurant . ' "
Details of the Crow Creek deal emerged as Stevens awaits a verdict in his trial .
He is charged with lying on Senate financial disclosure forms about gifts , including more than $ 250,000 in home improvements to his cabin , not far from the Double Musky .
Trial testimony indicated that Stevens granted Persons power of attorney to guide the home renovation .
Among the many presents Stevens is charged with concealing is a nearly $ 2,700 massage chair from Persons .
Stevens says the chair was a loan .
But his explanation of why he kept it in his house for seven years led to one of the more awkward exchanges of his testimony .
Telephone messages left at Persons ' home and the restaurant were not returned .
Stevens 's spokesman , Steve Wackowski , declined to answer questions from the AP concerning the senator 's communications with Persons about the road .
In a statement , he said Stevens set aside the money at local officials ' request and believed paving the road would boost tourism to a historic gold mine 2 miles beyond where the asphalt ends .
Stevens 's intent , as relayed through his staff to state officials , " was that any improvements or construction must continue all the way up to the mine , " according to the statement .
In 2002 , when Stevens was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , he inserted last - minute language in a transportation bill to secure $ 10 million for " Girdwood : Road Improvements . "
He then ensured that his intentions to pave his friend 's road were carried out .
Girdwood officials planned to cut that project , however , and repair residential streets with the money , according to the e-mails .
They had other priorities such as fixing trails and easing traffic .
That was unacceptable to Stevens , the longest serving Republican senator .
In office since 1968 , he has brought home billions in projects to his state .
In a June 2003 e-mail , a Stevens office worker , Lisa Sutherland , warned the director of Alaska 's state office in Washington , D.C. , that Stevens " would then be criticized for fixing up his own street .
Remember he lives there .
The best person to talk to to get guidance is Bob Persons . "
Persons was ready to help .
At Sutherland 's suggestion , a state transportation official , David Post , called Persons to clarify the senator 's intent .
Persons said the senator wanted the money to pave Crow Creek Road , a spruce - lined path dotted with a few commercial businesses .
Post told the AP he found it unusual to get direction on a publicly funded project from someone outside government .
" It struck me as odd , yes , " said Post , a regional transportation planning manager .
In an e-mail from June 24 , 2003 , the department 's chief of planning for the central region wrote a colleague about Post 's conversation with Persons .
" Spoke with Bob Persons this morning as Lisa suggested and his understanding from the Senator was that Crow Creek Rd. is number 1 priority because it is in such bad shape , " reads the e-mail from John Tolley .
" This is ' somewhat ' consistent with the board of supervisors ' priorities , however they have some other improvements in their top 7 priorities . "
The paving of Crow Creek Road was No. 6 .
Stevens and Persons have known each other for 25 years .
Persons and his wife , Deanna , have contributed nearly $ 7,000 to Stevens 's campaigns over the past decade .

Unless you 've been in a darkened room playing Spore with the TV off for the past month , you 're probably aware that the US is in the midst of a dire financial crisis .
That fact was underlined today when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 679 points to end the day at 8,579 , or down 7.33 percent .
That 's the first time since 2003 that the index has closed below 9,000 , and was the sixth triple - digit single - day loss in a row .
But though the news was grim on the New York Stock Exchange , it was slightly better on the NASDAQ , which saw its composite index fall a still - painful 95.21 points , or 5.47 percent .
America 's second - largest market is home to many technology stocks , including the majority of third - party video game publishers touted as " recession - proof " by some analysts .
Indeed , comparing the closing September 9 and October 9 share prices of four top publishers , it 's clear that some of the biggest names in games are hemorrhaging market value .
Worst off is Take - Two Interactive , which has lost 40 percent of its share price in a month , going from $ 21.77 to $ 13.01 .
Besides overall market woes , the decline was also in large part due to Electronic Arts ' abandonment of its Take - Two takeover bid , which was $ 26 per share at its highest point .
Ironically , EA was also a big loser during the Sept. 9 - Oct. 9 period .
Despite a recent spate of hits such as Spore and Warhammer Online , the publisher 's stock value has shrunk 37 percent over the month , going from $ 44.21 to $ 27.80 .
More alarming is the fact that EA 's stock value has nose - dived 53 percent in the past year , having been worth $ 59.94 on October 9 , 2007 .
Also battered in the value - loss demolition derby was THQ , which shed 39 percent of its value , sinking from $ 13.83 to $ 8.34 .
Over the past year , the WWE SmackDown and Saints Row 2 publisher has lost 68 percent of its value .
The last and least money - losing game company was Activision Blizzard , which shaved 28 percent --$ 4.67 - - off of its shares during the month , ending at $ 11.95 .
No year - on - year comparisons are available for the newly minted Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft maker , which was formed in July by the union of Activision and Vivendi Games .
Things were also tough for companies with major game interests , such as the two console companies traded on US stock markets .
On the NASDAQ , Xbox 360 maker Microsoft lost $ 3.80 ( 14 percent ) during the month to close at $ 22.30 , down from $ 30.10 a year ago .
On the NYSE , Sony Corp. fared worse , suffering an $ 11.91 monthly drop ( 33 percent ) , to end up at $ 23.51 .
Despite the apparent game - industry - wide drubbing , analysts are confident that the game industry will fare better in a recession than other sectors .
" If people are n't traveling and stay home , what are they going to do ?
They 'll want relatively cheap home entertainment , " David Gibson , senior analyst at Macquarie Research Equities , told the Wall Street Journal .
" [ And ] core gamers will buy the titles when they come out , regardless of economics . "

Two - page letter on Palin 's health leaves unanswered questions John Byrne
Published : Tuesday November 4 , 2008
Print This Email
This " Palin recently promised in a nationally televised interview that she would release her medical records .
Instead , the campaign issued the two - page letter from her physician on the eve of the election . "
That 's verbatim from the Associated Press .
Just hours before the election , Dr. Cathy Baldwin - Johnson , of Anchorage , released a two - page letter declaring Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in good health .
In the letter , she described Palin 's pregnancies , including the birth of her son , Trig , earlier this year at 35 weeks .
" Routine prenatal testing early in the second trimester of Palin 's pregnancy determined that the fetus had the chromosomal condition known as Down Syndrome , " the article notes .
" The Alaska governor and her husband , Todd , decided to go ahead with the pregnancy . "
Baldwin- Johnson added that Palin had had a breast biopsy in 1992 for what turned out to be a benign lesion , and that her patient 's vital signs , including blood pressure at 96 over 61 and a pulse of 77 , were within normal limits .
" Palin has no close relvatives with major medical problems . "
" She is physically fit with a regular exercise regimen , " Baldwin - Johnson continued , adding that the 44 - year - old Palin takes no routine prescription medications .
" In summary , Gov. Palin is in excellent health and has no known health problems that would interfere with her ability to carry out the duties and obligations of vice president of the United States of America . "
Curiously , the bulk of the letter described Palin 's most recent pregnancy and Trig 's health .
Conservative pundit and blogger Andrew Sullivan continues to question the official story regarding Trig 's birth , and has previously pegged it as a strong contending reason as to why the campaign put off releasing information for so long -- and did n't release details of her actual medical records , as the campaign promised .
" We have been given no actual records of the last pregnancy , or any records at all , although we are told by the elusive Dr. Catherine Baldwin - Johnson that labor was at 35 weeks - not as premature as previously believed ( if you research the average weight of full term DS babies , you find , by the way , that Trig was not underweight ) , " Sullivan wrote Tuesday .
" There is no time for any reporters to ask any questions , of course , or any time for the questions raised by the pregnancy to be aired in the press .
I doubt Baldwin - Johnson will respond to further queries .
Obama gave Palin a precedent for this kind of letter as a replacement for records with his equally secretive and brief doctor 's note .
But at least he did so well ahead of time , and has no serious questions pending about his own health history . "
" The timing of the release should also surely be interpreted as a giant finger to the press , " Sullivan added .
" Releasing this letter one hour before polling day begins and refusing to provide any actual documentation is not an answer .
We need documentation to verify the last pregnancy : the amniocentesis results with Sarah Palin 's name on them , for example , would be readily available and easy to disseminate , and would help raise awareness of Down Syndrome .
So why not give us something ?
All we have in this literally last minute letter is Baldwin - Johnson 's name .
We had that already . "
Obama similarly released a note from his doctor summarizing his health ; Sen. John McCain and Sen. Joe Biden both provided more detailed medical data .
Palin appears outwardly to be in good health .
But some -- including Sullivan -- have raised questions about whether Palin 's decision not to release any medical data has to do with the birth of her son , Trig , at 43 .
Sullivan has documented myriad inconsistencies in the governor 's account of her son's birth .
After her water broke in her eighth month of pregnancy , while out of town to give a speech , Palin did not go to the hospital and instead called her doctor over the phone .
" I think that the majority of obstetricians , given a 44 year old with 4 previous deliveries and a known
Down syndrome pregnancy at less than term with a question of ruptured membranes , would advise her to be seen at a hospital ( especially if out - of - town and the question of traveling was on the table ) to have these tests performed ; given the malpractice risk , very few would be comfortable making the diagnosis over the phone , " said one obstetrician Sullivan quotes .
Nhon Ky Phan sees John McCain as a brother , a man who -- much like him -- suffered through harrowing days as a prisoner during the Vietnam War .
“ What happened to me was what happened to him , ” he said in Vietnamese .
“ John McCain is my comrade . ”
In the waning days of the presidential campaign , a team of McCain boosters -- made up largely of former Vietnamese war veterans who are less concerned with Joe the Plumber than with the bonds forged in wartime -- is trying to rally the vote in Orange County ’s Little Saigon , the largest Vietnamese American community in the country .
The politics in the Westminster enclave lean to the right and Vietnamese Americans have proved to be faithful voters , so it ’s not altogether odd that the McCain campaign has set up shop in a Bolsa Avenue strip mall across the street from the Asian Garden Mall , a popular gathering spot .

Many Vietnamese Americans are drawn to McCain ’s support of Vietnamese refugees .
As a senator , McCain led efforts to pass legislation in 1996 that would allow the children of Vietnamese political prisoners to reunite with parents who ’d already been allowed to immigrate to the U.S.
“ The Vietnamese cannot forget what McCain has done for our people , ” Phan said .
McCain came to Little Saigon during the Republican presidential primary for a fundraiser held by Assemblyman Van Tran ( R - Garden Grove ) , whom some consider to be the dean of Vietnamese American politicians .
The candidate has not returned , but in August , the campaign opened a satellite office in the Little Saigon Outreach Center -- the first presidential campaign office located in Little Saigon .
There , an intern makes calls , hands out yard signs and answers questions from the visitors , most of them Vietnamese , who trickle in .
The area still echoes with memories of the war .
In Westminster , there ’s a statue honoring American and South Vietnamese soldiers .
The flag of the fallen country of South Vietnam is on display in shops .
And there are regular street protests condemning people or businesses perceived to be communist sympathizers .
Phan , 73 , is a former major in the South Vietnamese military who spent eight years in prison after being captured by the North Vietnamese .
He ’s a part - time host on a Vietnamese talk radio show and devotes a big chunk of his air time to preaching the gospel of John McCain .
“ He is a hero , ” Phan said .

More than policies and party loyalties , Phan said he is drawn to McCain ’s personal history .
As a Navy fighter pilot , McCain was shot down and captured by the North Vietnamese in 1967 and spent more than five years as a prisoner of war , enduring torture .
Phan is reminded of the years when he suffered at the hands of the North Vietnamese , who tied his legs together and gave him barely enough rice to survive .
On his show , Phan talks passionately of McCain ’s allegiance when he refused an offer by the North Vietnamese to be released from prison early .
“ This shows that when he is president , he will sacrifice for the country more than others , that he truly has the spirit of patriotism , ” Phan said in an interview .
Most of McCain ’s support in Little Saigon occurs outside of the modest campaign office -- in grass - roots efforts run by Vietnamese Americans on radio talk shows and in discussions at local restaurants and coffee shops .
Members of the Vietnamese community are organizing a rally for McCain on Saturday in front of Westminster City Hall .
That event comes on the heels of a rally last weekend in Little Saigon that drew about 120 Vietnamese American supporters of Barack Obama .
Organizers said that rally aimed to show that support for McCain is not ubiquitous in their community .

Cuong Sinh Cao , 62 , a captain during the Vietnam War , said that their efforts “ ca n’t make a difference in this election , but we want to send a message to politicians that we are involved and we are active . ”
Cao , who also sounds his support for McCain on a radio show , has rounded up about 30 Vietnamese volunteers to go to Nevada next week for a get - out - the - vote effort .
In a recent national poll , more than half of Vietnamese Americans surveyed said they support McCain , diverging from other Asian American groups that mostly supported Barack Obama .
Roughly 51 % of Vietnamese Americans nationwide support McCain , compared to 24 % who support Obama , according to the study conducted by professors at Rutgers University , UC Berkeley , UC Riverside and USC .
Many older Vietnamese who came to the U.S. as refugees are more concerned with foreign policy than domestic policy , said Jeffrey Brody , a Cal State Fullerton professor who has studied Vietnamese American issues .
“ John McCain ’s record and personal experiences as a prisoner in Vietnam has earned him a lot of credence with those Vietnamese who fled Vietnam or participated in the war , ” he said , adding that second - generation Vietnamese may not hold the same emotional ties .

Organizers at last Saturday ’s Obama rally were critical of McCain ’s support for normalized U.S. relations and trade pacts with the communist Vietnamese government , at a time when human rights abuses still occur there .
“ There is misconception in our community that McCain , just because he is a veteran , will support our cause , ” said Phu Nguyen , 31 , a local businessman and community activist .
“ McCain has a history of being very friendly to the government in Vietnam , which goes against the struggle of the activist movement . ”

Lisa Marie Presley Gives Birth to Twins
, 40 , gave birth to twin girls on Tuesday , October 7 .
The girls , delivered by cesarean section , weighed 5 lbs , 15 oz , and 5 lbs , 2 oz .
Lisa Marie wrote on her MySpace page during her pregnancy that she and husband , Michael Lockwood , 47 , were “ beyond thrilled and blessed , elated and saturated in happiness . ”
The twins are the first children for the couple .
Presley has two children , daughter Riley , 19 , and Benjamin , 15 with former husband Danny Keough .
Lisa Marie 's father , Elvis Presley , had a twin who died at birth , and her mother , Priscilla Presley , has younger twin brothers .
Mr. Crumpton , who was in charge of the C.I.A. teams that entered Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks but who said he had not seen the draft report , said that Afghanistan was “ bad and getting worse ” and that officials in Washington were just beginning to wake up to the problem .
“ It ’s taken them a long time to realize it , but now they know it ’s pretty grim , ” he said .
A National Intelligence Estimate is a formal document that reflects the consensus judgments of all 16 American intelligence agencies .
Although the Bush administration has made public the crucial findings from some recent N.I.E. ’s on Iraq and terrorism , most remain classified .
The assessment on Afghanistan is the first since the Taliban regained strength there beginning in 2006 and launched an offensive that has allowed them to seize large swaths of territory .
The draft intelligence report was described by more than a half dozen current government officials who had read its conclusions .
They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the report remains classified and has not been completed .
Richard Willing , a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , which produces the national intelligence assessments , declined to comment for this article .
A White House spokesman , Gordon D. Johndroe , also declined to comment on the report ’s conclusions but said : “ Everyone understands that the current situation in Afghanistan is a tough one .
That ’s why the president ordered additional troops there .
That ’s why we ’re increasing the size of the Afghanistan Army . ”
Both major presidential candidates , Senators Barack Obama and John McCain , have called for American troop increases in Afghanistan even beyond those the White House has ordered .
Mr. Obama has accused the White House of paying too little attention to Afghanistan as it poured the vast bulk of American military resources into the war in Iraq , while Mr. McCain has defended the administration ’s decision , saying that Iraq remains the more important front in the battle against terrorism .
In Tuesday ’s presidential debate , Mr. Obama said he told Mr. Karzai during a visit to Afghanistan in July that the Afghan leader had “ to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that ’s necessary . ”
“ We have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people , and frankly it ’s just not responsive right now , ” Mr. Obama said .
From Conservapedia
Moral decline prior to Nazi Germany , which spawned an increase in the acceptance of homosexuality in German society , occurred about 35 years before the Nazis took power and it paved the way for the Nazis to take power .
A large part of the increase of support for homosexuality beforehand , including Germany becoming the birthplace of the so - called " Gay Rights " movement , originated with a particular man , Karl Heinrich Ulrichs , who had been molested by his riding instructor at age 14 and attributed his homosexuality to a " third sex " instead of his molestation .
[ 1 ]
The Nazis were rabid evolutionists who insisted that the " German master race " should dominate other so - called inferior races .
Belief in evolution has been linked to a decline of morality . [ 2 ]
The American journalist H. R. Knickerbocker wrote about the homosexual Nazi leader Ernst Röhm : Röhm's " chiefs , men of the rank of Gruppenfuehrer or Obergruppenfuehrer , commanding units of several hundred thousand Storm Troopers , were almost without exception homosexuals .
Indeed , unless a Storm Troop officer were homosexual , he had no chance of advancement . " [ 3 ]
Ernst Röhm was the only Nazi leader to address Hitler by his first name " Adolf " rather than " mein Führer " which helped prompt rumors that Hitler was a homosexual .
The historian Lothar Machtan and others have uncovered historical evidence that suggest Adolf Hitler may have been a homosexual .
[ 4 ]
However , the sexuality of Hitler is a matter of scholarly debate and historians are divided on whether Hitler was homosexual , bisexual , heterosexual or asexual . [ 5 ]
Later when Adolf Hitler came into power , he chose to persecute homosexuals in order to advance his notions of racial struggle . [ 6 ]
Yet at the same time , Hitler retained some sexual deviants in positions of power within the Nazi leadership .
For example , Hermann Goering was known to dress in drag , paint his nails and put rouge on his cheeks .
Another example is the case of Max Bielas who " had a harem of little Jewish boys .
He liked them young , no older than seventeen .
He had a kind of parody of the shepherds of Arcadia , their role was to take care of the camp flock of geese .
They were dressed like little princes ... Bielas had a little barracks built for them that looked like a doll 's house ... Bielas sought in Treblinka only the satisfaction of his homosexual instincts ( Steiner : 117f ) . " [ 7 ]
Homosexuality was supported in Nazi Germany , although modern gay rights activists claim that an estimated 100,000 homosexual men were arrested for this crime , of whom approximately 5,000 to 15,000 were interned in concentration camps .
[ 8 ]
See Homosexuals and the Holocaust for further details .
Paragraph 175 banned homosexuality long before Hitler was even born .
As The Pink Swastika by Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams pointed out , 85 % of Nazi homosexuals were of the Butches faction while the other 15 % were of the Femmes faction , and as the Butches persecuted the Femmes , today 's LGBT movement is not monolithic either as they claim that drag queens offend the transgender .
Yet , according to some historians , homosexual men constituted the core of the Nazi Party in Germany . [ 9 ]
In contrast to the wimpy " swish " homosexual , Nazi homosexuals were ultra-macho or " butch " .
The OSS addressed the reason why so many homosexuals found the Nazi party inviting ,
“ this may be due to the fact that they are all fundamentally social outcasts and consequently have a community of interests which tends to make them think and feel more or less alike .
In this connection it is interesting to note that homosexuals , too , frequently regard themselves as a special form of creation or as chosen ones whose destiny it is to initiate a new order ....
The fact that underneath they feel themselves to be different and ostracized from normal social contacts usually makes them easy converts to a new social philosophy which does not discriminate against them .
Being among civilization 's discontents , they are always willing to take a chance of something new which holds any promise of improving their lot ... [ 10 ] ”
Bryan Fischer of the Idaho Values Alliance writes ,
“ Even today in America , it is chic in some homosexual circles for individuals to wear replicas of Nazi Germany uniforms , complete with iron crosses , storm trooper outfits , military boots and even swastikas . ”
In 1941 the Office of Strategic Services prepared A Psychological Analysis of Adolf Hitler .
Langer attributed the belief of many that Hitler was homosexual " ( a ) from the fact that he does show so many feminine characteristics , and ( b ) from the fact that there were so many homosexuals in the Party during the early days and many continue to occupy important positions . "
Langer added , " It does seem that Hitler feels much more at ease with homosexuals . "
Some parts of the American Nazi movement are explicitly homosexual .
The National Socialist League , a group that existed from the mid to late seventies , restricted its membership to homosexual Nazis . [ 11 ]
Scott Lively [ 12 ] wrote :
“ " Most people do n't realize that male homosexuality does not always lean to the effeminate .
Historically , male homosexuality was much more often associated with hyper - masculine warrior cults which were usually very brutal and very politically aggressive .
The most recent example was in Germany .
Hitler 's initial power base when he launched the Nazi Party was a private homosexual military force organized and trained by a notorious pederast named Gerhard Rossbach .
Rossbach 's homosexual partner Ernst Roehm , who was also Hitler 's partner in forming and building the Nazi Party , converted the " gay " Rossbachbund into the dreaded SA Brownshirts . " ”
Largely because of the Frankfurt School , and in particular Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse , redefining fascism and Nazism as being right wing and manipulating the American Jewish Committee as such , the Nazis being largely composed of sexual deviants and bohemians , including homosexuals , was often ignored in academic circles and various leftist groups , and many times the Nazis were falsely assumed to be sexually rigid and puritanical in their sexual relationships .

In separate testimony , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said : " We must take further , decisive action to comprehensively address the root cause of this turmoil . "
Leading Democratic - politicians have objected to the plan on the grounds that it throws a lifeline to banks without their top executives paying a price for their ill - judged loans .
Some have called for a limit on the pay packages of bank directors .
The Bank of England said it would make another £ 21.6 billion available to the money market in a bid to encourage lending between nervous banks .

In separate testimony , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said : " We saw market turmoil reach a new level last week , and spill over into the rest of the economy .
We must now take further , decisive action to fundamentally and comprehensively address the root cause of this turmoil . "
But leading Democratic politicians have objected to the plan on the grounds that it throws a lifeline to banks without their top executives paying a price for their ill - judged loans .
Some have called for a limit on the pay packages of bank directors .
The Bank of England said it would make another £ 21.6 billion available to the money market in a bid to encourage lending between nervous banks .
The Prime Minister Gordon Brown is facing pressure from the White House to launch his own bank rescue here .
Mr Paulson wants foreign leaders to follow him and use public money to buy toxic debts off the hands of beleaguered banks .
But there are fears Mr Paulson 's package could get bogged down in partisan wrangling in Congress .
Both sides of the political divide in the U.S. have voiced doubts over how fast the bail - out can be introduced .
' This is more of a concept than a plan .
The scepticism in the market is beginning to build , ' said Joseph Brusuelas , chief U.S. economist at California - based Merk Investments .
' It 's not clear who is going to be allowed to participate .
How much will each individual bank be allowed to dump on the public ?'
Some economists also fear the plan could raise inflation by pushing up oil prices .
' A bigger trade deficit may mean a weaker dollar .
The weaker the dollar gets , the more expensive oil gets , ' said U.S. oil analyst Phil Flynn .
The White House has now run up a total bill of nearly $ 1.8 trillion ( £ 975 billion ) supporting the financial system with rescue packages .
Some traders are worried this burden will stretch the American government 's finances to breaking point , leading to a slump in confidence in the world 's biggest economy .
Mr Brown and Chancellor Alistair Darling have pledged support for international action on the credit crisis , but they are unwilling to extend to massive cash injections like that announced by the Americans .
Some U.S. politicians are furious with the suggestion that foreign banks could benefit from cash provided by American taxpayers .
Controversially , HSBC , Royal Bank of Scotland , and Barclays are all planning to offload billions of pounds of toxic assets on to the Americans .
Yesterday President Bush said the ' whole world ' was watching to see if Republicans and Democratic lawmakers can quickly agree on a plan to halt the financial crisis .
Hillary Clinton : Make history , vote Obama Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday November 3 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US Senator Hillary Clinton on Monday urged her supporters to " make history " by voting for Barack Obama , her onetime bitter rival for the Democratic presidential nomination .
" Tomorrow we have the opportunity to make history , " the New York lawmaker told her backers in an mass emailing .
" Tomorrow we can elect Barack Obama , Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ticket .
Together , we can begin putting this country on the right track .
Clinton , who lost a bitter battle with Obama for the Democratic party 's presidential nomination earlier this year , called on recipients of the email " to come together once again for Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
" Let 's spend every hour and every minute doing all we can .
Vote , volunteer and work your heart out so that we can turn our country around , " she said .
The email was accompanied by a video in which the former first lady and her husband , former US President Bill Clinton , exhort voters , " do n't forget to vote .
We 're counting on you . "
So was his intellect ; when he quoted authors like Edith Hamilton you could tell it was from his own reading , not from a ghost writer 's quote cards .
Some of his quips and epigrams still salt our speech : A rising tide lifts all the boats . . .
Washington is a city of Southern efficiency and Northern charm . . .
Life is unfair .
It was not on my 21st birthday that I really achieved my majority as a citizen .
It was when he spoke of the torch being passed '' to a new generation . ''
Like millions , I was enough of an idealist to believe that we were the new brooms that could sweep away the old cruelties and old inertia .
Like millions , I was enough of a pragmatist to believe that it would take a cool head and a cool eye to show the way .
He had both .
He was quick , too .
Those televised news conferences were tennis matches , and how he covered the court !
That 's something you 've never seen - a President who stands out there at the net , again and again returning every ball .
If I sometimes thought him mistaken , I never thought him lazy or stupid or careless .
Neither did his detractors .
We saw him in action ; we knew what we had .
On the day 25 years ago when that President of the United States was assassinated , I was not much older than you are now .
But already I had known , twice , what it is to vote for a Presidential candidate with a joyful heart .
One candidate lost , the other won and both have been tarnished by time .
Never mind .
I believed then , as I believe now , that they were the best my country had to offer .
Would that President have captured your imagination and your hopes the way he did mine ?
I can't even guess .
But I hope that one day , best of all while you are young , you too will find your own standard - bearer and your own New Frontier .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Environmentalists warn that invasive species disgorged from ships ’ ballast tanks have put the Great Lakes near an ecological tipping point .
Light from the rising sun is reflected on ice sheets in Lake Michigan as temperatures dropped to 6 degrees Fahrenheit in Chicago , February 2 , 2007 .

But rules enacted this year require all inbound ships to flush their ballast tanks with seawater , allaying most fears about more invasions of the five lakes , which collectively hold one - fifth of the world ’s fresh surface water .
“ I just wonder sometimes if ( environmental groups ) appreciate that they ’ve won the battle .
And whether we ought to move on to other things like sewage runoff , and infrastructure , and other things that are problems for the Great Lakes , ” Collister Johnson , administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation said .
Johnson , in Chicago to discuss increasing container trade on the lakes , said in an interview that forcing every ship to flush ballast tanks in the Atlantic Ocean before entering the Seaway is close to 100 percent effective at controlling the invasive species problem .
He would like even stricter regulations , which are hung up in the U.S. Congress , that may require shipowners to install equipment to scour ballast tanks with chemicals , gas , or some other method to guarantee any invaders are killed .
When ships offload their cargoes , they fill their ballast tanks , then empty them again when taking on another load .
Even empty ballast tanks can harbor harmful species .
Previous colonizers of the Great Lakes such as zebra and quagga mussels , the round goby , and dozens of other species have proliferated and altered the lakes ’ ecology .
“ It only takes one critter to make a difference .
You have to question the ability to enforce the ( flushing ) rule , ” said Jeff Skelding of the environmental group Healing Our Waters .
Invasive mussels have blanketed vast areas of the lakes , clogging water intake valves of municipalities and utilities and triggering algae blooms that foul beaches .
A University of Notre Dame study put the cost of invasives at $ 300 million a year .
But a proposal floated last year to ban ocean - going vessels from the Great Lakes altogether to keep out invasive species appears to have faded .
Proponents had pointed to a disputed study that concluded ocean - going traffic was not that large and using alternate modes including trains , trucks , and lake - only ships and barges would cost only an additional $ 55 million annually .
Johnson disputed the figure , and called the idea of closing the waterway to ocean - going vessels “ absurd . ”
The Seaway , a system of locks and canals that opened in 1959 and jointly owned with Canada , is not large enough to handle the large container ships plying the seas .
Most of the traffic on the lakes are bulk cargoes -- imports of steel and exports of grain and iron ore .
But Johnson has high hopes for a proposed container port to be located in Nova Scotia , for which the Seaway could provide a feeder system to the U.S. interior .

Brad , I also heard you on DemocracyNow !
One question about this " callibration issue " with the machines .
I was wondering , if the machines are truly not properly callibrated , does that mean that a voter hoping to vote for John McCain would likewise experience problems ?
Was this tested ?
Listening to you speak ,
Is this really a conspiracy against Democrats , or does it affect all candidates and all parties ?
Thanks ,

and before someone yells at me for lol .. i would rather laugh than cry as to tx vote flipping , after the tx primary which was evidence of a program on machines simply because while hillary won the vote , obama won the caucuses i watched the tx sos site for couple days ,
printed off results from 3 - 5
in psd 19 in early voting clinton had 12,619 votes obama had 23,834 votes
on 3 - 6 i printed same sos page again but now in early voting in psd 19 , clinton has 27,413 and obama has 16,919
i faxed the print outs to vicki karp ( the activist with the radio show in tx )
heck i emailed it to brad too , vicki did mention it on her show and im glad of that but i dont understand why this isnt a news story , but then i dont understand why nhs screwed up numbers have nevr been reported FULLY
btw brad ty for the audio reply as i tried for the umtenth time to get u to read my 6 handwritten pages
my work in nh shows the sos ( who controled everything in the recount ) delivered ballots that when counted and reported on the sos web site were ovr 100 percent for both dems and reps in hillsborough county
maybe peops r confused thinking this shows old fashion ballot stuffing but thats not the case at all ... i believe the sos delivered the ballots needed to match the tape ( predetermined results ) and thats why they ended up with a mathmatical tag for these 6 handwritten pages i used the sos recount reports and the ballots cast foias posted on bbv ( not to be confused with the " corrected " report currently on nhs sos web site which seems to have been " corrected " w/ o any back up paper work as nancy has done 3 foias that i know of asking for the reasons for the changes from the recount ) and still has recieved no answers i am not trying to diss anyone , brad , bev , vicki and others r my heros brad ( or anyone ) if u can find an error in my overall conclusion that hillsborough reported ovr 100 percent i will pay 100 bucks to u , im that sure here is the catch that confuses peops , remember when a precinct / town has an undervote , thats a physical ballot that is blank in the presidental race

I 've been trying to find the article I read about my post @ 6 , but to no avail .
I did find this though , The governor was j h sununu who was a mechanical engineer .
" He earned a BS in 1961 , a Master 's degree in 1963 , and a Ph.D. in 1966 from MIT , all in mechanical engineering .
Sununu is a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity . "
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Sununu
And then there 's this
" When Bush had arrived in Manchester the night of the disastrous Iowa result , Sununu had promised a nine point victory for Bush in his state .
Oddly enough , that turned out to be exactly right .
The final result was 38 % for Bush , 29 % for Dole , 13 % for Kemp , 10 % for DuPont , and 9 % for Robertson .
Was Sununu a clairvoyant ?
Perhaps he was , but those familiar with the inner workings of the New Hampshire quadrennials are aware of a very formidable ballot - box stuffing potential assembled there by the blueblood political establishment .
Some observers pointed to pervasive vote fraud in the 1988 New Hampshire primaries , and Pat Robertson , as we shall see , also raised this possibility .
The Sununu machine delivered exactly as promised , securing the governor the post of White House chief of staff . "

Jonathan Kemmerer - Scovner ( #2 ) ~
Brad has a really interesting report on that from just last week , here : https://bradblog.com/?p=6559
Very few , if any , incidents of vote flipping from R to D .
In fact , the brilliant statisticians here in this very thread often confirm the sheer impossibility of that hard data ; the probability of such a high rate or D to R being so statistically anomalous that " poor calibration " as an explanation -- most of them seem to agree -- is a piss poor joke .
Then , add in the whirl - wind perspective of our own computer experts / systems tech analysts , and THEY ( with the exception of one I can think of ) weigh in with one voice on this issue : THESE MACHINES ARE FAULTY BY DESIGN .
That being said , I 'm sure these pieces of utterjunk we vote on are likely to give ANY voter a difficult time .
That 's under the sub-section I like to call - -" haul 'em off by Oompa - Loompas " .
They 're just bad eggs .
We did have an incident in Sarasota 's now notorious CD - 13 race , where the REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE 's WIFE reported ( and then quickly rescinded ) her own account of having difficulty getting her vote for her husband to register on ES&S 's touchscreen , paperless machines .
Her husband won , whattaya know , by 369 votes
after the ES&S machines dropped 18,412 -- and from just one , democratic leaning County .
At first I could n't wrap my head around the idea of malfeasance , because if it was a hack , it just seemed so OBVIOUS and DUMB !
To win by just the amount that 's needed ?
Voter 's WITNESSING their vote " flip " ?
But , according to every national pre-election poll , Congressional Dems led Repubs by 13 % -- the number of Dem votes that would have to be shaved for a victory in 50 - 50 swing districts .
Sarasota , the only district in the county without PAPER OF ANY KIND ( thanks to Katherine Harris and her Succubus Sibling Protege Kathy Dent ) had an " undervote " rate of 14.5 percent .
And then we learned the data base was hit by an " early voting Slammer Worm " .... and that the phones lines went down for several hours .
Yes , they stole just as many votes as it would take .
Right in front of the voter 's disbelieving eyes .
There 's no doubt about it .
The machines put the wrong candidate ( R ) in office over the rightful POTENTIAL winner ( D ) who lost her Congressional seat as a result of these voting machines .
It 's personal , it 's intentional .
And them Dems let it go ...

The video of Jackson County clerk Jeff Waybright demonstrating that calibrating the machine solves all its woes does not , m as I too first thought , show votes flipping after the calibration .
It shows Nader being retained since Waybright selected Nader right before he selected straight Republican ticket .
This is , apparently , a feature of the software to allow voters to select a candidate or more from another party and then choose straight ticket for the rest .
This is a confusing , poorly implemented " feature .
But it is crystal clear what happened in that in the high res video - which you can download from Video the Vote 's website - shows the machine stating that : " Candidates you have selected from a different party will be retained . "
You can download the high res video here : http://www.videothevote.org/video/384/
So , to recap , after the recalibration , dude selected Nader , then straight ticket , but Nader was retained .
No flipping .
Which raises another valid concern :
The person in charge to demo the machine did n't even know how it worked .
He thought it had flipped again too .
These machines are an atrocity .

Re : the Wired story on vote " flipping " on Hart Intercivic machines , here :
http://blog.wired.com/27...8/10/straight-party.html and the following passage :
... Rose M. Ward told Threat Level she selected the straight - party Democrat option on her Hart InterCivic machine , then selected Obama 's name separately .
She said when she did this , the box next to McCain 's name highlighted .
Generally when a voter selects a name that is already highlighted and clicks on it , the machine should simply de-select that candidate , not select another candidate .
Hart InterCivic spokesman Peter Lichtenheld disputed Ward 's claim and said its machines are n't capable of doing what she described unless she specifically selected McCain .
As a former technician for Hart I have seen this happen on Hart 's eSlate machines .
By making such a blanket statement Pete is simply lying .
Though it is rare , in my personal experience , Hart machines are quite capable of switching votes without voters making a deliberate specific change .
There are several ways this can happen , and I 've personally seen it both happen and in one case been able to " correct " the errant behavior .
In the situations I 'm familiar with I 'm thinking of an older version of the firmware - however the underlying problems with the design are still present .
( And nobody with any experience with electronic devices will believe that any odd behavior is actually " impossible " . )
Now while Pete might simply not remember being told about these problems ( by me and others ) , his perchant for lying ( about my employment and concerns with respect to Hart ) after being promoted to his current PR role leads me to believe that he is again , deliberately , lying .
I 'm ashamed of you Peter .

Troubling news .
Why the Dems continue to sit on their hands is baffling and infuriating .
I voted today in New Hanover Co , NC and arrived to an unpleasant surprise .
Previously , and even through this year 's primaries , my polling place used M100 optical scan machines , which was bad enough .
But they just rolled out new iVotronic machines for the general election .
This may be old hat for some , but it was a new experience for me .
After checking in and giving my name , address and birthdate , I was given a printed " no - excuse absentee " form which had a ballot number on it .
The poll workers escorted each voter to a machine , plugged in a cartrige to log in with the ballot id number , pulled it out , then demonstrated how the machine works .
They did this with every voter .
This may not sound like that big a deal to some , but I find it interesting in that Brad stated that no machine should ever have a cartridge inserted at any time after a machine has been programmed for an election .
They inserted a cartridge each time a new voter stepped up .
No reported vote - flipping , but does it really matter ??
I have no reason to believe my vote was recorded as cast .
In fact , I 'm left to pretty much assume that odds are it was n't - not so long as these damned DREs are used .
It was also a revelation to realize that it would n't be hard at all to match a voter 's ID with their vote selections .
So much for the idea of a secret ballot .

The Democrats think they can overwhelm the election fraud by the Rethuglicans with bigger numbers .
Bigger numbers will just mean more votes for the Rethuglicans when they are flipped .
The same Democrats who wanted to look for 500 undervotes in Florida in 2000 instead of 50,000 spoiled OVERVOTES ( like picking Gore and writing in Liberman or Gore as well ) .
The same Democrats who told Kerry to concede on Wednesday morning rather than look into the missing and provisional votes that were TWICE the margin of theft .
When will we stop listening to these people ?

There ’s a Screwed Scenario that I missed .
Back in my Borland days , we were working hard on Paradox for Windows .
I was a QA engineer testing the database creation and modification functionality .
My counterpart in engineering , Jerry , was working hard , but getting absolutely nowhere .
We were mid-to - late in a 1.0 product cycle and most of the engineers were slowly moving from development into bug fix mode , but not Jerry , he was still implementing … over and over again .
That ’s the Screwed Scenario , you ’ve given a critical task to someone who is utterly unable to complete it .
Now , let ’s first give Jerry a break .
He was a fine programmer , but he had two major strikes against him .
First , Jerry had never programmed for Windows .
so he was learning while he was coding .
Second , this was also a 1.0 product .
I ’ve got an article kicking around my head about 1.0 product development … it ’s titled “ 1.0 spelled One point oh my god I ’m never going to see my family again and , dear lord , I ’m going to take the company out while I ’m at it . ”
Short version : 1.0 is incredibly hard and combined with his Windows inexperience , Jerry was in trouble .
Yet , Jerry has pride .
Jerry believed that he could pull it off , but being on the receiving end of his code , I observed a disturbing coding practice which we ’ll call “ moving crap around on your plate ” .
Jerry ’s approach to fixing his bugs was to move his code around in interesting ways much the way you used to shove food around on your plate in a feeble attempt to convince your Mom that you actually ate your beets .
Nothing substantively changes , it just looks different .
Another name for this coding practice might be “ Coding by hope ” .
The end result with Jerry ’s code was each time he ’d fix something , we ’d discover another fundamental problem with the feature .
Yes , small incremental progress was being made with each bug fix , but Jerry was in a losing situation because his basic architecture was crap .
When asked for status , his lists of excuses were astonishingly believable .
They were the excuses of a person who honestly believed he could pull it off and was willing to put in the hours to do it , but all the hours in the world was n’t going to help Jerry because he was in over his head .
If you ’re the manager in this scenario , you ’ve got to make a major change because you can not release crap .
There are companies that do this and end up making a tidy profit .
You are not that person because once you are rewarded for releasing crap , you begin a blind walk down a path of mediocrity that ends up with you working at Computer Associates on a product no one has heard of and that no one cares about .
It ’s a two step fix process .
We needed to make a Jerry adjustment and then we needed a miracle .
I ’ll start with the easy one .
We needed Jerry .
He ’s the only one who knows what the hell is going on in that pile of spaghetti and he can fix trivial bugs .
The engineering manager sat Jerry down and told him we need to focus on quantity .
There were scads of trivial little fixes all over the place that had been ignored and Jerry could handle those .
Yes , he was pissed , but in a few weeks , Jerry was cranking because people always work better when they know they have the ability to complete a task .
With Jerry adjusted , we had to face another fact , we were six months from shipping and we had a major portion of functionality that was cobbled together and barely working .
In this scenario , you need a unique talent .
You need a Free Electron .
The Free Electron is the single most productive engineer that you ’re ever going to meet .
I have not even provided a definition and I ’m guessing a person has already popped into your mind that fits the bill .
A Free Electron can do anything when it comes to code .
They can write a complete application from scratch , learn a language in a weekend , and , most importantly , they can dive into a tremendous pile of spaghetti code , make sense of it , and actually getting it working .
You can build an entire businesses around a Free Electron .
They ’re that good .
Free Electron Got ’chas :
» There are two classes of Free Electrons .
Sr. Electrons and Jr. Electrons .
Both have similarly productivity yields , but the Senior versions have become politically aware .
In technology savvy organizations , most CTOs fall into this category .
Think Bill Joy .
The Junior versions have all the ability , they just do n’t have the experience of dealing with people because they spent a lot of the youth writing their own operating system as a intellectual exercise .
These Junior electrons represent the single best hire you can make as a hiring manager .
If you get two in twenty years , you ’re doing something right .
» Misdirected Free Electron intensity can yield odd results .
On one project , I assigned a couple of slippery memory corruption bugs to a Free Electron who nodded quietly and promptly vanished for a week .
When he returned , the bugs were fixed and the entire database layer had been rewritten .
A piece of code that ’d taken two engineers roughly six months to design had been totally redone in seven days .
Sound like a great idea until you realize we were working on a small update and did not have the resources or time to test a brand spankin ’ new database layer .
Oops .
» Free Electrons sometimes will never engage and they ’ll never explain why .
Free Electrons are high functioning and have a strong opinion about everything … but they may never tell you that opinion .
If you ’re asking them to do something that they do n’t believe in , they are n’t going to do it … ask all you want .
The worst case is when you ask a Free Electron to pull of a diving save and they nod in the affirmative and promptly return to whatever they were doing before you distracted them with your useless request
One week later , you ’re going to be expecting the miracle , but the Free Electron is going to plainly say , “ Have n’t got to that ” .
One week more , your hair is going to be mostly pulled out , and then you ’re going to realize you did n’t need a miracle in the first place and inaction was the right move .
Your Free Electron knew that two weeks ago .
He / she just did n’t want to take the two hours to draw the picture for you …
Annoying , huh ?
You ’ll get over it .
» You might expect Free Electrons to exhibit the personality of other uber - nerds , but often they do not .
The main Free Electron at Netscape was the most decent human being I ’ve met in recent memory .
He also rode a unicycle .
» There are two primary tasks in an engineering organization .
Research and Development .
While the Free Electron is imminently capable of doing the development , their value in the organization is research .
They define the bleeding edge .
If you leave a Free Electron in the development role too long , they will vanish and you will have permanently damage the future productivity of your organization .
Back to Jerry .
Enter Bernard , Borland ’s resident Free Electron .
Up until he started poking around the code , I had no idea what Bernard actually did .
He had a office .
It was full of books .
He talked a lot and produced little visible work .
“ Blowhard ” is what I thought .
Bernard started tinkering with Jerry ’s code on a Friday afternoon .
The next Monday , I was able to run through my functional test matrix for the first time ever .
By the end of that week , Bernard had closed a majority of the high severity bugs and was beginning to tread in fix areas reserved for Jerry .
The following week I was racing to file bugs to keep Bernard engaged .
That is a Free Electron at work .
