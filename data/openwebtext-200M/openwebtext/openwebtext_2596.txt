After decades of failed efforts to reshape the nation ’s healthcare system , a consensus appears to be emerging in Washington about how to achieve the elusive goal of providing medical insurance to all Americans .
The answer , say leading groups of businesses , hospitals , doctors , labor unions and insurance companies -- as well as senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill and members of the new Obama administration -- is unprecedented government intervention to create a system of universal protection .
At the same time , those groups , which span the ideological and political spectrum , largely have agreed to preserve the employer - based system through which most Americans get their health insurance .
The idea of a federal , single - payer system patterned on those in Europe and Canada , long a dream of the political left , is now virtually off the table .

Rejected as well is the traditionally conservative concept , championed by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) during the presidential campaign , of reforming healthcare mainly by giving incentives for more Americans to buy insurance on their own .
There also is a widespread understanding that any expansion of coverage must be accompanied by aggressive efforts to bring down costs and reward quality care .
And key players in the healthcare debate increasingly back a massive investment of taxpayer money for healthcare reform despite the burgeoning budget deficits .
Beyond those areas of basic agreement , the details of what would be one of the most momentous changes in domestic policy since World War II remain vague .
As a presidential candidate , Barack Obama embraced both expanded insurance coverage and preservation of the job - centered system , but since he won the White House he has provided few specifics about his plans once he takes office .

Disagreements over specifics could again lead to a stalemate .
Even the most sanguine advocates of sweeping reform concede that difficult negotiations lie ahead .
But what is taking shape is a debate very different from previous discussions about what America ’s healthcare system should look like .
“ A lot has changed , ” said Karen Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , or AHIP , a leading trade group whose members helped kill the Clinton administration ’s healthcare campaign in the early 1990s .
AHIP is participating in talks with other interest groups to build consensus before Obama takes office in January and Congress begins debating any healthcare legislation .

Unresolved issues
Among the issues to be decided as more concrete proposals emerge in the months ahead is whether the roughly 46 million uninsured people in the U.S. will be pushed to buy private coverage or will be enrolled in a government insurance program , as some consumer groups want .
Hospitals and doctors fear another public program would reduce what they are paid , as Medicare and Medicaid have done .
Insurers worry they could lose customers to the government .
Also unresolved is what mechanisms might be created to force individuals or businesses to get insurance , both potentially contentious subjects .

And few have tackled how the government will control costs and set standards of care , proposals that raise the unpopular prospect of federal regulators dictating which doctors Americans can see and what drugs they can take .
“ There are some very big questions and some very big stumbling blocks , ” said Stuart Butler , vice president for domestic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation , who has been watching the healthcare debate for three decades .
“ Once you get into the details , the consensus is going to vanish pretty quickly , I suspect , ” he said .
At the same time , advocates for a single - payer system , including the California Nurses Assn. , have vowed to continue pushing the idea next year along with many Democrats on Capitol Hill .

Republican lawmakers , still reeling from their election day losses , have signaled discomfort with a major expansion of government spending , a position many in the GOP hope will help return the party to power .
“ Increasing access for the uninsured is not going to come cheap , ” Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) said at a recent hearing on healthcare reform .
“ And it ’s clear to me that our economy cannot stand much further deficit spending . ”
Nonetheless , the current agreement on principles contrasts markedly with previous reform efforts .
Today , many of the key players in the debate see the importance of preserving elements of the current healthcare system that many Americans say they like .
“ There is a growing understanding that you have to give people choice and you ca n’t take away what they have , ” said Ron Pollack , head of Families USA , an influential advocacy group for healthcare consumers that is working with a diverse collection of interest groups to build consensus .
“ One of the big no - nos is that you must not ever threaten the coverage that people have . ”

The Clinton effort
Fifteen years ago , there was much less agreement about preserving an employment - based system that now insures about 177 million people .
Opponents of President Clinton ’s plan were able to sink it by raising the specter that government would take away consumers ’ choices in a new system that would force them into inferior health insurance .
But now the prospect of bold government action to address the healthcare crisis appears to have been accepted far more broadly by many of those involved in the debate .

Even business leaders traditionally wary of government intervention now are pushing for the federal government to act decisively to reshape the healthcare marketplace -- in large part because of the increasing burden imposed on them by rising costs .
“ Doing this piecemeal is not going to work , ” said Todd Stottlemyer , president of the National Federation of Independent Business , which was also instrumental in defeating the Clinton plan .
Many involved in the healthcare debate , including Democratic lawmakers and members of Obama ’s team , also see healthcare reform as part of a broader economic picture .
Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have begun sketching out plans for healthcare reform that , like Obama ’s plan , preserve the employer - based system and create a new system for those without insurance .

Last month , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) outlined such a plan in an 87 - page white paper titled “ Call to Action . ”
Similar approaches have been endorsed by House Democrats .
In contrast , the Clinton administration drew up its healthcare reform plan with little involvement from congressional Democrats .
In the Senate , then - New York Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan , who was chairman of the finance committee at the time , actively resisted the idea of sweeping change in healthcare .
There are no signs of a similar rift today , said Jacob Hacker , a political scientist at UC Berkeley who has written a book about the failed Clinton effort .
“ Possibly more important than policy agreements , ” Hacker said , “ is the fact that the political forces now are in alignment . ”

There was a British newspaper piece linked on Musical America this week , something about Handel operas being boring .
And then we had the opening of Handel ’s Giulio Cesare at the Met , with a worshipful review in the New York Times .
( “ [ T ] he richness and endless variety of the music … the piercing psychological insights of this staggering masterpiece . ” )
There ’s one thing I know for sure — performances of Handel ’s operas today are nothing like the performances in Handel ’s own time .
Back then , these operas ( and in fact all operas , by all composers , all over Europe ) were sheer entertainment .
Spectacle — lavish sets and costumes , and special effects like storms at sea and flying , fire - breathing dragons — were a big part of the attraction .
And there was musical spectacle , too .
The singers sang lavish , extravagant , often improvised ornamentation .
The operas , as any music history book will tell you , consist mainly of arias , almost all of them in the same musical form , with an opening section , a shorter , contrasting span of music , and then a repeat of the opening .
To musicologists , this has long seemed like a very severe and static way to construct an opera , and stage directors in our time labor mightily to construct some kind of action on stage , so that something happens while the arias are being sung .
Nothing like that happened in Handel ’s time !
Nobody needed to be distracted by stage action .
For one thing , very few people in the audience were paying full attention .
People talked to each other , ate , walked around , and sometimes shouted at the stage .
And for those who were listening , the repeat of the opening section was something to wait for , maybe with great excitement .
What was the singer going to do ?
Singers would stride down to the front of the stage , wearing wildly overdone costumes , sometimes even striding into the middle of the audience on specially constructed ramps .
Then they ’d vary the repeated section so that the original melody completely disappeared .
They did this ( to judge from some surviving examples ) with a virtuosity few singers have today .
Besides , our current classical music aesthetic goes against this practice .
We ’re supposed to respect the composer ’s text , and one result is that vocal ornaments , in current Handel productions , are careful and discreet , the exact opposite of what they were in Handel ’s time .
I do n’t claim to be a Handel expert , but for whatever it ’s worth , I ’ve only once heard ornaments in a Handel performance that approached what Handel ’s singers would have done .
This is in Ewa Podles ’s recording of “ Or la tromba , ” an aria from Handel ’s opera Rinaldo , found on a http://www.amazon.com/Ewa-Podles-c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bres-Famous-Arias/dp/B0000038C2/ref=pd_sim_m_6/002-4403189-2183203?ie=UTF8&qid=1176174202&sr=1-2 recital disk on the Forlane label , called Famous Arias .
Podles attacks the music like someone out to beat the world record for wild ornaments , and ( if you ask me ) gets a gold medal .
And this was only the beginning .
The orchestra improvised , too .
Recitative accompaniments were surprising and inventive .
Forget the blank chords on a harpsichord , and the discreet bass notes played on a cello , which you see in the written scores , and hear played in most performances .
The players went half crazy , with the cellist improvising scales , arpeggios , and complex chords .
Other members of the orchestra would improvise .
The written score was only a guide to what might be done , subject to delightful , unexpected changes in performance .
When Handel produced his operas in London , his own harpsichord playing was a great attraction .
He was n’t at all content simply to reinforce the orchestra , and calmly accompany the singers .
He improvised virtuoso counterpoints to everything that was going on , and deliberately drew attention to himself .
( Just as Vivaldi , when he produced his own operas , improvised crazy stuff on the violin , playing as high and fast as possible , and always providing one of the highlights of the show . )
( You can hear one reconstruction of what the instrumental playing in Handel ’s operas might have been like , on http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_m/002-4403189-2183203?url=search-alias%3Dpopular&field-keywords=rene+jacobs+rinaldo&Go.x=10&Go.y=14 René Jacobs ’ recording of Rinaldo .
The vocal ornaments , unfortunately , are far too discreet , though I do love it when some of the singers mockingly add their voices to an orchestral passage , something not even remotely indicated in the written score , but which Jacobs thinks might well have happened . )
And then there were the costumes .
In London , everyone wanted to know what the female singers wore .
Often their dresses became fashionable .
Sometimes they were shocking .
In effect , the singers would go from directly from the opera stage into the 18th century equivalent of gossip columns , and the cover of Vanity Fair .
The singers – largely Italian — were exotic creatures in London , much whispered about .
Sometimes they ’d get into fights on stage .
Sometimes the press would derisively comment on their supposed sexual habits , in explicit language that would never be seen in a newspaper today .
And the castrati !
Castrated men sang many of the leading roles .
Obviously they were exotic creatures , far removed from the ordinary run of human life .
They were gigantic international celebrities , and also walking sexual scandals .
For one thing , castration of boys for musical purposes was illegal in Italy .
But it was widely practiced , and here were the castrati to prove it , each one representing a flagrant violation of the law .
They were almost like liquor during prohibition — legally forbidden , but ( with a wink and a grin ) widely known to be available .
And on top of that , they were sexually potent .
Their castration robbed them of any chance to have children , but they could ( and did ) have erections from morning till night .
Some were gay , some were straight .
The straight ones were much in demand as sexual indulgences , for women in the nobility .
They were celebrities , after all — and they could n’t get you pregnant .
All of this jumped from the stage in any Baroque opera performance .
Sometimes the gossip came front and center , as it did whenever Vivaldi premiered an opera .
Vivaldi , as everybody knew , was a priest who had n’t said mass for decades .
How sinful was that ?
And he went around Europe , flagrantly living with two younger women , one of whom was his prima donna .
People drew the obvious conclusions , just as we ’d do now .
Starved of all this gossip and spectacle , Baroque opera as it ’s performed today is – to speak bluntly — a 21st century fabrication , in which we contort these pieces into something there ’s no sign that they were ever meant to be .
It was hoped the ducks would help produce much - needed ducklings
Ben and Jerry were meant to fall for Cherry and help produce some much - needed ducklings .
Instead , the two drakes only had eyes for each other – and have been inseparable ever since .
Paul Stevens , warden of Arundel Wetland Centre in West Sussex , said : “ To our surprise the two males really took to each other .
" It would have been nice to get a last clutch of eggs from Cherry but Ben and Jerry do make a lovely couple . ”
TV wildlife expert Chris Packham said : “ Ducks are one of the few species that show homosexual behaviour regularly . ”
But the gay love story does nothing to help the endangered blue duck , with just 2,500 now left in their native New Zealand .
Mr Sokaluk , who failed to appear in Melbourne Magistrate 's court on Monday for a scheduled hearing , is alleged to have " intentionally and without lawful excuse " set fire to a timber plantation in southeastern Victoria state on Feb 7 and " did thereby commit arson causing the death of another person , " according to a police document presented to the Melbourne Magistrates ' Court .
He is due back in court for a committal hearing on May 25 .
NEW DELHI : ' Idiot ' is a grossly misused word and an oversimplified epithet , if one goes by the Supreme Court 's brand new definition of the term .
It is almost impossible for a person to qualify as an idiot , says the Court and therefore , few can expect to get a reprieve for an offence .
To be legally accepted as an ' idiot ' , one has to be so dumb as to be unable to count till 20 , list the days of the week , or fail to remember the names of one 's parents , the Court said on Friday .
Under Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code , a person is not liable to be prosecuted if they are of unsound mind , or incapable of comprehending the nature of the criminal act and the fact that it is against the law .
The Supreme Court identified just four kinds of people who could be classified mentally unsound ��� idiots , the very ill , lunatics and drunks .
" An idiot is one who is of non -sane memory from his birth , by a perpetual infirmity , without lucid intervals : and those are said to be idiots who cannot count 20 , or tell the days of the week or who do not know their fathers or mothers or the like , " said the judgement by Justices Arijit Pasayat and M K Sharma .
They added that it was for the accused to prove they were idiots or otherwise of unsound mind .
The court was dealing with a case from Madhya Pradesh where Hari Singh Gond murdered his grandfather - in - law and then claimed innocence on the grounds of idiocy .
The Bench affirmed the lower court orders convicting Gond for the murder .
If the investigating agency came across a history of insanity , it was duty - bound to subject the accused to a medical examination , the judges said .
If a medical examination is not done " the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused " , the judges said .
The MP trial court had refused to accept the accused was mentally unsound even though eyewitnesses reported he behaved in an unusual fashion at the time .
Friday 's judgement differentiated between a defendant of unsound mind and mere absence of motive .
" Mere absence of motive for a crime cannot , in the absence of plea and proof of legal insanity , bring the case within Section 84 , " it said .
" Mere abnormality of mind or partial delusion , irresistible impulse or compulsive behaviour of a psychopath affords no protection under Section 84 , " the SC added , affirming the earlier court orders convicting Gond for the murder .
Try taking a digital pic of the said mirror ( close enough that you could see a face ) and then look for any faces in the mirror pic .
Just make sure your not in the pic also .

Desperate Measures Berlin Brothel Offers Flat - Rate Service to Beat Slump
These are hard times even for the oldest trade in the world .
A Berlin brothel has responded to the economic crisis by launching a flat - rate service to woo customers .
During the early days of the recession , as stock markets were vacillating between gains and losses , investors had hopes that 2009 would bring about a slow economic recovery as the housing market stabilized .
However , two quarters later , with stocks at their lowest levels since the mid 90s and no turnaround in sight , Americans are bracing for what could be a devastating depression .
The pain has been felt around the world with 8 members of the European Union pleading for help , loss of jobs all around the world , and a drop in commerce levels .
In a few months time , America has seen drastic drops in consumer spending and less demand for almost everything .
This has led to sweeping changes in the economic landscape as thousands of smaller companies and a considerable number of large ones have closed their stores , laid off their employees , and filed for bankruptcy protection .
Some of these companies include : Circuit City , Linen N’ Things , Mervyn’s , Pier 1 Imports , Sharper Image , KB Toys , Tribune , Saab , and Lehmann Brothers .
As 2008 tested the flexibility of businesses , 2009 will also not be kind to many companies that have been unable to restructure their budgets to deal with lack of demand and credit .
As one economist states , “ Short - sightedness , failure to think outside the box , and the inability to adapt to a changing market and changing demographics coupled with arrogance will lead to their failures . ”
The companies below are best bets to close down their stores sometime in 2009 .
I. Sirius XM Satellite Radio
With shares just above a dime each , Sirius satellite is facing major problems in debt repayment .
It posted a half billion dollar loss in 2008 and demand is generally nonexistent for its products .
It has over 3 billion in unpaid debt and with deadlines approaching , it may be timed for this short lived company to close down .
II .
Ford
4 years of billion dollar losses ( 2.7 billion loss of 2009 ) and a 53 % drop in car purchases in the month of February 2009 has left Ford in shambles .
Shares have fallen in the few dollar range with no increase in sight as every report seems to point to the end of almost 92 years of Fordism .
Only a swift turnaround in the economy led by an increase in consumer spending and complete makeover of its business will allow Ford to survive .
III .
General Motors
General Motors has received cash injections from the federal government but has seen no major turnaround and a staggering 27 billion of losses in 2008 .
They would surely be bankrupt if it had not been for intervention from the feds .
In a worse situation than Ford , GM ( the second largest automaker in the world ) is nearing the end of its historic run .
IV . AIG
An American record $ 61 billion loss in a quarter and a 30 billion cash injection from the Fed ’s has been the story of AIG in the last few weeks .
Sooner or later , the government is going to stop using taxpayer money to bail out the 18th largest company in the world .
V. Sears Holding Corporation
Sears has been struggling to change its business image to appeal to customers and fend off competition from larger retailers .
With losses of $ 826 million , it ’s a matter of time before investors figure out that the $ 35 per share for SHLD is overpriced .
However , their somewhat dependable appliance division might be here to stay .
VI . Borders Books & Music
Facing stiff competition from overzealous Barnes & Nobles and Amazon.com , Border ’s holiday sales decreased over 10 % in 2008 and revenue has been dropping consistenly .
Unless their is some major reorganization at the top executive level , Border ’s will become another victim of the economy .
VII .
Rite - Aid
Rite
Aid stores are losing their appeal as CVS and Walgreen ’s have begun to entice consumers with excellent promotions , savings , and better merchandise .
Shares of Rite - Aid have fallen to about a quarter from their 52 week high of $ 3 .
More importantly , consumer reviews of Rite Aid seem to show corporate distruct and a drop in customer service , which over time translates to a drop in demand .
VIII .
Blockbuster
Overpriced and off the radar , Blockbuster has been surprassed by NetFlix .
Consumers are also turning to cheaper alternatives , such as Redbox .
Also , online statistics show in 2008 , pirated movie downloads increased more than ever before .
Blockbuster is already in great peril and seeks to change its corporate image .
MTV is adding more music videos to its schedule  at 3 a.m .
On Monday the network starts “ AMTV , ” a six - hour block for music and advertising experimentation .
From 3 to 9 a.m. Monday through Thursday , it will show music videos , news , interviews and performances , harking back to the network ’s origins as a 24 - hour home for music videos .
Now , of course , the network is more synonymous with unrealistic reality shows like “ The Hills ” than with music .
Over the years the network , a unit of Viacom , has relegated music videos to its less popular digital channels and intermissions between shows .
But the network says that by carving out a new space for artists in the mornings , it is rethinking how it programs music .
Stephen Friedman , the general manager of MTV , said the new schedule “ creates more sampling opportunities ” for viewers .
“ It gives us a much wider palette to experiment , ” he said .
The network is bringing back “ Unplugged , ” its series of acoustic performances by artists .
Mr. Friedman said the mornings would always be “ complemented by a prime - time connection , ” when the network sees its highest ratings .

McCain vs. Obama on Yucca
Related story Energy secretary : Yucca no longer option for nuclear waste
Sun Topics Yucca Mountain
WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. John McCain drew a swift response from Nevada on Thursday after he criticized the Obama administration ’s intention to substantially scale back funding for the proposed Yucca Mountain waste dump .
The former Republican presidential candidate 's comments were a reminder of the starkly different views he and his one - time rival for the White House , President Barack Obama , hold on the Yucca Mountain issue .
Rep. Shelley Berkley said , “ Senator McCain has been shameless in pushing to turn Nevada into a toxic radioactive garbage dump . ”
McCain 's comments came during a spirited exchange as he questioned Stephen Chu , Obama ’s energy secretary , at a Senate hearing on the Hill , according to the Associated Press .
" What 's wrong with Yucca Mountain , Mr. Chu ? " McCain asked , according to the AP .
" I think we can do a better job , " replied the Nobel Prize - wining physicist .
Chu said Yucca Mountain was not an option for storing spent nuclear fuel .
Earlier this week , the Sun reported that several prominent pro-Yucca Republicans are planning to fight the administration ’s plans to back off Yucca Mountain .
Without mentioning McCain , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid welcomed
Chu ’s commitment to do away with Yucca .
“ I am pleased that President Obama and Secretary Chu are holding firm on their commitment to kill the dump , ” Reid said .
Reid and the Obama administration are working with the nuclear industry to develop alternatives to Yucca .
Some want a blue ribbon committee to devise a new plan .
“ Along with the Obama administration and leaders in industry , I will be working in the coming months to determine the best way to deal with the nation 's nuclear waste , " Reid said .
What it is
Bind extends the idea of of let and destructing to provide a uniform syntax for all your accessor needs .
It combines let , destructuring - bind , with - slots , with - accessors , structure editing , property or association - lists , and multiple - value - bind and a whole lot more into a single form .
The user guide has all the details but here is example to whet your appetite :
( bind ( (a 2 ) ( ( b &rest args &key ( c 2 ) &allow - other - keys ) '( :a :c 5 :d 10 :e 54 ) ) ( ( : values d e ) ( truncate 4.5 ) ) ) ( list a b c d e args ) ) ==> ( 2 :A 5 4 0.5 ( :C 5 :D 10 :E 54 ) )
Bind is especially handy when you have more than one layer of multiple - value - bind or destructuring - bind .
Since bind is a single form , you do n't end up too far off to the right in editor land .

( Natural News ) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that the nation is unprepared for the true effects of a pandemic such as that expected from avian flu .
The department conducted a survey of the emergency preparedness plans of all 50 states , five territories and the District of Columbia .
It concluded that while most of the country is well prepared to distribute vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat an influenza pandemic , this forms only one small part of what needs to be done .
Transportation plans for a pandemic are still far from adequate , the department says .
Furthermore , many states and territories are still planning as if a pandemic would be only a short incident , rather than months of social and economic disruption that could easily spread across the world .
Health experts now accept that some sort of pandemic will inevitably strike the United States -- most likely a mutant variation on the highly lethal avian flu strain H5N1 , which has infected and killed 394 and 248 people to date , respectively .
Currently , the disease does not pass easily to or between humans , but researchers worry that it would take only a few simple mutations for that to change .
Yet while a future pandemic is accepted as reality in health circles , many governments and hospitals continue to rank preparation low on their list of priorities .
For example , most hospitals have not yet made plans for the " surge " of patients that a rapidly spreading disease would cause .
"
The vast majority of hospitals are like the vast majority of other elements -- they are in the private sector , " said Dr. Til Jolly , deputy chief medical officer at the Department of Homeland Security .
" And economic times are tough .
" The federal government has also played a role in diverting money and attention from pandemic preparedness .
" Federal funding for state and territorial pandemic preparedness ended in August 2008 , " said Paul Jarris , executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials .
" In addition , overall federal funding for preparedness activities has been cut by 25 percent since 2005 .

The New Jersey Senate has approved a bill allowing chronically ill patients legal access to marijuana .
Advocates say medicinal marijuana has been shown to alleviate pain and nausea in patients suffering from cancer , glaucoma , multiple sclerosis and HIV / AIDS when other drugs fail .
Critics claim the measure would condone and promote illegal drug use .
The bill was approved 22 - 16 , after about 15 minutes of discussion on the Senate floor today .
The New Jersey Assembly has not yet considered the measure .
If the legislation is approved , New Jersey would become the 14th state to allow medicinal marijuana .

Why Network ?
As discussed in a previous post regarding time management and Covey ’s time management matrix , it ’s not enough to just accomplish tasks – the tasks that we take on should be important .
Many would agree that expanding and nurturing your professional network is a huge asset , however let ’s look at the facts to ensure this is true .
I ’ll explore one benefit of professional networking : how it affects employment options .
Acquiring Employment – Does Networking Provide an Edge ?
A study conducted in 1974 reviewed how 282 men from varying socioeconomic backgrounds found their jobs .
The researchers reported the following results :
56 % got their job through a personal connection
got their job through a personal connection 18.8 % used formal means ( i.e. headhunters , and ads )
used formal means ( i.e. headhunters , and ads ) 20 % applied directly
The statistic that jumps out immediately is that 56 % found their job through a personal connection .
As this data shows , the people the workers knew ( and the people who knew who they were ) greatly influenced which jobs the men acquired .
This leads to the question – what kind of personal connection ?
Relatives , family friends , remote acquaintances ?
Fortunately for us , the researchers dug deeper – and have the answer to that question .
Networking and Weight of Relationships
Instinctively we might think that the connections workers used to acquire their jobs would would be through “ strong ” connections – people that they interacted with frequently .
However , this was not the case – the researchers found that these personal connections were typically “ weak ties ” , with varying levels of contact broken down as follows :
16.7 % saw the contact “ Often ” ( twice a week or more )
saw the contact “ Often ” ( ) 55.6 % saw the contact “ Occasionally ” ( less than twice a week , but more than once a year )
saw the contact “ Occasionally ” ( ) 28 % saw the contact “ Rarely ” ( once a year or less )

Practical Application – Nurturing My Own Personal and Professional Relationships
As mentioned above , 83.6 % saw their contact less than twice a week , but many saw their contacts only occasionally .
This meant I ccould improve my opportunities by nurturing my network even with infrequent meetings .
For personal satisfaction I ’d like to interact more often with many in my network , but the “ Occasionally to Rarely ” side of my network can be nurtured with fairly little effort .
By nurturing the relationships I have with my “ weak ties , ” different opportunities open up .
I believe in life it ’s not enough to simply know how to do things : it ’s important to act on that information and implement change .
Here ’s what I did after I read this study .
Contacting My “ Weak Ties ” – And Results
I contacted several of my friends that I rarely saw and offered to have coffee / tea with them .
I briefly met one of my friends , who then invited me to a Tweetup ( people on Twtitter meeting up at a certain location ) .
That in turn helped me meet 6 new people .
3 were running social media companies , 2 were looking to change directions and the last guy was a manager for a Sales Recruiting Company .
This Tweetup was helpful for nurturing my relationship with my friend but even beyond t hat , several of my new contacts run their own events .
Through their offers to attend future events , I will nurture my professional relationships with them , and perhaps meet even more people that I would probably never meet if I stayed in my comfort zone .
In addition , my relationship with my original friend is stronger as a result of my reaching out to him
The second person I met up with introduced me to people from a whole different industry that I do n’t normally associate with .
That meeting did n’t turn out to bear any fruit directly , but my reaching out once again solidified my relationship – and led to an enjoyable experience meeting and learning from people in a new industry .
Applying These Strategies In Your Own Life
Messaging Via Social Networks
So – how does this apply to you and how can you apply this knowledge ?
Everyone now is on several social networks .
I ca n’t remember the last time I asked what someone ’s e-mail was when I was meeting them for the first time .
The question is always “ Are you on ____ ? ” and the network may vary from Facebook , LinkedIn , Myspace , Twitter to Greenlight Community .
In my experience , the easiest and least invasive interaction that I used to initiate contact was through social networking , and in my case specifically – Facebook .
I simply look through my network , see who I have n’t talked to or seen in awhile and send them a message that goes something like this :
“ Hey how ’s it going ?
Have n’t talked in a while , was thinking that we should meet up for coffee or tea sometime this week or next week to catch up . ”
Specific tips on Messaging via Social Networks :
Keep it brief .
Short and straight to the point is the best way to open up communication .

Send something interesting you found online .
When you send a link , add some of your own thoughts to it .
Do n’t just send people a story , photo or video : explain why you felt it was relevant to them
Pinging
[ reddit-me ]
Some of you may be familiar with the term pinging from working on websites .
Pinging is a technique used to check whether a webserver is available and responding to contact .
The purpose of the message is simply to get a response , and for each machine to be aware the other is there .
Pinging is something I learned about a couple of years ago and has helped tremendously in nurturing my network , particularly with people I do n’t interact with often in person .
Most people only contact others in their network when they want something from them .
This can lead to resentment , and understandably so – would n’t you prefer to stay in touch with someone who contacts you to provide value , versus someone who only contacts you only when they need something ?
Pinging is simply reaching out to keep communication open , and providing value in your relationship .
There are so many different ways to ping people , from social networks to email .
Here are some specific tips on the best way to utilize each of these mediums :
Calling and Texting – I call or text people that I want to know better in my network about once a week to see how they are doing .
Note that there is n’t any ulterior motive – I care about how they are doing and how I might be able to help them in their life .
With new contacts I usually contact them by text once a week and call once every two weeks to build a good relationship .
Different people may desire contact more or less frequently

Sharing information is always a good way to keep in touch with people .

Email – I prefer not to write e-mails because those tend to be longer than a text and to me less personal than a phone call .
Some people can be very protective of their inbox , while others are constantly overwhelmed and will lose your email in their digital pile of things to do .
I would strongly recommend against forwarding jokes , large images and videos via email , unless you already have a strong relationship and know the person very well – you never know who you might offend .

Instant Messaging – Instant messaging can be welcome , or it can be very intrusive .
I recommend using an asynchronous method of communication ( such as email or messaging via a social network ) before instant messaging .
Final Thoughts : Be Authentic
In the end , remember that relationships are built on trust .
I never ping or reach out in order to selfishly take from people : I always reach out and meet up in person so we can enjoy each other ’s company .
The one thing I am thinking when I am pinging is always “ How can I add value to this person ’s life ? “
Be authentic , add value – and nurture your network now , so that they ’ll want to help you when a mutually beneficial opportunity arises .

My friend abruptly stopped walking as we approached a street corner just outside of New Orleans ’ French Quarter .
It was the day before Mardi Gras and the sidewalks hummed with stumbling revelers , drinks - in - hand .
Hints of live jazz made their way lazily from the banks of the Mississippi River a few blocks away .
The friend , a Teach for America middle school teacher in New Orleans , turned to me and said , “ That ’s one of my students . ”
Ahead were three kids , tap dancing for change .
We gathered in front of the closest one , my friend ’s student who we ’ll call “ Michael , ” and clapped along as he danced for us .
His torn and faded Nikes had little bits of metal seemingly dug in the middle of the shoe , flattening out into a device that jutted in front of the toe , looking like a combination of a gardening hoe and steel - tipped boots .
As he got going , my friend cheered him on , “ Yeah , Michael , yeah , looking great . ”
Michael smiled wide , revealing a chipped right front tooth , still not saying a word — just dancing .
He looked about 13 years old .
He was good , the rhythms from his shoes blending perfectly with the sounds of America ’s most fun city .
My friend tossed some cash in Michael ’s hat and told him he ’d see him in class .
Michael never spoke , but looked thrilled to see my friend .
I had heard horror stories about my friend ’s classroom , but this moment was a reminder of the impact a teacher can have on a life .
When we were out of earshot , I asked my friend if Michael was one of his better students , one he was closest to .
“ Well , ” he said , “ he just came back to class from a prison stint for armed robbery .
He ’s a really sweet kid , but he follows the lead of one of the other 16 - year - olds in the class , who is a bad influence .
Yeah , Michael is 16 , not 13 .
Some mornings I say , ‘ Hey Michael , ’ and he says , ‘ Hey Mister , ’ some mornings I say , ‘ Hey Michael , ’ and he says , ‘ Fuck you . ’
Maybe he did n’t eat breakfast those mornings .
He ’s probably malnourished , which is why he looks so young .
But he ’s one of the sweetest kids .
He really is . ”
I come across stories like this every now and then .
I see them on the news , watch them in movies , television .
I hear them from friends and acquaintances .
But there is no substitute for seeing Michael in person , then finding out he was part of an armed robbery .
And this is what my friend deals with every day .
And I can’t possibly imagine how my brief encounter with a smiling boy compares to his daily reality .
My front right tooth is chipped , the same as Michael’s .
They are actually both chipped at nearly the same angle , when I come to think about it .
But you ’d never know if you met me because the tooth was capped by a dentist so talented I sometimes forget which front tooth is real .
There is nothing I can do about my good fortune other than be grateful .
But there are people — like my friend — who are trying to turn Michael ’s fortune around .
Teachers are n’t particularly controversial figures ; they ’re pretty much universally recognized as the good guys .
I spoke to several other teachers while in New Orleans and listened to their stories .
They spoke of small victories , trying to balance the tough hours and constant barrage of malicious insults with feelings of accomplishment and reminding themselves that they are doing something good .
They were all intelligent , thoughtful , with a sense of justice , purpose , service , and especially humor .
My teachers , too , were like this , at least the ones I remember best .
Without them , I would be someone else .
Sometimes I underestimate their effect on me .
My history major , my decision to go into journalism , my love of writing — I was not born with these decisions made , and when I look back , I can see a teacher smiling at me behind each decision .
I will not name one because I would need to name so many , but they should know what they ’ve meant .
Teaching is becoming an increasingly high - profile position , but for a moment , I want to keep it simple and thank them , and I hope you do , too .
Every teacher should be granted a reminder of why they do what they do , a candle in what can sometimes be a dark place .
This week , my friend was trying to elicit a story from his English class about a fictional worst birthday party ever .
No one seemed enthused until one student mentioned that it was the worst birthday party ever because my friend , their teacher , showed up .
That got the class going , and soon they had a whole list of ways that teacher ruined the party : he stunk , he was uninvited , and he wore a silly polo shirt .
They then wrote full - page stories on their own about my friend ’s incredible ability to ruin a party .
“ But it was a victory for me in the end , ” he told me .
“ Because they wrote . ”
The author of Clojure , Rich Hickey , has been contemplating changing the behavior of one of Clojure 's core features , the seq abstraction .
He 's been working on a few different alternatives for a couple months now .
First , a quick review of how things stand now .
Currently a lazy seq can be produced by using lazy - cons :
( defn my - range [ from to ] ( when ( < from to ) ( lazy - cons from ( my-range ( inc from ) to ) ) ) )
Calling my - range returns a lazy seq of the integers between from and to .
This seq can be used by any of the functions that consume seqs :
user= > ( reduce + ( my- range 5 10 ) ) 35
Reduce takes the first two numbers in the seq ( 5 and 6 ) and passes them as parameters to the addition function .
This result and the next value from the seq ( 11 and 7 ) are passed to the addition function again .
This continues until the end of the seq is reached , and the result ( 35 ) is returned .
The first alternative I heard about is the Left Fold Enumerator ( LFE ) .
LFEs are about inversion of control , where the function passed to reduce would be in charge of the looping and could choose to stop before the end of the seq and signal to the seq to free any resources it was holding .
This was was explored in much more detail by Christophe Grand .
However after some consideration , Rich appears to have abandoned the idea of replacing Clojure 's current seq abstraction with LFEs .
The next alternative is something called " streams " .
These are stateful iterators , carefully protected to help prevent the problems of state that Clojure sets out to solve .
Their main benefits over the existing seq model are better performance and more complete laziness .
Clojure 's existing seq abstraction could be built on top of streams such that both the extra laziness and most of the performance would be available to user - level code that remains almost entirely unchanged
One user - visible change would be the loss of a feature called nil punning .
Currently , something that returns a seq actually promises to return either an instance of ISeq ( which is guaranteed to have at least one item in it ) , or nil .
Since nil acts like false , you can write code like :
( if ( filter odd ? coll ) ; nil pun ( println " coll is a bit odd " ) ( println " no odds in coll " ) )
If there are no odd numbers in coll , filter promises to return nil , otherwise it will return a lazy seq containing all the odd numbers .
With streams , though , the behavior changes : filter could return a non-nil object representing an empty stream .
This provides the extra laziness that 's desirable , but the example above would no longer be correct .
If you want to find out if the stream is empty , you must force it to do some traversal , the idiom for which is to get a seq of the stream :
( if ( seq ( filter odd ? coll ) ) ( println " coll is a bit odd " ) ( println " no odds in coll " ) )
The only way to save nil punning would be to provide a whole separate set of seq - library - like functions for dealing with streams : filter - stream , map - stream , concat - stream , etc .
These would not allow nil punning , but the regular seq functions would continue to behave as they always had .
Despite the potential loss of nil punning , Rich thought this approach had enough promise that he forked a streams branch of Clojure and wrote some docs :
( defn my - range [ from to ] ( let [ a ( atom ( dec from ) ) ] ( stream ( fn [ eos ] ( swap ! a inc ) ( if ( < @a to ) @a eos ) ) ) ) )
But the stateful and imperative nature of the streams code were apparently unpleasant enough that he began looking at another alternative .
This new lazy branch does not have quite the performance benefits of streams , but does keep the immutable nature of Clojure and adds the extra laziness demonstrated by streams .
The lazy - cons macro is gone , and instead there is a lazy - seq macro :
( defn my - range [ from to ] ( lazy - seq ( when ( < from to ) ( cons from ( my- range ( inc from ) to ) ) ) ) )
This has the same loss of nil punning as streams , but perhaps the extra laziness is worth it .
But what happened to the resource management touted by LFEs ?
It appears likely that a new macro ( currently named ' scope ' in the streams branch ) will be introduced to help with that problem , regardless of whether the lazy or streams branch is finally adopted .
So there you have it -- two forks representing possible futures for Clojure .
Which will be the chosen path ?
Well , I can't say for sure , but the only drawback of the lazy branch compared to today 's Clojure is the loss of nil punning , and Rich seemed pleased by how little code in clojure .
core was actually making that assumption .
There 's even a compile - time flag that can be turned on to help users track down their nil puns , which I 'll blog about later .
Besides , I think Rich pushed streams as far as he could toward simplicity and protection against mutation , and still did n't like the results .
I doubt the streams branch has much future , but Rich has been asking for feedback so now's the time to explore the options and make your opinion know .
In my next blog post I 'll show my setup for easily switching between Clojure branches .
Update :
My next blog post will not be about switching Clojure branches .
As of Tue Feb 17 2009 , the lazy branch was merged into trunk .
" We appreciate we can not please everybody but there are alternatives , such as turkey ham , and we have thought long and hard about this decision and we are sure it is the right one . "
The film " Fitna " by Dutch parliament member Geert Wilders has created an uproar around the world because it links violence committed by Islamists to Islam .
Many commentators and politicians -- including the British government , which denied him entry to the country last month -- reflexively accused Mr. Wilders of inciting hatred .
The question , however , is whether the blame is with Mr. Wilders , who simply exposed Islamic radicalism , or with those who promote and engage in this religious extremism .
In other words , shall we fault ...

My casual impression is that successful authors of fiction do not have a very high opinion of college creative writing courses .
Quite a lot of them , however , seem to have developed their skills in the context of Dungeons and Dragons or similar games , as dungeon masters and / or players .
A role playing game is , after all , an exercise in collaborative story telling .
The things that make it work or not work are , to a considerable extent , the same as the things that make a novel work or not work .
And , unlike a creative writing course , the participants are doing it because they want to , for the fun of it , not because someone else has told them that this is what they have to do to learn to write .
I was reminded of this observation recently by conversation inin which a player was discussing with others his problems in writing .
It was clear , in context , that the writing was neither a school assignment nor an attempt at a publishable novel or short story , but posts to one of theforums .
Such posts often take the form of fictionalized accounts of things that actually happened in the game .
I will not be surprised to discover , ten or twenty years in the future , that some of the new generation of authors , especially fantasy authors , got their start there .
My own non-fiction writing largely developed during the years when I was producing a monthly column for , a conservative student magazine on which I was the token libertarian columnist .
There too , I was writing not as a school exercise but because I actually had things I wanted to say .
All of which fits into my general views on the advantages of unschooling , education that takes the form of doing things one wants to do , learning things one wants to learn , over the approach to education embedded in the conventional K - 12 curriculum and many college courses .
A friend asked me for a quick tip from BLONDES that she could use for her date that evening .
I threw out a few ideas — home - cooked - meal smells may be aphrodisiacs , for instance .
But this was a first date , she said , and she wanted to be cool and casual .
She had in mind a wine bar .
I had a better idea .
I told her to go somewhere that serves hot stuff in huge mugs .
Hot chocolate , coffee , tea .
Anything warm , nothing cold .
And not just because it ’s cold outside .
My advice draws on a popular study by Yale psychologist John Bargh ( an advisee of Robert Zajonc ) , who studies nonconscious social behavior .
Bargh asks :
“ What in our surroundings causes us to think , feel , and behave in ways without our intention or awareness ? ”
The smell of lemon , for example , makes people feel compulsed to clean .
The sound of Christmas music makes people want to shop longer .
And , it turns out , the feel of a warm cup in the hand makes people perceive others as warmer , i.e. more generous and caring .
It ’s a warm and fuzzy feedback loop , because people who hold warm cups act warmer , too .
In Bargh ’s experiment , people who held a warm cup were likely to be much more generous than people who were holding a cold cup .
( One wonders : Are baristas warmer than sommeliers ? )
In a second study , the researchers had subjects briefly hold either a cup of hot coffee or cold coffee before evaluating a stranger ’s personality traits based on some stories .
Subjects who had held the hot coffee assessed the person as being “ warmer ” on the likability scale than subjects who had held the iced coffee ( 4.7 vs 4.3 ) .
And there ’s nothing magical about coffee : in other experiments , subjects who merely held a hot therapeutic pack judged others as warmer , and in turn acted more generously , than people who held ice packs .
What ’s going on , according to the researchers , is a sort of conflation of physical and emotional warmth .
A high temperature triggers activity in the insular cortex , an “ old ” brain structure that plays a role in processing both emotional and sensory experiences .
It ’s also the part of the brain that contains mirror neurons , which help people connect emotionally with others .
Of course , it all makes you wonder if the same phenomenon applies to climates .
Is there any truth to the stereotype that Southerners are warm - hearted whereas Northerners are cold , Finns are temperamentally frigid and Haitians are hot ?
Is it any accident that the ice between couples melts when they go on beach vacations ?
As instructed , my friend made her date wrap his hands around a mug of cocoa .
It went well .
He even called her later this evening to say how much he liked her .
Of course , the feel - good dopamine blast from all the milk fat and sugar in the cocoa probably did n’t hurt either .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. food companies are tailoring their marketing strategies to the recession , trying to stretch budgets without cutting back on experiments with pushes into new areas such as online “ viral ” campaigns .
Constellation Brands CEO Robert Sands speaks during the Reuters Food and Agriculture Summit in Chicago March 18 , 2009 .
REUTERS / John Gress
Executives at this week ’s Reuters Food and Agriculture Summit said they were using more efficient ways to marketproducts , and most said cutting back was not a good thing .
Constellation Brands STZ.N CEO Robert Sands said his overall advertising budget generally rises with inflation .
Yet he said he plans to spend more to market Constellation 's Svedka vodka , whose growth has been largely fueled by the online popularity of its futuristic female " spokesbot . "
“ That ’s the most contemporary example of how you reach ( younger ) consumers who are not receiving their advertisements through watching TV or reading magazines or newspapers anymore , ” Sands said .
Besides offering demographic advantages , online or viral campaigns are often less expensive than splashy TV or radio advertisements , adding to their attractiveness , said Mark Schiller , president of Quaker Oats ’ North American business .
Earlier this month , Quaker launched a campaign including billboards , print ads , giveaways and a temporary appearance on Yahoo.com of its Quaker man flying across the screen .
The campaign ’s scope was a departure from Quaker ’s earlier reliance on television and print .
“ For really the first time in -- I think in forever , but certainly in my tenure with the company , this is much more of a ‘ surround - sound ’ campaign , ” Schiller said .
“ One of the positives in tough economic times is your dollars go a lot farther .
So we ’re finding that we get a much bigger bang for our buck in terms of purchasing power . ”
FOOD MAKERS GAIN PROMINENCE
U.S. advertising spending is expected to fall between 5 percent and 10 percent this year due to cutbacks by retailers , automakers and financial service firms .
This is also pressuring advertising rates .
Spending by food companies , which are in far less turmoil , is expected to hold up better .
By simply maintaining their budgets this year , food companies could see their share of U.S. advertising rise in 2009 , after increasing slightly in 2008 to 5.6 percent , according to TNS Media Intelligence .
Bakery - cafe chain Panera Bread Co PNRA.O is currently testing its first big foray into television .
As advertising costs come down , Panera can “ dramatically ” increase the value of its advertising at “ modestly ” higher prices , said William Moreton , co-chief operating officer .
The company has also been testing billboards , radio and the Internet , he said .
Whether on the web or on TV , marketers including food companies are increasingly using ads to trumpet cost savings .
Coupons , giveaways or entire campaigns built to promote “ value ” for consumers feeling the pinch of the recession have become a top trend .
Sara Lee Corp SLE.N , maker of Sara Lee bread and Jimmy Dean sausages , is shifting some of its marketing dollars from media toward in - store promotions , CEO Brenda Barnes said .
“ It has to do with making sure that the value ... in - store hits the right price points , ” Barnes told the Summit .
The company is emphasizing the value of its Jimmy Dean Skillet product , Barnes said , noting that a consumer just has to add eggs and can feed a family of five a hearty breakfast for about $ 5.00 .
The current draw of economical foods also has been a boon to Hormel Foods Corp HRL.N , which for the first time in a long while has increased its advertising efforts around its Spam luncheon meat and Dinty Moore stew .
Hormel spent more in fiscal 2008 on advertising than in prior years , and CEO Jeff Ettinger said he is hoping to increase spending this year as well .
“ We have 35 items within the portfolio that are either No. 1 or No. 2 , ” Ettinger said .
“ We do need to support those brands . ”
( New York ) -
The sentencing of four Tehran bloggers by Iran 's Judiciary Court on February 3 , 2009 , to prison terms , fines and flogging , despite the head of the judiciary 's admission that they had been coerced into confessing , violates their right to a fair trial , Human Rights Watch and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said today .
The four said shortly after their arrest in 2004 that they had been tortured during interrogation , but there has been no public investigation into these allegations despite a high - level promise to do so .
Authorities arrested Omid Memarian , Roozbeh Mirebrahimi , Shahram Rafizadeh , and Javad Gholamtamimi in September and October 2004 , and detained them without charge .
The four said that they were subjected in detention to physical and psychological abuse , as well as prolonged periods of solitary confinement in a secret detention center without access to counsel or family .
Three of the men subsequently described the abuse at a meeting with Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi , the head of the judiciary .
On April 20 , 2005 , a judiciary spokesman said that an official investigation confirmed that their confessions had been coerced .
" The interrogators and prosecutors committed a series of negligent and careless acts in this case that led to the abuse of the detainees ' words and writings in producing confession letters , " the spokesman said .
" These sentences are shocking , given that the head of the judiciary himself admitted the evidence had been obtained by coercion " said Joe Stork , deputy director of the Middle East division at Human Rights Watch .
" The judges should be investigating and prosecuting abusers , not their victims . "
Human Rights Watch and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran called on the Tehran Appeals Court to overturn the sentences , and on the government to investigate the torture claims .
The four journalists were released on bail in late 2004 .
Memarian , Mirebrahimi , and Rafizadeh subsequently left Iran and are living abroad .
Gholamtamimi resides in Iran .
Judiciary authorities informed lawyers for the four on February 4 that Branch 1059 of Tehran 's Judiciary Court sentenced them each to prison terms of up to three years and three months , and to be flogged .
Memarian was also fined 500,000 tomans ( US$ 520 ) .
The known charges against them include " participating in the establishment of illegal organizations , " " membership in illegal organizations , " " propaganda against the state , " " disseminating lies , " and " disturbing public order . "
Gholamtamimi was also charged with treason .
The lawyers for the four include the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Shirin Ebadi , who told Human Rights Watch and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran that they would " definitely appeal " the sentences .
Memarian , Mirebrahimi , and Rafizadeh met with Ayatollah Shahroudi on January 10 , 2005 , and described physical and psychological torture at the hands of a specific interrogator , whom they said identified himself as " Keshavarz " ( farmer ) .
They said the magistrate in charge was known as " Mehdipour . "
The apparent purpose of the abuse was to extract confessions that implicate reformist politicians and civil society activists in activities such as spying and violating national security laws ( https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2004/12/19/iran-judiciary-uses-coercion-cover-torture ) .
According to the three men , both the interrogator and the magistrate repeatedly delivered messages and threats to the detainees on behalf of the chief prosecutor of Tehran .
Shahroudi's spokesman announced on January 12 , 2005 that , " Shahroudi has issued a special order to investigate and probe these [ detentions ] .
If any of the detainees ' allegations , at any level , are true then we will prosecute the violators . "
To date , the government has not made the full findings of any investigation public , nor has it announced any penalties or prosecution for the abuse .
" Either the Iranian judges are not listening to Ayatollah Shahroudi , or he has reneged on his promise to investigate the torturers and not the bloggers , " said Hadi Ghaemi , coordinator of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran .
" These brave journalists stood up for their rights .
It 's high time the Iranian judiciary stood up for justice . "
Human Rights Watch and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran have documented extensive patterns of forced confessions , arbitrary detentions , and prison torture against opposition political activists , journalists , and anyone perceived as a critic .

• Judge describes sentence as ' an act of mercy ' •
Drug sold to people with ' aches and pains '
A 72 - year - old milkman who supplied cannabis to customers on his rounds to help ease their aches and pains was today given a suspended sentence .
Robert Holding , of Burnley in Lancashire , was sentenced at Burnley crown court for supplying and possessing the drug .
The court heard that his wife has Alzheimer 's disease and has recently moved into a care home , where he visits her every day .
He was sentenced to 36 weeks on each count , suspended for a year .
Judge Beverley
Lunt told him the sentence was " an act of mercy " in the light of his wife 's illness .
At an earlier hearing , Holding had admitted supplying cannabis resin between April and July 2008 , and possessing cannabis with intent to supply on July 17 last year .
Sarah Statham , prosecuting , told the court that police uncovered his activities and raided his property when his wife and daughter were at home .
During the raid , Holding arrived home in the Transit van he used for his milk round and officers found nearly 167g ( 6 oz ) of cannabis split into 15 separate packets in an egg crate in the vehicle .
Statham said the smallest amount the packets contained was 3g of the drug and the largest amount was 20g .
She said the cannabis had an estimated street value of £ 450 .
Statham said that , during the course of an eight - minute police interview , the defendant was " extremely frank " .
" He said he sold the cannabis to existing customers because they were old and had aches and pains , " she said .
" He said he sold a 9 oz [ 255g ] bar about every three weeks and sold it for a relatively cheap value .
" He said that customers left him notes saying , for example , ' Can I have an ounce this week or can I have an eighth ' . "
Statham revealed that Holding sold an ounce for £ 30 or one - eighth for £ 4.10 to 17 customers .
She said Holding , a motorcycle enthusiast , said he would never sell the drug to children .
The court heard that Holding has been married for 53 years and has six children and 28 grandchildren .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has worsened sharply since President Barack Obama took office as prison guards “ get their kicks in ” before the camp is closed , according to a lawyer who represents detainees .
Abuses began to pick up in December after Obama was elected , human rights lawyer Ahmed Ghappour told Reuters .
He cited beatings , the dislocation of limbs , spraying of pepper spray into closed cells , applying pepper spray to toilet paper and over - forcefeeding detainees who are on hunger strike .
The Pentagon said on Monday that it had received renewed reports of prisoner abuse during a recent review of conditions at Guantanamo , but had concluded that all prisoners were being kept in accordance with the Geneva Conventions .
“ According to my clients , there has been a ramping up in abuse since President Obama was inaugurated , ” said Ghappour , a British - American lawyer with Reprieve , a legal charity that represents 31 detainees at Guantanamo .
“ If one was to use one ’s imagination , ( one ) could say that these traumatized , and for lack of a better word barbaric , guards were just basically trying to get their kicks in right now for fear that they wo n’t be able to later , ” he said .
“ Certainly in my experience there have been many , many more reported incidents of abuse since the inauguration , ” added Ghappour , who has visited Guantanamo six times since late September and based his comments on his own observations and conversations with both prisoners and guards .
He stressed the mistreatment did not appear to be directed from above , but was an initiative undertaken by frustrated U.S. army and navy jailers on the ground .
It did not seem to be a reaction against the election of Obama , a Democrat who has pledged to close the prison camp within a year , but rather a realization that there was little time remaining before the last 241 detainees , all Muslim , are released .
“ It ’s ‘ hey , let ’s have our fun while we can , ’ ” said Ghappour , who helped secure the release this week of Binyam Mohamed , a British resident freed from Guantanamo Bay after more than four years in detention without trial or charge .
“ I ca n’t really imagine why you would get your kicks from abusing prisoners , but certainly , having spoken to certain guards who have been injured in Iraq , who indirectly or directly blame my clients for their injuries and the trauma they have suffered , it ’s not too difficult to put two and two together . ”
FORCE -FEEDING
Following a January 22 order from Obama , the U.S. Defense Department conducted a two - week review of conditions at Guantanamo ahead of the planned closure of the prison on Cuba .
Admiral Patrick Walsh , the review ’s author , acknowledged on Monday that reports of abuse had emerged but concluded all inmates were being treated in line with the Geneva Conventions .
“ We heard allegations of abuse , ” he said , asked if detainees had reported torture .
“ And what we did at that point was to go back and investigate the allegation ...
What we found is that there were in some cases substantiated evidence where guards had misconduct , I think that would be the best way to put it . ”
An inmate is pictured in his cell at the detention complex for terrorism suspects at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , July 23 , 2008 .

Walsh said his review looked at 20 allegations of abuse , 14 of which were substantiated , but he did not go into details .
Generally he said the abuse ranged from “ gestures , comments , disrespect ” to “ preemptive use of pepper spray . ”
Ghappour said he had spoken to army guards who , unsolicited , had described the pleasure they took in abusing prisoners , whether interrupting prayer or physical mistreatment .
He said they appeared unconcerned about potential repercussions .
He also saw evidence of guards pulling identity numbers off their uniforms or switching them once they were on duty in order to make it more difficult for them to be identified .
Ghappour said he had filed two complaints of serious detainee abuse since December 22 but received no response from U.S. authorities .
In one case his client had his knee , shoulder and thumb dislocated by a group of guards , Ghappour said .
In one of the six main camps at Guantanamo , the lawyer said all the detainees he knew were on hunger strike and subject to force - feeding , including with laxatives that induced chronic diarrhea while they were strapped in their feeding chairs .
“ Several of my clients have had toilet paper pepper - sprayed while they have had hemorrhoids , ” Ghappour said .
Another area of concern was evidence that detainees were being abused on the way to meetings with their lawyers -- sometimes so badly that they no longer wanted to meet with counsel for fear of the beatings they would receive , he said .
“ Some detainees are convinced they are going to be locked up there forever , despite the promises to close the camp , ” he said .
Twenty - five years is a long time .
The decades keep rockin ' and rollin ' by - first one , then the next , then , finally , half of the next .
Has it really been a full quarter - century since This is Spinal Tap , when the world saw a decent , hard - working , hard - rocking band depicted as a full - stop laughing stock ?
First , some facts : many nights on the road , even during that now - famous American tour , we found our way to the stage just fine , no problem .
Many witnesses .
Next , when Tap played Royal Albert Hall in ' 93 , the Stonehenge was too big to fit in the venue .
So , it 's hard to get these things exactly right .
It 's trial and error , is n't it ?
And is n't that true of life itself ?
Being in a band that has had to outlive its notoriety to get a chance at fame has produced plenty of both trials and errors .
My first divorce trial , for example .
And who would have known , 25 years ago , that being in one of England 's loudest bands , and standing next to a succession of England 's loudest drummers , would result in severe high - frequency hearing loss ?
Obviously , not me .
So here we stand , on the threshold of the precipice of our next quarter - century .
David [ St. Hubbins ] , Nigel [ Tufnel ] and I still believe in the same things : rockin ' the world extra hard , getting a slice of the gold ring , and professional management .
No doubt , a remarkably wide range of trashy souvenirs - hastily printed shirts , grotesquely designed " action figures " - will flood the marketplace this year .
At least , I hope so .
There may well be " now it can be told " - type exposés of our lifestyles - David 's womanising , Nigel 's ferret fetish , my interest in rare first editions of certain photo magazines .
We 're open to offers .
Of course , in this economy , when so many people are being rendered as redundant as hard rock in the hip - hop years , we wo n't be staging large , OTT tours of the UK , the US , and the U - everywhere else .
But there will be tribute productions .
Three Yanks - Mssrs. Guest , McKean , and Shearer - are rumoured to be preparing acoustic shows that will include Tap songs among other , less powerful , selections .
Where they will be , so will we , at least in spirit , if not in royalties .

Scientists have found a way to make an almost limitless supply of stem cells that could safely be used in patients while avoiding the ethical dilemma of destroying embryos .
In a breakthrough that could have huge implications , British and Canadian scientists have found a way of reprogramming skin cells taken from adults , effectively winding the clock back on the cells until they were in an embryonic form .
The work has been hailed as a major step forward by scientists and welcomed by pro-life organisations , who called on researchers to halt other experiments which use stem cells collected from embryos made at IVF clinics .
Sir Ian Wilmut , who led the team that cloned Dolly the Sheep and heads the MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University where the work was done , said : " This is a significant step in the right direction .
The team has made great progress and combining this work with that of other scientists working on stem cell differentiation , there is hope that the promise of regenerative medicine could soon be met . "
Stem cells have the potential to be turned into any tissue in the body , an ability that has led researchers to believe they could be used to make " spare parts " to replace diseased and damaged organs and treat conditions as diverse as Parkinson 's disease , diabetes and spinal cord injury .
Because the cells can be made from a patient 's own skin , they carry the same DNA and so could be used without a risk of being rejected by the immune system .
Scientists showed they could make stem cells from adult cells more than a year ago , but the cells could never be used in patients because the procedure involved injecting viruses that could cause cancer .
Overcoming the problem has been a major stumbling block in efforts to make stem cells fulfil their promise of transforming the future of medicine .
Now , scientists at the universities of Edinburgh and Toronto have found a way to achieve the same feat without using viruses , making so - called induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cell therapies a realistic prospect for the first time .
In 2007 , researchers in Japan and America announced they had turned adult skin cells into stem cells by injecting them with a virus carrying four extra genes .
Because the virus could accidentally switch on cancer genes , the cells would not be safe enough to use in patients .
In two papers published in the journal Nature , Keisuke Kaji in Edinburgh and Andras Nagy in Toronto , describe how they reprogrammed cells using a safer technique called electroporation .
This allowed the scientists to do away with viruses and ferry genes into the cells through pores .
Once the genes had done their job , the scientists removed them , leaving the cells healthy and intact .
Tests on stem cells made from human and mouse cells showed they behaved in the same as embryonic stem cells .
" I was very excited when I found stem cell - like cells in my culture dishes .
Nobody , including me , thought it was really possible , " said Kaji .
" It is a step towards the practical use of reprogrammed cells in medicine , perhaps even eliminating the need for human embryos as a source of stem cells . "
Nagy said : " We hope that these stem cells will form the basis for treatment for many diseases and conditions that are currently considered incurable .
We have found a highly efficient and safe way to create new cells for the human body which avoids the challenge of immune rejection . "
Josephine Quintavalle from the lobby group Comment on Reproductive Ethics , which opposes embryonic stem cell research , said : " What we 've got here is something that will bring joy to the pro-life movement , a way of obtaining embryonic - type stem cells without having to destroy human embryos .
" There are some scientists who like to hold on to what they 've got , but I do n't think people are going to waste time on embryonic stem cells any more .
Half of Europe is opposed to embryonic stem cell research .
Ideally you want something that everybody can use without any problems .
This is definitely a very , very promising way forward and a very promising solution to the embryonic stem cell battle . "
It would be some time before the cells could be used in patients , Wilmut said , because scientists have yet to find reliable ways of making different tissues from stem cells .

The late winter storm now pounding the northeast US is n't the only freak weather event currently in progress .
Hell itself has frozen over , and the proof is that , for the first time in history , Intel is partially outsourcing the fabrication of one of its CPUs to a foundry .
Intel and TSMC have jointly announced the start of a long - term , " strategic " collaboration in which Atom IP will be ported to TSMC 's manufacturing process , with the Taiwanese foundry fabricating Atoms for some customers .
" It is a long - term collaboration .
It is not about capacity .
It 's a strategic relationship that allows us to expand the growth opportunities for both companies , " said an Intel spokesperson on a call announcing the venture .
" This relationship between us and TSMC is strategic in nature ; it 's the first time we 've ported a processor externally outside of an Intel process . "
Both parties are being deliberately vague on the timing and the process node at which this will start , stressing that the current announcement is just about the " memorandum of understanding " ( MOU ) that they 've signed .
( The press release is similarly vague . )
News of specific plans and products will follow much later , once the details have been worked out .
Intel 's Sean Maloney set out to give the company 's official explanation for the move by touting Intel 's recent announcements of investments in 32nm and stressing that Intel still sees itself as a manufacturing company .
He then jumped to the non-sequitur that the TSMC agreement will allow Intel to " attack new markets " and offer " post - recession products . "
In response to questions , Maloney stressed that the existing Atom roadmap is unchanged , and that the TSMC relationship was not about replacing Intel 's existing fab capacity , but about new markets .
" We 're doing it because it enables us to get access to a market that we can't do alone , " Maloney said .
" This does n't replace what we 're doing already , or what they 're doing already .
It 's additive to what we 're currently doing . "
Intel totally failed to explain why its massive new investments in 32nm , not to mention its current 45 nm plants and substantial legacy fab capacity , are n't just as amenable to " attacking new markets " as outsourced fab capacity .
But while Intel can't possibly admit this , the reason is as clear as day :
Atom is just too cheap to support Intel 's legacy business model , which is about funding expensive new fabs on the backs of high - margin sales of existing , high - performance processors .
Betting the farm
Intel 's margins on Atom are much thinner than those on regular desktop and server CPUs , and with each process shrink , Atom 's cost ( and price ) will go down .
But fabs get more expensive with each shrink , so the result is that Intel has to sell many more Atoms at 32nm than it does at 45 nm to make money .
The demand for all of those Atoms may or may not materialize , which is why Intel will pay TSMC to fab them and share the risk that the demand may not be there .
Meanwhile , Intel wants to save its ( very costly ) in - house fab capacity for high - margin products , like its CPUs .
There 's one big question about the new arrangement : could Intel actually stay in business by producing mainly Atom - class products on its 32nm and smaller lines , if the demand for performance increases fails to recover ?
The main problem facing Intel is that , right now , nobody wants high - margin , high - performance CPUs .
The demand is there for the cheap stuff , but Intel would rather not take the risk that this appetite for cheap will continue to balloon by turning even more of its premium in - house fab capacity to the task of cranking out Atoms .
Better to dedicate the costly new 32nm fabs to producing high - margin CPUs on the hopes that demand for performance will eventually recover , while letting TSMC 's fabs support any further growth in the Atom market .
There 's one big question about the new arrangement : could Intel actually stay in business by producing mainly Atom - class products on its 32nm and smaller lines , if the demand for performance increases fails to recover ?
In other words , it could be that Intel has no choice but to bet everything on the possibility that a global appetite for 32nm , high - performance , high - margin CPUs will actually rematerialize , because the company could n't keep going if it had to use its new fabs to support a rising demand for Atoms in - house .
I think the answer to the above question is " no , Intel could n't survive in a world where the vast majority of customers just want ever cheaper Atoms , and relatively few are willing to pay premiums for continued performance scaling . "
I do n't have the numbers to back this up , though .
On a final note , props to Dave Manners , who saw this coming when Craig Barrett simply resigned as Intel 's Chairman without triggering the normal chain of succession at the company :
It looks as if , instead of waiting for the normal orderly succession , Barrett has decided that it 's time to go .
Now why should he want to go ?
Having survived 35 years in the fearsomely confrontational Intel culture , he would not leave over a small thing .
But there 's one issue he might leave over : Intel 's strategy as a manufacturer .
Intel has always been a leader in process engineering .
Barrett came from the manufacturing side of Intel , and re-vitalised the companies ' fabs during his time as CEO with his ' copy exactly ' strategy .
If there was to be any change proposed in Intel 's manufacturing strategy , Barrett might decide he does n't want to stay around to preside over it .
Today 's announcement of a major shift in Intel 's manufacturing strategy suggests that this is exactly what happened .
Barrett apparently did n't want to stick around at an Intel that outsources parts of its core CPU business .

( CNN ) -- Critics took to the social networking site Facebook to voice their fury over Pope Benedict 's remark that condoms do not prevent HIV .
Pope Benedict XVI 's anti-condom comments have raised the ire of some Facebook users .
Thousands have pledged to send the pontiff millions of condoms to protest the controversial comment he made to journalists as he flew to Cameroon last week .
" You ca n't resolve it with the distribution of condoms , " the pope told reporters .
" On the contrary , it increases the problem . "
Pope Benedict XVI has made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional Catholic teaching on artificial contraception .
The Vatican has long opposed the use of condoms and other forms of birth control and encourages sexual abstinence to fight the spread of the disease .
About a dozen Facebook groups have sprung up , mostly from European countries , criticizing the pontiff .
" The clergy are n't supposed to have sex at all , but they are free to tell people how to conduct themselves ?
That 's like a girl who wears no make - up as the CEO of CoverGirl , " one member posted on the page , " Condoms for Pope Benedict XVI . "
" It frightens me that a man who has devoted his life to moral guidance ... and is undeniably a learned , intelligent man can be at the same time so narrow - minded , bigoted and irresponsible , " posted another person on a different page .
The online campaign added another voice to a deluge of criticism , which includes the governments of France , Germany and Belgium .
Aid agencies and other health organizations have also chimed in .
The Lancet , a British medical journal , urged the pope Saturday to issue a retraction for the " outrageous and wildly inaccurate " statement to journalists aboard his plane .
" When any influential person , be it a religious or political leader , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " The Lancet said in an editorial .
" Anything less from Pope Benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of Catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of HIV / AIDS worldwide . "
Some in the Catholic Church have rallied to the pontiff 's support .
Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco , head of the Italian Bishops Conference , told Times Online in Britain that Benedict was simply pointing out that condoms " had not solved and could not solve the AIDS problem . "
Despite the controversy , the pope 's pilgrimage spurred excitement in Africa .
An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear him preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday , the last major event of his trip .
He spoke of the need for reconciliation in the country , which has endured a brutal civil war .
" Look to the future with hope , trust in God 's promises and live in his truth .
In this way you will build something that will stand and endure , " he said .

OKC - WHAT REALLY DESTROYED THE BUILDING ?
PART 1
By : Devvy January 11 , 2004 NewsWithViews.com
" We will leave no stone unturned in our effort to get to the truth . " ï¿½ Attorney General Janet Reno Recently two new articles on the OKC bombing have been published : January 28 , 2004 , McCurtain Daily Gazette Langan to testify at Nichols trial , name others in OKC bombing " A convicted neo - Nazi bank robber is expected to name several other suspects in the Oklahoma City bombing when he testifies in the trial of Terry Nicholsï¿ ½.. "
The article gives general background and then states : " Briefly explaining the scope of his expected testimony , Langan indicated that he will provide evidence to the jury that will tie McVeigh and the bomb plot to several men with very close connections to the white supremacist enclave called Elohim City . "
I find it rather suspect that after all these years , just at the time when Nichols is scheduled to be tried again at the state level , a convicted waste of human skin suddenly wants to name suspects with conveniently white supremacist ties .
In a recent phone discussion with Brigadier General Ben Partin , U.S.A.F. ( Retired ) , this association with the Elohim City connection is " a manufactured image to justify all this anti-terrorism legislation .
Blame everything on the ' right - wing Christian threat ' and lump them in with white supremacists .
One only has to look at the FBI 's " Project Mediggo " to see the blueprint for this scenario . "
( Megiddo means " mountain " in Hebrew , and har Megiddo , " the mountain , " eluded to become Armageddon .
According to geography books , Megiddo lies south of Nazareth , where Jesus lived as a child .
According to the New Testament , Armageddon is where Jesus will triumph over evil after an apocalyptic battle on Judgment Day .
Rather interesting that the Federal government decided to use Mediggo as the title for their home grown terrorist report . )
Unfortunately , there are neo - Nazi organizations operating in this country , one being too many .
But , to carte blanche paint every American who holds Christian beliefs as some sort of domestic terrorist is heinous and goes against everything this nation was founded upon .
Then again , the end game for those who seek destroy what we hold so dear is literally a clash of civilizations : Christianity vs. Communism .
The clash is here and now like never before in this history of this Republic .
In my opinion , the only question about the OKC bombing that should be asked is what really caused the multiple explosions that destroyed the Murrah Building ?
In a nutshell , the case of the FBI investigation into this horrific crime was beyond incompetence , it is an ongoing cover up .
The FBI manipulated any real evidence and tore at the heart strings of Americans to build their case .
The second article cited below does raise the question and rightly so about where are the video tapes known to exist of those critical moments the morning of April 19 , 1995 ?
February 1 , 2004 - Worldnetdaily.com
Ex -Congressmanï¿½s aide has video of explosion ?
" The Fairfax County , Va. , home of John Culbertson ï¿½ once a member of former U.S. Rep.
James Traficant 's scandal - plagued congressional office ï¿½ was raided Friday afternoon by Oklahoma City police detectives searching for evidence related to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing . "
According to this article , Culbertson may have in his possession a number of crucial videos and still photos never known to federal or state prosecutors until recently .
If true , it is inconceivable that this Culbertson would conceal , at his private residence no less , important evidence ï¿½ no matter who it may or may not implicate .
Further into the article it states : " In an affidavit obtained by this newspaper , Detective Easley said Mills told him the images he was shown included the Murrah building in '' pristine condition . ''
" Mills then said , '' Mr. Culbertson pushed a button and a second photograph came up with a small glow at the bottom of the building .
Mr. Culbertson pushed another button and another frame appeared of a ball of fire rising from the building and the building fell . "
Other videos still out there ?
Martin Keating ( brother of Frank Keating , former company man for the FBI and Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing ) , bragged after the bombing that he had copies of the surveillance film from the Southwest Bell building across the street from the Murrah building .
Another odd thing about Martin Keating that just can't be ignored : Brother Martin wrote a manuscript in 1991 , roughly four years before the OKC bombing .
Keating could not get this work published until after the bombing .
This manuscript , now a published book , is titled The Final Jihad .
In this book , Keating lays out a story of terrorists based in OKC who decide to bomb a federal building .
Guess what the name of the one of the key " terrorists " in the book is ?
Tom McVey .
And for the kicker of this fictional work :
The terrorists in The Final Jihad are stopped by an Oklahoma highway patrolman for a broken tail light .
How extraordinary !
We have a book in manuscript form written four years before the OKC bombing whose story line involves terrorists in Oklahoma City .
This part of this fictional work comes true .
We have a main character in the book by the name of Tom McVey .
In real life , the bomber four years later in OKC is named Tim McVeigh .
We have the terrorists in this fictional work stopped by Oklahoma state troopers for a broken tail light .
In real life , our bomber , Tim McVeigh , is pulled over by an Oklahoma state trooper because of a missing license plate .
How 's that for fiction being stranger than reality ?
In this book , written in 1991 , Martin Keating also predicts the TWA downing and the World Trade Center bombing .
Was this just a premonition that Mr. Keating had ?
The bottom line is why has n't Martin Keating been put under the microscope regarding his own statements that he has videos that could unlock the truth ?
That aside , now we are starting to touch on the real issue in the OKC bombing :
What really destroyed the building ?
It is the key to the crime and this two part series , I hope , will encourage the American people demand a real investigation by experts , who have no ties whatsoever to the Federal government , into all the facts and evidence about OKC .
McVeighï¿½s Second Trial Millions and millions of words have been written about Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols .
Most of it focuses on the " anti- government " hate mongers , Tim McVeigh , Nichols and the Ryder truck filled with drums of ammonia nitrate , which once cooked and detonated , turned into " weapons of mass destruction " that brought down the Murrah Building ï¿½ or it is alleged .
Several weeks before McVeigh 's execution , this writer authored a 228 - page document titled McVeigh 's Second Trial .
This meticulous statement of facts was not compiled to defend Timothy McVeigh , although every defendant is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty .
That was impossible in the United States v. Timothy McVeigh trial .
The greatest majority of the American people have never been told the truth about the facts surrounding that heinous act .
Both the Clinton and Bush administrations , through their minions , Janet Reno and John Ashcroft , have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal the truth and have participated in a colossal cover up pertaining to the slaughter of 168 innocent men , women , children and babies .
I am compelled to cite some of the factual details contained in McVeigh 's Second Trial because it is one of my life goals to see those who perpetrated this screaming act of murder suffer the full consequences of the law at the state level ; the feds have no jurisdiction to try McVeigh or Nichols for murder ; see the U.S. Constitution .
These are just a tiny fraction of issues covered in McVeigh 's Second Trial : Question :
With no suspects and absolutely no leads , how is it the feds zeroed in on McVeigh within 48 hours ?
Fact : Because , quite conveniently , his social security number was put out to all law enforcement as a suspect within two days of the bombing .
This is how patsy 's are made .
Question : Was Trooper Charlie Hanger alone when he pulled McVeigh over near Perry , Oklahoma ?
According to the official trial transcripts , apparently not : Trooper Hanger under cross by the completely incompetent McVeigh defense team : Q : Did you drive even with the driver 's side of Mr. McVeigh 's vehicle ?
Response by Trooper Hanger : " I actually overshot him .
We passed him . "
" We " passed him ?
Was this just a slip by Hanger because he usually rides with a partner or was there another trooper in his official car that day when the real Timothy McVeigh was pulled over ?
If so , why was he / she never mentioned or put on the stand ?
On May 20 , 1995 , just a few days before the evidence ( the Murrah Building ) was destroyed , I drove the stretch between the crime scene ( the Murrah Building ) and the location where McVeigh was pulled over .
It would have been impossible for him to drive this distance in the time available for the government 's time line to work without exceeding a consistent speed of 80 + mph .
No one has ever stepped forward to say they observed this 1977 crummy old Mercury Marquis speeding away from OKC at high speed , all the way up the interstate to the Perry turn off .
Not to mention how foolish it would have been for McVeigh to draw such attention to himself .
McVeigh 's car had very distinct rust markings , yet no one remembers seeing this vehicle speeding away from OKC to the Perry exit .
How extraordinary .
The Carol Howe Case
This case was directly connected to the investigation of the loons who lived in Elohim City , McVeigh and the bombing .
During Ms. Howe 's trial , a single witness destroys the government 's time line regarding Timothy McVeigh .
As this witness was a victim of the bombing , it is n't likely she would want to do anything to help mass murderer Timothy McVeigh , but she did .
Why on earth Stephen Jones never subpoenaed her to testify at McVeigh 's trial in Denver remains a mystery to this writer .
Testimony from the official transcripts of Germaine Johnston ; the full transcript testimony can be read in McVeighï¿½s Second Trial .
Certain parts have been omitted for brevity .
Please be prepared when you read the transcripts contained in that document because the testimony of victims and their families will rip your heart out .
Q. Did you have an encounter with someone that stood out in your mind ?
Answer by Ms. Johnston : Yes , I did .
When I got down here , to the Southwestern Bell property , there was a car sitting facing north , and there were two young men standing by it .
And as -- approached them .
Q. Do you know about how long after the bombing that would have been ?
A . My estimate would be that it was 20 or 25 minutes afterwards .
I think between 9:25 and 9:35 or something like that .
Q. Okay .
Now , you said that there were two young men that you saw ?
A . Uh - huh , there were two men standing by the passenger side of this car .
It was yellow car .
It was parked in the alley , close to this building right here , facing north ; and they were standing by the driver 's door .
Q. Now , did you recognize the type of car ?
A . It was a Mercury .
Q. How do you know that ?
A . My husband and I used to drive a Mercury , about that same age and about that same color .
Q. What model , year model was your Mercury ?
A. ' 77 .
Q. What color was this Mercury ?
A . It was faded yellow .
Q. Okay .
Was it a four - door ?
A. Yes .
Photos of McVeigh 's car are at : [ www.okcitytrial.com/content/current/April/exb41 2.jpg ]
[ www.okcitytrial.com/content/current/April/exb41 3.jpg ]
[ www.okcitytrial.com/content/current/April/exb41 4.jpg ]
You will notice on the driver 's side of the car , there is huge discoloration and rust .
There is no mention of this in Mrs. Johnston 's testimony above because , unfortunately , she is standing on the passenger side of the car .
Did she happen to see the other side of the car before going on her way ?
The question was never asked , but it should have been by McVeighï¿½s defense attorneys .
The other critical statement during Mrs. Johnston 's testimony that must be considered is this :
She states that she approached this yellow ' 77 Mercury approximately 20 - 25 minutes after the bombing .
That would make it somewhere between 9:25 and 9:35 am in her words .
That is her testimony .
These are very , very important minutes .
Why ?
Because Trooper Hanger stated in his testimony that " we " pulled McVeigh over at approximately 10:20 am .
According to his log for that day , it says he called in the arrest at 10:22 am .
That would mean that McVeigh would have driven from the Murrah Building to the location of his arrest in 50 minutes or less .
As I said earlier , unless McVeigh was flying in his clunker , which no one observed , the time line does n't fit .
Come on , with all the horror and publicity surrounding his arrest , not one single person on that highway that day at around that time came forward to report seeing McVeigh 's car .
A whole lot of people saw the brown pick up with Middle Eastern looking men inside speed away from the building .
However , that solid lead was quickly dropped at the altar of political correctness .
How revolting .
According to the feds in McVeigh 's trial , he allegedly left the Ryder truck at 9:00 am , walked quickly away and 1 hr and 20 minutes later , he was pulled over .
That can be done if you drove straight as the crow flies , however , it doesnï¿½t square with Ms. Johnston 's sworn testimony .
Even if McVeigh walked straight to his get - away car , the Murrah Building was not located next to the freeway on - ramp .
Precious minutes would be eaten up getting to I - 35 north .
Trooper Hanger says McVeigh was not speeding when he approached him .
Now , let 's go back to Mrs. Johnston .
She says she spoke with McVeigh and another man at roughly 9:25 - 9:35 am .
She testified that as she approached them , they were just standing there on the driver 's side .
She briefly spoke with them and then moved on .
The question is how long did this McVeigh and the other unidentified man continue to stand there ?
Did they get in this yellow car and leave ?
Did the unidentified man leave then and then this McVeigh get in his car and take off ?
We do n't know .
One thing I do know :
If it was 9:25 - 9:35 am and McVeigh was standing around near the building , there simply is no way , without traveling at a high speed all the way , that McVeigh could have made it to marker 202-203 where Trooper Hanger stopped him at 10:20 am .
Also , what happened to the second man this McVeigh was with when Ms. Johnston spoke with them ?
It was n't Nichols .
McVeigh would have had to leave the minute Mrs. Johnston walked away , hurry to I- 35 , which would have drawn a lot of attention , some one fleeing instead of sticking around to help , and race up I - 35 to travel 75 miles in the 45 minutes left to him based on Mrs. Johnston 's testimony .
Could you drive 75 miles in 45 minutes ?
This means getting to the freeway through the massive mess and heading out at a very high speed .
The time line does n't work .
Mrs. Johnston was a victim .
It 's unlikely she would want to mislead anyone during her testimony to protect McVeigh .
This not only establishes very reasonable doubt , it also puts us once again with two McVeigh look - alikes .
In the June 1995 issue of Soldier of Fortune Magazine is a photo of three ATF agents taken in a court room during the Waco trials .
Two are identified ; the agent in the middle is not .
He is also a dead ringer for Timothy James McVeigh .

The former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once described Eric Hobsbawm as " my favourite Marxist " .
But now the Labour government is being challenged to explain to parliament why one of Britain 's most eminent leftwing historians has been barred from seeing a file kept on him by the Security Service , MI5 .
Hobsbawm is 91 and a Companion of Honour , an award given to only 45 Britons for outstanding achievements and whose motto is " In Action Faithful and in Honour Clear " .
He has been told by MI5 he is not entitled to see the file , for which he applied under the Data Protection Act .
Ministers face the potentially embarrassing task of having to explain to parliament why Hobsbawm , who joined the now defunct British Communist party in 1936 and is widely regarded as one of the world 's leading Marxist historians , is worthy of receiving such an exclusive distinction from the Queen but is not trusted to see his own security file .
" To the best of my knowledge I have never been involved in anything of security interest , " Hobsbawm said yesterday .
" I think the only reason can be that the security people do n't want to give away who snitched on me to the authorities . "
The Labour life peer Lord Lipsey tabled a question in the House of Lords last week asking ministers to lift the ban on Hobsbawm 's access to his files .
Lipsey told the Guardian yesterday there was no good reason for withholding the files from the historian .
" Professor Hobsbawm is arguably Britain 's most distinguished historian , " said Lipsey , who was a special adviser to Anthony Crosland and James Callaghan .
" In my years in government in the 1970s , I found the security services only too eager to collect information about Communists - by then a party which represented no threat to anyone - while they ignored Trotskyist sects who were a potential threat to national security , " he added .
" Perhaps they do not wish now to allow Professor Hobsbawm to see his file because to do so would expose their ineptitude . "
Hobsbawm is the author of 23 history books , including a highly regarded trilogy on the 19th century , as well as a successful 2002 autobiography .
He is a fellow of the British Academy and president of Birkbeck College , London .
Hobsbawm applied to the Security Service in June 2007 for access to his personal files under part II , section 7 of the Data Protection Act .
He eventually received a reply from MI5 which said : " We have conducted a search of Security Service records and have determined that the service does not possess any personal data to which you are entitled to have access under section 7 of the act .
You should not take this response to imply that the Security Service does or does not hold any personal data about you . "
Under data protection laws , MI5 and MI6 , the Secret Intelligence Service , are required to consider requests for access to files but can refuse for several reasons , including national security .
The Freedom of Information
Act does not apply to MI5 , but the service regularly releases files to the National Archives .
These have recently included files on dead Communists or one - time communist sympathisers of Hobsbawm 's generation who came under MI5 scrutiny .
Those whose files have been released in this way include the writers George Orwell , WH Auden , Olivia Manning , Arthur Ransome and Sylvia Townsend Warner , as well as the theatre director Joan Littlewood and the folk singer Ewan MacColl .
Hobsbawm is confident that there is also a file on him in the MI5 records .
As an undergraduate communist at Cambridge University before the second world war and a member of the Apostles secret society , Hobsbawm came into contact with several important players in the Cambridge spy ring .
" I knew Anthony Blunt [ the disgraced art historian and spy and so - called ' fourth man ' ] , " he said .
" I knew Guy Burgess [ the spy who defected to the USSR in 1951 ] .
I knew James Klugmann [ the British communist widely supposed to have been involved in recruiting the Cambridge spies ] .
I knew others .
But I had no dealings with their activities .
They can't say there is n't a file , " Hobsbawm said yesterday .
Security Service files already released to and about other Communists of that era have included references to him and letters by him , the historian said .
" Since I knew many people now dead whose files have been accessed , and some material by me or referring to me is therefore already available , I can see no reason why my own file should be withheld . "
Asked why he wanted to see what MI5 had collected on him , Hobsbawm said : " Getting to see the files might help me to correct any errors in my autobiography . "

For today 's How - To :
Radio - Shack de-soldering Iron ( $ 10 )
Small fish tank air pump ( $ 7 )
Six to eight feet of vinyl fish tank air hose ( $1 )
De-soldering braid or steel wool
Zip ties
Modify the de-soldering iron
Get airflow to the iron
Insert the tube
Hot stuff
Heat shrink tubing
Hot glue
Surface mount :
Conclusion
You 'll need :
The tip of the iron needs a little bit of work to efficiently heat the air flow .
We lightly pinched the tip of the tip with our vice .
Crushing the tip seemed to help direct the airflow , but we 're not calling it necessary .
Let us know what works best for you .
The next trick is to add some heat exchanging material to the tip of the iron .
Cut off a length of de-soldering braid or get a small bunch of steel wool .
The braid is copper , so it should conduct heat more efficiently .
Roll up the braid / wool and lightly stuff it into the tip of the iron .
Do n't push so hard that you restrict the air flow to much .
The material will slow down the air flow slightly , and help radiate the heat of the iron into the air .
Gently re-install the tip , it 's made of soft metal .
Since we do n't have any heat resistant tubing , we used the suction bulb as a bulky , but simple heat insulator .
Drill a hole in the end of the bulb with a 5/32 inch drill bit or something similar .
The hole needs to be round for a good seal .
Cutting the end of the vinyl tubing at a 45 degree angle will help a bit .
Wet the end of the tube lightly and push the end into the hole you drilled in the bulb .
Attach the other end of the tube to the outlet on the air pump .
To clean things up , secure the airhose to the iron and along the power line with the zip ties .
Later we replaced the zip tie on the handle with some stylish red electrical tape .
To use the gun effectively , allow the iron a sufficient warm up time without turning on the air pump .
Once it 's toasty , plug in the air pump and it 'll be ready to go .
In order to get a feel for the way the heat transfer works , we tried out our gun on a few workbench materials .
The tubing shrinks instantly with none of the burn marks we gotten with more primative methods .
If you 've ever used a soldering iron to slice through some stubborn hot glue , you 'll love this trick .
Hot glue is great , but sometimes it gets in the way .
The heated air liquifies the hot glue without burning it .
But what about actually soldering surface mount components ?
Our solder paste is on order , so we had to test it on a pre-assembled board .
It easily melts the solder joints on this chip .
Working with surface mount hardware has been a recurring challenge for us .
We hate to admit it , but we may have actually resorted to crushing certain SMD resistors to enable some features in our hardware .
Aside from the mad scientist look of our new tool , we can't wait to offer to mod someone 's console with , um , parts from the fish tank .
And that , friends , is reason enough to go through with this How - To .
Yes , they built one before over at gideontech .
Ours wo n't melt the hose ;
Nope , we did n't read yours first .

Kucinich to probe $ 3.6 billion in Merrill Lynch bonuses Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday March 30 , 2009
Print This Email This After TARP funds set , 696 employees got bonuses of $ 1 million or more
Even as Merrill Lynch & Co. bled money and warily eyed a merger with Bank of America , company executives were preparing for a windfall .
Following the federal government 's promise of $ 10 billion in TARP funds to buoy the ailing firm through it 's roll - up , Merrill paid out $ 3.6 billion in bonuses : a package 22 times larger than compensation given by AIG , said Congressman Dennis Kucinich 's offices in a Monday release .
The congressman 's staff sent letters to Ken Lewis , CEO of Bank of America , Ben Bernanke , Chairman of the Federal Reserve , and Neel Kashkari , Interim Assistant Director of Financial Stability , requesting documents related to communications on Merrill Lynch compensation packages .
Bank of America , which absorbed Merrill in 2008 , received an additional $ 25 billion from the government to facilitate the merger .
" [ T ]he Merrill Lynch Compensation Committee awarded these payments on December 8 , 2008 , before the end of the fourth quarter , in which Merrill lost more than $ 15 billion , and after Merrill was informed that it would be allocated $ 10 billion in TARP funds , " the congressman 's office said in an advisory .
" These payments raise significant questions about what information Merrill Lynch and Bank of America executives shared with federal officials that oversaw the Merrill acquisition by Bank of America .
Ordinary shareholders were unaware of the details of the bonus payments , but the U.S. government held 800,000 shares in preferred stock and warrants at the time and federal officials regularly met with both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch executives , " the release read .
North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper recently targeted the Merrill bonuses with an investigation .
" We 're going to do what we can to hold people accountable , " he told ABC Eyewitness 11 .
" New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has also been investigating executive bonuses at Bank of America and other companies , " noted WSOCTV .
" Cuomo managed to get executives at financially troubled insurance giant AIG to return some of the $ 165 million in bonuses that were handed out after the company accepted a federal bailout . "
" The bonuses were awarded despite the fact that Merrill lost $ 25 billion in 2008 and posted greater than anticipated fourth quarter after - tax losses of $ 5 billion dollars , " reported ABC News .
" Sources tell ABC News that a non-public agreement between Merrill and Bank of America was signed September 15th , 2008 .
The two companies initially agreed that Merrill Lynch could award up to $ 5.8 billion in performance bonuses , an amount that was later reduced to " under $ 4 billion " following a conversation between Thain and Bank of America 's Steele Alphin , the top aide and close confidant of the bank 's CEO , Ken Lewis , the sources said . "
" Cuomo found Merrill paid its four top bonus recipients $ 121 million and doled out bonuses of $ 1 million or more to 696 employees , as the firm lost $ 15 billion in the fourth quarter , " reported CNN .
" It is not clear how much each of the subpoenaed Merrill executives received in bonus payments . "
The full copy of Congressman Kucinich 's letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke follows .
####
Dear Mr. Bernanke :
As you know , Merrill Lynch & Co. ( " Merrill " ) paid out several billion dollars of bonuses in December 2008 , before their merger with Bank of America Corporation ( BOA ) was consummated but after Treasury allocated $ 10 billion in Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) funds to Merrill and after Treasurys initial injection of $ 15 billion in BOA .
In contrast to the bonuses awarded by AIG , the Merrill bonuses constituted a significant proportion of allocated TARP funds , were not locked into place by preexisting contract , and were performance , not retention , in nature .
They also raise significant questions about what you and other Federal Reserve officials involved in the merger of BOA and Merrill knew about the Merrill bonuses .
The Merrill bonuses were 22 times larger than those paid by AIG ( $ 3,620 million versus $ 165 million ) .
They were also very large relative to the TARP monies allocated to Merrill .
The Merrill bonuses were the equivalent of 36.2 % of TARP monies Treasury allocated to Merrill and awarded to BOA after their merger .
The bonuses , awarded mostly as cash , were made only to top management at Merrill .
To be eligible for the bonuses , Merrill employees had to have a salary of at least $ 300,000 and attained the title of Vice President or higher .
The Merrill bonuses were determined by Merrills Compensation Committee at its meeting of December 8 , 2008 , shortly after BOA shareholders approved the merger but before financial results for the Fourth Quarter had been determined .
This appears to be a departure from normal company practice , since the type of bonus Merrill awarded was a performance bonus that , according to company policy , was supposed to reflect all four quarters of performance and was paid in January or later .
In this case , however , the bonuses were awarded in December before Fourth Quarter performance had been determined .
Shortly after the award of the Merrill bonuses , Merrill / BOA determined that the losses for Fourth Quarter performance at Merrill were enormous .
By January , BOA would announce Fourth Quarter losses at Merrill in excess of $ 15 billion .
BOA had knowledge of and influence over Merrills intent to pay out bonuses even before BOA took control of Merrill .
According to the merger agreement of September 15 , 2008 , Merrills bonus awards were to be made in consultation with [ Bank of America ] . 
In an undisclosed attachment to the merger agreement , made public only recently by the Attorney General of New York State , Bank of America permitted Merrill the right to award up to $ 5.8 billion for calendar year 2008 performance ( See Merger Agreement Attachment , attached hereto ) .
While prior to the merger BOA knew of Merrills intent to award billions of dollars in performance bonuses before the Fourth Quarter earnings were calculated , BOA did not disclose the details it possessed about the Merrill bonuses and the unusualness of the timing of those bonuses to its shareholders prior to their vote on the merger .
This raises important questions about what you knew about the Merrill bonuses , and what you did with your knowledge .
If ordinary BOA shareholders were ignorant of the details of the Merrill bonus arrangement , was the U.S. government as well ?
At the time , the U.S. held 800,000 shares in preferred stock and warrants in BOA .
Unlike ordinary shareholders , you and then - Secretary Henry Paulson met on at least several occasions with Ken Lewis of BOA in late 2008 .
For instance , on December 17 , 2008 and again on December 19 , 2008 , BOA CEO Ken Lewis met with you to explore withdrawing from the deal to acquire Merrill .
However , you and Mr. Paulson reportedly impressed upon Mr. Lewis the importance of upholding his commitment to the deal .
Additionally , Treasury released in the following month another $ 20 billion in TARP funds to BOA and guaranteed $ 118 billion in troubled assets against loss .
In order to assist the Subcommittee with its investigation into what you knew about the Merrill bonuses , when you knew it , and what you did with your knowledge , I hereby request the following documents :
1 ) All documents and communications between employees of Bank of America and the Federal Reserve , and Merrill Lynch and the Federal Reserve , related in any way to Merrill 's compensation packages , bonuses , and / or Bank of Americas receipt of TARP monies , for the period from August 1 , 2008 through January 19 , 2009 .
The answers the Subcommittee seeks will be of interest to the American public , who are rightly concerned about how recipient firms have used TARP monies , and how well the Federal Government has monitored the use of those funds and safeguarded them from waste and abuse .
The Oversight and Government Reform Committee is the principal oversight committee in the House of Representatives and has broad oversight jurisdiction as set forth in House Rule X .
An attachment to this letter provides information on how to respond to the Subcommittees request .
Sincerely ,
Dennis J. Kucinich
Chairman
Domestic Policy Subcommittee

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Vice President Joe Biden continued the administration 's rollout of the recently passed economic stimulus package Friday , highlighting $ 1.3 billion in federal funding for Amtrak .
Vice President Joe Biden called Amtrak " an absolute national treasure and necessity . "
The money for the rail service , which carried almost 29 million passengers in the previous fiscal year , will go primarily to infrastructure repair and improvement .
The $ 787 billion stimulus plan includes a total of $ 8 billion for improvements in rail service , a crucial investment to help ease traffic in the congested northeast corridor running from Boston , Massachusetts to Washington , Biden argued .
It is " a necessity for a great nation to have a great [ rail ] passenger system , " Biden said .
" I 'm tired of apologizing for help for Amtrak .
...
It 's an absolute national treasure and necessity . "
The $ 1.3 billion will roughly double the size of Amtrak 's capital investment program over the next two years , according to the vice president 's office .
The largest single project funded by the stimulus money is the $ 105 million replacement of a movable bridge over Connecticut 's Niantic River .
The replacement of the 102 - year - old drawbridge has been delayed for more than 20 years because of a lack of capital , Biden noted .
Leading Republican critics of Amtrak argue that the money is a poor use of taxpayer dollars and that the often - struggling rail service should instead be stripped of public money in an effort to force changes that would make it more profitable .
Amtrak is " poorly run and poorly managed , " Sen .
Tom Coburn , R - Oklahoma , told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Tuesday .
" That does n't mean we should n't have a train service , but we [ should n't ] give additional money and reward incompetency and inefficiency .
If that 's what the stimulus is about , we 're in a whole lot worse trouble . "
Amtrak 's financial struggles are more a result of inadequate public support than managerial incompetence , responded Ross Capon , head of the National Association of Railroad Passengers .
" By and large , this organization has survived an incredible amount of low funding [ for ] years , " Capon said .
There is very little rail service in states like Oklahoma , " so it might not be surprising that one of Amtrak 's fiercest critics comes from a state that , relatively speaking , would not notice it if Amtrak disappeared tomorrow . "
Biden frequently commuted on Amtrak between Washington and his home near Wilmington , Delaware , during his more than three decades in the Senate .
In his remarks Friday , Biden argued that every modern passenger rail service in the world depends on subsidies .
He also claimed that U.S. highways and airports are actually subsidized more than the railway system .
" So let 's get something straight here .
Amtrak has not been at the trough .
Amtrak has been left out , " he said .
During the 2008 presidential campaign , President Obama pledged to support a national network of faster passenger trains .
He has proposed an additional five - year , $ 5 billion investment in high - speed rail as part of the administration 's suggested fiscal year 2010 budget .
Amtrak , according to its
Web site , was established by Congress in 1970 " to take over the passenger rail services previously required to be operated by private freight railroad companies in the United States . "
It functions today as a quasi-public entity that , while able to set its own rates and fares , is subject to strict governmental oversight .
An average of more than 78,000 passengers ride Amtrak each day , according the rail 's press office .

There is an arms race between censors and circumvention tools .
We 've developed a number of features to prepare for the next few steps in this race .
Some of these features involve the ability to use non-public relays and normalization of the Tor traffic to allow those in content denied environments the ability to continue to reach the information and communities they need .
Much more research and experimentation needs to occur in the next few years to further enhance these features .
As part of its dedication to transparency and openness , The Tor Project has published its three year development roadmap , focused on providing anti-censorship tools and services for the advancement of Internet freedom in closed societies .
While Tor 's original goal was to provide online anonymity , many people around the world use
Tor to get around Internet censorship , as well .
Human Rights Watch and Global Voices
Online have both recommended Tor as a tool to circumvent censorship regimes in oppressive nations .
The roadmap is focused on providing anti-censorship tools and services for the advancement of Internet freedom in closed societies .

Being on stage at Wheel of Fortune , the world 's most prestigious game show , is probably a lot of pressure .
All your friends back home are watching , and your hero Pat Sajak is staring down at you expectantly .
But sometimes , there 's just no excuse for what happens .
After the jump , what may be the three worst failures in the show 's history [ culled from a list at Pwn The Net ] .
Watch , weep , and umm ... sympathize ?
Or not .
WASHINGTON  The Federal Reserve Chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , told lawmakers on Tuesday that the country faces “ a prolonged episode of economic stagnation ” if they do not address the economic crisis forcefully , but he quickly encountered deep anger , particularly over the dealings of the ailing American International Group .
Mr. Bernanke told the Senate Budget Committee that the worst outlook , should action on the crisis prove inadequate , would be “ further deterioration in the fiscal situation ” and probably “ lower output , employment and incomes for an extended period . ”
But the chairman was met at once with sharp questions from the senators , some of whom said they were passing on the resentment they have been hearing from constituents , not necessarily about President Obama ’s proposed $ 3.55 trillion budget for the next fiscal year but about the rescue plan for the financial system and the stimulus package .
“ Mr. Chairman , ” Senator Ron Wyden , Democrat of Oregon , asked at the outset , “ at what point will the taxpayer no longer be on the hook for the massive A.I.G. failure ?
What is the end game for American taxpayers ? ”
major speed improvement : regex - tdfa reaches 1.0.0
Announcing the version 1.0.0 release of regex - tdfa .
I am proud of this release .
This is not just a bug fix release .
It is a serious improvement in the asymptotic running time .
The previous versions allowed bad combinations of pattern and searched text length to scale badly in the length of the text .
Previously the worst case for text of length N was O ( N^3 ) .
The new worst case asymptotic runtime scaled as O ( N ) .
There is never any backtracking .
And the worst case storage space is independent of N .
The package is on hackage at http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/regex-tdfa
The darcs repository is at http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/regex-unstable/regex-tdfa/
All non-overlapping matches are found and returned , along with all captured ( parenthesized ) subexpressions .
The result is precisely what Posix extended regular expressions are supposed to return .
To be concrete , consider example text with length of N of ( 2 ^ n ) +2 : > longInput = replicate ( 2^n ) ' a ' ++ " bc " And define 4 worst - case - scenario patterns .
I wrote the code and I know how to kill it : > wcs0 = " a * b " > wcs1 = " a* c " > wcs2 = " ( a|aa ) * b " > wcs3 = " ( a|aa ) * c " wcs0 is easy .
wcs1 causes the old code to backtrack .
wcs2 causes the old code 's storage to scale as O ( N ) .
wcs3 causes both backtracking and O ( N ) storage with the old code .
The old code 's time scales as O ( N ) for wcs0 , O ( N^2 ) for wcs1 and wcs2 , and O ( N^3 ) for wcs3 .
The new code is always O ( N ) .
The actual timings for the old code on my G4 laptop for wcs on 2^8 and 2^9 and 2^10 are : Reason : compare - tdfa chrisk$ time ./ Test - TDFA -np wcs3 8 +RTS - sstderr 2>&1 | head - 4 ./ Test - TDFA -np wcs3 8 +RTS - sstderr

The doubling of length is causing a nearly eight - fold time increase .
The heap allocation is also increasing nearly eight - fold .
The new code with the same input pattern and texts gives : Reason : compare - tdfa chrisk$ time ./ Test - TDFA2-0.99.19-np2 wcs3 8 +RTS - sstderr 2>&1 | head - 4 ./ Test - TDFA2-0.99.19-np2 wcs3 8 +RTS - sstderr

Note that the heap allocation for the 1026 character example above is 2466 times less than the old code .
That was too fast to prove the scaling , so take more input : Reason : compare - tdfa chrisk$ time ./ Test - TDFA2-0.99.19-np2 wcs3 20 +RTS - sstderr 2>&1 | head - 4 ./ Test - TDFA2-0.99.19-np2 wcs3 20 +RTS - sstderr

11,416,354,056 bytes allocated in the heap user 0m52.656s sys 0m1.985s
The length and time both doubled , as did the heap allocation .
And the new code has searched two million characters in the time the old code searched one thousand .
How about away from the worst case scenario ?
On the testing suite the new code is running slightly slower : Reason : compare - tdfa chrisk$ time ./ Test - TDFA-np -r 1 100 > / dev/null user 0m4.841s sys 0m3.019s Reason : compare - tdfa chrisk$ time ./ Test - TDFA2-0.99.19-np2 -r 1 100 > / dev/null user 0m5.970s sys 0m3.012s
So that is an increase of execution time of 14 % .
This small dip in performance might be reclaimable with more optimization .
I think the gain in worst case performance already offsets the slight cost .
The code for String is complete .
The strict and lazy bytestrings and the ( Seq Char ) are currently using the String code for matching .
This will be improved in a future release .
Cheers , Chris
The small print : regex - tdfa will still behave badly in space and time if given a pathological pattern , e.g. " ( ( ( a|aa ) { 0,100} ) {0,100} ) {0,100} " .
But , I am hopeful than I can improve regex - tdfa to behave well with the patterns like this one .
That is my vague goal for a future version 2.0.0 release .
The very small print : I have been using ghc - 6.10.1 , and I think I have carried over cabal switches to make ghc - 6.8.3 also work .
The library probably can work with ghc - 6.6 , but the cabal file will need editing first as well as fixes to " Text.Regex.TDFA.NewDFA.copySTU " .
The entertainment industry managed to convince the French government to draft a law that will make it possible to disconnect people from the Internet , if they receive more than two copyright infringement warnings .
Sadly , most of the politicians who plan to sign the law into action have no clue what they 're dealing with .
According to France ’s Minister of Culture , Christine Albanel , the effects of illegal file - sharing are disastrous .
She claims , based on statistics provided by the music industry , that piracy seriously hurts the economy and hinders cultural development .
The public has to be made aware of the harm they are causing , she argues .
In order to clamp down on piracy the French have proposed a new law that requires Internet service providers to cut off Internet access for persistent offenders .
Under the new law ISPs have to warn alleged copyright infringers , and if they they ignore these warnings their Internet access is terminated for up to a year .
The public has actively opposed the law , claiming it restricts their freedom and privacy , while deeming the measure to be ineffective .
In a recent poll 90 % of the people spoke out against the legislation .
Despite this protest , the law is backed by a majority in the French parliament and is expected to be adopted quite easily in the beginning of April .
However , do the politicians that will vote on the law have any clue what they are dealing with ?
Are they aware that the evidence gathering against alleged infringers is far from accurate , and that it ’s not unusual for the wrong person to be accused ?
Or do they even know what BitTorrent is ?
In order to test their knowledge on the subject , a reporter from Hebdo Cinéma questioned some of the politicians .
They were asked what they thought was a bigger threat – BitTorrent or P2P .
The results were quite revealing , and almost none of them could come up with the right answer .
Most politicians have simply no idea what they are talking about , with Herve Mariton commenting “ It is beyond my skills , I admit . ”
Arnaud Montebourg used his trip to Washington as an excuse for not answering the complex question .
“ Give me a minute , because I am not aware of the details of the last amendments , ” he added .
Patrick Ollier on the other hand , did n’t even understand what was said and asked the reporter to repeat the question in French .
Maxime Gremetz ’ response was n’t any better , “ I do n’t know , I am not a technician , ” he told the journalist .
Interestingly , Georges Tron said that P2P was more of a threat than BitTorrent , although his explanation for it was utterly vague .
Claude Bartolone was the only one who made sense really .
“ From a technological point of view , I think the consequences would be the same , ” he said , adding “ From a consumer point of view it ’s always more pleasant to listen to whatever you want whenever you want . ”
The lack of knowledge demonstrated by these lawmakers signals a major problem .
They are clueless about file - sharing technology and how it works , and oblivious to the potential negative consequences of the new law .
Their main advisers are fed dubious and one - sided information from the entertainment industry , while the people on the streets seem to be ignored .
Sad but true .
Writers , pop stars , lawyers and politicians from across the party spectrum yesterday issued a call to arms .
They joined the largest ever campaign across Britain to warn of the erosion of freedoms and the emergence of surveillance techniques
The government and the courts are collaborating in slicing away freedoms and pushing Britain to the brink of becoming a " database " police state , a series of sold - out conferences in eight British cities heard yesterday .
In a day of speeches and discussions , academics , politicians , lawyers , writers , journalists and pop stars joined civil liberty campaigners yesterday to issue a call to arms for Britons to defend their democratic rights .
More than 1,500 people , paying £ 35 a ticket , attended the Convention on Modern Liberty in Bloomsbury , central London , which was linked by video to parallel events in Glasgow , Birmingham , Belfast , Bristol , Manchester , Cardiff and Cambridge .
They heard from more than 80 speakers , including author Philip Pullman ; musicians Brian Eno and Feargal Sharkey ; journalists Fatima Bhutto , Andrew Gilligan , Nick Cohen and Guardian editor - in - chief Alan Rusbridger ; politicians Lord Bingham and Dominic Grieve ; a former director of public prosecutions , Ken Macdonald ; and human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy .
In her speech Kennedy said she felt that fear was being used as a weapon to break down civil liberties .
" There is a general feeling that in creating a climate of fear people have been writing a blank cheque to government .
People feel the fear of terrorism is being used to take away a lot of rights . "
She said that voters were anxious that their communities were ' being alienated ' by the use of powers designed to protect national security being applied outside their original remit , and that there was now an open window of opportunity for the electorate to make their feelings known to government before the next election : " People are fearful of the general business of collecting too much information about individuals . "
High on the concerns of the convention were the recent allegations against the British security services by Guantanamo Bay torture victim Binyam Mohamed , plans for ID cards , DNA collection databases and controversial surveillance powers being used by civil servants .
In addition , concerns were high over Government plans to create a database of all the communciations and movements of ordinary people as well as the profileration of anti-terrorism laws including detention of suspects .
The Conservative MP David Davis , who resigned from the shadow cabinet in order to fight a byelection on a civil liberties platform , gave the final keynote speech of the day .
He told the Observer that he believed the danger of a police state was a very real one and that justice secretary Jack Straw was leading a " piecemeal and casual erosion " of freedom in this country .
" There has been a tide of government actions which have put expediency over justice time and time again .
The British people wear their liberty like an old comfy suit , they are careless about it , but the mood is changing .
Last year 80 per cent of people were in favour of ID cards , now 80 per cent are against .
There 's a point of reflection that we are reaching , the communications database which is planned to collect every private text and phone call and petrol station receipt will create uproar . "
That people had paid £ 35 a ticket to attend such an event was a real sign that people were waking up and getting irritated by the threat , he said .
" We are getting on the way to becoming a police state and the surest thing I do know is that by the time we are sure we are , then it will be too late . "
Britain 's judiciary came under fire from many speakers .
The courts were accused of helping quash free speech by a panel of leading journalists who agreed that libel law was being manipulated by " dodgy characters " from all over the world who sought legal redress against valid investigative journalism in UK courts .
" Most of this is hidden from public view , " said Alan Rusbridger who complained that British lawyers fees were 140 times as expensive as in the rest of Europe , creating impossible dilemas for journalists on newspapers already suffering from dropping sales and advertising revenues .
London Evening Standard journalist Andrew Gilligan said the planned database would bring an end to privacy and with it " an end of journalism " .
He pointed out that in the whole case around the illegal shooting to death by police of Brazilian student Jean Charles de Menezes , the only arrest was that of a journalist who revealed that police statements of the event were untrue .
The Observer and Vanity Fair writer Henry Porter , who co-organised the conference , said he felt tremendously moved by the support shown by everyone who had attended the event or agreed to speak .
" I had been feeling like the lone lunatic wandering around Oxford Street with a placard and it's tremendously moving for me to see how many people share my concerns .
The number of tickets , I 'm told , could have been sold two or three times over .
That has to show people really are thinking about these frightening issues quite seriously . "
The Convention on Modern Liberty , sponsored by the Rowntree Trusts , openDemocracy , Liberty , NO2ID and the Guardian , was launched as an umbrella campaign last month under the statement of purpose : " A call to all concerned with attacks on our fundamental rights and freedoms under pressure from counter - terrorism , financial breakdown and the database state . "
Yesterday 's gathering was by far the largest civil liberties convention ever held in Britain and it was held a day after a leading UN human rights investigator attacked Britain for " undermining " the rights of its citizens .
In an advance copy of a report to the UN Human Rights Council , Martin Scheinin said so - called ' data mining ' blurred the boundary between the targeted observation of suspects and mass surveillance .
Scheinin , the UN 's independent investigator on human rights in the fight against terrorism , also questioned the use of spy software that analyses people 's internet postings to create profiles of terrorists .
The notion that the poor always will be with us has been ingrained in our culture ever since the sermons of Moses were set down by the anonymous author of Deuteronomy .
The financial crisis of the present day raises a rather different issue , however :
What should we do about the rich ?
That the point is even open for discussion suggests that a sea change is taking place on the American political scene .
For decades , the wealthy have been held up as people to be admired , victors in the Darwinian economic struggle by virtue of their personal ingenuity and hard work .
Americans consistently supported fiscal policies that undermined middle - and working - class interests partially because they saw themselves as rich - people - in - waiting : Given time , toil and the magic of compound interest , anyone could retire a millionaire .
Advertisement
That mind - set has all but been eradicated by the damage sustained by the average worker ’s nest egg , combined with the spectacle of bankers and financial engineers maintaining their lifestyles with multimillion - dollar bonuses while the submerged 99 % struggle for oxygen .
( The price of admission to the top 1 % income - earning club last year was roughly $ 400,000 . )
That may account for the near - total absence of public outcry over President Obama ’s proposal to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans -- except of course from the wealthiest Americans .
One factor fueling the public fury over the AIG bonuses , so inescapably in the news this week , is the recognition that so many huge fortunes landed in the hands of the undeserving rich .
Some of them added little value to the economy but merely moved money around in novel , excessively clever and ultimately destructive ways ; others are corporate executives who were ridiculously overpaid whether they succeeded or failed at their jobs .
It wo n’t be long now , moreover , before Americans again wise up to the role of dumb luck in building wealth .
By my count , roughly one - quarter of the names on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans got there by inheritance ( and by no means have all of them enhanced the family fortune with their own toil or brainpower ) .
A few years ago , it was common to think of the rich as a special breed .
We may soon come around to George Orwell ’s view that the only difference between rich and poor is income -- “ The average millionaire , ” as he put it , “ is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit . ”

The shift in sentiment should surprise no one .
As the management sage Peter Drucker once predicted , “ In the next economic downturn there will be an outbreak of bitterness and contempt for the super - corporate chieftains who pay themselves millions .
In every major economic downturn in U.S. history the ‘ villains ’ have been the ‘ heroes ’ during the preceding boom . ”
Drucker was speaking in 1997 , two downturns ago .
This brings us to a couple of questions certain to become more pressing as we stagger through the fiscal and economic hangover from the Roaring Oughty - Oughts :
How much does our economy depend on the rich , anyway , and why should n’t we soak them good ?
A bit of history will be useful here .
The original case for a progressive income tax -- that is , one levied disproportionately on larger incomes -- was based less on raising revenue for the state than breaking up concentrations of wealth , inherited and otherwise .
The nation ’s Founding Fathers considered these to be undemocratic -- markers of “ an aristocratic society , not a free and virtuous republic , ” as the tax - law expert Dennis Ventry has written .
Recent events validate the Founders ’ instincts .
The craze for financial deregulation in Washington was fomented in part by Wall Street plutocrats brandishing lavish political donations , gifts , offers of employment and other trappings of economic power .
Would Wall Street have gotten so far out of control if it had had less power to wield ?
No one can know for sure , but it ’s a question worth pondering .

There ’s also a social value in suppressing income inequality .
In a country with only a slightly less ingrained tradition of civility than the United States , the AIG affair would provoke rioting in the streets .
“ We live in a country with tranquillity and good feelings toward each other , and that ’s precious , ” says Robert Shiller , a Yale University economist and coauthor of “ Animal Spirits , ” a new book about the psychology of economics .
In the current crisis , “ there ’s anger and a sense of injustice taking hold , and it ’s not in the interest of wealthy people -- you do n’t want people on the poor side of town to be angry with you . ”
By the way , maintaining the civic institutions , police forces and public infrastructure that enable great fortunes to be made and kept costs money .
Wealthy taxpayers should keep that in mind the next time they ’re inclined to bellyache about not getting anything from government .
As a rationale for progressive taxation , the concept of regulation and redistribution eventually yielded to the quest for revenue .
Taxing large incomes was justified because that ’s where the money is , and , secondarily , a rich person suffers less in giving up a dollar than does a poor one .

The inflection point was the Roosevelt administration .
FDR kept talking about the justice of chipping away at “ great accumulations of wealth , ” but he also needed the money .
The overall average tax bite on the richest Americans reached its high - water mark of nearly 59 % during World War II .
After that , even though marginal rates ( the amounts charged on the last dollars ) remained as high as 91 % , the average tax bite on the rich fell to as little as 25 % in the early ‘ 60s , largely the result of their skill in exploiting loopholes .
Starting with Ronald Reagan , federal income tax policy came to focus mostly on finding the rate that could produce the most revenue while provoking the minimum squawking from the wealthy chickens being plucked .
Those squawks sometimes take the form of a claim that too much taxation saps the economic value of the wealthy -- their capacity to invest , to create jobs , etc .
It ’s proper to note that years of study have unearthed no consistent evidence that taxation causes the rich to alter their investing behavior much , at least not until their tax burden reaches a point vastly higher than what Obama contemplates .
“ The real rich -- the top 1 % -- work very hard for reasons other than money , ” Reuven S. Avi-Yonah , a tax historian at the University of Michigan , told me this week .
The quest for prestige , political power and self - esteem , the ability to control things and people , are all factors in their behavior .
Advertisement
Thanks to the financial crisis , those goals are regarded with increasing hostility by the political establishment .
Certainly the claim of the rich to play an indispensable role in the American economy will be treated with more skepticism than in the recent past , and their ability to preserve their loopholes and other advantages in the tax code will diminish .
Will the economy suffer as a result ?
The experiment is about to begin .

No .
Not really .
At least not in the sense that is usually argued .
China has no need to sell foreign assets like Treasuries to finance its domestic fiscal stimulus so long as it is running a large external surplus .
But China could use a large buyer for some of its Agencies .
Now it has one .
Though here the Fed is n’t so much bailing China out as substituting for the falloff in Chinese and other central band demand .
And I would be curious to know if China is worried by the latest bout of dollar weakness or relieved that a weaker dollar is pulling the RMB back down .
China ’s biggest financial exposure is n’t to the equity market , it is to the dollar .
It thus benefits financially from dollar strength .
But a strong dollar also does n’t exactly help China ’s exporters .
And exporters have long driven China ’s policy choices .
Let ’s start with the first point .
Does China -- as Felix ’s correspondent implies -- need to sell Treasuries to finance its fiscal stimulus ?
The simple answer is no , it does n’t .
Foreign exchange reserves can finance a current account deficit or a capital outflow .
Foreign assets are n’t needed to finance a fiscal stimulus .
The US is a case in point ; it has financed a large fiscal deficit by selling dollar - denominated bonds -- not by selling off its reserves .
China would only need to draw on its foreign exchange reserves to cover its fiscal deficit if its fiscal deficit led to a trade and current account deficit .
And China no need to worry there .
It is n’t Russia -- a country that looks set to run both a fiscal and a current account deficit this year , and thus will need to draw on its reserves to meet the balance of payments needs associated with its fiscal deficit .*
Do n’t take my word .
Read the World Bank ’s latest China Quarterly .
Thanks to David Dollar , Louis Kuijs and the rest of the staff of the Beijing office , it remains the best single source for analysis of macroeconomic trends in China .
The World Bank forecasts that China ’s fiscal deficit will expand by about 2.8 percentage points in 2009 , with the fiscal deficit rising from 0.4 % of China ’s GDP to 3.2 % of GDP ( table 4 )
The World Bank also forecasts that China will run a $ 425 billion current account surplus in 2008 .
That means Chinese investors -- whether private investors or the central bank -- will be net buyers of the world ’s financial assets , not net sellers .
China , like the Fed , will be buying Treasuries .
How can the fiscal balance deteriorate by 2.8 % of GDP while the current account deficit deteriorates by only -- according to the World Bank ’s forecasts -- 0.8 % of GDP ?
Should n’t the fiscal deficit suck up some of the funds that China would otherwise lend to the world ?
There is an easy answer here too : the rise in the fiscal deficit will offset a sharp fall in private investment , a fall that otherwise would have pushed the current account surplus up .
But are n’t China ’s reserves falling because of China ’s new spending plans ?
It is certainly rumored that China ’s reserves fell by $ 30 billion in January .
But the euro fell sharply against the dollar in January ( after rising in December ) .
Currency moves alone likely subtracted $ 40 - 50 billion from China ’s reserves .
If China ’s reserves only fell by $ 30 billion , China was still buying foreign exchange in the market to keep its currency from rising .
Consequently , it is more accurate to say that China ’s reserves are still growing , just at a much slower pace than before .
More importantly , the currency slowdown in reserve growth is n’t due to a spending spree that brought China ’s current account surplus down .
Not at all .
Real imports -- according to the World Bank ( see Table 1 ) -- fell by more than real exports in November , December and January .
February will prove to be a bit different , but it is a month that is heavily shaped by seasonal factors .
Nonetheless , China ’s q1 current account surplus is on track to exceed its current account surplus in q1 2009 , even with China ’s fiscal stimulus .
On a rolling 12 m basis , China ’s trade surplus is at or near a record high , even including the February data .
That may change if the global slump -- now a quite severe global slump -- continues to cut into China ’s export and the stimulus reverses the slide in China ’s ( real ) imports .
But for now , China ’s surplus is getting bigger not smaller .
So why has reserve growth slowed ?
Simple : private capital is leaving China .
And that has nothing to do with the fiscal stimulus .
It is tied to the dollar ’s rise -- and expectations that China might allow its currency to slide against the dollar to help its export sector .
For the year , the World Bank forecasts that China ’s $ 425 billion current account surplus will lead to $ 425 billion in reserve growth , as " hot " outflows subside .
That means that China will still be buying foreign assets , and unless something changes , it will still be buying Treasuries .
Perhaps not quite at the same rate as before .
But there is a difference between not buying as much and selling .
So what has China been selling ?
Simple : Agencies .
That is n’t because China needs the money to finance its fiscal deficit , or ( more realistically ) to finance large capital outflows .
It is simply because China seems to have lost confidence in the implicit guarantee that backs the Agency market .
What is the Fed buying : Agencies .
That helps China .
If SAFE wants to lighten up its Agency portfolio -- and it has a lot of Agency MBS -- it can now sell to the Fed .
That facilitates its exit from its large position in the Agency market .
I suspect that China alone accounts for about half of all central bank Agency holdings -- it is a huge player .
The Fed , in effect , is making it easier for China to sell long - term Agency bonds and shift into short - term Treasury bills -- or whatever other asset China wants to buy .
That help though is n’t free .
The Fed ’s move has pushed the dollar down v the euro .
And helped push oil up .
Neither helps China financially .
If China wants to shift from say Agencies to bunds , it is now easier for it to trade its Agencies for dollars , but each dollar buys fewer euros .
The dollar ’s share of China ’s reserve portfolio exceeds the United States ’ share of China ’s imports .
The more the dollar falls over time , the fewer of the world ’s goods China can buy with all the dollars it has salted away .
And the more the dollar falls , the more likely that the RMB will eventually resume its rise against the dollar .
That also does n’t help China financially .
China ’s government has borrowed in RMB to buy dollars and to a lesser degree euros , effectively opting to hold more reserves than it needs to support its export sector .
The ultimate cost of that policy hinges on the dollar ’s ultimate fall v the RMB .
SAFE thus should want a strong dollar , as it is fundamentally long dollars .
Relative to other reserve currencies .
And relative to China ’s own currency .
Then again China ’s policy of building up far more reserves than it needs never made much financial sense .
China was n’t all that happy with a strong dollar , even if that was in its financial interest .
The RMB has appreciated far more in real terms over the last nine months -- when it has been tightly pegged to the dollar -- than it ever did back when the RMB was appreciating against a depreciating dollar .
My guess is that Europe is far more worried by the dollar ’s recent slide than China .
China -- or least its exporters -- were n’t happy with the RMB ’s recent strength .
The Fed thus , in some sense , bailed out China ’s exporters far more than it bailed out China ’s reserve managers .
Actually , it makes more sense to think of the Fed as substituting for China in the market for Agencies -- and other central banks -- than to think of the Fed as bailing out China and other central banks .
The end of the foreign central bank bid , as global reserve growth slowed and central banks shifte dto Treasuries -- has had a big impact on the Agency market .
That was n’t helping the US housing market .
Nor is the Fed just stepping in to buy the Agency bonds central banks now want to sell .
It is also trying to substitute for the collapse in private financial intermediation here in the US .
Private banks have gone from lending huge sums for almost nothing to not lending even when spreads are much higher for the same risk .
Put it this way : foreign central banks never bought anything close to a trillion dollars of Treasuries and Agencies in a single year .
A half trillion or so of annual purchases was more than enough to have an impact ..
* Russia is effectively using its reserves to make up for the fall in the government ’s export revenues .
Absent a buffer of reserves , that short - fall would have required that Russia reduce both government spending and its import bill .

Advertisement The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir for alleged war crimes in Darfur .
The Sudanese government has always said the accusations are political but now one of the country 's former soldiers , who served in Darfur , has been telling his story to the BBC's Mike Thomson .
Khalid ( not his real name ) , a polite and softly spoken man from Darfur , seems reluctant to talk about his past .
It is soon clear why .
" The orders given to us were to burn the villages completely , " he says .
" We even had to poison the water wells .
We were also given orders to kill all the woman and rape girls under 13 and 14 . "
Khalid , who is of black African origin , says he was forcibly recruited into President Omar al - Bashir 's Sudanese army in late 2002 .
Many could n't take all their children .
If you saw them you had to shoot and kill
" Khalid "
He and several other men where he lived were taken to the headquarters of his regiment which was based near the north - western Darfur town of Fasher .
He admits to having taken part in seven different attacks on Darfur villages with the help of Janjaweed militia .
The first one was in the Korma area in December 2002 several months before the conflict in Darfur officially began .
He claims to have been extremely reluctant to carry out the savage orders he was given .
" When they asked me to rape the girl , I went and stood in front of her , " he said .
" Tears came into my eyes .
They said : ' You have to rape her .
If you do n't we will beat you . '
I hesitated and they hit me with the butt of a rifle .
" But when I went to the girl I could n't do it .
I took her into a corner and lay myself on top of her as if I was raping her for about 10 to 15 minutes .
The six - year conflict has spawned more than two million refugees " Then , I jumped up and came out .
They said : ' Did you rape her ? '
I said : ' Yes , I did ' . "
Khalid says that soon after this he and the other soldiers went back to base .
When they got there he was told to join another patrol immediately .
When he refused they beat and tortured him , inflicting severe burns on his legs and back .
He spent five weeks in a military hospital recovering from his injuries .
Before long , he said , he was ordered to join other brutal raids on Darfur villages .
I asked him what he was told to do with unarmed civilians who did not resist in any way .
" They told us , do n't leave anybody , just kill everybody , " he said .
" Even the children , if left behind in the huts , we had to kill them , " he said .
" People would cry and run from their huts .
" Many could n't take all their children .
If they had more than two they had to leave them behind .
If you saw them you had to shoot and kill . "
In cold blood Khalid insists that he always fired over the heads of civilians and did n't kill anyone himself despite the orders he was given .
He says he could do this without his fellow soldiers noticing but he admits that there was no way he could avoid carrying out orders to torch peoples homes .
The war in Darfur began in 2003 when rebel groups took up arms " I did take part , " he admitted .
" They forced me .
We had no choice .
If you did n't they would kill you . "
Did anyone refuse ?
" Two of my colleagues refused and they were shot dead . "
I asked him how the Sudanese officers had justified killing unarmed civilians in cold blood .
How they had explained the need to slaughter women , babies and children ?
He replied : " They said they are the ones who take food and water to the rebels .
" They said that if we kill these people and burn their villages then the rebels will not have any supplies so they 'll have to move out to the neighbouring country . "
Close to tears Khalid , who at times appeared close to tears , deserted from the army in 2003 and has now left the country .
He says he may never be able to return now that he has spoken out .
But , I asked him , if he does go back , will he ever be forgiven by his own people for taking part in these attacks , even if he was forcibly recruited ?
Luis Moreno - Ocampo prepared the charge sheet " Up until today they will never have known that it was me , " he said .
" They will only know that I became a soldier .
They would n't know what part I took .
Even my family do n't know where I am . "
Over the last six years it is estimated that around 300,000 people have died as a result of the conflict in Darfur and a further 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes .
President Omar al - Bashir and the Sudanese government have always denied that the country 's army committed atrocities in the region or commissioned Janjaweed militia to do this on their behalf .
It is a claim they repeated firmly when the International Criminal Court 's chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo announced last summer he was seeking an arrest warrant for the Sudanese president .
But a nervous Khalid , who fears officials from the court might soon come looking for him , says he is in no doubt who bears full responsibility for the suffering in Darfur .
" Omar al - Bashir is in the chair , " he said .
" He is the first person that is responsible for the genocide , of the killing of the children , of everything .
He should never say that ' I did not kill and I do n't know ' .
" If you are head of the country then you are responsible for any crimes done by your soldiers .
It is Bashir doing all these things . "

David Heinemeier Hansson :
The past month has seen a flurry of activity getting Rails 2.3 solid .
We think we ’ve ironed out all the major kinks now , but just to be sure , we ’re running one last release candidate before it heads off to the presses .
This release candidate looks much better than the last one .
The Agile Web Development with Rails book has always been chock full of executable and tested code .
With this edition , I ’ve taken this one half - step further .
I have a script and data that will run the majority of the executable examples from them book and capture the output : compare 2.2 vs 2.3RC2 .
If there is a next edition and if I ’m part of it , I plan to take this to the next level and have the output be self - checking and hopefully a part of the Rails team ’s regression test suite .
As with every release , there are changes to the generators which affect this book .
For example , Rails 2.2 will generate controllers with lines like these :
@users = User.find(: all )
And the book contains the suggestion that that particular line be modified to look like the following :
@users = User.find ( : all , :order => : name )
Now consider what happens when a user who tries out Rails 2.3 and sees the following instead :
@users = User.all
I suspect that many will follow the instructions , and assume that what the book is trying to tell them is that .all must be converted into a . find if you wish to order the results .
This simply is n’t true , as the following works just fine with Rails 2.3 :
@users = User.all ( : order => : name )

Advocates of Islamic finance say it copes better with crisis
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called on Islamic banks to take a leadership role in the global economy , amid the financial crisis .
He was speaking at the opening of the World Islamic Economic Forum in the Indonesian capital , Jakarta .
The forum has brought together political and business leaders from 38 countries to discuss the global economic slowdown .
They will also discuss ways to achieve energy and food security .
Mr Yudhoyono said it was time for Islamic banks to do some missionary work in the West .
Islamic financial institutions , he said , had not been hit as hard as their western counterparts because they did not invest in toxic assets .
Banks run in accordance with Muslims laws on interest payments and the sharing of credit risks are seen by many as fairer than traditional banks , less focused on profit and kinder to the communities they work in .
Demand for Islamic financial products has been growing in the Muslim world for years but Mr Yudhoyono said that many in the West were now ready to learn from them .
Islamic law prohibits the payment and collection of interest .
Transactions must be backed by real assets , and because risk is shared between the bank and the depositor , there is added incentive for the institutions to ensure deals are sound .
BARACK OBAMA must savor the moment while he can .
It may never get better than this .
As he stood before Congress on Tuesday night , the new president was armed with new job approval percentages in the 60s .
After his speech , the numbers hit the stratosphere : CBS News found that support for his economic plans spiked from 63 percent to 80 .
Had more viewers hung on for the Republican response from Bobby Jindal , the unintentionally farcical governor of Louisiana , Obama might have aced a near - perfect score .
His address was riveting because it delivered on the vision he had promised a battered populace during the campaign : Government must step in boldly when free markets run amok and when national crises fester unaddressed for decades .
For all the echoes of F.D.R. ’s first fireside chat , he also evoked his own memorably adult speech on race .
Once again he walked us through a lucid step - by - step mini-lecture on “ how we arrived ” at an impasse that ’s threatening America ’s ability to move forward .
Obama ’s race speech may have saved his campaign .
His first Congressional address wo n’t rescue the economy .
But it brings him to a significant early crossroads in his presidency  one full of perils as well as great opportunities .
To get the full political picture , look beyond Obama ’s popularity in last week ’s polls to the two groups of Americans whose approval numbers are in the toilet .
There is good news for Obama in these findings , but there ’s also a stark indication of the unchecked populist rage that could still overrun his ambitious plans .
The first group in national disfavor is the G.O.P .
In the latest New York Times / CBS News survey , 63 percent said that Congressional Republicans opposed the stimulus package mostly for political reasons ; only 17 percent felt that the Republicans should stick with their own policies rather than cooperate with Obama and the Democrats .
The second group of national villains is corporate recipients of taxpayer money : only 39 percent approve of a further bailout for banks , and only 22 percent want more money going to Detroit ’s Big Three .

The flood fighters in the Red River have added a high - tech weapon to their arsenal this year .
A Predator unmanned drone aircraft , on loan from the Department of Homeland Security , is being used to survey the valley for the first time and give officials a quicker assessment than ever before of the flood ’s effects on the ground .
[ efoods ]
” We think it will help the emergency management folks pinpoint the areas they have to pay the most attention to , ” said Juan Munoz - Torres , a spokesman for the department .
An initial aerial survey of the valley was flown last weekend from south of Fargo to the Canadian border — before the flood caused any substantial damage .
A second flight will be launched as soon as this weekend .
High - definition videos shot from both Predator flights will be then compared , immediately showing the physical differences wreaked by the flood .
Predators were used last summer along the Gulf Coast to assess damages sustained during the hurricane season , Munoz - Torres said .

The week before last , twenty - five hundred delegates , from more than seventy countries , met in Copenhagen to prepare for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which will take place there in December and will produce a successor to the Kyoto Protocol , which was adopted in 1992 and will expire in 2012 .
The speakers in Copenhagen were united by a sense of urgency — and for good reason , given the poor record of most participating countries in meeting their Kyoto targets for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
So far , the most effective way for a Kyoto signatory to cut its carbon output has been to suffer a well - timed industrial implosion , as Russia did after the collapse of the Soviet Union , in 1991 .
The Kyoto benchmark year is 1990 , when the smokestacks of the Soviet military - industrial complex were still blackening the skies , so when Vladimir Putin ratified the protocol , in 2004 , Russia was already certain to meet its goal for 2012 .
The countries with the best emissions - reduction records — Ukraine , Latvia , Estonia , Lithuania , Bulgaria , Romania , Hungary , Slovakia , Poland , and the Czech Republic — were all parts of the Soviet empire and therefore look good for the same reason .
The United States did n’t ratify the Kyoto Protocol , but Canada did , and its experience is suggestive because its economy and per-capita oil consumption are similar to ours .
Its Kyoto target is a six - per-cent reduction from 1990 levels .
By 2006 , however , despite the expenditure of billions of dollars on climate initiatives , its greenhouse - gas output had increased to a hundred and twenty - two per cent of the goal , and the environment minister described the Kyoto target as “ impossible . ”
The explanation for Canada ’s difficulties is n’t complicated : the world ’s principal source of man-made greenhouse gases has always been prosperity .
The recession makes that relationship easy to see : shuttered factories do n’t spew carbon dioxide ; the unemployed drive fewer miles and turn down their furnaces , air - conditioners , and swimming - pool heaters ; struggling corporations and families cut back on air travel ; even affluent people buy less throwaway junk .
Gasoline consumption in the United States fell almost six per cent in 2008 .
That was the result not of a sudden greening of the American consciousness but of the rapid rise in the price of oil during the first half of the year , followed by the full efflorescence of the current economic mess .
“ In my day , there was no reward for incompetence . ”

The world ’s financial and energy crises are connected , and they are similar because credit and fossil fuels are forms of leverage : oil , coal , and natural gas are multipliers of labor in much the same way that credit is a multiplier of wealth .
Human history is the history of our ascent up what the naturalist Loren Eiseley called “ the heat ladder ” : coal bested firewood as an amplifier of productivity , and oil and natural gas bested coal .
Fossil fuels have enabled us to leverage the strength of our bodies , and we are borrowing against the world ’s dwindling store of inexpensive energy in the same way that we borrowed against the illusory equity in our homes .
Moreover , American dependence on fossil fuels is n’t going to end any time soon : solar panels and wind turbines provided only about a half per cent of total U.S. energy consumption in 2007 , and they do n’t work when the sun is n’t shining or the wind is n’t blowing .
Replacing oil is going to require more than determination .
The environmental benefits of economic decline , though real , are fragile , because they are vulnerable to intervention by governments , which , understandably , want to put people back to work and get them buying non-necessities again — through programs intended to revive ordinary consumer spending ( which has a big carbon footprint ) , and through public - investment projects to build new roads and airports ( ditto ) .
Our best intentions regarding conservation and carbon reduction inevitably run up against the realities of foreclosure and bankruptcy and unemployment .
How do we persuade people to drive less — an environmental necessity — while also encouraging them to revive our staggering economy by buying new cars ?
The popular answer — switch to hybrids — leaves the fundamental problem unaddressed .
Increasing the fuel efficiency of a car is mathematically indistinguishable from lowering the price of its fuel ; it ’s just fiddling with the other side of the equation .
If doubling the cost of gas gives drivers an environmentally valuable incentive to drive less — the recent oil - price spike pushed down consumption and vehicle miles travelled , stimulated investment in renewable energy , increased public transit ridership , and killed the Hummer — then doubling the efficiency of cars makes that incentive disappear .
Getting more miles to the gallon is of no benefit to the environment if it leads to an increase in driving — and the response of drivers to decreases in the cost of driving is to drive more .
Increases in fuel efficiency could be bad for the environment unless they ’re accompanied by powerful disincentives that force drivers to find alternatives to hundred - mile commutes .
And a national carbon policy , if it ’s to have a real impact , will almost certainly need to bring American fuel prices back to at least where they were at their peak in the summer of 2008 .
Electric cars are not the panacea they are sometimes claimed to be , not only because the electricity they run on has to be generated somewhere but also because making driving less expensive does nothing to discourage people from sprawling across the face of the planet , promoting forms of development that are inherently and catastrophically wasteful .
One beneficial consequence of the ongoing global economic crisis is that it has put a little time back on the carbon clock .
Because the climate damage done by greenhouse gases is cumulative , the emissions decrease attributable to the recession has given the world a bit more room to devise a plan that might actually work .
The prospects for a meaningful worldwide climate agreement probably improved last November , with the election of Barack Obama , but his commitments to economic recovery and carbon reduction — to bringing the country out of recession while also reducing U.S. greenhouse emissions to seventeen per cent of their 2005 level by 2050 — do n’t pull in the same direction .
Creating “ green jobs , ” a key component of the agenda , is different from creating new jobs , since green jobs , if they ’re truly green , displace non-green jobs — wind - turbine mechanics instead of oil - rig roughnecks — probably a zero- sum game , as far as employment is concerned .
The ultimate success or failure of Obama ’s program , and of the measures that will be introduced in Copenhagen this year , will depend on our willingness , once the global economy is no longer teetering , to accept policies that will seem to be nudging us back toward the abyss . ♦
THE DREAM YOU HOLD -- What We Might Gain
Four Metaphors for Books , Offered as Aid to the New Electronic BookbindersWHAT WE MIGHT GAINOne of the best days of my life was stepping into my first university library and seeing all those glittering , peculiar books and realizing that my student ID doubled as a library card and that all these books were MINE ( as mine as yours , anyway ) .
I could take as many books as I wanted -- forty books at a time -- as long as I brought them back when I was done ( or said I would ) .
At first I was conservative and careful , only checking out one book at a time and bringing it back the day I was finished .
But when nothing bad happened , I started to get comfortable and greedy .
No one else was taking advantage , so why should n't I eat , EAT for chrissakes ?
The library was always empty .
The august and sacred university I attended was in essence a trade school with football games .
My professors were doddering and congealed : they each read the same ten books over and over again , no matter how many books were purchased on their behalf each semester with student tuition money .
So who were all these books for ?
Town locals could n't get a free library card .
They could read books in the library during regular hours , but they could n't check them out without paying .
Anyway , town locals did n't care .
They were too busy seeing " awesome live music , " laughing real hard about new cartoons on television , and trying to remove more meat from food and clothing .
The six floors of the Perry - Castaneda library in Austin were the one place in Austin you were guaranteed NOT to meet some sexy decadent who wanted to hear about your favorite new band .
You could walk the floors back and forth all day and night and not meet a single soul .
The haunting emptiness in such a tremendous building stuffed with wisdom was like a vacuum cleaner attachment shoved up your ass that made your bowels twinge and curl .
The library was my plague ship at sea ; my prison of exile where I could erect my own inner Pandemonium and fill it with all the sins , demons , and lusts I could cram inside me to watch burn and dance .
A huge building shaped like Texas , the PCL was MY Texas .
Eventually , I realized that I was probably doing the library books a favor by circulating them .
The books were in danger of becoming clotted blood .
Covered in dust and decay , most of them had n't been checked out since the sixties .
And these were n't abstruse marginalia about esoteric subjects : I was reading pulp novels and porn , cycling back around every third book or so to one of the books on Columbia University 's " Great Books " list out of spite and frustration regarding the education I was not receiving .
When today 's perversions lost their flavor , I dipped into the pulp and porn of previous centuries .
If I had been able to carry that library with me in my pocket -- hell , I might never have gone to college in the first place .
A huge , bureaucratic state university can teach you not only to hate books like retail workers hate customers , but it can teach you worse , that books must be worshiped from afar like dead gods : not loved , enjoyed , torn apart , and consumed with a mind bent toward writing them .
So what will happen once everyone in the world can carry a library the size of a small city in their pocket ?
what will happen once everybody in the world has access to everything ever written ?
And not only public domain " classics , " but new books and also the books that time forgot -- books that never found their cult of passionate enthusiasts or debased gourmands .
People from the provinces read , become obsessed with reading , become writers , and then move to cities to sell their stories about the provinces .
Only the world 's sick , twisted , and self - destructive have classically had the will to bend their lives toward writing fiction .
There are simply too many barriers .
There is the poverty , the hard work , and the grueling process of editors , drafts , and self - promotion .
What will happen when anybody in the world can toss off a novel in a weekend for anybody else in the world to read ?
Here 's what we 'll get from ebooks and the 24 hour open access of all literature : 1 ) .
Poor people will be able to read whatever they want . 2 ) .
Rich people will have to find some other way to gild their minds other than parroting their passing cultural knowledge of difficult texts .3 ) .
Dead books will be resurrected .
Literature will finally become a pure meritocracy instead of a medium controlled by a selective chokepoint of publishers and investors . 4 ) .
The world will be glutted with an immense , rotten tide of bad writing .
America 's coasts may be swept away in the deluge . 5 ) .
Publishers and investors will morph into designers and promoters , advocating for new books as matters of taste and principle instead of to sell " copies . "
Publishing houses will shrink , merging into literary magazines .
Literary magazines will serve the function of editing literature , pushing for specific literary agendas , courting advertisers , and shaking down readers for micropayments .
The next generation of publishers will look a lot like hip - hop record labels , pulling fiction writers together to edit , promote , and write .
Fiction writers will take turns getting each others books out to the people and working together to achieve the mutually satisfying goal of getting read . 6 ) .
We 'll save some trees .6 ) .
Libraries will become book museums .
People might actually visit them .7 ) .
Print copies of books will be like vinyl editions of records in an age of .mp3 players .
They will be good to collect if you are an enthusiast , but ultimately will not be a good deal . 8 ) .
I do n't want to alarm you , but ebooks could be BEAUTIFUL .
I know in their current incarnation they are about as aesthetically appealing as that TV channel that tells you what is playing on other TV channels , but if people actually spent time and effort crafting ebooks , they could truly become small marvels that constantly challenge the definition of design itself .
Persistent , web - hosted books could be constantly updated and tweaked , culminating in rich , beautiful structures -- the guts ripped out of novels , shined up , and made to glow .
The reading experience of each electronic tome could be unique , targeted , and layered .
The internet provides infinite space !
To hell with counting pages !
Given enough time , all books could be redesigned over the years with an eye toward opening them up to all their possible design idiosyncrasies .
Instead of editions of books , there could be book " skins " : modular overlays that convert your favorite books into specific forms and treatments that conjoin with your mood .
As electronic paper becomes more powerful and easier to use , people may someday pick out books like they build custom cars : you design one beautiful book to spec , and then every time you open it , it is a new book with new text inside .
I am 27 and I have watched the internet sweep over everything in my lifetime , and I have never had the illusion that the thing that I love most would be spared .
My heart hurts like a thumb hit with a hammer to contemplate a world without print literature , or a world where print literature is secondary to electronic text .
But I am young enough to realize that I am an asshole for thinking this way .
Whole generations have lived and died without access to the stories and information I take for granted .
Whole generations continue to live and die in this condition .
For every bespectacled , privileged , crusty writer who just loooooooves her books , there are a hundred thousand starving , illiterate , wasted geniuses who never had a chance to write the best stories we 've never read .
To stand in the way of making access to the world 's literature universal , to stand in the way of reaching out and making the possibility of self - expression , self - discovery , and self - knowledge the God - given right of every curious sapient creature straddling planet Earth ?
To even hesitate for a moment ?
It 's worse than burning books .
It 's choking dreams to death , like we 've always done , the way we 've always throttled the mewling , mutant kittens we fear .
What if we stopped doing that ?
Two subsistence hunters from the BaAka pygmy tribe hunt game along a forest stream ( Image : Martin Harvey / CORBIS )
West African pygmy populations vary more than their similarities in body size would indicate .
A new genetic analysis of pygmy populations native to Gabon and Cameroon suggests they split apart from one another roughly 3000 years ago and from other humans at least 50,000 years ago .
European explorers first encountered pygmy populations in the 19th century and lumped them together under a name that Homer used in the Iliad to describe an African tribe of diminutive crane - fighters .
Advertisement
“ Artificially we created a common origin and a common heritage just by the use of this pygmy term , ” says Paul Verdu , a geneticist at the Musée de l’Homme in Paris , who led the study
No group identity
Although pygmies resemble one another in physical stature – about 1.5 metres on average – they share little else in common .
Some live as jungle hunter - gatherers , while others practice agriculture and commerce and live in the savannah .
Many of their languages are also very varied , and the populations do not view identify any of the others as an ancestral group .
“ There is no such thing as a pygmy civilisation or identity , ” Verdu says .
Working with ethnographers , anthropologists and musicologists , his team collected DNA from 604 people belonging to nine pygmy groups and 12 non -pygmy populations living nearby .
Their analysis of 28 DNA markers hinted at close relations among the non-pygmies , but more widespread genetic diversity among pygmies .
A mathematical analysis of the data suggested that the pygmy populations diverged from one another roughly 2,800 years ago .
What ’s more , all the pygmy populations showed signs of inbreeding with outsiders .
None of the non-pygmy populations , however , exhibited any evidence of pygmy genes .
‘ Second - class citizens ’
This apparent paradox might be explained by widespread discrimination against pygmies , Verdu says .
Occasionally , pygmy women marry into non-pygmy families and have children .
Often these women and children are treated as second - class citizens and they eventually return to their native lands .
Exactly why pygmy populations diverged from one another is unclear , Verdu says .
He hypothesises that an ancient migration of farmers and herdsmen across sub-Saharan Africa – dubbed the Bantu expansion – might have segmented pygmies living in West Africa .
“ That makes sense to me , ” says Sarah Tishkoff , a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , who was not involved in the study .
“ You ’ve got these Bantu people coming through and maybe that caused isolation among these hunter gatherers who would have otherwise roamed freely . ”
A bigger mystery for Tishkoff is the relationship between West African pygmies and East African pygmies , who live thousands of kilometres away .

Bush emails not a priority : Congress budgets $ 650,000 to declassify Nazi war docs John Byrne
Published : Wednesday March 4 , 2009
Print This Email This The National Archives and Records Administration ( NARA ) -- which has yet to complete a program designed to properly store electronic records even in the shadow of millions of missing White House emails sent during the presidency of George W. Bush -- apparently feels a World War II probe is more important .
So does Congress , if their most recent budget is any guide .
Congress has just budgeted $ 650,000 for the declassification of any documents relating to US intelligence agencies and their relationships with Nazi or Japanese war criminals .
Thirty million dollars has already been spent on the Archives ' program aiming to declassify records that explore the web of connections between intelligence agencies and Nazi and Japanese war criminals , according to Congressional Quarterly 's Jeff Stein , who also reported the budget request .
The Archives has already spent ten years attempting to sort through their files .
But Congress appears to think $ 30 million and a decade of time spent is n't enough .
" There 's a million pages of Army and CIA documents left " to read and catalog , Miriam Kleiman , a spokeswoman for the National Archives and Records Administration , told Stein .
She blamed other agencies for failing to produce documents to declassify in a timely manner , and says the Archives plans to hire additional staff to continue the project .
While the Archives focuses on Nazi-era documents , watchdogs have questioned the agency 's ability to keep up with computer - era files -- namely , records of the Bush Administration .
A comprehensive program to store electronic data is not slated to be completed until 2011 , and has been hampered by delays and cost overruns .
Last September , the Government Accountability Office urged the Archives to create a backup plan should their systems be unable to process incoming records turned over by former President Bush in January of this year .
" If it can not ingest the electronic records from the Bush administration in a way that supports the search , processing and retrieval of records immediately after the presidential transition , it will not be able to meet the requirements of the Congress , the former and incumbent presidents , and the courts for information in these records in a timely fashion , " the GAO wrote .
In December , a report indicated that the records would not be transferred on schedule for various reasons , among them Bush officials ' court battles and technical problems the Archives has encountered .
Stories on millions of missing Bush White House emails , which the Bush White House said were not backed up by accident , have brought a spotlight to the Archives ' capacity and technical resources relating to electronic data .
The missing emails caused a stir in Congress because of the dates in which they were deleted ; they included key dates in the timeline of the outing of CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson , and were sought in connection with the alleged political firing of US Attorneys .
In a December interview , the Archives ' general counsel Gary M. Stern told The Washington Post , " We hope and expect they all will exist on the system or be recoverable , " even in coming weeks .
" We ca n't say for sure . "
US government agencies were required by a 1999 law to release " all records " relating to their relationships with German scientists and intelligence agents .
An agency set up for the task published books on their findings in 2004 and 2006 , Stein notes .
" I thought this was concluded years ago , " secrecy expert Steven Aftergood told Stein .
" $ 650 k is a good chunk of money in the declassification world .
At roughly $ 1 per page declassified -- it could be $ 0.50 or as much as $ 3.00 per page declassified , depending on the need for multiple reviews or for detailed redaction of individual pages -- that would pay for more than half a million pages that could be declassified .
At this point , the Nazi and Japanese Imperial ( Government ) records should be completed , and other initiatives funded . "

Why does Stiglitz want to give the banks more money , then present arguments that seem to be against such a proposal ?
Let ’s be clear : President Barack Obama inherited an economy in freefall and could not possibly have turned things around in the short time since his election .
Unfortunately , what he is doing is not enough .
The real failings in the Obama recovery program lie not in the stimulus package — though it is too heavily weighted toward tax cuts , and much of it merely offsets cutbacks by states — but in its efforts to revive financial markets .
America ’s failures provide important lessons to countries around the world that are or will be facing increasing problems with their banks :
• Delaying bank restructuring is costly , in terms of both the eventual bailout costs and the damage to the overall economy in the interim .
• Governments do not like to admit the full costs of the problem , so they give the banking system just enough to survive , but not enough to return it to health .
• Confidence is important , but it must rest on sound fundamentals .
Policies must not be based on the fiction that good loans were made , and that the business acumen of financial - market leaders and regulators will be validated once confidence is restored .
• Bankers can be expected to act in their self - interest on the basis of incentives .
Perverse incentives fueled excessive risk - taking , and banks that are near collapse but are too big to fail will engage in even more of it .
Knowing that the government will pick up the pieces if necessary , they will postpone resolving mortgages and pay out billions in bonuses and dividends .
• Socializing losses while privatizing gains is more worrisome than the consequences of nationalizing banks .
American taxpayers are getting an increasingly bad deal .
In the first round of cash infusions , they got about 67 cents in assets for every dollar they gave ( though the assets were almost surely overvalued , and quickly fell in value ) .
But in the recent cash infusions , it is estimated that Americans are getting 25 cents , or less , for every dollar .
Bad terms mean a large national debt in the future .
• Do n’t confuse saving bankers and shareholders with saving banks .
America could have saved its banks , but let the shareholders go , for far less than it has spent .
• Trickle - down economics almost never works .
Throwing money at the banks has n’t helped homeowners : foreclosures continue to increase .
Letting AIG fail might have hurt some systemically important institutions , but dealing with that would have been better than to gamble upwards of $ 150 billion and hope that some of it might stick where it is important .
One of the reasons we may be getting bad terms is that if we got fair value for our money , we would by now be the dominant shareholder in at least one of the major banks .
• Lack of transparency got America ’s financial system into this trouble .
Lack of transparency will not get it out .
The Obama administration is promising to pick up losses to persuade hedge funds and other private investors to buy out banks ’ bad assets .
But this will not establish ” market prices , ” as the administration claims .
Banks ’ losses have already occurred , and their gains must now come at taxpayers ’ expense .
Bringing in hedge funds as third parties will simply increase the cost .
• Better to be forward looking than backward looking , focusing on reducing the risk of new loans and ensuring that funds create new lending capacity .
There is no ” mystique ” in finance :
The era of believing that something can be created out of nothing should be over .
Short - sighted responses by politicians — who hope to get by with a deal that is small enough to please taxpayers and large enough to please the banks — will merely prolong the problem .
An impasse is looming .
More money will be needed , but Americans are in no mood to provide it — certainly not on the terms that we have seen
The well of money may be running dry , and so , too , may be America ’s legendary optimism and hope .
Joseph E. Stiglitz is professor of economics at Columbia University and recipient of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics .

As Electronic
Arts reported greatly - widened losses in its fiscal third quarter , CEO John Riccitiello said that in addition to getting its operating expenses way down , the publisher needs to do better on the Wii in order to make a rebound .
EA 's goal , he said on the company 's call to investors , is to " rival Nintendo on their own platform " and " get noticed [ on Wii ] in ways that no other third party will .
"
In addition to focusing EA Sports heavily on the Wii with a new tennis franchise , the publisher plans on " taking advantage of ... fascination with fitness " through EA Sports Active .
But Riccitiello also said EA would also be bringing " core intellectual property " such asto Wii , in editions custom - designed for the strengths of the platform .
Riccitiello also described how the EA thinks of the industry in terms of three " buckets " ( excluding EA 's mobile and Pogo businesses ) :
Online games , Wii games , and Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games .
The EA CEO says he places the Xbox 360 and the PS3 in the same " bucket " because " the lion 's share of titles developed for those platforms are common . "
" We 're proud to have great marketing partnerships around key exclusives , but in general , think of us as having those three buckets , " he says .
And as the market leader , the Wii will receive as much focus from EA now as both the next - gen systems together .
" Nintendo is the leader ; they 're getting half our emphasis in terms of title counts , " said Riccitiello .
"
You live , you learn you adjust and improve , " he added , explaining why the company 's Wii initiatives would be more successful in the coming year than in the previous year .
" This year 's title slate is a significant improvement from last year . "
Not for the first time , Catalonia 's tourism authorities have been caught seeking to glamorise their beaches with promotional photographs taken on the other side of the globe .
In the Girona tourist board 's latest attempt to spice up its Mediterranean appeal , an image supposedly of the Costa Brava was actually taken on a beach in Perth , Western Australia .
The picture shows a man and a boy gazing out to a deep blue horizon of sea and sky , while gentle waves lap the sand beneath their feet .
The Catalan version tones down the antipodean brilliance of the original , pastes a Costa Brava logo to the man 's T - shirt and adds in Catalan : " Congratulations Costa Brava on 100 years .
You really are great . "
The photo , taken 9,000 miles from the beach it represents , appeared on the programme of the recent Gastronomic Forum , a prestigious annual jamboree attended by top chefs including Ferran Adria .
Some 30,000 copies of the programme were handed to chefs , journalists and the general public during the event .

The cost of this piece of spin , the food fair 's publicity catalogue helpfully revealed , was € 3,200 ( £ 2,900 ) .
The tourist board , which provided the advert , described it as " a photomontage " , but at no time clarified that it did not show the Costa Brava , according to Jaume Von Arend , one of the forum 's organisers .
" We had no idea it was not the Costa Brava , " Mr Von Arend said .
The photo of the Australian beach was provided by Getty Images and forms part of the " Jacobs Stock Photography " collection .
A tourism official said the offending ad was developed by Be Brand , a company specialising in " communication strategy " .
Girona 's tourism board hired Be Brand last November to organise publicity for the centenary celebrations .
Spain 's rugged north - eastern shoreline was named the " wild coast " by the Catalan poet and politician Ferran Agullo 100 years ago , to launch it as a tourist destination .
The official said " he could not be sure " if Costa Brava tourism authorities knew the photo was of a beach half a world away .
Plans for the food fair and the centenary had been in train for two years , but even so " the advertisement was , as always , produced at very short notice , " they added .
The embarrassing blunder came as new figures showed the number of overseas visitors to Spain falling by 12 per cent in January from a year ago .
And it was not the first such gaffe .
Last month , the Catalan tourist board attempted to pass off a photo of a beach in the Bahamas – this time with a young woman strolling across golden Caribbean sand – as a local scene .
See what the hate from the ilks of Rush Limbaugh releases ?
Some crazy , biatch named Tammy Bruce goes straight negative and outrageous .
I wonder if she is trying to sell a book , get a tv show , or a radio program ?
Who knows , but the woman is totally foul and over the line .
Tammy Bruce , guest host for Laura Ingram 's radio show , had some harsh words for First Lady Michelle Obama .
Discussing the first lady 's visit to a Washington D.C. classroom last week , Bruce incredulously recalled Obama 's story about wanting to get A's in school and called out her use of a " weird , fake accent . "
" That 's what he 's married to , " Bruce said .
" ... You know what we 've got ?
We 've got trash in the White House .
Trash is a thing that is colorblind , it can cross all eco-socionomic ... categories .
You can work on Wall Street , or you can work at the Wal - Mart .
Trash , are people who use other people to get things , who patronize others , who consider you bitter and clingy ... "
The Obamas got more class than this biatch , for real .
Some folks really have nerve , I mean just nerve .
I guess we live in the age of " who can shock , whom the most " .
As much as I did not care for George W. Bush , I never thought he or his wife , Laura , was a bunch of trash .
Bruce describes herself as , " an openly gay , pro-choice , gun owning , pro-death penalty " progressive feminist " who has voted for presidents as diverse as Ronald Reagan , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush . "
Maybe she got confused along the way for the crap she was saying today .
Anyway it is words like this that makes folks just shake their heads , " NO " to the Republican Party .
If you want to listen to her rant , right here .
It is a shame we are in 2009 and some folks are still in the 1950/60s frame of mind .
Change is a bitch .

Yes folks , id Software ’s Quake Live , the 100 % free ( advertising paid ) and browser based edition of Quake III Arena , released in open beta February 24th .
Forget all of your preconceptions of beta testing games as the title runs without nearly any hitches .
Well , at least hitches affecting core game play mechanics , but we ’ll get into that later .
The game retains everything you hardcore Quake fans out there love about the first - person shooter ( FPS ) on steroids and Muscle Milk .
The ridiculously explosive weapons , the goofy man-grunts , and intoxicating trance tunes are all included for your late night ( or early morning ) binges of blink - less fragging .
Find more details after the break .
Quake Live is simple to install : Just create an account , download the browser plug - in , and you ’re good to go .
After installation the games mascot , Crash , forces you to do battle with her before she releases you into the fast - paced , sometimes harsh world of competitive shooters , but with good reason .
Based upon how you perform against Crash is how Quake Live matches you up with other players initially .
In other words , Crash makes it so that you are always playing matches with players of your skill level .
This is an amazing feature for FPS newcomers , who may not know strafing from leading a shot , and veterans alike .
Finding a match is fairly easy and your search can be fine tuned with search filters based on region , game difficulty , map settings and even game state , which means either the game has just started , is in warm up phase , or is already underway .
The types of matches currently include the basics such as Death Match , Capture the Flag and Free - for - All .
Novelty match types make their way in as well like “ Instagib “ , shorthand for instant giblets , which allows players to equip only a laser rifle that allows for one hit kills that cause your victims to explode in gory goodness .
Who makes this stuff up ?
Once you ’re in playing one of Quake Live ’s several match types against living , breathing people , gameplay is standard - yet - hopelessly - addictive FPS fare : Collect power-ups , armor and weapons as quickly as possible , turn your enemies into piles of pixelated goo and repeat .
Sounds simple , yes , but also endlessly appealing and difficult to master .
The only hitches found currently are the lack of certain features ( now that the 30 minute to one hour queues of last week are gone ) such as some forms of stat tracking and a few of the achievements that have been taken down temporarily .
Other than these few bumps in the road , Quake Live succeeds as a beta because if you missed the word “ beta ” below the game ’s current logo , you would barely notice it ’s a beta test at all .
There are no words from id Software on an official release , but expect it to be a while before Quake Live moves on from beta as there are plenty more features id Software are planning to add .
Can someone say “ premium accounts “ ?

WASHINGTON , D.C. --
A tour of the world 's most religious countries would n't be all mountaintop shrines and magnificent temples -- it would also take you to some pretty bleak places .
Gallup Polls in 143 countries reveal that among countries where average annual incomes are $ 2,000 or less , 92 % of residents say religion is an important part of their daily lives .
By contrast , among the richest countries surveyed -- those where average annual incomes are $ 25,000 or more -- that figure drops to 44 % .
Why is a population 's religiosity consistently connected to its wealth , or lack thereof ?
Sociologists going back to the 19th century have theorized that societies naturally grow more secular as they modernize -- that is , as people begin to grow better off in terms of education and living standards , the importance they attach to religion begins to recede .
But these secularization theories have come under fire more recently for their inability to tell the whole story .
Other researchers have shown that religion is in fact a powerful positive force for disadvantaged populations .
In 2004 , Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris used data from the World Values Survey to document a growing " religiosity gap " between developing and industrialized populations .
They argued that people in the poorest societies live with much greater vulnerability to forces that threaten their existence , so they 're more likely than those in developed nations to rely on religion for hope .
Gallup 's 2008 surveys in 32 countries with average annual incomes of $ 2,000 or less ( the countries are listed in the " Survey Methods " section ) document the extent to which religiosity appears to affect residents ' emotional health .
Specifically , they are more likely than those in the less religious group to say they experienced enjoyment the previous day , and they are less likely to have experienced a range of negative emotions .
These differences persist even after factoring in other variables that might affect respondents ' emotional states such as gender and age .
Now compare these results with those from the world 's richest countries -- i.e. , the 31 countries surveyed in 2008 where residents have average annual incomes of $ 25,000 or more .
Note that the differences here are smaller -- in fact , in the two cases in which they are more than a couple of percentage points , they are in the opposite direction from those we saw among the poorest countries .
The Social Side of Religion
In rich - world countries , one reason people that are more religious are less likely to get an emotional lift from their faith may be that they have fewer similarly devout people to share that faith with .
This gets to another line of thought that emphasizes the social connections that religion fosters in developing societies .
Common faith traditions give residents access to social networks and opportunities to forge meaningful relationships that offer emotional satisfaction , as well as a safety net -- a literal form of " social security " -- in times of crisis .
An ongoing analysis by Princeton economists Angus Deaton and Danny Kahneman and Gallup senior consultant Raksha Arora supports this concept , finding that respondents who are more religious give higher ratings on a life evaluation scale in countries where religiosity is more common overall .
In other words , as you move to countries where higher proportions of people say religion is important to them , the relationship between that question and overall life satisfaction gets stronger .
Gallup 's data also reveal that in poor countries residents who are more religious are more likely than those who are less religious to say they had positive experiences and interactions the previous day .
For example , those in the more religious group are more likely to say they were treated with respect all day and that they smiled and laughed a lot that day .
Again , these differences are smaller or nonexistent among rich - world populations .
Where Is the " Religion Lift " Strongest ?
Finally , let 's take a closer look at those poorer countries where 1 ) there are enough residents who are less religious to meaningfully compare them with their more religious counterparts ( 7 % of the population was our lower limit ) and 2 ) religiosity is most closely associated with more positive emotions and experiences .
We can clearly see the effect in most sub-Saharan African countries , but in three countries -- Uganda , Ethiopia , and Burkina Faso -- it is particularly dramatic .
Controlling for the effects of age , gender , and household income , the connection between religiosity and enjoyment is just as strong or stronger .
What do these three countries have in common that might help explain why religiosity appears to have such a powerful effect ?
Many factors unique to each country may be at play , but it 's notable that they share three characteristics :
Prominent role of religion in culture .
In all three countries , religious traditions are an important part of public life .
In Ethiopia , for example , religious festivals are enthusiastically celebrated by entire communities , with members of all faiths participating together .
High levels of religious acceptance .
None of the three countries has a completely homogenous religious makeup -- all have some mix of Christianity , Islam , and indigenous faiths -- but all three have a history of harmonious coexistence between different faith communities .
Low government involvement in religion .
The government does not formally align itself with any particular religion in any of the three countries .
Nor does the government in any of the three seek to limit or control the religious practices of its people .
It seems likely that these three elements contribute to an environment that maximizes the benefits of religiosity , while minimizing the likelihood of costly religious conflict .
Bottom Line
Gallup
Poll results support the idea that the social and psychological benefits of religion are strongest in the world 's poorest countries .
However , these effects vary from country to country , and as history has shown , religion is often associated with devastating conflict as well .
One implication seems to be this : Strategies for development in the world 's poorest countries should seek to leverage the positive power of religion by promoting conditions , such as interfaith harmony and low state interference , under which its benefits are most likely to come shining through .
Survey Methods
Global results are based on telephone and face - to - face interviews conducted in 2006 , 2007 , and 2008 with approximately 1,000 adults in each country .
Results from each country have an associated sampling error of ±4 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Girl to police : ' Mom cooks me in the oven like a turkey '
Girl to cops : ' Mom cooks me in the oven like a turkey '
HAMTRAMCK , Mich . —
After telling police that " Mom cooks me in the oven like a turkey , " a 4 - year - old Hamtramck girl and her four siblings are in foster care and their mother is facing years in prison on torture charges .
Reyna Valentino , 40 , was arraigned Thursday in 31st District Court in Hamtramck on two counts of torture and two counts of child abuse .
Bond was set at $ 1 million .
Her next hearing is set for Feb. 12 .
Police said Valentino went to a neighbor 's house after burning the girl in the oven at 3:30 p.m. Jan. 23 , begging the neighbor to call police .
" It 's really sad , " said Mamun Roshid , 16 , whose family lives in the house where Valentino knocked .
Hamtramck police detective Ben Bielecki said Valentino asked police in her 911 call to come get her .
" She said , ' I 'm going to hurt my family , ' " Bielecki said .
" When our guys got there , it was pretty bad . "
While the father had gone to pick the two boys up from school , Valentino used a heated nail or a screwdriver to burn the 4 - year - old girl 's lower eyelid , police said .
Then she put the girl in the turned - on oven , creating sear lines on her back .
" She said that her heart 's hurt and broke , " the 4 - year - old told police , according to Bielecki .
The girl also said : " Mommy does n't love me anymore .
Mama 's going to hurt me again .
She hurts me with a nail and cooks me in the oven like a turkey . "
Another daughter told investigators her mother once hit her with a crowbar .
All five children are in foster care and doing fine , Bielecki said .
Valentino was immediately taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital for evaluation after her arrest .

The economy may be bad but Wim Roelandts is n’t really bothered much by that because , as he told me , this is his 8th recession so far .
Wim ’s worst crisis as a leader came in 2000 when Xilinx , a computer chip manufacturer based in Silicon Valley , got hit hard and fast by the dot - com crisis .
In the December 2000 quarter their revenue was $ 450 million  9 months later , their revenues for the September 2001 quarter was down to only $ 225 million .
Something had to be done , and fast , but what ?
Wim Roelandts , an affable Belgian who is usually seen with a smile on his face , was the CEO back then and was clearly facing some tough choices .
And while Xilinx ’ competitors wasted little time in laying off a large percentage of their staff to cut costs , Wim felt here had to be a better way .
He came up with a plan for his organization and the 2,800 people in it and called it  Share the pain .
The plan had three major components .
1 : Cut salaries , not jobs
Wim felt strongly that if they laid off people now , they ’d just need to rehire them 5 or 6 quarters later when business improved .
Could n’t there be a way that kept people on even during the crisis ?
So they instituted a pay cut that was progressive and voluntary .
Progressive meant that your pay cut depended on your salary  the higher your salary , the higher your pay cut .
These were some typical pay cuts :
Job Pay cut Production - level employees 0 % Junior - level engineers 6 % Senior engineers and middle managers 9 % Directors 12 % Vice Presidents 15 % CEOs ( that ’s Wim ! ) 20 %
So while production employees were not affected at all , Wim himself took the largest pay cut  20 % of his salary .
They might have given everyone a 10 % pay cut , but chose this way because it shares the pain  not the pay cut .
When you ’re a production - level employee with a salary of around $ 30.000 - 40.000 trying to live in the Silicon Valley area , a 5 % or 10 % pay cut could really damage your quality of life .
When you ’re a VP , 15 % is entirely survivable .
Secondly the pay cut was voluntary .
This was n’t part of the original plan but it turned out that Xilinx employees in Europe would have to agree to take the pay cut voluntarily , so Wim decided to make it voluntary for everyone .
Amazingly , every one of the 2.800 employees chose to take the pay cut – except one .
And no , that one person was not singled out for reprisals of any kind .
Voluntary means voluntary .
Thinking back to this entire time , the one thing that Wim is the most proud of , is that everyone agreed to the pay cut in order to save their co-worker ’s jobs .
Later in the process , when the pay cuts turned out not to be enough to keep the company profitable , they introduced more measures , like closing the company for one day every other week and the option of taking a paid leave of absence to take an education .
Though Wim was very careful never to promise that there would be no lay - offs , this plan meant that Xilinx got through the crisis without laying off one single , solitary employee .
2 : Communicate openly
Wim knew that honest communication was essential .
His motto was to keep communicating and force his management team to communicate . 
In practice , he organized meetings with his entire management staff and the managers below them as well .
He knew , that when employees had questions , they would n’t come to him or the VP ’s , they would come to the managers closest to them , so it was important that they knew what was happening and remained optimistic .
This is not easy , as Wim readily admits .
 I didnt know any more than anybody else what was coming and so the tendency is to close your office door and dont talk to anybody because if you talk with someone , they can ask questions that you dont know the answers to .
But that s actually the wrong thing to do , you have to get out there .
You have to talk with people and even more important you have to force your management to get out and talk , talk to people , tell them when you dont know but also tell them all the things you know and good friend to give people some hope that things will get better soon . 
In these sessions with the managers , Wim would go over the company ’s situation honestly and thoroughly and then they would discuss how to communicate this to the employees .
Typical topics of discussion were :
What can we do as managers ?
What do we say ?
How do we act ?
A key aspect of these meetings was also to listen to the middle managers , so they felt good about the company ’s situation and could pass that feeling on to their people .
3 : Involve employees in decisions
They involved people in all new initiatives by consulting focus groups of employees .
They ’d get 20 employees together , tell them about what they were planning to do and get their honest feedback .
One specific decision that came out of these focus groups concerned new employees .
Originally , the company had planned not to include them in the pay cuts .
When this was tested , the new employees protested  they wanted to be treated like everyone else and share the pain too .
An intended byproduct of the focus group sessions was that information about the crisis and how it was being handled spread quickly throughout the organization .
When the initatives were announced to the employees , most people had heard about them already , which created more trust .
Wim himself
That was his plan for the organization , but there was another equally important aspect : Himself !
On a purely personal level , Wim did three things to handle the crisis .
First , he did his best to be positive .
Yes , the very survival of the company was at stake , but he still had to believe that there was a way out .
Wim put it like this :
 You have to be positive yourself .
If you are negative and you come in the factory everybodys going to be looking at you and getting depressed .
So however bad it is , however sad you feel , however worried you are , you come to work in the morning and you put on a big smile and you feel optimistic and you exude optimism and positive thinking .
When you are the CEO and you see the numbers go down every week or every day , its very easy to become depressed yourself and you really have to find the inner strength . 
Secondly , he saw the crisis not only as a threat but also as an opportunity .
This has become something of a stale and ridiculed cliché ( the next time some tells me ,  We do n’t have problems , we have opportunities ,  I may punch them ) but Wim saw this crisis as a chance to get creative and try something new .
To him , creativity and innovation should n’t just be applied to creating new and exciting products but also to leadership  to find new and exciting management solutions .
And thirdly , Wim saw this as a chance to prove that there is indeed a better way to handle a crisis than the tried - and - stale ones .
He wanted to show the world , that this can be handled differently .
 I ’m gonna show them may not be the noblest motivation , but it ’s not uncommon .
All the leaders I interviewed for this book expressed the same desire to  show them ! 
Now make no mistake , Wim faced a lot of resistance to his approach .
He had heated discussions with some board members , who wanted to know why he did n’t just lay off 10 % of the employees when everyone else in the industry was doing it .
The same arguments came from outside the organization from financial analysts , who also would have been much more comfortable with the traditional approach .
Time proved
Wim right and the result of this creative approach to crisis leadership was amazing .
The results were :
Profitability – Except for the second quarter of 2001 , when there was an inventory write down , Xilinx was profitable every quarter of that recession .

Customer satisfaction – Xilinx kept the same people in sales so the customers saw the same people they were used to talking to .

Motivation and happiness at work 
This showed employees that they were truly valued .
Not just on paper and in good times , but also in a down - turn .
At first employees were skeptical , seeing it as a cheap trick .
 Yeah , you say you ’re not doing lay - offs , but it ’s just a matter of time ,  was a common attitude .
But as many other companies in the area had mass lay - offs and Xilinx employees saw friends losing their jobs and having to sell their houses they started to come around .
During that time Xilinx participated in the Fortune Magazine 100 best places to work and came in the top 10  in the middle of the company ’s worst crisis ever .
The effect was also felt outside the company .
One day , about two years after the crisis when Xilinx was back on track , Wim was just arriving at the office when he was approached by a female employee who happened to arrive at the same time .
She told him this story :
 My husband got laid off and so yesterday evening we had a family meeting with the children .
We had to tell them that their father had been laid off and that they had to do some savings and we had to be very careful how we spend money , to make sure that we get through this tough time until our dad finds a job again . 
One of my children asked ‘ but mom what is going to happen if you get laid off ’. and I was so proud to say that I work at Xilinx and Xilinx doesnt lay off people .
Wim told me that this was his proudest moment in the whole process .

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland/17
by Michele Simionato
March 3 , 2009
The R6RS standard provides a few list utilities ; the SRFI - 1 provides a few others .
Nevertheless the offering is incomplete : in particular a list comprehension syntax is missing .
Therefore I have decided to distribute a library providing list comprehension and more .
Such library will be useful for future episodes of my Adventures , in particular for part IV , about advanced macro programming .
After all , macro programming is nothing else than manipulation of code seen as a nested list of expressions .
With a remarkable lack of fantasy , I have decided to call the library list - utils and to put it in a package called aps ( aps of course stands for Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland and not for American Physical Society ; ) .
In this way I will be contributing to the entropy and I will be littering the world with yet another version of utilities that I would rather not write , but this cannot be helped :-(
For your convenience , I have added in the library the Python - style utilities range , zip , transpose , enumerate I did discuss in episodes 7 and 8 , as well as the let + list destructuring macro I introduced in episode 15 .
I have also added the reference implementation of SRFI - 26 i.e. the cut and cute macros described in episode _ 14 .
Moreover , the aps package contains the testing framework discussed in episode 11 , renamed as ( aps easy - test ) and slightly improved ( the improvement consists in the addition of catch - error macro , which captures the error message ) .
Finally , the aps library includes a more recent version of sweet - macros than the one I discussed in episode 9 , so you should replace the old one if you have it .
You can download the package from here : http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/scheme/aps.zip
Just unzip the archive and put the files somewhere in your path :
$ cd < DIRECTORY-IN -YOUR-SCHEME -PATH >
$ unzip aps.zip inflating : sweet - macros.sls inflating : aps / cut.sls inflating : aps / easy - test.sls inflating : aps/list- utils.sls ...
You can test the library as follows :
$ ikarus -- r6rs - script aps/test- all.ss .........................
Run 25 tests .
25 passed , 0 failed
Currently all the tests pass with the latest development version of Ikarus .
They also pass with the latest development version of Ypsilon and with PLT Scheme version 4 , except for the test zip - with - error :
( test " zip - with - error " ( catch - error ( zip ' ( a b c ) ' ( 1 2 ) ) ) " length mismatch " )
However , this is an expected failure , since the error messages are different between Ikarus , Ypsilon and PLT Scheme .
Clearly , checking for an implementation - dependent error message is a bad idea and I could have thought of a better test , but I am lazy ; moreover , I do not want to discuss the error management mechanism in Scheme right now , since it is quite advanced and it is best deferred to future episodes .
Larceny
Scheme is not supported since it does not support the .IMPL.sls convention .
When it does , it could be supported as well , expecially if I get some help from my readers .
If you are wondering about the so - called .IMPL.sls convention , let me explain that it is a non-standard convention to enable portability about different R6RS implementations .
In particular the aps library contains three modules compat.ikarus.sls , compat.mzscheme.sls and compat.ypsilon.sls following the convention .
When I write ( import ( aps compat ) ) in Ikarus , the file compat.ikarus.sls is read ; when I import ( aps compat ) in PLT , the file compat .
mzscheme.sls is read ; and finally for Ypsilon the file compat.
ypsilon.sls is read .
This mechanism allows for writing compatibility wrappers ; for instance , here is the content of compat.
mzscheme.sls :
# !r6rs ( library ( aps compat ) ( export printf format gensym pretty - print ) ( import ( rnrs ) ( only ( scheme ) printf format gensym pretty - print ) ) )
Basically all decent Scheme implementations provide printf , format , gensym and pretty - print functionality , usually with these names too , but since they are not standard ( which is absurd IMO ) one is forced to recur to do - nothing compatibility libraries , which just import the functionality from the implementation - specific module and re-export it :-(
You can try the ( aps list - utils ) library as follows :
> ( import ( aps list - utils ) ) > ( enumerate ' ( a b c ) ) ( ( 0 a ) ( 1 b ) ( 2 c ) )
Mr. Obama said on the campaign trail last year that the possibility of breaking away some elements of the Taliban “ should be explored , ” an idea also considered by some military leaders .
But now he has started a review of policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan intended to find a new strategy , and he signaled that reconciliation could emerge as an important initiative , mirroring the strategy used by Gen. David H. Petraeus in Iraq .
“ If you talk to General Petraeus , I think he would argue that part of the success in Iraq involved reaching out to people that we would consider to be Islamic fundamentalists , but who were willing to work with us because they had been completely alienated by the tactics of Al Qaeda in Iraq , ” Mr. Obama said .
At the same time , he acknowledged that outreach may not yield the same success .
“ The situation in Afghanistan is , if anything , more complex , ” he said .
“ You have a less governed region , a history of fierce independence among tribes .
Those tribes are multiple and sometimes operate at cross purposes , and so figuring all that out is going to be much more of a challenge . ”
For American military planners , reaching out to some members of the Taliban is fraught with complexities .
For one thing , officials would have to figure out which Taliban members might be within the reach of a reconciliation campaign , no easy task in a lawless country with feuding groups of insurgents .
And administration officials have criticized the Pakistani government for its own reconciliation deal with local Taliban leaders in the Swat Valley , where Islamic law has been imposed and radical figures hold sway .
Pakistani officials have sought to reassure administration officials that their deal was not a surrender to the Taliban , but rather an attempt to drive a wedge between hard - core Taliban leaders and local Islamists .
During the interview , Mr. Obama also left open the option for American operatives to capture terrorism suspects abroad even without the cooperation of a country where they were found .
“ There could be situations  and I emphasize ‘ could be ’ because we have n’t made a determination yet  where , let ’s say that we have a well - known Al Qaeda operative that does n’t surface very often , appears in a third country with whom we do n’t have an extradition relationship or would not be willing to prosecute , but we think is a very dangerous person , ” he said .
Barack Obama promised to put fixing America ’s broken health care system at the top of his agenda as president .
But supporters of the one solution that could actually work were at the bottom of his White House invitation list .
As Obama ’s White House health care summit approached on March 5 , advocates of a so - called “ single - payer ” system , under which the government would cover everyone , eliminating the role of private insurers , were stunned to learn they were n’t invited .
It was an insult to organizations that have been warning for years about the health care crisis - in - the - making and putting forward the single - payer alterative — Physicians for a National Health Program ( PNHP ) , the California Nurses Association ( CNA ) and Healthcare - NOW !
Rep. John Conyers , the sponsor of a bill , known by its official designation HR 676 , that would establish single - payer , personally asked Obama for an invitation when the two met at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting .
The answer was no .
Only because people flooded the White House with angry phone calls , faxes and e-mails , and PNHP threatened to protest , the administration relented and reluctantly invited Conyers and Oliver Fein , the president of PNHP .
At the summit , Obama stated : “ In this effort , every voice must be heard .
Every idea must be considered .
Every option must be on the table .
There will be no sacred cows in this discussion . ”
This simply is n’t true .
Obama and his advisers have stated openly and unequivocally that as far as they are concerned , single - payer is n’t on the table — and the White House guest list for the summit proves the point .
Summit invitations went out to more than 120 “ stakeholders , ” [ 1 ] every one of them opposed to single - payer , save for Conyers and Fein .
It was a rogue ’s gallery of profit - seeking , price - gouging , highly compensated corporate criminals from the insurance and pharmaceutical industries .
Among them were Karen Ignagni , president and CEO of America ’s Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) , annual compensation $ 1,236,422 ; Scott Serota , CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield , annual compensation $ 1,498,018 ; Jeff Kindler , CEO of Pfizer , annual compensation $ 12.6 million ; and Ken Powell , member of the Business Roundtable and CEO of General Mills , annual compensation $ 6,515,047 .
Another invitation went to Billy Tauzin , a former Republican member of Congress notorious for his sleazy deals , and now , as president and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) , the top lobbyist for the drug company giants .
There were representatives from patient organizations and unions at the table , too : the American Cancer Society , AARP , Families USA , the Service Employees International Union , the United Auto Workers , and the AFL - CIO .
Unfortunately , the leaders of these organizations still accept that there is a role for the private insurance industry , even while many of their members do not .
Watching the breakout sessions streaming live over the Internet was both infuriating and surreal .
The “ stakeholders ” sat side by side at the same table , laughing and smiling — among them , CEOs responsible for a health care crisis that has left 50 million Americans uninsured and that causes the needless deaths of 18,000 and 100,000 people every year , depending on who is doing the estimating .
Meanwhile , not one union leader or patient advocate or political leader was willing to point out the responsibility of the insurance and pharmaceutical industry for the crisis .
Not one dared to speak truth to power , not even Conyers .
Obama set the tone for the meeting by asserting , “ Each of us must accept that none of us will get everything we want , and no proposal for reform will be perfect .
While everyone has a right to take part in this discussion , no one has the right to take it over . ”
Yet in each of the five breakout sessions , the insurance industry did dominate the discussion .
Moreover , the moderators of each session were all foes of single - payer , including Zeke Emanuel , a physician and brother of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
At the end of the forum , Obama handed the microphone to Ignagni , the voice of the insurance industry , who declared , “ We hear the American people about what ’s not working .
We ’ve taken that seriously .
You have our commitment to play , to contribute , and to help pass health care reform this year . ”
Really ?
Is this the same Ignagni whose AHIP bankrolled the infamous Harry and Louise television commercials 15 years ago in a successful attempt to smear the Clinton administration ’s health care reform effort ( though the Clintons certainly helped by putting forward a compromised proposal ) .
Does anyone seriously believe the AHIP would be willing to play fair if it did n’t think the Obama administration was preparing to deliver “ reform ” on terms that preserve its interests and profits ?
Single - payer advocates never even got in the door in Sen .
Ted Kennedy ’s secret meetings on health care .
According to the New York Times , Kennedy has been holding behind - closed - doors gatherings since last fall with lobbyists from AHIP , PhRMA , the Business Roundtable and others .
These clandestine , invitation - only sessions were designed to whittle down options for health care reform under the Obama presidency , with the health care industry setting the parameters of what would be acceptable .
Reportedly , the insurance industry got a guarantee from Kennedy that single - payer would n’t be on the table .
According to the Times , the consensus in the Kennedy meetings embraced so - called “ mandates ” –a legal requirement that every American have health insurance .
As a memo written by a Kennedy staffer and leaked to the Times put it :
[ T ]he sense of the room is that an individual obligation to purchase insurance should be part of reform if that obligation is coupled with effective mechanisms to make coverage meaningful and affordable …
There seems to be a sense of the room that some form of tax penalty is an effective means to enforce such an obligation , though only on those for whom affordable coverage is available .
According to the Times , the industry lobbyists at Ted ’s table said they would accept stricter regulation , including a requirement to offer coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions , but only if the federal government requires everyone to buy coverage .
This is essentially the same scheme for insurance mandates that was passed in Massachusetts in 2006 , under then - Gov. Mitt Romney , a right - wing Republican .
Under the Massachusetts law , for those who do n’t have employer - provided coverage , the state subsidizes sub - standard insurance coverage for the poor , and requires those in other income brackets to buy policies or pay a tax penalty — this year , it will be over $ 1,000 .
In other words , the insurance companies make money coming and going , and ordinary people pay the price .
A recent study by doctors at Harvard Medical School , titled “ Massachusetts ’ Plan : A Failed Model for Health Care Reform , ” shows the Massachusetts mandate model is n’t financially sustainable or truly affordable for those required to buy private insurance .
The plan has n’t even attained its stated goal of “ universal ” coverage : over 200,000 people in Massachusetts are still uninsured , and that number will increase as a result of rising unemployment .
That is the other major flaw in the model — it continues to link health insurance to employment .
The cost of an individual plan in Massachusetts averages around $ 3,500 for an individual and $ 10,000 for a family .
The Commonwealth Choice program classifies commercial plans into four levels : Gold , Silver , Bronze and Young Adult .
The lower - priced Bronze plans have a $ 2,000 per person deductible , co-pays and restrictions on where care is provided .
The message : We wo n’t all be Michael Phelps .
As for the federal “ reform ” effort , insurance executives have made it clear they will oppose the creation of a new public Medicare - like option , with the government providing health care benefits .
The insurers complain this would be unfair competition — Ignagni has called such proposals “ a ‘ stalking horse ’ to drive the nation toward a single - payer government system . ”
The insurance companies want “ reform ” that delivers the entire nation to their doorstep and forces us to buy private insurance from them at prices they set .
They definitely do n’t want any option that lets people opt out of their system and choose a public plan , as no doubt millions would , if given a choice .
In a distortion of the single - payer slogan “ Everybody in , nobody out , ” the insurers want everybody in and nobody out . . . of their private , for - profit system .
The health care summit was a reality check for anyone who may have had illusions that Obama would advocate for a single - payer system once he got into office .
Despite saying that he would favor such a system if he was “ starting from scratch , ” Obama is clearly opposed to single - payer under the current circumstances .
On the contrary , he has invited the parasitical insurance industry to continue to play a central role in health care .
The administration is holding health care forums in five states , and activists are planning to hold protests and pickets to make sure the message of the single - payer movement is heard .
The hope for winning health care justice for all does n’t lie with political leaders , but with organizing and protest at the grassroots .
WHAT YOU CAN DO
Activists for single - payer plan to make their voices heard at demonstrations outside the White House forums on health care reform taking place around the country .
See the home page of the California Nurses Association Web site for more details as they become available .
The group Healthcare - NOW !
also has information about the protests .
Physicians for a National Health Program has a Web site that makes the case for a government - administered single - payer program and has information on single - payer legislation sponsored by Rep. John Conyers .
Nancy ’s Welch ’s article , “ National Health Care : A Dream Deferred , ” in the International Socialist Review , examines what it will take to win health care for all .
Also in the ISR , Helen Redmond uncovers the crooked practices of the pharmaceutical industry in “ Bitter Medicine . ”
Patricia Morgan , author of studies of teenage pregnancy , said : " You could hardly do more to encourage promiscuity .
It is close to asking girls to go about the place with notices on their foreheads saying they are available . "

This was our second attempt at the ultimate structure .
To say we did not make any concessions would be a lie .
At first we believed the arch would span both cubicles without the use of the center cubicle divider .
We also believed the arch could be built without using temporary supports made out of DVD spindle cases .
We were wrong on both these fronts , but our results were not disappointing .
It took perhaps a full 3 - 4 weeks of building to reach the point the bridge is at now .
We started with the belief that a double thick base would create in the end a stronger bridge .
What we found was that those tapes could better be used elsewhere .
We drew diagrams and used mathematics .
We ran small scale mock arches to figure out the tape - to - arch ratios .
All the math in the world , though , could not prepare us for the trials of the spirit brought on by the construction .
True knowledge of the arch came only from touching the tapes , feeling their weight , lifting the unfinished bridge , feeling it ’s sheer mass .
This is how we were able to make decisions without thinking .
This is how the arch became instinct .

Be sure to hit up the MSN Health article for the details on what makes each offering such a disaster and for the list of healthier alternatives .
Last month we highlighted the 20 worst foods in America from the Eat This , Not That !
folks , but this supermarket - focused edition will hopefully help you stay healthy now that the recession 's got you eating in more often .
If a favorite of yours made the list , let 's hear about it in the comments .
[ MSN Health and Fitness / Men's Health ]
Like all revolutions in thought , this one began with anomalies , strange facts , odd observations that the prevailing wisdom could not explain .
Casino gamblers , for instance , are willing to keep betting even while expecting to lose .
People say they want to save for retirement , eat better , start exercising , quit smoking — and they mean it — but they do no such things .
Victims who feel they ’ve been treated poorly exact their revenge , though doing so hurts their own interests .
Such perverse facts are a direct affront to the standard model of the human actor — Economic Man — that classical and neoclassical economics have used as a foundation for decades , if not centuries .
Economic
Man makes logical , rational , self - interested decisions that weigh costs against benefits and maximize value and profit to himself .
Economic
Man is an intelligent , analytic , selfish creature who has perfect self - regulation in pursuit of his future goals and is unswayed by bodily states and feelings .
And Economic Man is a marvelously convenient pawn for building academic theories .
But Economic
Man has one fatal flaw : he does not exist .
When we turn to actual human beings , we find , instead of robot - like logic , all manner of irrational , self - sabotaging , and even altruistic behavior .
This is such a routine observation that it has been made for centuries ; indeed , Adam Smith “ saw psychology as a part of decision - making , ” says assistant professor of business administration Nava Ashraf .
“ He saw a conflict between the passions and the impartial spectator . ”
Nonetheless , neoclassical economics sidelined such psychological insights .
As recently as 15 years ago , the sub - discipline called behavioral economics — the study of how real people actually make choices , which draws on insights from both psychology and economics — was a marginal , exotic endeavor .
Today , behavioral economics is a young , robust , burgeoning sector in mainstream economics , and can claim a Nobel Prize , a critical mass of empirical research , and a history of upending the neoclassical theories that dominated the discipline for so long .
Although behavioral economists teach at Stanford , Berkeley , Chicago , Princeton , MIT , and elsewhere , the subfield ’s greatest concentration of scholars is at Harvard .
“ Harvard ’s approach to economics has traditionally been somewhat more worldly and empirical than that of other universities , ” says President Lawrence H. Summers , who earned his own economics doctorate at Harvard and identifies himself as a behavioral economist .
“ And if you are worldly and empirical , you are drawn to behavioral approaches . ”
Framing a New Field
Two non-economists have won Nobel Prizes in economics .
As early as the 1940s , Herbert Simon of Carnegie Mellon University put forward the concept of “ bounded rationality , ” arguing that rational thought alone did not explain human decision - making .
Traditional economists disliked or ignored Simon ’s research , and when he won the Nobel in 1978 , many in the field were very unhappy about it .
Then , in 1979 , psychologists Daniel Kahneman , LL.D. ’ 04 , of Princeton and Amos Tversky of Stanford published “ Prospect Theory : An Analysis of Decision under Risk , ” a breakthrough paper on how people handle uncertain rewards and risks .
In the ensuing decades , it became one of the most widely cited papers in economics .
The authors argued that the ways in which alternatives are framed — not simply their relative value — heavily influence the decisions people make .
This was a seminal paper in behavioral economics ; its rigorous equations pierced a core assumption of the standard model — that the actual value of alternatives was all that mattered , not the mode of their presentation ( “ framing ” ) .
Framing alternatives differently can , for example , change people ’s preferences regarding risk .
In a 1981 Science paper , “ The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice , ” Tversky and Kahneman presented an example .
“ Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease which is expected to kill 600 people , ” they wrote .
“ Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed . ” Choose Program A , and a projected 200 people will be saved .
Choose Program B , and there is a one - third probability that 600 people will be saved , and a two - thirds probability that no one will be saved .
The authors reported that 72 percent of respondents chose Program A , although the actual outcomes of the two programs are identical .
Most subjects were risk averse , preferring the certain saving of 200 lives .
The researchers then restated the problem : this time , with Program C , “ 400 people will die , ” whereas with Program D , “ there is a one - third probability that no one will die , and a two - thirds probability that 600 people will die . ”
This time , 78 percent chose Program D—again , despite identical outcomes .
Respondents now preferred the risk - taking option .
The difference was simply that the first problem phrased its options in terms of lives saved , and the second one as lives lost ; people are more willing , apparently , to take risks to prevent lives being “ lost ” than to “ save ” lives .
“ Kahneman and Tversky started this revolution in economics , ” says Straus professor of business administration Max Bazerman , who studies decision - making and negotiation at Harvard Business School .
“ That 1979 paper was written on the turf of economics , in the style of economists , and published in the toughest economic journal , Econometrica .
The major points of prospect theory are n’t hard to state in words .
The math was added for acceptance , and that was important . ”
In 2002 , Kahneman received the Nobel Prize in economics along with Vernon Smith , Ph.D. ’ 55 , of George Mason University , who was honored for work in experimental economics .
( Tversky , Kahneman ’s longtime collaborator , had died in 1996 . )
In the 1980s , Richard Thaler ( then at Cornell , now of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business ) began importing such psychological insights into economics , writing a regular feature called “ Anomalies ” in the Journal of Economic Perspectives ( later collected in his 1994 book , The Winner ’s Curse ) .
“ Dick Thaler lived in an intellectual wilderness in the 1980s , ” says professor of economics David Laibson , one of Harvard ’s most prominent behavioral economists .
“ He championed these ideas that economists were deriding .
But he stuck to it .
Behavioral approaches were anathema in the 1980s , became popular in the 1990s , and now we ’re a fad , with lots of grad students coming on board .
It ’s no longer an isolated band of beleaguered researchers fighting against the mainstream . ”
As with most movements , there were early adopters .
“ In the 1980s the best economists in the world were seeing the evidence and adopting it [ behavioral economics ] , ” Bazerman says .
“ Mediocre economists follow slowly — they continued to ignore it so they could continue doing their work undisturbed . ”
To be fair , the naysayers would have agreed that the rational model only approximates human cognition — “ just as Newtonian physics is an approximation to Einstein ’s physics , ” Laibson explains .
“ Although there are differences , when walking along the surface of this planet , you ’ll never encounter them .
If I want to build a bridge , pass a car , or hit a baseball , Newtonian physics will suffice .
But the psychologists said , ‘ No , it ’s not sufficient , we ’re not just playing around at the margins , making small change .
There are big behavioral regularities that include things like imperfect self - control and social preferences , as opposed to pure selfishness .
We care about people outside our families and give up resources to help them — those affected by Hurricane Katrina , for example . ”
Much of the early work in behavioral economics was in finance , with many significant papers written by Jones professor of economics Andrei Shleifer .
In financial markets , “ The usual arguments in conventional economics are , ‘ This [ behavioral irrationality ] ca n’t be true , because even if there are stupid , irrational people around , they are met in the marketplace by smart , rational people , and trading by these arbitrageurs corrects prices to rational levels , ’ ” Shleifer explains .
“ For example , if people get unduly pessimistic about General Motors and dump GM shares on the market , these smart people will sweep in and buy them up as undervalued , and not much will happen to the price of GM shares . ”
But a 1990 paper Shleifer wrote with Summers , “ The Noise Trader Approach to Finance , ” argues against this “ efficient market ” model by noting that certain risk - related factors limit this arbitrage .
At that time , for example , shares of Royal Dutch were selling at a different price in Amsterdam than shares of Shell in London , even though they were shares of the same company , Royal Dutch / Shell .
Closed - end mutual funds ( those with a fixed number of shares that trade on exchanges ) sell at different prices than the value of their portfolios .
“ When the same thing sells at two different prices in different markets , forces of arbitrage and rationality are necessarily limited , ” Shleifer says .
“ The forces of irrationality are likely to have a big impact on prices , even on a long - term basis .
This is a theoretical attack on the central conventional premise . ”
Meanwhile , the Russell Sage Foundation , which devotes itself to research in the social sciences , consistently supported behavioral economics , even when it was in the intellectual wilderness .
Current Sage president Eric Wanner , Ph.D. ’ 69 , whose doctorate is in social psychology , was running a program in cognitive science at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1984 when Sloan started a behavioral economics program as an application of cognitive science to the study of economic decision - making .
( “ The field is misnamed — it should have been called cognitive economics , ” says Wanner .
“ We were n’t brave enough . ” )
After Wanner became president of Russell Sage in 1986 , the two institutions worked jointly to foster the new subfield .
In the last 20 years , Sage has made well over 100 grants to behavioral economists ; it also organizes a biennial summer institute that has drawn younger scholars like Laibson and professor of economics Sendhil Mullainathan .
Princeton University Press and Russell Sage also co-publish a series of books in the field .
Behavioral economics , then , is the hybrid offspring of economics and psychology .
“ We do n’t have much to tell psychologists about how individuals make decisions or process information , but we have a lot to learn from them , ” says Glimp professor of economics Edward Glaeser .
“ We do have a lot to say about how individuals come together in aggregations — markets , firms , political parties . ”
The Seductive Now - Moment
A national chain of hamburger restaurants takes its name from Wimpy , Popeye ’s portly friend with a voracious appetite but small exchequer , who made famous the line , “ I ’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today . ”
Wimpy nicely exemplifies the problems of “ intertemporal choice ” that intrigue behavioral economists like David Laibson .
“ There ’s a fundamental tension , in humans and other animals , between seizing available rewards in the present , and being patient for rewards in the future , ” he says .
“ It ’s radically important .
People very robustly want instant gratification right now , and want to be patient in the future .
If you ask people , ‘ Which do you want right now , fruit or chocolate ? ’ they say , ‘ Chocolate ! ’
But if you ask , ‘ Which one a week from now ? ’ they will say , ‘ Fruit . ’
Now we want chocolate , cigarettes , and a trashy movie .
In the future , we want to eat fruit , to quit smoking , and to watch Bergman films . ”
Laibson can sketch a formal model that describes this dynamic .
Consider a project like starting an exercise program , which entails , say , an immediate cost of six units of value , but will produce a delayed benefit of eight units .
That ’s a net gain of two units , “ but it ignores the human tendency to devalue the future , ” Laibson says .
If future events have perhaps half the value of present ones , then the eight units become only four , and starting an exercise program today means a net loss of two units ( six minus four ) .
So we do n’t want to start exercising today .
On the other hand , starting tomorrow devalues both the cost and the benefit by half ( to three and four units , respectively ) , resulting in a net gain of one unit from exercising .
Hence , everyone is enthusiastic about going to the gym tomorrow .
Broadly speaking , “ People act irrationally in that they overly discount the future , ” says Bazerman .
“ We do worse in life because we spend too much for what we want now at the expense of goodies we want in the future .
People buy things they ca n’t afford on a credit card , and as a result they get to buy less over the course of their lifetimes . ”
Such problems should not arise , according to standard economic theory , which holds that “ there should n’t be any disconnect between what I ’m doing and what I want to be doing , ” says Nava Ashraf .
Luckily , Odysseus also confronts the problem posed by Wimpy — and Homer ’s hero solves the dilemma .
The goddess Circe informs Odysseus that his ship will pass the island of the Sirens , whose irresistible singing can lure sailors to steer toward them and onto rocks .
The Sirens are a marvelous metaphor for human appetite , both in its seductions and its pitfalls .
Circe advises Odysseus to prepare for temptations to come : he must order his crew to stopper their ears with wax , so they cannot hear the Sirens ’ songs , but he may hear the Sirens ’ beautiful voices without risk if he has his sailors lash him to a mast , and commands them to ignore his pleas for release until they have passed beyond danger .
“ Odysseus pre-commits himself by doing this , ” Laibson explains .
“ Binding himself to the mast prevents his future self from countermanding the decision made by his present self . ”
Pre-commitments of this sort are one way of getting around not only the lure of temptation , but our tendency to procrastinate on matters that have an immediate cost but a future payoff , like dieting , exercise , and cleaning your office .
Take 401 ( k ) retirement plans , which not only let workers save and invest for retirement on a tax - deferred basis , but in many cases amount to a bonanza of free money : the equivalent of finding “ $ 100 Bills on the Sidewalk ” ( the title of one of Laibson ’s papers , with James Choi and Brigitte Madrian ) .
That ’s because many firms will match employees ’ contributions to such plans , so one dollar becomes two dollars .
“ It ’s a lot of free money , ” says Laibson , who has published many papers on 401 ( k ) s and may be the world ’s foremost authority on enrollment in such plans .
“ Someone making $ 50,000 a year who has a company that matches up to 6 percent of his contributions could receive an additional $ 3,000 per year . ”
The rational model unequivocally predicts that people will certainly snap up such an opportunity .
But they do n’t — not even workers aged 59 1 / 2 or older , who can withdraw sums from their 401 ( k ) plans without penalty .
( Younger people are even more unlikely to contribute , but they face a penalty for early withdrawal . )
“ It turns out that about half of U.S. workers in this [ above 59 1/2 ] age group , who have this good deal available , are not contributing , ” says Laibson .
“ There ’s no downside and a huge upside .
Still , individuals are procrastinating — they plan to enroll soon , year after year , but do n’t do it . ”
In a typical American firm , it takes a new employee a median time of two to three years to enroll .
But because Americans change jobs frequently — say , every five years — that delay could mean losing half of one ’s career opportunity for these retirement savings .
Laibson has run educational interventions with employees at companies , walking them through the calculations , showing them what they are doing wrong .
“ Almost all of them still do n’t invest , ” Laibson says .
“ People find these kinds of financial transactions unpleasant and confusing , and they are happier with the idea of doing it tomorrow .
It demonstrates how poorly the standard rational - actor model predicts behavior . ”
It ’s not that we are utterly helpless against procrastination .
Laibson worked with a firm that forced its employees to make active decisions about 401 ( k ) plans , insisting on a yes or no answer within 30 days .
This is far different from giving people a toll - free phone number to call whenever they decide to enroll .
During the 30 - day period , the company also sent frequent e-mail reminders , pressuring the staff to make their decisions .
Under the active - decision plan , enrollment jumped from 40 to 70 percent .
“ People want to be prudent , they just do n’t want to do it right now , ” Laibson says .
“ You ’ve got to compel action .
Or enroll people automatically . ”
When he was U.S. Treasury Secretary , Lawrence Summers applied this insight .
“ We pushed very hard for companies to choose opt - out [ automatic enrollment ] 401 ( k ) s rather than opt - in [ self - enrollment ] 401 ( k ) s , ” he says .
“ In classical economics , it does n’t matter .
But large amounts of empirical evidence show that defaults do matter , that people are inertial , and whatever the baseline settings are , they tend to persist . ”
Marketing Prudence
Assistant professor of business administration Nava Ashraf helped adapt a home - grown savings technique she saw in West Africa to the Philippines , where the “ cute ” SEED ( “ Save , Earn , Enjoy Deposits ” ) bank ( opposite ) helped ordinary citizens save money .
These insights can also be writ large .
Laibson ’s former student Nava Ashraf , who has worked extensively with non-governmental organizations , is now applying behavioral economics to interventions in developing countries .
She lived for a year in Ivory Coast and Cameroon , where she “ noticed that farmers and small - business owners were often not doing the things that a development policymaker or economist thinks they should do , ” she says .
“ They would n’t take up technologies that would increase agricultural yield , for example .
They would n’t get vaccines , even though they were free !
They also had a lot of trouble saving .
In January they had a lot of money and would spend it on feasts and special clothes , but in June their children would be starving . ”
Still , some found ways to offset their less - than - prudent tendencies .
One woman had a cashbox in her home , where she saved money regularly — and gave her neighbor the only key .
Another timed the planting of her sweet - potato crop so that the harvest would come in when school fees were due .
Her farm became an underground bank account that allowed withdrawal only at the proper moment .
Ashraf worked with a bank in the Philippines to design a savings plan that took off from the African woman ’s cashbox .
The bank created a savings account , called SEED ( “ Save , Earn , Enjoy Deposits ” ) , with two features : a locked box ( for which the bank had the key ) and a contractual agreement that clients could not withdraw money before reaching a certain date or sum .
The clients determined the goal , but relied on the bank to enforce the commitment .
The bank marketed the SEED product to literate workers and micro-entrepreneurs : teachers , taxi drivers , people with pushcart businesses .
The SEED box , designed to appeal to the bank ’s clients ( “ In the Philippines , they like ‘ cute ’ stuff , ” Ashraf explains ) , helped mobilize deposits .
“ It ’s similar to automatic payroll deduction , but not enough of the customers had direct deposit to make that work , ” she says .
To further encourage deposits , Ashraf worked with the bank on an additional program of deposit collectors who , for a nominal fee , would go to the customer ’s home on a designated day and collect the savings from the SEED box .
The withdrawal restrictions on the account helped clients avoid the temptation of spending their savings .
The SEED savings account made a designed choice available in the marketplace that , so far , has helped a growing number of microfinance clients in the Philippines reach their savings goals .
Ashraf is now working with Population Services International — a nonprofit organization that seeks to focus private - sector resources on the health problems of developing nations — on a project in Zambia to motivate people to use a water purification solution known as Clorin .
“ We can use what marketing people have known all along , ” Ashraf says .
“ There are ways of manipulating people ’s psychological frameworks to get them to buy things .
How do you use this knowledge to get them to adopt socially useful products or services ?
It ’s so practical , and very important in development , for anybody who wants to help people reach their goals . ”
Carefully designed programs like the SEED bank are examples of what Richard Thaler called “ prescriptive economics , ” which aims not only to describe the world but to change it .
“ Behavioral economics really shines when you talk about the specifics of what the policy should look like , ” says Sendhil Mullainathan , who received a MacArthur Fellowship in 2002 .
“ The difference in impact between two broad policies may not be as great as differences in how each policy is framed — its deadlines , implementation , and the design of its physical appearance .
“ For example , in Social Security privatization , ” Mullainathan continues , “ the difference between private accounts and the status quo may be less than that between two different ways of implementing private accounts .
What is the default option ?
Are you allowed to make changes ?
What ’s the deadline for making changes ?
How are the monthly statements presented — just your returns , or are the market returns printed alongside your own ?
In terms of impact , the devil really is in the details of how the program is designed .
We know that people have a tough time making these choices .
So how are the choices framed ?
What metrics do they focus on ? ”
“ We tend to think people are driven by purposeful choices , ” he explains .
“ We think big things drive big behaviors : if people do n’t go to school , we think they do n’t like school .
Instead , most behaviors are driven by the moment .
They are n’t purposeful , thought - out choices .
That ’s an illusion we have about others .
Policymakers think that if they get the abstractions right , that will drive behavior in the desired direction .
But the world happens in real time .
We can talk abstractions of risk and return , but when the person is physically checking off the box on that investment form , all the things going on at that moment will disproportionately influence the decision they make .
That ’s the temptation element — in real time , the moment can be very tempting .
The main thing is to define what is in your mind at the moment of choice .
Suppose a company wants to sell more soap .
Traditional economists would advise things like making a soap that people like more , or charging less for a bar of soap .
A behavioral economist might suggest convincing supermarkets to display your soap at eye level — people will see your brand first and grab it . ”
“ Policymakers think that if they get the abstractions right , that will drive behavior in the desired direction , ” says professor of economics Sendhil Mullainathan .
“ But the world happens in real time . ”
Mullainathan worked with a bank in South Africa that wanted to make more loans .
A neoclassical economist would have offered simple counsel : lower the interest rate , and people will borrow more .
Instead , the bank chose to investigate some contextual factors in the process of making its offer .
It mailed letters to 70,000 previous borrowers saying , “ Congratulations !
You ’re eligible for a special interest rate on a new loan . ”
But the interest rate was randomized on the letters : some got a low rate , others a high one .
“ It was done like a randomized clinical trial of a drug , ” Mullainathan explains .
The bank also randomized several aspects of the letter .
In one corner there was a photo — varied by gender and race — of a bank employee .
Different types of tables , some simple , others complex , showed examples of loans .
Some letters offered a chance to win a cell phone in a lottery if the customer came in to inquire about a loan .
Some had deadlines .
Randomizing these elements allowed Mullainathan to evaluate the effect of psychological factors as opposed to the things that economists care about — i.e. , interest rates — and to quantify their effect on response in basis points .
“ What we found stunned me , ” he says .
“ We found that any one of these things had an effect equal to one to five percentage points of interest !
A woman ’s photo instead of a man ’s increased demand among men by as much as dropping the interest rate five points !
These things are not small .
And this is very much an economic problem .
We are talking about big loans here ; customers would end up with monthly loan payments of around 10 percent of their annual income .
You ’d think that if you really needed the money enough to pay this interest rate , you ’re not going to be affected by a photo .
The photo , cell phone lottery , simple or complicated table , and deadline all had effects on loan applications comparable to interest .
Interest rate may not even be the third most important factor .
As an economist , even when you think psychology is important , you do n’t think it ’s this important .
And changing interest rates is expensive , but these psychological elements cost nothing . ”
Mullainathan is helping design programs in developing countries , doing things like getting farmers to adopt better feed for cows to increase their milk production by as much as 50 percent .
Back in the United States , behavioral economics might be able to raise compliance rates of diabetes patients , who do n’t always take prescribed drugs , he says .
Poor families are often deterred from applying to colleges for financial aid because the forms are too complicated .
“ An economist would say , ‘ With $ 50,000 at stake , the forms ca n’t be the obstacle , ’ ” he says .
“ But they can . ” ( A traditional explanation would say that the payoff clearly outweighs the cost in time and effort , so people wo n’t be deterred by complex forms . )
Economists and others who engage in policy debates like to wrangle about big issues on the macroscopic level .
The nitty - gritty details of execution — what do the forms look like ?
what is in the brochures ?
how is it communicated ?— are left to the support staff .
“ But that work is central , ” Mullainathan explains .
“ There should be as much intellectual energy devoted to these design choices as to the choice of a policy in the first place .
Behavioral economics can help us design these choices in sensible ways .
This is a big hole that needs to be filled , both in policy and in science . ”
The Supply of Hatred
While some try to surmount or cope with irrationality , others feed upon it .
In the wake of the 9/11 attacks , Edward Glaeser began using behavioral economic approaches to research the causes of group hatred that could motivate murderous acts of that type .
“ An economist ’s definition of hatred , ” he says , “ is the willingness to pay a price to inflict harm on others . ”
In laboratory settings , social scientists have observed subjects playing the “ ultimatum game , ” in which , say , with a total kitty of $ 10 , Player A offers to split the cash with player B .
If B accepts A ’s offer , they divide the money accordingly , but if B rejects A ’s offer , both players get nothing .
“ In thousands of trials around the world , with different stakes , people reject offers of 30 percent [ $ 3 in our example ] or less , ” says Glaeser .
“ So typically , people offer 40 or 50 percent .
But a conventional economic model would say that B should accept a split of even one cent versus $ 9.99 , since you are still better off with a penny than nothing . ”
( If a computer , rather than a human , does the initial split , player B is much more likely to accept an unfair split — a confirmation of research conducted by professors at the Kennedy School of Government ; see “ Games of Trust and Betrayal , ” page 94 . )
Clearly , the B player is willing to suffer financial loss in order to take revenge on an A player who is acting unfairly .
“ You do n’t poke around in the dark recesses of human behavior and not find vengeance , ” Glaeser says .
“ It ’s pretty hard to find a case of murder and not find vengeance at the root of it . ”
The psychological literature , he found , defines hatred as an emotional response we have to threats to our survival or reproduction .
“ It ’s related to the belief that the object of hatred has been guilty of atrocities in the past and will be guilty of them in the future , ” he says .
“ Economists have nothing to tell psychologists about why individuals hate .
But group - level hatred has its own logic that always involves stories about atrocities .
These stories are frequently false .
As [ Nazi propagandist Joseph ]
Goebbels said , hatred requires repetition , not truth , to be effective .
“ You have to investigate the supply of hatred , ” Glaeser continues .
“ Who has the incentive and the ability to induce group hatred ?
This pushes us toward the crux of the model : politicians or anyone else will supply hatred when hatred is a complement to their policies . ”
Glaeser searched back issues of the Atlanta Constitution from 1875 to 1925 , counting stories that contained the keywords “ Negro + rape ” or “ Negro + murder . ”
He found a time - series that closely matched that for lynchings described by historian C. Vann Woodward : rising from 1875 until 1890 , reaching a plateau from 1890 until 1910 , then declining after 1910 .
In the 1880s and 1890s , Glaeser explains , the southern Populist Party favored large - scale redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor , and got substantial support from African Americans .
“ Wealthier Southern conservatives struck back , using race hatred ” and spreading untrue stories about atrocities perpetrated by blacks , Glaeser says .
“ ‘ Populists are friends of blacks , and blacks are dangerous and hateful , ’ was the message — instead of being supported , [ blacks ] should be sequestered and have their resources reduced .
[ Rich whites ] sold this to poor white voters , winning votes and elections .
Eventually the Populists gave in and decided they were better off switching their appeal to poor , racist whites .
They felt it was better to switch policies than try to change voters ’ opinions .
The stories — all about rape and murder — were coming from suppliers who were external to poor whites . ”
Glaeser applies this model to anti-American hatred , which , in degree , “ is not particularly correlated with places that the United States has helped or done harm to , ” he says .
“ France hates America more than Vietnam does . ”
Instead , he explains , it has much to do with “ political entrepreneurs who spread stories about past and future American crimes .
Some place may have a leader who has a working relationship with the United States .
Enemies of the leader offer an alternative policy : completely break with the United States and Israel , and attack them .
We saw it in the religious enemies of the shah [ of Iran ] .
The ayatollah sought to discredit the secular modernists through the use of anti-American hatred . ”
For Glaeser , behavioral economics can take “ something we have from psychology — hatred as a hormonal response to threats — and put this in a market setting .
What are the incentives that will increase the supply of hatred in a specific setting ? ”
Economists , he feels , can take human tendencies rooted in hormones , evolution , and the stable features of social psychology , and analyze how they will play out in large collectivities .
“ Much of psychology shows the enormous sensitivity of humans to social influence , ” Glaeser says .
“ The Milgram and Zimbardo experiments [ on obedience to authority and adaptation to the role of prison guard ] show that humans can behave brutally .
But that does n’t explain why Nazism happened in Germany and not England . ”
Zero-Sum Persuasion
Andrei Shleifer has already made path - breaking contributions to the literatures of behavioral finance ( as noted above ) , political economy , and law and economics .
His latest obsession is persuasion —
“ How people absorb information and how they are manipulated , ” he says .
At the American Economic Association meetings in January , Shleifer described “ cognitive persuasion , ” exploring how advertisers , politicians , and others attach their messages to pre-existing maps of associations in order to move the public in a desired direction .
The Marlboro Man , for example , sold filtered cigarettes by mobilizing the public ’s associations of cowboys and the West with masculinity , independence , and the great outdoors .
“ There is a ‘ confirmation bias , ’ ” Shleifer explained , which favors persuasive messages that confirm beliefs and connections already in the audience ’s mind ( see “ The Market for News , ” January - February , page 11 , on work by Shleifer and Mullainathan that applies a similar analysis to the news media ) .
For example , George W. Bush wearing a $ 3,000 cowboy hat was not a problem , because it matched his image , but John Kerry riding a $ 6,000 bicycle was a problem — that luxury item appeared hypocritical for a candidate claiming to side with the downtrodden .
Citing Republican pollster and communications consultant Frank Luntz , Shleifer noted how the estate tax was renamed the “ death tax ” ( although there is no tax on death ) in order to successfully sell its repeal .
The relabeling linked the tax to the unpleasant associations of the word “ death , ” and the campaign asked questions like , “ How can you burden people even more at this most difficult time in their lives ? ”
“ Messages , not hard attributes , shape competition , ” Shleifer said ; he noted that the fear of terrorism is a bigger issue in probable non-target states like Wyoming , Utah , and Nevada than in New York and New Jersey .
Because successful persuasive messages are consistent with prevailing worldviews , one corollary of Shleifer ’s analysis is that persuasion is definitely not education , which involves adding new information or correcting previous perceptions .
“ Do n’t tell people , ‘ You are stupid , and here is what to think , ’ ” Shleifer said .
During presidential debates , he asserted , voters tune out or forget things that are inconsistent with their beliefs .
“ Educational messages may be doomed , ” he added .
“ They do not resonate . ”
In economic and political markets , he said , there is no tendency toward a median taste ; divergence , not convergence , is the trend .
Therefore , the successful persuader will find a niche and pander to it .
When making choices in the marketplace , “ People are not responding to the actual objects they are choosing between , ” says Eric Wanner of the Russell Sage Foundation .
“ There is no direct relation of stimulus and response .
Neoclassical economics posits a direct relationship between the object and the choice made .
But in behavioral economics , the choice depends on how the decision - maker describes the objects to himself .
Any psychologist knows this , but it is revolutionary when imported into economics .
“ We are vulnerable to how choices are described , ” Wanner explains .
“ Advertising is a business that tries to shape how people think about their choices .
Neoclassical economics can explain ads only as providing information .
But if the seller can invest in advertising that frames the choice , that frame will skew the buyer ’s decision .
The older economic theories depend on the idea that the successful seller will produce a better product , the market will price the product correctly , and the buyer will buy it at a price that maximizes everyone ’s interest — the market is simply where the buyer and seller come together .
But once you introduce framing , you can argue that the buyer may no longer be acting entirely in his own self - interest if the seller has invented a frame for the buyer , skewing the choice in favor of the seller .
“ Then , the model of the market is not simply buyers and sellers coming together for mutually beneficial exchange , ” Wanner continues .
“ Instead , the exchange between buyers and sellers has aspects of a zero - sum game .
The seller can do even better if he sells you something you do n’t need , or gets you to buy more than you need , and pay a higher price for it . ”
The classical welfare theorem of Vilfredo Pareto was that markets will make everyone as well off as they can be , that the market distribution will be an efficient distribution that maximizes welfare .
“ But once you introduce framing , all bets are off , ” Wanner says .
A zero -sum game between buyer and seller clearly does not maximize everyone ’s welfare , and hence suggests a different model of the marketplace .
There are many political implications .
We have had 30 years of deregulation in the United States , freeing up markets to work their magic .
“ Is that generally welfare - enhancing , or not ? ” Wanner asks .
“ Framing can call that into question .
Everyone agrees that there ’s informational asymmetry — so we have laws that ensure drugs are tested , and truth - in - advertising laws .
Still , there are subtle things about framing choices that are deceptive , though not inaccurate .
We have the power of markets , but they are places where naive participants lose money .
How do we manage markets so that the framing problem can be acknowledged and controlled ?
It ’s an essential question in a time of rising inequality , when the well - educated are doing better and the poorly educated doing worse . ”
It ’s a question that behavioral economics raises , and , with luck , may also be able to address .
The eclipse of hyper-rational Economic Man opens the way for a richer and more realistic model of the human being in the marketplace , where the brain , with all its ancient instincts and vulnerabilities , can be both predator and prey .

Once thought to be operating well under the radar , recent months have seen fresh efforts to silence sites that provide fan - created translations of movies and TV shows for their home countries .
The latest targets for shutdown - Israel and France .
With the assistance of ALIS ( Israel ’s answer to the MPAA ) , in late 2007 raids were conducted on the homes of the admins of three sites known as ‘ xvoom ’ , ‘ MYakuza ’ and ‘ Donkey ‘ which carried Hebrew subtitles for US movies .
ALIS reached private agreements with the admins of ‘ xvoom ’ and ‘ MYakuza ’ , under which the sites would be closed and compensation paid .
“ The feeling is very difficult .
A website that I have put 2.5 years of work into was closed ” , said the owner of ‘ mYakuza ’ , who did n’t hire a legal team .
“ Links to illegal films were never available on the website but I preferred not to destroy my life and decided to shut it down completely .
They have more lawyers and money .
We came out lucky . ”
Effi Teva , the admin of ‘ Donkey ’ was n’t included in the settlement and legal procedures against him have begun .
Last Wednesday , the district court in Haifa , Israel , ordered the permanent closure of the movie and TV subtitling sites donkey .
co.il and sratim.co.il .
The court decided that the sites infringed copyrights by offering links to unauthorized subtitles and Judge Gideon Ginat ruled that the defendant , Effi Teva , should pay compensation of 160,000 shekels to ALIS and various filmmakers , which includes the lawyers ’ fee of 60,000 shekels .
Effi
Teva did n’t give any testimony .
The previous hearing in the case took place in 2007 , but Teva did n’t show up then either , instead asking the plaintiff ’s lawyer to request an extension .
Judge Ginat says that Teva requested postponements numerous times .
“ I want to make it clear ” , said the judge , “ that I said in the last meeting to those present that I wo n’t be able to keep postponing the dates of the hearing . ”
Judge Ginat criticized the behavior of the defendant and his lawyer and said , “ It goes without saying that the defendant and his proxy cannot dictate the hearing date in a last minute phone call . ”
Lawyer Sarah Prazanti , who represents movie anti-piracy outfit ALIS said that the judge refused to accept the request to postponed the hearing , and gave the verdict .
Effi Teva did not comment on the matter .
In France this week , Warner has been taking action of its own against subtitling sites .
It says that such sites “ make intellectual property available to the public without authorization , ” such as foreign translations of Warner productions .
“ This , ” says Warner in threats to various subtitling sites , “ will affect your liability and exposes you to possible civil lawsuits . ”
One site under threat is ‘ Frigorifix ’ , which appears to be taking the threat seriously .
“ Never , until now have we had threats from rights holders that are as real and immediate as the ones we received yesterday . ”
“ Our names and addresses are listed with our registrar and web host , ” said a representative of the site , “ and we can not afford to undergo a judicial process . ”
It is believed that members of the site will continue to translate , but no subtitles will be available from the site itself .
Earlier this month we reported on the problems faced by Brazilian sub - site Legendas.tv after anti-piracy action , but it quickly bounced back .

India ’s gold demand surged by 84 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008 on investors ’ confidence in the yellow metal as a safe haven .
According to data collated by Gold Fields Mineral Services , an independent consultancy , for the World Gold Council ( WGC ) , India ’s gold demand shot up to 147.2 tonnes in the fourth quarter in 2008 from 80 tonnes in the comparable quarter in the previous year .
While demand from the jewellery sector rose 107 per cent to 102.1 tonnes , investment demand jumped 47 per cent to 45.1 tonnes , a WGC release said .
The report assumes significance amid analyst estimates that demand for the yellow metal will fall in the country , following record high prices .
Indian retail consumers invested an all - time high amount of Rs 88,056 crore in gold in 2008 as compared to Rs 71,761 crore in 2007 , an increase of 22.7 per cent .
Of the total value in gold , jewellery constituted 71 per cent while investment comprised 29 per cent , especially products such as gold bars and coins .
In 2008 , gold outperformed most asset classes and provided a 32 per cent return on investment in rupee terms .
The compounded annualised returns given by gold in the last five years ending 2008 have been recorded at 19.54 per cent ( 13.63 per cent in 10 - year figure ) .
Gold prices have appreciated by 10.1 per cent , which works out to an annualised return of 81 per cent , in 2009 so far .
Gold exchange - traded fund ( ETF ) has offered 25 per cent returns while debt accrued 11 per cent .
Equity and Sensex have offered negative returns of 49 per cent each .
WGC attributes the rise in demand to some national - level initiatives taken to maintain investor confidence .
For instance , a first - of - its - kind initiative was introduced — retailing of gold coins through post offices in 108 places as a pilot study .
It has been now extended to 250 outlets and is expected to expand more in the next 2 years .
The yellow metal was also sold through special initiatives such as the National Lucky Lakshmi Jewellery Shopping Festival , which covered 1,400 jewellers across India .
Sustained investor interest in gold in 2008 against the backdrop of fall in global stocks as well as other asset classes , helped push dollar demand for the safe haven asset to $ 102 billion , a 29 per cent increase on year .
According to the WGC report , identifiable gold demand in tonnes rose 4 per cent to 3,569 tonnes .
( CNN ) --
An unexpected and sudden spotlight on the Special Olympics , an organization that for more than 40 years has served and honored those with intellectual disabilities , comes less than two weeks before the nonprofit launches a new campaign : Spread the Word to the End the Word .
Special Olympics is running a campaign to stop the use of the " R- word . "
March 31 is being billed a " national day of awareness , " a call to Americans to recognize and rethink their use of the word " retard , " or as the organization would prefer , the " R- word . "
" Most people do n't think of this word as hate speech , but that 's exactly what it feels like to millions of people with intellectual disabilities , their families and friends , " a statement about the campaign reads .
" This word is just as cruel and offensive as any other slur . "
The push for increased respect is being spearheaded by young people who are collecting pledges or vows to not use the word at http://www.r-word.org/, and are leading online discussions on how people can get involved in this cause .
So far , across the country , 300 schools have already committed to hosting rallies on March 31 , Special Olympics President and CEO J. Brady Lum said .
Obama 's late - night gaffe The Chairman of the Special Olympics responds to Obama 's controversial joke on CNN's " Larry King . "
Tonight , 9 ET see full schedule »
An aggressive print and online campaign , targeting people ages 18 to 30 , will follow , said Kirsten Suto Seckler , who directs the organization 's global brand marketing and awareness .
The ads designed by BBDO New York , will challenge the public -- with language meant to raise eyebrows -- to think about the issue more deeply .
The campaign uses slurs against Asians , homosexuals , Jews and African - Americans to make the point that language can be harmful to all groups , including people with intellectual disabilities .
Attention on the Special Olympics skyrocketed Thursday when , in a quick and clearly unscripted moment , President Obama exhibited the power of words during his history - making visit with Jay Leno .
Watch Suzanne Malveaux 's look at Obama 's Tonight Show appearance »
While joking on The Tonight Show about his bowling prowess ( during last year 's campaign trail he shamefully scored 37 in a game ) , Obama said he'd been practicing at the White House .
He told Leno that he bowled 129 in the White House bowling alley and said his bowling skills are " like Special Olympics or something . "
The comment during the taping of the show prompted Obama to pick up the phone on Air Force One and call Special Olympics Chairman Timothy Shriver to preemptively apologize for the remark before it hit television screens .
He also reportedly invited Special Olympic athletes to Pennsylvania Avenue to hit the lanes and give him tips or shoot some hoops .
The president " expressed his heartfelt and sincere commitment to work with our athletes and make this country a more accepting place for people with special needs , " Lum , the organization 's president , said .
What Obama said on The Tonight Show adds to the discussion that 's needed to raise awareness and has proven " an incredibly important and seriously teachable moment , " Lum said .
From playgrounds to the " top rungs of our leadership , including our president , " he said Americans have plenty to talk about and learn when it comes to stereotypes and how words can sting .

The Columbus , Ohio suburb of Whitehall is awash in controversy over a proposal to designate February as “ Science Month . ”
According to the Columbus Dispatch , Councilwoman Jacquelyn Thompson originally proposed that the city declare February 12 to be “ Darwin Day ” in Whitehall .
This February 12 marks the 200th anniversary of Darwin ’s birth .
( 2009 is also special in marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin ’s On the Origin of Species .)
After other council members raised the inevitable objections , Thompson modified her proposal to declare February as " Science Month " in honor of both Darwin and Galileo , whose birthday falls on February 15 .
Yet even this modified and modest proposal has divided the council , which is scheduled to vote on a final resolution sometime in February .
What could be wrong with a bland recognition of the value of science and open inquiry ?
Other council members have trotted out every conceivable objection , apparently without regard to credibility .
Councilman Jim Graham reportedly charges that it would be unfair “ to the hundreds if not thousands of other scientists to not name them ” in addition to science giants Darwin and Galileo .
Others object that the proposed declaration would conflict with other February designations , including Black History Month .
One exchange between councilwoman Thompson and her detractors , as reported by the Columbus Dispatch , is both illuminating and depressing :
" The whole idea of this was to recognize the events , " [ Thompson ] said at a council meeting yesterday .
" I thought it was a great opportunity to show that we value science , we value inquiry and we encourage our students to open up to the world . "
A few council members replied with shouts of " Not my children ! "
Of course the unspoken controversy is evolution versus creationism .
The Whitehall controversy appears to have captivated the attention of creationists across the U.S. Ray Comfort , the southern California evangelical TV host and proponent of creationism ’s famed and cunning Banana Argument , charges that the Whitehall city council is “ trying to deitize [ sic ] Darwin . "
He characterizes the proposed declaration as a celebration of “ atheist Christmas . ”

Snoop Dogg would not say when he had joined Nation of Islam Snoop Dogg has revealed he has joined the Nation of Islam after appearing at the religious group 's annual Saviours '
Day event in Chicago .
The rapper , who described himself as the " leader of the hip - hop community " , told followers he would share what he learned with other musicians .
He told reporters that he joined the group because he was " doing what 's right and representing what 's right " .
It preaches self - reliance for black people within an Islamic framework .
At Sunday 's event , the rapper sat on stage while Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan gave a speech .
I live how I 'm supposed to live as far as doing what 's right and representing what 's right - that 's why I was here today
Snoop Dogg
He said afterwards that listening to the speech from Mr Farrakhan was " about a mirror - it 's about looking at yourself " .
He added : " We 're doing a lot of wrongs among ourselves that need correcting . "
When asked if he had joined the movement he said : " I 'm already in the Nation , that 's why I 'm here .
" I 'm an advocate for peace , I 've been in the peace movement ever since I 've been making music .
" My whole thing is not about really trying to push my thing on you .
" It 's just about the way I live , and I live how I 'm supposed to live as far as doing what 's right and representing what 's right - that 's why I was here today . "
He would not say when he had joined the Nation of Islam .
Other rappers previously involved with the movement include NWA star - turned - actor Ice Cube .

The UK ’s decline under illiberal socialist governance continues with the news that the UK is set to ban all drawn imagery of an erotic nature where the “ impression ” is that a participant or onlooker is a child , or rather is “ under 18 ” .
The ban officially brands such imagery “ disgusting ” .
The laws in question , coming as part of the Coroners and Justice Bill , which looks set to come into effect without difficulty , set out a complete ban on possession of drawn pornography featuring underage participants , images where “ the impression conveyed … is that the person shown is a child . ”
In this case child is simply defined as anyone under 18 years of age .
UK law already bans “ pseudo - photographs ” of underage sex , referring to images which have been Photoshopped or rendered with a computer ; this new law is presented as “ closing a loophole ” as a result .
One of the major proponents of the bill even went so far as to suggest that prosecutions should be made for simple doodles :
“ Let us assume that for the purpose of this argument he and I were separately doodling the sorts of images described in the measure and that once we finished we tore them up , threw them away , and showed them to nobody .
Would he expect that that doodling should lead us to be prosecuted under the clause ? ”
George Howarth :
“ [ If ] somebody retrieves it , and then it is discovered that it is grossly offensive , disgusting or of an otherwise obscene character — an image that could be of such a nature that it would be solely or principally used for the purpose of sexual arousal — what he had engaged in would be improper and should not be approved of or sanctioned by the law . ”
An MP raises doubts over the complete lack of evidence underlying the bill , and the lack of any victims , but is told that “ all children ” are victims of the drawings :
“ I am a little concerned that we are legislating without any evidence , because the risk to children could increase .
If the evidence showed that having images that were not photographic acted as a release , and therefore reduced the risk of harm to children , legislating could increase the risk of harm .
That is why I am concerned that we are legislating without sufficient evidence . ”
George Howarth :
“ If the image in question is grossly offensive , disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character but does not have a child as a victim , is it not arguable that , by extension , all children are victims of that image ? ”
A victimless crime where all children are victims ?
You heard it in parliament .
No evidence of any kind is presented in support of the law or claims of the legislators .
The opposition to the bill is muted , with only amendments to change the wording of the law to cover only “ publishing by any means whatsoever to another ” , instead of the current blanket ban on possession proposed .
Freedom of expression is not given any consideration .
The issue of how to tell the age of a character illustrated is hardly considered by the proponents either ; in practice this will be left up to police , courts and juries to decide , with predictable results .
Most people would likely be unable to reliably discriminate between 18 - year - olds and 17 - year - olds , and in fact it is legal to have sex with 16 - year - olds in the UK .
An opposing MP considers the matter of age , even making specific reference to manga ( although not knowing the proper word ) :
“ Clearly , when we have a photograph of an actual person it is much easier to determine someone ’s age .
We can work out how old they were when the photograph was taken .
When it is an imaginary figure that is drawn , a number of concerns have been raised — including in some of the responses to the consultation — that Japanese art forms in particular are often ambiguous , so it is difficult to decide how old the figure is .
My amendment proposes to delete the entire subsection .
I know the thinking behind it is obvious , but I am not sure how it can be properly implemented without pulling into it all manner of things that probably should not be illegal .
For example , images of an 18 - year - old who is dressed as a child , such as Britney Spears in a pop video , clearly is not illegal .
If it was a drawing , however , it could be illegal because it would be very difficult to work out whether the person in the picture was supposed to be over 18 or under 18 and dressed up as a school girl . ”
Bizarrely , the minister ( Maria Eagle ) in response starts rambling about how such images could be used for “ grooming ” a child :
“ One of our major concerns is that the images could be used for grooming a child in preparation for actual abuse .
Amendment 489 would remove images such as cartoons or drawings from the scope of the offence .
We believe that that is an unacceptable limitation .
Children see cartoon images regularly in day - to - day life .
They are a well - accepted form of entertainment for children , and the characters are often well known .
An offender could easily exploit that familiarity , using explicit images created in such formats , and such graphic cartoon images could be a powerful grooming tool .
Reducing the scope of the offences described in amendment 489 by the hon .
Member for Cardiff , Central could leave explicit cartoon images in circulation and open to serious misuse , and without the provision the police would be unable to remove them from people ’s possession .
The amendment would create a loophole in the law and in the new offence , which would be exploited . ”
She then starts rambling about the need to make illegal disgusting nekomimi shoujo :
“ [ The amendment proposed ] provides that an image of a person should be treated as an image of a child if : ‘ the predominant impression conveyed is that the person shown is a child despite the fact that some of the physical characteristics shown are not those of a child . ’
I appreciate that that last point may sound unusual , but it is important to cover circumstance in which a person may try to avoid prosecution by amending the image of a child slightly — for example , by adding antennae or animal ears , and then suggesting that the subsequent image is not a child .
That is a real concern .
The people who seek to exploit the provisions and to continue to create what they call legal child pornography on the internet will use every loophole to try to escape the offence .
It has been carefully structured and amendment 491 could create another loophole that would render ineffective the offence that we are seeking to create .
We structured the provision carefully to capture only the images that cause concern . ”
When finally pinned down as to how to determine the age of a fictional character , she is determined that no “ reasonable person ” have the opportunity to judge whether an image is of a child and illegal , only police and courts :
“ [ The amendment ] would add a reasonable person test so that an image would be treated as one of a child if a reasonable person would consider the impression conveyed by the image of the person shown to be that of a child .
We believe that that test is unnecessary and unhelpful … ”
The same spate of legislation also contains a variety of unrelated laws , including a ban , including criminal penalties for manslaughter , on providing information which “ encourages or assists ” suicide …
You can read what else the wise legislators have to say in the official transcripts of their debate .
This comes hot on the heels of the ban on fetish porn the UK recently passed into law , leaving no doubt as to the fact that UK now harbours one of the most illiberal and oppressively moralistic governments found in the developed world , with the ruling Labour Party consistly having shown no interest whatsoever in preserving essential liberties .
Controversy in the US , or the judicial ban in Australia clearly have nothing on the dedication with which UK legislators seek to stamp out sexual deviance ….

Professional Treasure Hunter Gregg Stemm ' Secrecy Is Key in Our Business '
The underwater archaeology company Odyssey Marine Exploration recently found the British warship HMS Victory on the floor of the English Channel .
SPIEGEL ONLINE spoke with company founder Gregg Stemm about gold coins , recalcitrant governments and secrecy .
The economic crisis is a turning point in the life of this country .
For a brief period , history is in the public realm and ours for the making .
But for Labour this is a crucial time .
The pro-market values that have dominated much government thinking are being discredited .
There are fundamental questions to ask about what the party might now become .
The recession has dealt a mortal blow to the neoliberal hegemony .
It was the sale of council housing that helped to secure its popular support .
In the name of a property owning democracy , the modest economic interests of individuals were integrated into the profit - seeking of financialised capitalism .
A similar integration of the business elite and shareholder value created a tiny super rich elite – and became the unquestioned business model of the era .
These compacts between the individual and the market cemented the social order .
They were based on rising wealth and the values of individualism and self reliance .
They legitimised market - based welfare and pension reform , the drive to a flexible labour market and the transfer of risk from the state and business to the individual .
New Labour entered government in 1997 having accommodated itself to this new orthodoxy and with plans to deepen and extend these compacts .
Growth in the UK economy depended on them .
It was driven by consumerism , and sustained by the hard selling of cheap credit .
The housing market turned homes into assets for leveraging ever - increasing levels of borrowing .
The financial services industries created an indentured form of consumption as it laid claim to great tranches of future earnings .
Millions were entangled in the capital markets as their personal and mortgage - backed debt became the economic raw material for global capital .
This commodification of society engineered a massive transfer of wealth to the rich .
The neo-liberal model of capitalism generated unprecedented affluence for many .
But it corroded the civic culture of democracy .
Commodification and huge inequalities helped create a social recession with widespread mental illness , systemic levels of loneliness , growing numbers of psychologically damaged children , and an increase in eating disorders , obesity , drug addiction and alcoholism .
It created monopoly forms of capitalism and an increasingly authoritarian , technocratic and centralising state .
A ruling class of diverse elites accrued a dangerous amount of power and became a financial law unto itself .
The gulf between the political elites and the population widened as economic restructuring destroyed traditional working class cultures and communities .
While asset prices rose and the economy boomed these problems were evaded by the government .
But the recession has torn away the veil .
Britain fell into a recession with personal debt standing at £ 1.4 trillion , of which £ 231bn was unsecured .
Economic insecurity threatens millions and it has weakened Britain ’s capacity to weather the economic storm .
The partial dismantling of the welfare state , and employment de-regulation has removed many of the economic stabilisers that act as buffers to deflationary pressure – secure jobs , decent wages and proper benefits .
This lack of structural solidity is made more severe by government neglect of manufacturing industry in favour of finance .
The declining share of manufacturing in GDP , and the relocation of industries to low wage economies , has reduced the security and income base of the working class .
Loss of trust is not confined to the markets .
The recession has destroyed the compact between the market and the individual and the government has no social alternative to replace it with .
The destruction of working class cultures threatens the existence of the Labour Party as the institutions which once supported it disappear or lose their social vitality .
The current panic about rioting in the lead up to the G20 summit is a symptom of the breakdown in political representation .
The youthful cultures of cosmopolitan modernity , like the conservative cultures of mainstream working class life have no political organisation to give voice to their hopes and fears .
For many Labour is seen as a party of war , injustice and insecurity .
Our new ebook The Crash - a view from the left is an attempt to raise some of these issues for debate .
It is a call for radical change in the spirit of what G.D.H.
Cole called a ‘ sensible extremism ’ .
We have to remake democracy and rediscover our capacity for collective change .
We need a new socialism not dictated by the few from above , but made by the many from below .
The task is not to win the political centre ground – it is gridlocked and dead – but to transform it and embark on the deep and long transformation that will bring about the good society .
It is this ideal of a good society that offers hope .
The political struggle to create it will be the great challenge of our time , and it will shape the lives of generations to come .

A Tiny Computer .
An unpublished memo by Chuck Thacker , Microsoft Research , 3 September 2007 .
Posted with permission .
Alan Kay recently posed the following problem :
" I 'd like to show JHS and HS kids ' the simplest non-tricky architecture ' in which simple gates and flipflops manifest a programmable computerâ€ .
Alan posed a couple of other desiderata , primarily that the computer needs to demonstrate fundamental principles , but should be capable of running real programs produced by a compiler .
This introduces some tension into the design , since simplicity and performance sometimes are in conflict .
This sounded like an interesting challenge , and I have a proposed design .
Dr Izeldeen Abuelaish shared his grief at losing his daughters
An Israeli probe into the death of the three daughters of a Gaza doctor in the recent offensive there has concluded they were killed by Israeli fire .
The army said troops had fired shells at suspicious figures in Dr Izzeldeen Abuelaish 's house , believing they were observers directing sniper fire .
The Israeli - trained doctor is a fluent Hebrew speaker .
His loss became known across Israel when the grieving doctor phoned a TV station to describe what had happened .
The shelling of his house in Gaza occurred on 16 January , as Israel was engaged in operations against Hamas .
Three of the physician 's daughters - aged 13 to 20 - and a 17 - year - old niece died in the incident .
' Path of light '
The Israeli military released the conclusions of its investigation on Wednesday .
We all make mistakes , and we do n't repeat them

Gaza doctor 's loss grips Israelis Bowen diary : Hitting home
It extended its condolences over the shelling , but insisted that troops had operated within reason , given the heavy fighting in the region .
The army also said residents had been urged to leave the area before the attack , and that the doctor had been personally asked by phone to evacuate his family .
At the time of the bombing , Dr Abuelaish , 55 , denied that any militants had been hiding in or firing from his house .
He responded to the inquiry by thanking those who carried it out , telling Israeli TV : " We all make mistakes , and we do n't repeat them " .
The father - of - eight added : " I have two options - the path of darkness or the path of light .
The path of darkness is like choosing all the complications with diseases and depression , but the path of light is to focus on the future and my children . "

From the former Soviet Union , markets in burnt out light bulbs :
For most of us , it is hard to fathom the rationale for a market in burnt - out light bulbs .
But in the scarcity - driven Soviet economy , the market was entirely reasonable .
Light bulbs were rarely available to individual consumers , but were obtainable for state - sponsored activities .
Thus , it would be difficult to purchase a light bulb for a new lamp in one 's home , while burnt - out bulbs in state - run offices or factories were routinely replaced .
So if someone purchased a new lamp and needed a bulb , he would buy a used light bulb for a small fee and replace a functioning bulb at work with the dud .
He would then take the functioning bulb home for the new lamp , while the burnt - out bulb at the office / factory would be replaced with a new functioning bulb .
Meanwhile , the maintenance person at the office / factory would take the used bulb and sell it on the used light bulb market .

March 20 , 2009 | “ President Barack Obama ’s budget would produce $ 9.3 trillion in deficits over the next decade , more than four times the deficits of Republican George W. Bush ’s presidency , congressional auditors said Friday , ” reports the Associated Press .
“ The new Congressional Budget Office figures offered a far more dire outlook for Obama ’s budget than the new administration predicted just last month — a deficit $ 2.3 trillion worse .
It ’s a prospect even the president ’s own budget director called unsustainable . ”
Certainly unsustainable for the chattel , debt slaves on the hook to the international bankers who will clean up big time on this obvious ( or should be obvious ) scam .
“ In his White House run , Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor , but the eye - popping deficit numbers threaten to swamp his ambitious agenda of overhauling health care , exploring new energy sources and enacting scores of domestic programs . ”
It ’s disgusting the corporate media keeps feeding us this line of bullshit and we keep supping it up — all this blame heaped on Obama ’s addled predecessor , who had a difficult time eating pretzels and riding bicycles without accident .
It is a manufactured given that we need health care , new energy sources ( in response to an equally manufactured climate change crisis ) and domestic programs that government has no business creating .
In 1945 , Harry Truman said we needed a new health care system .
Did we get one ?
Of course not .
Give ’em Hell Harry gave us the National Security State instead .
George Bush ’s task was to double the national debt and now it is Obama ’s turn to quadruple it .
“ In 1910 the U. S. Federal debt was only $ 1 billion , or $ 12.40 per citizen .
State and local debts were practically non-existent , ” writes Pastor Sheldon Emry .
“ By 1920 , after only six years of Federal Reserve shenanigans , the Federal debt had jumped to $ 24 billion , or $ 228 per person .
In 1960 the Federal debt reached $ 284 billion , or $ 1,575 per citizen and state and local debts were mushrooming .
In 1998 the Federal debt passed $ 5.5 trillion , or $ 20,403.90 per man , woman and child and is growing exponentially . ”
Now the national debt is more than a $ 11 trillion .
It ’s interesting if nauseating to watch the liberal side of the contrived right - left paradigm rant and rave about the Bush dictatorship .
Bush merely set the stage for Obama who has himself a mighty rolling tool chest of extrajudicial repression just in case he needs it .
He ’s going to need it when people begin going in the streets to protest against engineered inflation and the punitive taxation coming down the pike .

HANOVER ( Reuters ) - Microsoft MSFT.O may create up to 3,000 jobs as it raises investment in research and development by $ 1 billion this year , its chief operating officer said on Tuesday .
“ Realignment of the company will help us reassign people and could allow us to create some 2,000 to 3,000 new jobs , ” Kevin Turner said at CeBit , Europe ’s biggest technology trade fair .
Turner said while Microsoft was eliminating jobs in some areas , new opportunities would arise at the same time .
He reiterated that Microsoft , under pressure to trim costs amid a global recession , would stick to its research budget this year .
“ We will invest a record $ 9 billion in R&D ... spend a billion more than last year , ” Turner said , adding Internet - based applications -- so called cloud computing -- would be a major field for Microsoft ’s investment .
The current macroeconomic climate was the most challenging most people had ever seen in their lifetime , Turner said .
“ We believe while this may be a once in a lifetime event it may also be a once in a lifetime opportunity to create new business models , ” Turner said .
Red Cross confirms Bush administration , CIA used torture in interrogations
By Patrick Martin
7 August 2007
A confidential report by the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) suggests that Bush administration officials may have committed war crimes in the operation of CIA “ secret prisons ” overseas , according to a lengthy analysis published on the web site of the New Yorker magazine Sunday .
The Red Cross report concluded that the methods used in the CIA interrogation of alleged 9/11 terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other Al Qaeda prisoners were “ tantamount to torture ” and that Bush administration officials had likely committed “ grave breaches ” of the Geneva Conventions .
The article by Jane Mayer , entitled “ The Black Sites , ” is the product of a series of interviews with former CIA officers involved in operating the agency ’s secret prisons overseas , agents who directly participated in torture sessions and apparently concluded that the methods they were employing were either immoral or counterproductive , or both .
The New Yorker has become one of the principal conduits for dissent within the military / intelligence apparatus directed against the policies of the Bush White House .
Mayer ’s colleague , Seymour Hersh , wrote the first extensive report on the abuse of prisoners at the US military prison at Abu Ghraib , near Baghdad , as well as a series of exposés about US preparations for a military strike against Iran .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured by Pakistani authorities in early 2003 , just before the US invasion of Iraq , and held at secret CIA locations for nearly four years before his transfer to Guantánamo Bay .
Last March , the Pentagon made public his “ confession ” to carrying out or planning no less than 31 separate terrorist atrocities , a statement widely hailed in official circles as proof that torture — or , in Washington - speak , “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” — was an effective and legitimate practice in the “ war on terror . ”
At the time , the World Socialist Web Site noted the dubious character of Mohammed ’s self - incriminating statements , in which he claimed responsibility for an improbable number of spectacular plots , including purported plans to destroy the Sears Tower , the Empire State Building and London ’s Big Ben , and to assassinate former US President Jimmy Carter and Pope John Paul II .
( See : “ Washington exploits Guantánamo ‘ confession ’ to justify its crimes ” )
No politically literate observer doubted that Mohammed had been severely tortured , and many said so , among them journalist Nat Hentoff ( “ Was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed tortured ? ” ) and Professor Anthony D’Amato of Northwestern University School of Law ( “ True Confessions : The Amazing Tale of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ” ) , who compared the 26 - page “ confession ” to the self - indictments by prisoners in the Stalinist purge trials of the 1930s .
Mayer ’s article confirms , in fact , that the CIA actually employed torture techniques first developed by the Soviet KGB and copied by US intelligence agencies during the Cold War .
The International Committee of the Red Cross was given access to Mohammed late last year , after his transfer to Guantánamo Bay .
The policy of the ICRC is to discuss its findings only with the government holding prisoners in custody , not with the press , in order to insure its continued access to prisoners .
But , according to Mayer , the ICRC report on the 15 detainees held in the CIA ’s secret prisons was circulated through the very highest levels of the White House , State Department and National Security Council , and to some congressmen on the House and Senate committees that oversee the intelligence agencies .
Mayer cited “ congressional and other Washington sources familiar with the report , ” writing that “ one of the sources said that the Red Cross described the agency ’s detention and interrogation methods as tantamount to torture , and declared that American officials responsible for the abusive treatment could have committed serious crimes .
The source said the report warned that these officials may have committed ‘ grave breaches ’ of the Geneva Conventions , and may have violated the US Torture Act . ”
Mayer adds ,
“ The conclusions of the Red Cross , which is known for its credibility and caution , could have potentially devastating legal ramifications . ”
In other words , those US government officials who authorized and carried out the torture of CIA prisoners could face war crimes charges before either an American or international tribunal , as could those who subsequently became aware of what was taking place in the secret prisons and covered it up .
According to Mayer ’s article , the CIA use of torture was not a “ rogue ” operation , but a massive bureaucratic enterprise involving systematic research and development to find the “ best ” methods for breaking down prisoners .
CIA officials reviewed the techniques employed by the Phoenix Program during the Vietnam War as a model for the “ war on terror . ”
The Phoenix Program involved the systematic assassination of an estimated 20,000 cadres , supporters and sympathizers of the National Liberation Front , as well as the widespread torture of prisoners .
The agency also sought interrogation advice from the secret police of Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia , all of which practice barbaric methods of torture against political prisoners .
And one former military interrogator described the techniques of exerting total control over a prisoner ’s environment as “ the KGB model , ” developed during the purges against political dissidents in the former Soviet Union , and subsequently mimicked by the CIA .
Among the techniques used on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed were prolonged sensory deprivation , continuous shackling while naked , use of a dog leash and female interrogators , forcible slamming into the walls of his cell , suspension from the ceiling of the interrogation room by his arms , and the now - notorious practice of waterboarding , the simulated drowning technique employed as torture since medieval times ( when it became known as the “ Chinese water torture . ” )
One interrogation expert told Mayer , referring to the victims of the torture sessions : “ People were utterly dehumanized .
People fell apart .
It was the intentional and systematic infliction of great suffering masquerading as a legal process .
It is just chilling . ”
The torture was so severe and systematic that it had a profound psychological effect on some of the torturers themselves , according to Mayer , who interviewed one of those who interrogated Mohammed .
This interrogator described a fellow torturer who now “ has horrible nightmares ...
It really haunts him .
You are inflicting something really evil and horrible on somebody . ”
CIA officials repeatedly voiced concerns that the orders they were receiving from the White House , and particularly from Vice President Dick Cheney , might leave them vulnerable to criminal prosecution , particularly since they were instructed to keep prisoners like Mohammed alive and thereby preserve them as witnesses to their own abuse .
As one official told Mayer , in a particularly chilling passage , “ It would have been better if we had executed them . ”
A former CIA official told Mayer that many agents had taken out liability insurance to help cover the anticipated legal bills when they face prosecution for prisoner abuse .
There is a “ high level of anxiety about political retribution , ” he said , and “ several guys expect to be thrown under the bus , ” serving as fall guys for the decision - makers at the highest levels , including Bush , Cheney , former CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who , as White House counsel , supervised the process of giving a legal stamp of approval to torture .
Several leading congressional Democrats are well aware of the ICRC report , which was circulated to leaders of the Senate and House Intelligence committees , chaired by Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Congressman Sylvestre Reyes of Texas .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid were likely “ in the loop ” as well .
This fact underscores the complicity of the congressional Democratic leadership , who only two days ago pushed through legislation that greatly expanded the domestic spying powers of an administration which they knew had been branded by the International Committee of the Red Cross as a serial perpetrator of war crimes .
Despite the sensational character of Mayer ’s revelations , there has been relatively little comment on the subject in the American media .
The Washington Post , in an article Sunday previewing the New Yorker account , confirmed the existence of the Red Cross report and its circulation at the highest levels in the US capital .
It cited “ sources familiar with the document ” as confirming that the detainees interviewed by the ICRC gave similar accounts of their torture even though they were held in isolation from each other and could not coordinate their stories .
This reinforces the credibility of their testimony — as does the exporting of these methods from the CIA secret prisons and the Guantánamo Bay concentration camp to the US military prison in Abu Ghraib , Iraq , where digital photographs made public in 2004 caused worldwide revulsion at US torture methods .
Paramilitary agents for the CIA 's super - secret Special Activities Division , or SAD , perform raids , ambushes , abductions and other difficult chores overseas , including infiltrating countries to " light up " targets from the ground for air - to - ground missile strikes .
This week the government acknowledged for the first time that some of SAD 's sensitive air operations were swept up in a fraud conspiracy that reached the highest levels of the CIA and cost the government $ 40 million .
That information was contained in a series of courtfilings released in advance of the long - awaited sentencing of Kyle Dustin " Dusty " Foggo , the disgraced former No. 3 official at the CIA .
One remarkable affidavit came from a leader of SAD , a branch of the CIA 's National Clandestine Service , which handles covert actions .
It indicates that Foggo forced SAD to use a shell company set up by defense contractor Brent R. Wilkes to handle its sensitive air operations , even though Wilkes and his company had no experience in clandestine aviation operations .
Wilkes was Foggo 's boyhood friend and a co-conspirator in the bribery scandal that erupted around former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham , who is serving more than eight years in federal prison .
Since the 9/11 terror strikes , SAD 's role in the war on terror has become more prominent .
Its paramilitary operatives have been used to snatch high - value suspects from the streets of foreign countries for rendition to black sites for interrogation .
When carrying out their operations in other countries , the agents typically do not wear uniforms or carry items that connect them to the U.S. government .
If they are caught , the government may disavow any connection to them .
Foggo 's sentencing , scheduled Thursday before Judge James C. Cacheris in U.S. District Court in Alexandria , Va. , will be the final sentencing of the ring of co-defendants in the bribery scandal that erupted around Cunningham .
Foggo , 53 , was running the CIA on a day - to - day basis until he resigned in 2006 after his name surfaced in the scandal .
At first , Foggo sought to have the charges against him dismissed .
When that failed , he argued that he would need to disclose classified information to defend himself .
This practice , sometimes referred to as graymail , was rejected by the court , but led prosecutors to drop 27 of the 28 charges against him .
In September , Foggo pleaded guilty to a single count of defrauding the government of his " honest services " by steering contracts to Wilkes .
While Cacheris could sentence Foggo to up to 20 years in prison , the plea agreement calls for 37 months behind bars .
Foggo is seeking an even more lenient sentence from the judge .
In the days leading up to the sentencing , prosecutors have sought the release of transcripts from grand jury proceedings that they believe will be helpful in opposing a reduced sentence .
The flurry of motions and counter - motions resulted in the release of a trove of documents Monday , including the affidavit from one of SAD 's leaders .
In the affidavit , in which he is identified as " John Doe # 1 , " the official says Foggo introduced Wilkes to him and other SAD officials as " someone who had an extensive corporate portfolio that included experience in aviation , and for that reason could assist SAD .
Mr. Foggo then left Wilkes with us to discuss our need for cover for our air operations . "
Within days , Wilkes provided the group with a $ 132 million proposal that John Doe # 1 described as " unwieldy , cumbersome , and lacking a real understanding of what the Agency needed ... If implemented as presented , I believed the proposals would be wasteful , misguided , and contrived . "
Nonetheless , Foggo ordered them to proceed quickly .
" The rapid decision by Mr. Foggo and the urgent deadlines he imposed on the program meant that we necessarily had to use Mr. Wilkes for the Enhanced Capability , because he was the only option available to us at the time , " the official testified .
Despite misgivings about the directive coming from Foggo , " we saluted and carried out his orders . "
The plan was derailed in August 2005 after Wilkes ' and Foggo 's roles in the Cunningham scandal surfaced , but not before it had cost the government $ 40 million in planning expenses , according to the documents .
" Upon being apprised of this , I was greatly relieved that we would not have to proceed with the cover solution with Wilkes , and would have more time to explore the best possible solution , " John Doe # 1 wrote .
The documents also argue that Wilkes and Foggo tried to incorporate the military 's need for armored vehicles into an array of contracts that involved not only the CIA 's sensitive air operations but also water for troops in Iraq .
Wilkes ' and Foggo 's deals -- during which they hid their long , personal friendship from other government officials -- included markups of up to 60 percent on the goods and services they sold the CIA .
The documents released Monday provide extensive details about Foggo 's efforts to move his mistress from Europe to Langley when he was promoted in November 2004 from chief of support at an undisclosed European location to the agency 's No. 3 post , executive director .
According to prosecutors and testimony included in the filing , Foggo arranged for his family to remain in Europe at taxpayer expense while he moved to Langley .
He then arranged a CIA job for his mistress , identified only by the initials ER .
At first the CIA ruled that ER was ineligible for employment because a background check found that she had an improper relationship with a superior in her previous government position and had destroyed evidence being sought by the inspector general of that agency .
Foggo summoned the agency 's managing associate general counsel to his office and insisted that the woman 's service was vital and she must be hired , without disclosing his romantic relationship with ER , according to the documents .
ER was hired , but her supervisor soon found her work unsatisfactory .
" Instead of being receptive to her supervisor 's critiques and suggestions , ER made it clear that she had influence with Foggo .
Indeed , she did , " the prosecutors ' sentencing memo states .
" Her supervisor had been an attorney with the ( CIA 's Office of General Counsel ) for 20 years , during which time she received numerous performance awards and even the Career Intelligence Medal , which rewards ' exceptional achievements that substantially contributed to the mission of the Agency ' over the course of her career .
Within months of crossing Foggo 's mistress , however , she suffered a humiliating firing by Foggo . "
The government 's 24 - page reply to Foggo 's sentencing memorandum , 31 - page sentencing memo and 82 - page appendix are full of such previously undisclosed material .
Calls to the offices of the prosecutors and Foggo 's defense attorneys were n't returned on Tuesday .

I 'm fairly confident that Rush Limbaugh has leapt into the abyss and is just thisshy of an aneurysm or apoplexy .
I can't believe he will keep escalating like this without men in white jackets coming for him .
On his show Thursday afternoon , Rush took a call from a woman wondering why all of her carefully created myths about the joy of living in a Republican - controlled country were being threatened by these crazy Democrats .
Rush 's response was disturbing , to say the least :
LIMBAUGH :
At this point , at this point , Gretchen , I do n't care about the " why . "
They are not going to leave , they are trying to control it .
At this point the only thing is they - must - be - stopped .
CALLER : I agree .
LIMBAUGH : Within , within the confine of our Constitution and the political arena of ideas .
They must be stopped .
I do n't care why they see this county the way the see it .
I do n't care why a murderer does it .
I do n't care why a rapist does it .
I do n't care why this Muslim guy offed his wife 's head .
The " Now Gang " is out there saying " Ah now that ’s not domestic violence , that ’s just uh , that ’s just uh , what 'd they call it , “ culturally honor killing ” and this woman was gonna divorce him …it ’s against the law , and , and , and , that 's that 's … that 's his diversity .
You know it , uh , I do n't care …
I do n't care why anymore .
I mean , if I figure it out , I will be glad to tell you , because its interesting to know , but it does n't matter in terms of defeating them .
Good God .
Aside from the really tenuous grip on reality , someone is going to be hurt by this kind of angry rhetoric .
It wo n't be Rush , but some innocent person whose only crime will be hoping for progress .
Maybe bringing back the Fairness Doctrine is not likely , but something should be done about this kind of inciting rhetoric .
Full transcripts below the fold :
LIMBAUGH : To answer your question , " Why do so many liberal Democrats want to basically tear apart and re-build the country ?
Because they do n't control enough of it to satisfy them .
They want to ...
CALLER : They live here too I do n't understand , like ..
LIMBAUGH : Yes , but , they are gonna establish separate rules for themselves by which they live .
Such as they will be able to not pay their taxes and work in government at high levels .
They are not going to be subject to whatever green - house gas laws that there are .
They are not going to be subject to any of this sort of , they have , ' cause they ’re too important , you see .
Uh , and they all think they are part of the elite .
Some of them are gonna get canned , some of them are gonna get the shaft here ; they just do n't know it .
Uh , but it's , it 's …forget Democrat , these people are liberal Socialists now .
They bear no resemblance of the Democrat party of , of John Kennedy , for example .
CALLER : No you 're right , you 're right I agree , I agree and my thought is ...
LIMBAUGH : It 's about power , it 's about control , These people genuinely look out over this country from their lofty perches they do n't like what they see .
Otherwise , they ...
CALLER : Well then they can go somewhere else , I do n't understand why do they have to stay here ?
LIMBAUGH : I do n't look ..
CALLER : I mean , leave us alone .
LIMBAUGH :
At this point , at this point , Gretchen , I do n't care about the " why . "
They are not going to leave , they are trying to control it .
At this point the only thing is they - must - be - stopped .
CALLER : I agree .
LIMBAUGH : Within , within the confine of our Constitution and the political arena of ideas .
They must be stopped .
I do n't care why they see this county the way the see it .
I do n't care why a murderer does it .
I do n't care why a rapist does it .
I do n't care why this Muslim guy offed his wife 's head .
The " Now Gang " is out there saying " Ah now that ’s not domestic violence , that ’s just uh , that ’s just uh , what 'd they call it , “ culturally honor killing ” and this woman was gonna divorce him …it ’s against the law , and , and , and , that 's that 's … that 's his diversity .
You know it , uh , I do n't care …
I do n't care why anymore .
I mean , if I figure it out , I will be glad to tell you , because its interesting to know , but it does n't matter in terms of defeating them .
Accused fraudster gave big to Dems
The Texas financier accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday of “ massive ongoing fraud ” was a generous political donor who gave more heavily to Democrats .
Since 2000 , R. Allen Stanford , the chief of the Stanford Financial Group in Houston , his wife and company gave $ 2.2 million in political contributions – $ 1.7 million to Democratic candidates and committees – according to Federal Election Commission records .

The most recent donation on record was $ 300,000 from Stanford Financial Group to the Democratic Governors Association , a so - called 527 group not subject to campaign contribution limits .
Other big beneficiaries included the Democrats ’ congressional campaign committees , which received $ 1.2 million over the years , and their Republican counterparts , which got $ 322,000 , including a $ 28,500 personal donation last year to the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Stanford and his companies gave $ 128,500 to the Republican National Committee , plus $ 2,000 to Sen.
Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , $ 4,000 to Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , $ 4,000 to Rep. Charles Gonzalez ( D - Texas ) , $ 4,000 to Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) and $ 4,800 to the committees of Rep. Charles B. Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) , among other contributions .
The SEC accused Stanford and two associates of misrepresenting the safety and liquidity of more than $ 8 billion worth of certificates of deposit held in Antigua .
Cornyn also reported that Stanford Financial Group paid $ 7,441.00 in travel , lodging and meal expenses to fly him and his wife to Antigua in November , 2004 .
The purpose of the trip was a “ financial services industry fact - finding mission hosted by [ a ] constituent company with substantial operations on site , ” according to a travel report that Cornyn filed with the secretary of the Senate .
Stanford , who is a dual United States - Antigua citizen , was described by a Cornyn aide as “ nothing more than a constituent . ”
“ No one is above the law , and prosecutors should follow the facts , wherever they may lead , ” Cornyn said in a statement .

In May 2004 , the New York Times , while claiming it was aggressive in pursuing stories about the Bush - Cheney Administration , slipped in an apology for acting more as the mouthpiece for politicians than as a watchdog for society .
“ Coverage was not as rigorous as it should have been , ” the Times admitted .
Part of the problem , the Times acknowledged , was that “ Editors at several levels who should have been challenging reporters and pressing for more skepticism were perhaps too intent on rushing scoops into the paper . ”
The Times concluded it wished “ we had been more aggressive . ”
Almost three months later , the Washington Post , one of the most hawkish papers for invading Iraq , finally acknowledged its own pre-war hysteria and lack of journalistic competence and courage .
“ We were so focused on trying to figure out what the administration was doing that we were not giving the same play to people who said it would n’t be a good idea to go to war and were questioning the administration ’s rationale , ” wrote Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr .
During President Bush ’s second term , especially after his popularity had begun to sink , several major newspapers , including the New York Times and Washington Post , became more aggressive , publishing several major investigations into the War in Iraq , the government ’s use of torture and apparent violation of the Geneva Accords , violations of due process , extensive spying upon Americans , the failure to provide combat troops with adequate body armor , the silencing of government scientists who disagreed with Bush - Cheney beliefs and values , the classification of 55,000 documents in the National Archives that had previously been declassified , the use of propaganda to support doctrine , and problems at Guantanamo Bay .
A New York Times investigation by Tim Golden and Don Van Natta Jr. revealed “ government and military officials have repeatedly exaggerated both the danger the detainees posed and the intelligence they have provided . ”
That same investigation also revealed a CIA report in September 2002 that questioned the arrests .
Most of those picked up in Afghanistan and transferred to Guantánamo Bay , according to the CIA investigation , were low level recruits or innocent men .
Among other reporters from the Times who broke major stories were Elisabeth Bumiller , Douglas Jehl , James Risen , and Eric Schmitt , who wrote about secret prisons and rendition ; and James Risen and Eric Lichtblau , who wrote several articles about the government ’s illegal spying upon American citizens .
Times editors , however , had kept the stories about the government ’s spying out of the newspaper for about a year , in deference to the Administration ’s hysterical claims before the November 2004 election that breaking news about unconstitutional activities might somehow be aiding and abetting the enemy ; the reality was that the Times was duped into protecting the Administration against a vote drain .
For the Washington Post , Stave Fainam wrote about abuses by extramilitary private contractors in Iraq ; Dana Priest wrote about secret prisons and controversial parts of the Bush - Cheney counter - terrorism tactics ; Jo Becker and Barton Gellman investigated the growing influence of Dick Cheney into national policies ; and Dana Priest , Anne Hull , and Michael duCille in several articles exposed the medical and psychiatric neglect of returning combat soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
Although the Post‘s Bob Woodward fully believed Bush - Cheney Administration claims about the need to invade Iraq , he still produced the most in - depth reporting about Bush and his decision - making process .
His four books in six years were all best - sellers .
The Los Angeles Times published a series in 2006 about Iraq ’s descent into civil war following the U.S. invasion .
Outstanding reporting about the impact of the war upon soldiers and civilians was done by several reporters , including Borzou Daragahia and David Zucchino of the L.A. Times ; and Lisa Chedekel and Matthew Kauffman of the Hartford Courant .
However , for the most part , reporters accepted what they were given .
Robert Fisk , Middle East correspondent for the London Independent , condemned much of the American press corps in Iraq for “ hotel journalism , ” writing stories based upon what they were told in press conferences without going into the field .
At the Boston Globe , Charlie Savage did solid reporting about President Bush ’s use of signing statements to bypass federal and constitutional law .
Much of the best in - depth reporting about the Bush - Cheney Administration , especially its fixation upon invading Iraq , was done by reporters for national magazines .
Seymour Hersh ’s powerful series about the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison and several articles about the war in Iraq first appeared in the New Yorker .
Hersh had broken the story about the massacre at My Lai and its cover - up during the Vietnam War ; it was this willful murder of civilians by the U.S. military that other reporters knew about but did n’t report that earned Hersh the Pulitzer Prize .
However , after Hersh ’s series was published , the establishment media could no longer ignore the story .
Not much changed in the four decades since then .
Perhaps Hersh ’s greatest honor is that a senior Bush advisor called him “ the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist . ”
Among several outstanding hard - news reports about the Bush - Cheney Administration , especially its fixation upon invading Iraq and of subsequent constitutional violations , were those of Michael Isikoff in Newsweek , David Corn in Mother Jones , Jane Mayer in the New Yorker , and James Bamford in Rolling Stone .
With a few blips for courageous reporting , the American press , according to media critic Norman Solomon , continued to blindly accept the Bush - Cheney doctrine as truth .
“ The American media establishment , ” wrote Solomon in August 2007 , “ continues to behave like a leviathan with a monkey on its back - hooked on militarism and largely hostile to the creative intervention that democracy requires . ”
However , reporters for one establishment news agency consistently represented the highest ideals of an uncompromised press .
John Walcott , the Knight Ridder bureau chief in Washington , and bureau reporters Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel , were aggressive in publishing well - documented stories that challenged Bush - Cheney claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the need for the invasion .
When McClatchy bought out Knight Ridder in 2006 , Walcott continued as bureau chief , and Landay and Strobel become senior correspondents .
They continued to challenge the propaganda , and proved that their organization was doing everything the Founding Fathers demanded when they said the primary function of the media is to act as a watchdog on government .
When other media disregarded the anti-war dissidents , Walcott ’s reporters interviewed them ; when other media gave Guantanamo Bay coverage little more than “ he said / she said ” coverage , the McClatchy bureau dug into the story to present the truth and not the spoon - fed lies .
When other media took down what they were told at press conferences and private meetings with senior Bush - Cheney officials , Walcott ’s reporters listened , but went to innumerable professionals and lower - level staff in the Defense and State departments to get the truth .
“ Journalism is not stenography , ” says Walcott , winner of the first I.F. Stone medal for journalistic independence .
The role of the journalist , he says , is n’t to record what people say , but to question it in the search for the truth .
“ One of the reasons we pressed so hard for the case for the war in Iraq , ” says Walcott , “ is that what they [ the Administration ] said simply made no sense . ”
The primary focus for Walcott ’s reporters was “ how were the decisions being made in Washington , [ by ] many who had never been to war , would affect the men and women ” in the military .
“ On the whole , the Bush Administration did not put out the welcome sign for us , ” says Roy Gutman , McClatchy foreign editor .
On even routine stories , the White House planted its leaks with friendlier organizations , and tried to isolate the Knight Ridder / McClatchy bureau from the other media .
Publicly , the Bush - Cheney Administration issued no retort ; by maintaining silence , the Administration knew the establishment media would also ignore a competitor ’s reports .
“ We were alone at the beginning , ” says Walcott , “ and are still fairly lonely at the end . ”
Desk - based peripherals vendor La Cie is getting into the cloud by merging with Swiss online storage house Caleido .
Paris and Portland , Oregon - based La Cie makes neat , minimalist external disk drives and other peripherals .
The boxes are designed by Neil Poulton and feature elegant sharp - edged rectangular shapes with smooth glossy exteriors and funky blue lighting effects .
They offer Apple - like style for both PCs and Macs , have ridden the 250 GB - 500 GB - 750 GB - 1TB SATA hard drive capacity curve and also had features added to enter the domestic media playing scene , as well as acting as a local backup resource for desktops and notebooks .
Caleido is a Swiss company offering a free online social storage service with files being broken up into encrypted parts and stored across a grid of connected computers , a cloud .
The service is called Wuala and provides the usual file , fiolder , digital media content backup service with web access from anywhere and content sharing with friends .
Only yesterday Symantec announced its Norton Online Service to do this and there is a whole raft of similar international and national service offerings from Mozy , Carbonite , Spare Backup and others .
In a novel twist Wuala " users start with 1 GB of storage but can get as much as they want , either by trading idle disk space or by buying additional storage . "
Luzius Meisser , a Caleido co-founder said , " Wuala ... builds its reliable and secure cloud storage by harnessing idle resources . "
The company describes its offering thus : " Wuala users can choose to contribute idle resources to Wuala .
In addition to servers , Wuala can harness these resources .
All data is first encrypted and then split into fragments which are redundantly stored on our servers and in the grid network .
This allows us to save costs for downloads ( bandwidth , electrical power ) and thus to provide a better service for free , with a number of advantages that others just can't offer : unlimited traffic , no file size limits , fast downloads , and so on . "
Dominik Grolimund , a co-creator of Wuala , said : " A robust rights management system protects files from unauthorized access .
We will also bring this technology to enterprises and professional customers , who will soon take advantage of our services with both cloud and data center - based storage . "
Ah , that 's the business , then .
LaCie plans to implement this cloud storage technology into its range of storage devices , offering a combination of local device storage for fast access , and secured remote storage on the cloud , for easy sharing and enhanced backup .
In fact LaCie has tentatively dipped its toe into cloud storage already and this move confirms its strategy here .
La Cie 's founder and CEO , Philippe Spruch , pleased as could be , said : " For 20 years , LaCie massively promoted hard drive technologies ; today , as a leader on storage market , we will be a first mover in the next leading technologies : flash - based storage , and cloud storage .
With this merger , LaCie will morph from a pure hardware manufacturer to a solution provider .
These new technologies will be amazing for our customers and will enhance their experience . "
Pity about the " solution provider " market - speak but what he means is clear enough .
Disk drive manufacturer Seagate has its online eVault service .
It seems pretty stratightforward to conclude that external disk drive storage suppliers to desktop , notebook and small business server owners will have to start offering a local storage - remote cloud storage combo offering .
Will the Buffalo roar in this direction ?
Is Western Digital heading towards the clouds ?
Will Toshiba ?
Hitachi GST ?
And did you see that point about flash in the La Cie guy 's quote ?
Verbatim's Hans Christoph Kaiser , EMEA business development manager , did n't laugh away the idea of a local storage box combining flash solid state storage speed , bulk SATA disk storage and a link to a cloud storage facility .
We 're all gonna get tiered and suppliers who do n't go that route risk having their products niched , nipped and tucked away into irrelevance . ®
On February 4th , the Franken campaign moved to amend their original counterclaim to Coleman 's election contest notice .
Then on February 6th , the Coleman campaign essentially consented to Franken 's request .
Finally on Saturday afternoon , the Franken campaign released their newly amended list to members of the Minnesota media as well as the Election Contest Court .
The Franken release came in the form of a twenty - five page PDF ; two exhibits , labeled X and Y accompanied the document .
An overview of these exhibits is provided within the first counterclaim , as presented below in it 's entirety :
... FIRST COUNTERCLAIM ERRONEOUSLY REJECTED ABSENTEE BALLOTS
1 . Franken has identified a number of absentee ballots that were rejected in error by election judges and local election officials , in the first instance , or by Coleman as part of the absentee ballot review process pursuant to order of the Minnesota Supreme Court .
2 . In a complete about - face from his previous position , Coleman now alleges that approximately 4,800 absentee ballots were rejected in error .
Of those , Franken agrees that the absentee ballots identified in attached Exhibit X should be opened and counted or , as to those rejected for lack of registration , the envelopes should be opened to determine if voter registration applications were submitted .
3 . Franken further alleges that the absentee ballots identified in attached Exhibit Y , but not among those identified by Coleman , should be opened and counted or , as to those rejected for lack of registration , the envelopes should be opened to determine if voter registration applications were submitted .
4 . A number of the absentee ballot envelopes and related materials identified in Exhibits X and Y are the subject of pending Minnesota Government Data Practices requests and trial subpoenas .
Franken expects to refine these Exhibits as information is received and as evidence is adduced at trial .
...
Source : Contestee 's First Amended Answer and Counterclaims via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
I 've parsed through each of these exhibits and compiled the following spreadsheets to allow for a more efficient dissemination of the information contained therein :
I 've further condensed the data provided above , into the table below :
Identified Extrapolation Voters Coleman Franken Exhibit X 781 319.06 334.10 Coleman Counties 451 142.87 104.39 Franken Counties 330 103.39 175.72 Exhibit Y 804 305.53 368.88 Coleman Counties 300 215.68 158.39 Franken Counties 504 162.67 264.50 Total 1585 624.59 702.98 Coleman Counties 751 358.54 262.78 Franken Counties 834 266.05 440.21
If each one of the 1,585 ballots listed within Franken 's latest filing are opened and counted , Franken would gain about 78 votes .
This extrapolation assumes a linear relation between the certified recount result on the county level and the inclusion of the listed absentee ballots .
Absentee ballot counting in Hennepin County is delegated to each city , as such , our extrapolation uses the city totals from each applicable Hennepin County municipality as provided by the Franken campaign .
...
There were a plethora of other court filings released today , but filed prior to today , in addition to the information presented above .
We 'll start with a rather ambitious request by the Coleman campaign :
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT at a time set by the Court Contestants will move the Court to enter a ruling applying the standards of Minn.
Stat. §§ 203B.12 and 203B.24 , as the Court has announced those standards , to all absentee ballots cast in the election for U.S. Senate to determine whether those ballots are legally cast votes .
The motion is based on the accompanying Memorandum , Affidavit of James K. Langdon , and all the files , records , evidence in the record and the proceedings herein .
Dated : February 20 , 2009 Source : Contestants ' Notice of Motion and Motion via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
The Coleman campaign is essentially asking the Election Contest Court to reconsider every counted absentee ballot .
This request has essentially no chance of being granted but it raises an interesting point none the less .
The official recount guide states that the purpose of the recount " is not to determine if absentee ballots were properly accepted . "
It 's certainly possible , even probable that some absentee ballots that were counted should not have been counted .
The Coleman campaign does not however provide any empirical evidence .
Without proof of wrongdoing , Coleman 's assertion opposes Dep. Sec. Jim Gelbmann 's testimony and the idea that " the decision of the local election officials should be assumed to be correct . "
The Coleman campaign also presented a nine page memorandum supporting their aforementioned motion .
I 've posted the conclusion below :
... CONCLUSION
Contestants do not support a remedy that would disenfranchise Minnesota voters whose ballots already have been counted , but the Court 's current rulings dictate that result .
All similarly situated voters must be treated consistently - and fairly .
Elementary fairness as well as equal protection of the laws demands no less .
Moreover , the Court is statutorily precluded from including illegal votes in determining who won the election .
Contestants accordingly respectfully request that the Court grant their Motion for Ruling Applying February 13,2009 Order regarding Minn. Stat. §§ 203B.12 and 203B.24 to all absentee ballots previously counted in this election .

Franken has either not filed a response , or the campaign 's response is simply not yet listed on the litigation website .
The group of 61 petitioners represented by Charles Nauen has filed additional evidence and presented a new motion for summary judgment requesting the inclusion of nineteen previously denied petitioners .
The entire motion for summary judgment is displayed below :
PETITIONERS ' NOTICE OF MOTION AND RENEWED MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that as soon the parties may be heard , Petitioners Dennis Peterson , et. al. ( " Petitioners " ) , through their attorneys , Lockridge Grindal Nauen P, L.L.P. , will renew , and hereby renew , their motion to this Court , the Honorable Elizabeth A. Hayden , the Honorable Kurt 1 .
Marben , and the Honorable Denise D. Reilly , presiding , at the Minnesota Judicial Center , 25 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard , St. Paul , State of Minnesota , for the entry of an order granting summary judgment in their favor pursuant to Rule 56 of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure .
Petitioners respectfully request this Court grant judgment as a matter of law in their favor as follows : 1 . Directing that 19 Petitioners ' absentee ballots shall be opened and counted immediately , and the total be declared and certified , for such use as might be appropriate by the United States Senate , this Court in the above - captioned matter , or any other proper use under law ; and 2 .
Granting Petitioners such other relief as the Court deems just and appropriate .

The group of petitioners represented by Mr. Nauen is widely considered to be very Franken friendly for two reasons .
First , Mr. Nauen seems to support the Democratic agenda based upon his contributions and secondly , the majority of the 61 petitioners are found somewhere on Franken 's wrongfully rejected list .
It 's very unlikely that Coleman will gain votes based upon the potential inclusion of these nineteen ballots .
Our final court document was drafted by the Franken campaign last Wednesday , but was not filed until Friday .
The first and last paragraphs of the memorandum are presented below :
A question has been raised regarding the form and specificity required for an offer of proof when the Court excludes evidence .
Contestee Al Franken provides the following legal authority and argument to assist the Court .
At the outset it should be noted that the purpose of an offer of proof is to create a record on which the trial court can make a ruling and to create and preserve a record upon which an appellate court may review lower court decisions .
Thus , this Court certainly may and should allow Contestants to make an appropriate written or oral offer of proof for the purposes of creating a record for appellate court review , but it most assuredly has no duty whatsoever to allow , assist or facilitate the creation of a record to assist Contestants in a collateral attack on this Court , its decisions to date in this matter , or Minnesota 's electoral system more generally .
The suggestion that somehow different standards should be applied to an offer of proof on account of Contestants ' apparent intention to file federal court litigation attacking this Court 's decisions in this matter is seriously misplaced , misapprehends the purposes of an offer of proof and misstates applicable law .
...
The Court properly may require that an offer of proof be in the form of an oral or written summary by the attorney , rather than the testimony sought to be adduced .
To avoid further waste of this Court 's time , delay in the conclusion of this process and the seating of Minnesota 's second United States Senator , and further cumulative testimony apparently designed to undermine the legitimacy of this election and this Court 's process , Contestee respectfully submits that Contestants should be directed to make a written offer of proof , in whatever level of specificity they would like , but no further testimony should be entertained with respect to Contestants ' dismissed equal protection claims .
Dated : February 18 , 2009 Source : Memorandum of Law Regarding Form and Level of Specificity Required in an Offer of Proof via MNCourts.gov [ PDF ]
I 'm not entirely sure of the exact intent of this filing , but it appears as though the Franken campaign is trying to limit the topics on which the Coleman campaign can call witnesses to the stand .
The Franken campaign is requesting that the Coleman campaign be forced to present an offer of proof , ( which upholds the presentation of evidence in the event of an appeal ) instead of calling a witness to support any equal protection argument .
That 's it for now , but I suspect another round of documents will be published tomorrow as the litigation resumes at 9 AM CT .
Update [ 2:33 AM CT ] : Franken sent out another order to the Minnesota Media Monday afternoon which the litigation website eventually posted .
The filiing is twenty - five page and is dated February 23rd :
The above - entitled matter came on for hearing before the Court on January 23 , 2009 , upon Contestee 's Conditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Certain of Contestants ' Claims and on Contestee 's Conditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Certain of Contestee 's Counterclaims .
Counsel noted their appearances on the record .
The Court having heard and read the arguments of counsel , and based upon the files , records , and proceedings herein , makes the following : ORDER 1 .
Contestee 's Conditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Certain of Contestee 's Counterclaims is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART .
2 . The following absentee ballots shall be provided to the Secretary of State at a date to be determined by the Court to be opened and counted at a date to be determined by the Court , and the total be declared and certified for such use as might be appropriate by the United States Senate , this Court , or any other proper use under law .
[ Table identifying twelve individual voters and their associated county . ]
3 . Contestee 's Conditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Certain of Contestants ' Claims is DENIED .
4 . Any other relief not specifically ordered herein is DENIED .
5 . The attached Memorandum is incorporated herein by reference .
... j. Conclusion
For the aforementioned reasons , the Court grants in part and denies in part Contestee 's Conditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Certain of Contestee 's Counterclaims and denies Contestee 's Conditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Certain of Contestants ' Claims . "
Any other relief not specifically ordered herein is denied .

Of the twelve voters identified in the preceding order , nine of the names can be found in Franken 's Exhibit X , while just one is listed in Exhibit Y .
The other two voters were mentioned as part of Franken 's original counterclaim addressing 792 specific voters by name .
It 's impossible to know exactly which way these twelve ballots will fall .
It seems slightly more likely that this set will favor Franken based upon his specific identification of these voters , although Coleman has also identified nine of these voters .
In the end , we know that twelve more ballots will be opened and likely counted , so the speculation is irrelevant .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. real consumer spending fell in December for the sixth time in seven months as consumers saved what they gained from falling energy prices , the Commerce Department reported Monday .
Nominal spending fell 1 % in December , marking the sixth straight decline .
This was in line with expectations of economists surveyed by MarketWatch .
See Economic Calendar .
After adjusting for a 0.5 % decline in prices , real consumer spending fell 0.5 % in December , a reversal following a 0.3 % increase in November , the government said .
It was the sixth decline in real spending in the past seven months .
Read the full government report .
Nominal incomes fell 0.2 % in December .
After adjusting for inflation and after paying taxes , real disposable incomes rose 0.3 % .
With spending falling faster than incomes , the personal savings rate rose to 3.6 % in December , the highest since May when savings were boosted by tax - rebate checks .
" Apart from the disruptions caused by the recent tax rebate checks , the Microsoft special dividend , and the 9/11 terror attacks [ it 's ] the highest level since 1999 , " said Harm Bandholz , an economist for UniCredit Markets .
In driving the savings rate higher , consumers have reduced their spending by about $ 400 billion from what it would be with a zero savings rate , said Tony Crescenzi , chief bond market strategist for Miller Tabak & Co .
The drag from the increased savings is about 3 % of gross domestic product , he said .
The Commerce Department report fills in monthly details provided on a quarterly basis in the gross domestic product report released last Friday , which showed the economy contracted at a 3.8 % annual rate in the fourth quarter , the worst since the early 1980s .
See full story .
Consumer prices fell 0.5 % in December from November but were up just 0.6 % compared with December 2007 .
Core prices , which exclude food and energy prices in order to highlight underlying trends , were flat in December and were up 1.7 % since December 2007 , within the Federal Reserve 's target zone of 1 % to 2 % .
Last week , Federal Open Market Committee policy makers cautioned that core inflation might head too close to zero for the U.S. central bank 's comfort .
Details
Incomes measured in current dollars fell 0.2 % , the third consecutive decline .
Income from wages and salaries sank 0.3 % , as more than half a million jobs were lost and hours worked were slashed .
Income from owning a business fell 0.6 % .
Income from assets dropped 1.5 % .
Rental income rose 4.8 %
Real spending ( inflation - adjusted ) fell 0.5 % .
Real spending decreased 0.8 % on durable goods , fell 1.8 % on nondurable goods and rose 0.1 % for services .
HERE ARE TWO stories about the Internet .
The week before last , the crippled economy coughed up a gift for picked - on college students across the country :
It shut down Juicy Campus , a notorious website where campus gossips nationwide were invited to hold forth anonymously .
" Just remember , keep it Juicy ! " the home page had exhorted .
Posters had duly obliged , and many students had found their social skills , weight , grooming habits , sexual orientation , and / or promiscuity to be the subject of gleefully vicious discussion by unseen online classmates .
In a healthier economy , it 's unclear if anything could have closed down Juicy Campus - university administrators and even state prosecutors were eager to take it on , but had all but conceded that they had few legal options , and the website had been rapidly expanding the number of its member campuses .
And then there is this :
Last month , someone posted a map showing the names , home locations , and occupations of thousands of people who gave money to support the passage of Proposition 8 , the ballot initiative outlawing gay marriage in California .
A number of these Proposition 8 supporters have since reported threatening e-mails and phone calls .
Speech now travels farther faster than the Founding Fathers - or the judges who created much of modern free speech law - could have dreamed .
The Web has brought a new reach to the things we say about others , and created a vast potential audience for arguments that would once have unfolded in a single room or between two telephones .
It has eaten away at the buffer that once separated public and private , making it possible to expose someone else 's intimate information to the world with a few keystrokes , or to take information that would formerly have been filed away in obscure public records and present it digestibly as a goad to collective political action .
One of the results has been the advent of a new culture of online heckling and shaming , and the rise of enormous cyber - posses motivated by social or political causes - or simple sadism .
Now , some legal scholars are beginning to argue that new technologies have changed the balance of power between the right to speak and the right to be left alone .
At conferences , in law review articles , and , increasingly , in the courts , some lawyers are suggesting that the time has come to rethink some of the hallowed protections that the law gives speech in this country , especially if that speech is online .
The proposals vary : Some focus on restricting material that can be posted online or how long it can stay there , others on whether we should be less willing to protect online anonymity .
More ambitious schemes would have courts treat a person 's reputation as a form of property - something to be protected , traded , and even sold like any other property - or create a legally enforceable duty of confidentiality between friends like that which exists between doctors and their patients .
At stake is the basic question of what we will allow people to say and do online , whether it's on a message board , a Craigslist ad , or a YouTube video - and who gets to set the rules governing what 's OK and what 's not .
As the Web grows increasingly interactive , the system of informal and formal rules that determines appropriate behavior is only beginning to emerge , and thinkers on both sides of the debate agree that courts can go a long way toward shaping it .
The argument over what to do about online speech , in other words , is an argument over whether the Web 's unruly nature is something to be celebrated or tamed .
" Right now , it 's pretty much like the Wild West , and we need to do something to combat that norm , " says Daniel Solove , a professor at George Washington University and leading advocate of reining in online speech .
Free speech advocates caution that these sorts of measures , no matter how carefully drawn up , are likely to backfire , creating a snarl of lawsuits .
For all the pain of being exposed or attacked online , the far greater threat , these thinkers believe , is that the Web becomes a place where the rules are set by the most litigious and the thinnest - skinned , stifling the free flow of ideas and opinions that today define it .
Relaxing the protections for online speech , argues Kurt Opsahl , a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , an advocacy group , " would relegate comment on the Internet to only that provided by large and powerful and very cautious media . "
Proponents of the new privacy protections , however , insist that all they are doing is helping to level the playing field between private citizens and those who , for whatever reason , are using the Web to expose others ' secrets to the wider world .
. . .
Modern American privacy law arose , in part , out of concern over an earlier transformative technology : the Kodak " snap camera . "
For the first few decades after cameras were invented , they were large and expensive , and nobody could take your picture unless you sat still for several minutes .
When the Kodak hit the market in 1884 , it changed all that - the new camera was cheap and comparatively small , and it took a picture in an instant .
" Suddenly , your photograph could be taken without your permission , or even without your knowledge , " says Lawrence Friedman , a professor at Stanford Law School and prominent historian of privacy law .
And if that picture was compromising in any way , it could easily find its way into one of the many cheap , lurid newspapers that made up the era 's burgeoning " penny press . "
Alarmed by this new landscape , two young Boston lawyers , Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren , wrote an article in the Harvard Law Review that served as the foundation for most of the state laws that today protect privacy .
( Brandeis would go on to serve on the Supreme Court . )
Brandeis and Warren 's basic argument , innovative at the time , was that people should be able to sue others for the wrong of exposing their private lives to public scrutiny .
According to concerned legal scholars like Solove , the power and pervasiveness of the Web have now unsettled the privacy law regime that the Kodak helped create .
Not only does the Web allow for anonymous , immediate posting of information , but search engines make that information retrievable for curious people everywhere .
And whether it's an address , a lewd photograph or video , or a written insult , it remains on the Web until someone actively removes it , and even then copies can survive elsewhere .
" We can now readily capture information and images wherever we go , and we can then share them with the world at the click of a mouse , " Solove wrote in his 2007 book , " The Future of Reputation . "
" Somebody you 've never met can snap your photo and post it on the Internet .
Or somebody that you know very well can share your cherished secrets with the entire planet . "
The answer , Solove believes , lies in giving people more explicit control over information about them .
As Solove sees it , the Web highlights an existing set of problems with how American law treats the divulging of intimate details - whether they end up on the Internet or not .
For example , American courts tend to assume that once you tell someone a secret , unless that person is your doctor or lawyer or minister , it 's basically public .
It 's therefore futile to sue a former lover for breach - of - confidentiality for telling someone about your sexual hang - ups , even if that " someone " is thousands of readers of a blog post .
" There 's a notion in the law that if you tell a secret to another person you just risk that they might betray you , " Solove says , " that if you tell a friend or spouse your secret and they spread it , you should n't have trusted them , it 's tough luck and you should find new friends .
I think that is problematic . "
There is an alternative .
In England , courts enforce a far broader duty of confidentiality , upholding breach - of - confidentiality lawsuits against loose - lipped ex-spouses and lovers .
Solove would like to see the United States move to a legal regime more like that one , so that we 're not held hostage by the questionable trustworthiness of our friends .
Such a significant shift makes legal scholars who are more protective of speech deeply uncomfortable .
Eugene Volokh , a law professor at UCLA and a free speech and cyberlaw expert , sees that model leading to an almost comical set of limits on conversations .
" Let 's say you are talking to your new girlfriend about past relationships , " he says .
" You tell her you feel you 've been hurt by an ex-girlfriend , and she asks you to tell her about it .
You then have to say , ' I 'm sorry , but I 'm legally bound not to reveal anything about that relationship . ' "
County election boss claims there 's no deadline for manual count of e-voting ' paper trails '
State SoS seems to disagree ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/31/2009 , 2:26 pm PT
We know what the excuse is in MN , but what 's the excuse in Riverside County , CA ?
Seems there is none , other than County Registrar Barbara Dunmore 's hope to ensure the county remains one of the absolute worst places to cast a vote in the entire nation ( and there 's some stiff competition there ! )
Though Dunmore certified the results of last November 's election on Dec. 2 as " full , true and correct " --- 28 days after the election , as per state law --- it turns out she 's still counting votes , months after the election .
In secret ...
Incredibly , while every other county in the state finished on time and did n't need to lie about " full , true and correct " totals , Dunmore failed to complete the state - mandated hand - count of " paper trail " votes cast on touch - screen voting machines .
So they are still counting , the Sec. of State 's office is flummoxed about it , and Dunmore is claiming the state law that requires hand - counts of Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE ) paper trails ( due to concerns about security and accuracy of such devices ) does n't require her to actually do that count before certifying the election .
According to Julia Glick 's excellent coverage in the Press - Enterprise the CA SoS office , at this time , has no explanation for what 's going on and seems to disagree with Dunmore 's assertion that she can take as long as she wants to hand - count the DRE paper trails ...
" At the end of the 28 - day canvass , counties confirm to the secretary of state 's office that their totals are , in fact , true and correct , which allows the secretary of state to then confirm state 's results , " [ SoS spokesperson Kate ]
Folmar said , adding that votes must be counted and verified in accordance with state laws and regulations .
" It would be alarming for a county official to certify results to Secretary of State Bowen if they were not . "
According to a complaint filed by Riverside Election Integrity advocate Art Cassell , apparently Dunmore also does n't feel the counting , now months after the election , needs to be done in public view , as per state law , either .
Amazing .
As long - time BRAD BLOG readers may recall ( and as other may search for , if they wish ) , Riverside County has a storied history of massive e-voting disasters and embarrassments since becoming the first county in the nation to go all touch - screen back in 2000 .
They were subsequently forced to go back to ( mostly ) paper ballots after CA SoS Debra Bowen 's landmark " Top - to - Bottom Review " of e-voting systems found them , um , lacking .
How it is that Dunmore still has a job defies explanation at this point .

For those times when you 're not near a Wi -Fi network , being able to tether to your phone 's data connection can be very useful indeed - provided your phone 's OS , your data plan , and your network provider are all set up to provide tethering of course .
The latest Canary ( developer ) build of Chrome OS has added an " instant tethering " option that makes it easier to get online this way : once you 've enabled the feature on the flags page ( look for " enable - tether " ) , it appears as an option on the main settings page .
It 's the same feature we saw come to selected Android devices earlier this year , and it works the same way - if you have a Chromebook and a phone signed into the same Google account , the Chromebook automatically picks up on the phone 's data connection when Wi-Fi is n't available .
You do n't even need to take the phone out of your pocket .
Under the tether
Another added bonus of instant tethering is that the Wi-Fi hotspot being run from your phone automatically starts up and shuts down as needed , so it 's not running all the time and wasting battery life while your Chromebook is switched off .
While it might not change your tethering life , it should make for a more seamless browsing experience when you 're using your Chromebook away from home .
Note though that the feature can only be used with a Pixel or Nexus device running Android Nougat , which will also need to have instant tethering enabled ( under Google in Settings ) .
If you do n't want to play around with the Canary build of Chrome OS then you 'll have to wait for it to trickle down to the regular version of the operating system , which should n't take too long .
In the market for a Chromebook ?

John Oliver - Sticker Shock
Upon reflection , John Oliver thinks putting a warning sticker on science textbooks is n't such a bad idea .
Snapshots of the asteroid 1 Ceres taken by the Hubble Space Telescope provide clues about the asteroid 's interior make - up .
The bright spot that appears in each image is a mystery .
The largest known asteroid could contain more fresh water thanEarth and looks like our planet in other ways , according to a new study thatfurther blurs the line between planets and large space rocks .
Astronomers took 267 imagesof asteroid Ceres using the Hubble Space Telescope .
From these images andsubsequent computer simulations , they suggest Ceres may have a rocky inner coreand a thin , dusty outer crust .
A team led by Peter Thomas of Cornell University said todaythat Ceres is nearly spherical , which suggests that gravity controls its shape .
Also , the asteroid 's non-uniform shape indicates that material is not evenlydistributed throughout the inside .
These and other new clues , including Ceres ' low density , pointto an interior loaded with frozen water , the astronomers said .
The results are detailed in the Sept. 8 issue of the journal Nature .
Big and round
Ceres has long been considered one of the tens of thousands ofasteroids that make up the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter .
At 580 miles ( 930 km ) in diameter – about the size of Texas – it's the largestasteroid in the belt , accounting for about 25 percent of the belt 's totalmass .
Astronomers had thought Ceres might never have been heatedenough to create layers of material .
But computer models now suggest Ceres has a differentiatedinterior – dense material in the core and lighter stuff near thesurface .
Possible configurations include a mantle rich in water ice around arocky core .
If this mantle is composed of at least 25 percent water , Cereswould have more fresh water than Earth , according to a statement released bythe Space Telescope Science Institute , which operates Hubble for NASA and the European Space Agency .
" The most likely scenario from the knowledge we have onhow other objects form , it probably has a rocky core and a mantle .
That mantleis probably some watery , icy mix , with other dirt and constituents .
That mantlecould be as much as ? of the whole object , " study coauthor Joel Parker ofthe Southwest Research Institute told SPACE.com .
" Even though it 's a small object compared to Earth , there could be a lotof water . "
On Earth , fresh water makes up only a thin layer just a fewmiles deep in some places , less in others .
The water layer proposed for Ceres , while smaller in circumference , is many miles thicker .
The total volume of water on Earth is about 1.4 billion cubickilometers , around 41 million of which is fresh water .
If Ceres ' mantleaccounts for 25 percent of the asteroid 's mass , that wouldtranslate to an upper limit of 200 million cubic kilometers of water , Parker said .
Since all the nine " regular " planets havedifferentiated interiors , this new view of Ceres has some astronomers callingCeres a " mini- planet , " adding fuel to an ongoingdebate over exactly what qualifies as a planet .
Embroyonic world
Other researchers recently announced the discovery of 2003 UB313 , a round object in our solar system 1 - 1/ 2 times larger than Pluto and aboutthree times further away from the Sun .
But even an object of this size –at 2,100 miles in diameter roughly four times the size of Ceres – doesn ' treceive universal endorsement as being a planet .
One astronomer , Brian Marsden , whoruns the Minor Planet Center where data on small bodies is collected , says thatif Pluto is considered a planet , then any other round worlds should also beconsidered planets .
Under this definition , which some other astronomerssubscribe to , Ceres 2003 UB313 and a handful of other large objects would benamed planets .
The alternative , Marsden and otherssay , is to stop calling Pluto a planet .
Another explanation is that Ceres is a sort of ' baby ' planet– an underdeveloped version of Earth and other rocky planets .
Looked atthis way , Ceres appears as other fledgling planets might have looked more than4 billion years ago .
The leading theory for planet formation holds that small rockscollided , stuck and gradually grew .
Depending on location and orbit , adeveloping world may or may not have encountered enough raw materialto become as large as the four traditional rocky planets .
" Ceres is an embryonic planet , " said observation teammember Lucy McFadden of the Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland .
" Gravitational perturbations from Jupiter billions of years agoprevented Ceres from accreting more material to become a full - fledgedplanet . "
In 2015 scientists will get a close up look at Ceres when theNASA Dawn mission orbitsthe asteroid .
A closer look should provide more clues about the asteroid ' scomposition .

Camcording pirates pose a serious threat to the profits of Hollywood , according to the MPAA at least .
In order to stop the cammers in their tracks , theater owners have been equipped with night - vision goggles .
That 's not all though , the latest Hollywood blockbusters may soon come with watermarked audio that can pinpoint a pirate 's seat number .
Hindering piracy is priority number one for theater employees nowadays , and there is even a $ 500 award for those who manage to catch one .
In dealing with a tiny minority , theater owners are slowly alienating their customers and even go as far as using metal detectors and night - vision goggles to track down movie cammers .
Everyone is treated like a pirate these days .
The efforts are paying off nicely though .
The night vision goggles helped to spot Batman and Bond pirates and a Virgina teenager was busted a while back for recording a few seconds of the movie Transformers on her cell - phone .
The only thing she wanted to do was show it to her 13 year old brother , however , the alert theater staff called in the police and the girl was arrested .
With one of the latest inventions by Prof.
Babaguchi and colleagues , catching cammers might become even easier .
While video - based watermarks are already used in theaters in order to determine which screen the movie was recorded from , new technology makes it possible to watermark the audio of films too .
The audio watermarks go much further though , as they can pinpoint almost the exact location that the pirate was in when he recorded the movie .
This so called spread - spectrum audio watermarking does not spoil the subjective acoustic quality and is fairly accurate in estimating where the offender was seated .
With a mean estimation error of only 44 centimeters , it might be a seat off every now and then , but those are worries for later .
To use the technology successfully , however , the theater has to keep a database with info on the identity and seating position of each member of the public so the offenders can be handed over to the police afterwards .
These administrative tasks can of course take place while waiting in line for the metal - detector , and might even come in handy to contact someone who forgot to pick up his phone after the movie ended .
The movie - goers can still enjoy a great night out if they pass all the nice security checks and they wont be bothered by any buzzing camcorders anymore .
Everyone wins really .

The Dalai Lama has visited South Africa twice before South Africa has denied the Dalai Lama a visa to attend a peace conference linked to the 2010 Football World Cup , which the country is hosting .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu has pulled out of the meeting in protest and branded the decision " disgraceful " .
A government spokesman has denied suggestions that the ban was a result of Chinese pressure .
He said he did not want anything to distract from South Africa 's hosting of the World Cup . ' Solidarity '
The Johannesburg conference is intended to discuss football 's role in fighting racism and xenophobia .
The Tibetan spiritual leader was due to attend the meeting , along with fellow Nobel laureates , Nelson Mandela , Archbishop Tutu and FW de Klerk later this week .
Mr de Klerk has also withdrawn from the event , while Mr Mandela 's position is not clear .
" It is disappointing that South Africa , which has received so much solidarity from the world , does n't want to give that solidarity to others , " Nobel Institute Director Geir Lundestad told the Associated Press news agency in Oslo , referring to the decades - long fight against apartheid .
Presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said the conference organisers had not consulted them before inviting the Dalai Lama .
Huge preparations are underway for the South Africa 2010 World Cup " The South African government does not have a problem with the Dalai Lama , " he told the local Sapa news agency .
" But at this time the whole world will be focused on the country as hosts of the 2010 World Cup .
We want the focus to remain on South Africa .
" A visit now by the Dalai Lama would move the focus from South Africa onto issues in Tibet . "
Speculation has also been rife that South Africa does not want to jeopardise its bilateral relations with China , one of its major trading partners .
" We are shamelessly succumbing to Chinese pressure , " Archbishop Tutu was quoted as telling the Sunday Independent .
" I feel deeply distressed and ashamed . "
A spokesperson for the Dalai Lama told AFP news agency he was " very disappointed " by the decision , also accusing South Africa of caving into " intense pressure " from Chinese authorities .
' Hypocrisy ' South Africa is China 's largest trading partner in Africa , with 2008 trade standing at 100bn rand ( $ 10 bn ; £ 7 bn ) .
Dai Bing , an official at the Chinese embassy in Pretoria confirmed to Sapa that Beijing had warned the South African government that allowing the Dalai Lama into the country would harm bilateral relations .
Local newspaper , Business Day , quoted an unnamed government official as saying : " The Chinese government would not have been happy had we let him come ...
We would not do anything to upset the relationship we have with China . "
But this was denied by Mr Masebe , who said China had played no role in the government 's decision .
Beijing says the Dalai Lama is pushing for Tibetan independence , and has stirred up unrest in the region .
But the Dalai Lama , who fled to India in 1959 during an uprising against Chinese rule , has said he only wants limited autonomy for his homeland .
The refusal has also drawn criticism of the government from South Africa 's opposition groups .
Independent Democrats leader Patricia de Lille accused the government of hypocrisy , and says the episode shows that there is no consistency in the country 's foreign policy .
Democratic Alliance spokesperson Tony Leon said the decision " flies in the face of all logic " , Sapa reports .
The Dalai Lama has visited the country on two previous occasions , in 1999 and 2004 .

Bailed - out insurance giant American International Group gave retention bonuses of $ 1 million or more to 73 employees in the latest round of payments , New York Atty .
Gen. Andrew Cuomo said today .
And 11 of the people who received million - dollar bonuses no longer work for the company -- even though the payments were specifically aimed at retaining them , Cuomo said .
The new bombshells about AIG ’s bonuses are in a letter Cuomo sent to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) .
" These payments were all made to individuals in the subsidiary whose performance led to crushing losses and the near - failure of AIG , " Cuomo said in the letter .
" Thus , last week , AIG made more than 73 millionaires in the unit which lost so much money that it brought the firm to its knees , forcing a taxpayer bailout .
" Something is deeply wrong with this outcome . "
AIG , now 80 % - owned by the government after a series of bailouts that began last September , nonetheless paid out more than $ 160 million in retention bonuses beginning late last week -- despite congressional and White House protests .
The company said its hands were tied because the payments had been guaranteed in employment contracts predating the bailout .
Cuomo , who has subpoenaed AIG to provide names of all bonus recipients , said he had obtained copies of the contracts .
" The contracts shockingly contain a provision that required most individuals ’ bonuses to be 100 % of their 2007 bonuses , " Cuomo told Frank .
" Thus , in the spring of last year , AIG chose to lock in bonuses for 2008 at 2007 levels despite obvious signs that 2008 performance would be disastrous in comparison to the year before .
My office has thus begun to closely examine the circumstances under which the plan was created . "
-- Tom Petruno
Republicans are desperate to keep Al Franken out of the Senate .
How desperate ?
Threatening “ World War III ” desperate :
Texas Sen. John Cornyn is threatening “ World War III ” if Democrats try to seat Al Franken in the Senate before Norm Coleman can pursue his case through the federal courts .
Cornyn , the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , acknowledges that a federal challenge to November ’s elections could take “ years ” to resolve .
But he ’s adamant that Coleman deserves that chance — even if it means Minnesota is short a senator for the duration .
A three - judge panel is expected to rule any day now on legal challenges to the November election .
This is beyond appalling .
The Senator from Texas wants to keep the people of Minnesota from being fully represented .
The GOP leaders want to delay this as long as possible .
They ’re using every legal trick in the book , which is almost funny since the Republicans are always bashing what they deem to be frivolous lawsuits .
The GOP ’s reason has nothing to do with fairness or counting the votes .
It ’s about political power :
Without Franken in the Senate , the Democrats hold a 58 - 41 vote advantage over the GOP ; getting to 59 - 41 sooner rather than later would make it easier to move President Barack Obama ’s agenda through Congress .
That ’s it in a nutshell .
Someone needs to ask Senator Cornyn just what “ World War III ” means ?
The Great SOCPA Section 165 Scam ( UK only )
Perhaps the most well - known provision of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act is that demonstrations can only take place if authorised by the police .
But , buried in this Statute , is the provision for a wonderful money - making scam , which utilises the police ( either wittingly or unwittingly - who knows ? )
Unfortunately I discovered this scam before I discovered all the other information in relation to Statute so - called ' law ' .
If I had known then what I know now , the outcome might have been different .
The person involved , the person actually scammed , was a friend of mine .
She was driving her car .
I was merely a passenger ( actually , a ' guest ' in Common Law - but I did not know that , at the time ) .
However , this means I can write the events from personal observation .
Summary of what happened
1 ) In October 2008 she overtook a police car on the Motorway .
2 ) Blue light went on .
3 ) She pulled over on to the hard shoulder , stopped the engine , and went back to see what was wrong .
The police car had pulled up behind .
4 ) She came back saying they were going to ' do ' her for speeding .
They were checking out other things , and would let us continue after the ' checkout ' had been done .
5 ) After ' checking ' , they said they needed to seize her vehicle .
They said her licence had been ' revoked ' in 2004 .
6 ) They arranged for her car to be carted away to a Car Pound .
7 ) This was very late , on a Saturday night .
The Car Pound was not open for collections on the Sunday .
Consequently she regained her car on the Monday , as soon as possible , and was charged £ 190 by the Car Pound .
In order to achieve this she had to take documents to the police station , accompanied by another of my friends , who was insured to drive any car .
( The police released the car into his custody ) .
A point to note here is that the glass screen , which the officer sits behind , had one single notice prominently displayed .
Of all the possible things this notice could have referred to , it actually referred to Section 165 .
( So it 's big business ! )
8 ) One other point to add in this summary .
The police who stopped her said they probably would n't ' do ' her for the speeding offence .
Analysis of what happened
The police were using a computer screen in their car .
They had downloaded information from the DVLA which indicated my friend 's licence had been revoked .
Note that word , and think about it .
And that this had happened four years ago .
Note that , as well .
Please also note that my friend was fully insured , the vehicle was validly Road Taxed and MOT'd .
She has not been prosecuted for anything - even the speeding offence .
All that has actually happened is that she has been ' shaken down ' for £ 190 .
Are you smelling ' scam ' ?
Here 's why you are probably smelling ' scam '
We have to go back four years .
My friend admits that she may have had a ' run in ' , but can't remember very much about it .
She is absolutely , positively , and vehemently certain that she was never asked , by the DVLA , to send up her licence such that points could be added .
( Actually ' physically printed ' - see below how this is not , necessarily , relevant in this day & age ) .
My friend is adamant that her licence to drive is a crucial thing for her ( she has an invalid son ) and that - of all things - she would keep her licence in order as a top priority .
( I see no reason to disbelieve ) .
The likelihood is that a court awarded points for some minor offence .
The DVLA did not request her licence due to ' one department not knowing what the other department was doing ' .
Because she was not notified , she forgot all about it .
Because she did not return her licence for ' stamping ' , the DVLA revoked her licence in 2004 .
Now let 's look at some facts .
1 ) In all other matters my friend was ' legal ' .
She had never had a problem getting Insurance , Road Tax , etc .
And yet - according to the DVLA - her licence had been revoked ????
Does this make sense ?
Does this make sense when - as we know - all these agencies computer - connect these days ?
2 ) What does ' revoked ' mean ?
That 's pretty draconian , is n't it ?
It implies that she ' could never drive again ' .
What could she have possibly done to attain that state ?
Drink - driving ?
Well , this would receive a ban , for a period of time , a temporary suspension .
But revoked ?
( BTW my friend is a long way from being an alcoholic ) .
So what 's with this ' revoked ' business ?
If she had been banned in 2004 for - say - 3 years , which is a pretty stiff sentence , she would be perfectly entitled to drive in 2008 .
3 ) Anyway , she knows she was never banned .
I think someone generally knows if they get banned , do n't you ?
4 ) 3 , 6 , 9 points on a licence does not debarr anyone from continuing to drive .
It just means be very careful not to get the 12 .
5 ) In these computerized days , does it actually matter if the points are not , actually , physically printed on a licence ?
Most agencies have on - line access to one 's Driving Record .
Placing the points on the computer database , as the DVLA does , could surely be used to supercede physical printing on the piece of paper held by the Driver .
6 ) And , in any case , if physical printing is so important , surely it would warrant a ' policeman on the doorstep ' demanding said piece of paper - in the event that the DVLA do not get a posted response from the Driver ?
This whole business shrieks of , at the very least , incompetence and - at worst - a lovely scam .
It is hard to believe that , in this day and age , it is not possible for the police to accurately determine - in real time - since they have computers in their cars - whether or not a person 's licence is valid , or truly invalid .
So .
If you get stopped under Section 165 , ask a few pertinent questions , such as :
" I may have collected points on my licence , but I was never banned , I know that for a fact .
Consequently I 'm fully entitled to drive , irrespective of the word ' revoked ' on your computer screen .
Is this not the case , officer ?
That I 'm entitled to drive - unless I 've been banned ? "
" Now , I realise that you have no way of knowing the truth in this respect , but let me please explain something to you .
Something you , apparently , do n't seem to realise .
Under Common Law , which trumps the Section 165 Statute Law , the seizure of my property can only LAWFULLY occur if a Court of Law has said so . "
" Now what , specific , Court of Law has authorised you to seize my , specific , car ?
You are telling me that a Statute authorises you .
I 'm telling you that Common Law does not authorise you officer ... absent , that is , a specific Court Order - and that Common Law trumps Statute Law "
" And I 'm telling you something else .
That you need to ascertain the truth of this matter , before taking an irrevocable step .
Because , put quite simply , if you seize my car , without the authority of a Court of Law , you - personally - will be committing a serious offence .
Actually a crime . "
" A crime for which you can be fined , and possibly imprisoned .
You see officer , if you check up - and I seriously suggest you do for your own sake - you 'll see that Common Law does not recognise uniforms .
Common Law does not recognise the uniform you are wearing .
The one you think protects you .
I can assure you it does n't .
Under Common
Law each is responsible for their own actions , whatever clothes they may be wearing at the time . "
" It may be that you do not believe a word I 'm saying .
That 's up to you , of course .
All I 'm suggesting is that you fully ascertain your position and rights in this matter , and mine , before taking a step that you could seriously regret .
I 'm saying this for your benefit , as well as for mine . "
" Why do n't you check with your superiors ?
You have a radio .
You can do that right now .
Even if they have a smattering of the knowledge of the law , they will tell you to ' hold on a bit ' ' .
Try it . "
" And , if they have the Internet - which I 'm sure they do - they can read FMOTL.com - right here and now - which explains it sufficiency well as to - at the very least - set some alarm bells ringing in someone 's head .
Alarm bells that would suggest what I 'm saying could very well be correct , and that you should check the situation out a lot more thoroughly before having my car towed away .
I 'll quite happily wait while they do that .
It would only take them a quarter of an hour , or so . "
" And , while we are waiting , I suggest that you should seriously consider what that word ' revoked ' means .
The one on your screen .
And how , it can possibly have any actual meaning at all .
If it said ' banned ' or ' temporarily suspended ' , one could visualise it having a reasonable meaning .
But what , in heaven 's name , could I possibly have done , such as to have my licence REVOKED ?
Revoked , officer , has the same root as the word IRREVOCABLE .
As in ' I could never drive again ' "
" In summary , officer , you would be acting UNLAWFULLY , and YOU could be prosecuted , for seizing my car without the authority of a court .
If there were to be a Court Hearing , the number of points on my licence would be established correctly .
If it turns out that I have 12 points or more , then the Court would issue authority , to you , to LAWFULLY seize my car .
If it turns out that I have less than 12 points , the Court would agree that I was still perfectly entitled to drive .
Is this not the case ? "
" That 's why we have courts , officer .
Is n't it ?
Is n't that precisely why we have courts .
Yes ? "
" And , if I may , I 'll add one further point .
You stopped me while I was driving .
You say that I 'm not entitled to drive .
In that case you should be booking me for driving without a licence - as well as seizing this vehicle .
And you have n't mentioned this , have you ?
How can that be ?
How can it be that you can just seize the car , without also charging me with driving without a licence ?
I suggest that you know , by experience , that I 'm perfectly entitled to drive , and that the DVLA information is simply out of date or erroneous .
How many times have you stopped someone , seized their vehicle , and yet NOT CHARGED WITH DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENCE ? "
" On the other hand you know that charging me with driving without a licence wo n't stick .
That can be the only reason why you are not bothering to do that .
And that means you must be aware you have no authority to seize my car , for the same reasons . "
" Officer , acting on erroneous information will be no defence if you are charged with UNLAWFULLY seizing my property .
For the simple reason that you should have established the veracity of the information , before taking action . "
" In summary , and with due respect , I suggest that you need to establish exactly how many points are attached to my licence before taking any action .
If you can't do that , then your best , and safest , bet would be to book me on the assumption that I 'm driving without a licence , and to let me continue on my way , and to let a Court of Law decide the matter .
I 'm sure a court will impose a stiffer penalty if - upon investigation - it is established that I truly am diving while unlicenced . "
( They know the score .
They are not stupid .
They know , deep down )
If the policeman insists that s/he has to apply SOCPA Section 165 then point out
" Officer .
That is a Statute .
It is the law - of - the - sea .
And we are on dry land .
SOCPA , therefore , has no applicability .
You are way outside your lawful authority and any jurisdiction .
You may not know or understand it , but I do .
And I will make sure my rights are upheld .
That 's a promise .
And , because you and your colleague are personally taking this action , then it is you and your colleague I will hold personally responsible .
I 've given you many reasons to check up on your proposed actions , so you cannot claim you have not been told .
You need to discover the immense difference between Statutes and Law . "
If they respond " Are you a Lawyer then ? " , the response is " No , but I understand Common Law , and you - quite obviously - do n't "
( Note : There are a few Policemen who actually know all this .
And they shake their heads in disgust at it all .
However they are outnumbered / swamped by colleagues who have no idea what they are doing .
We must support these few decent Coppers , by supporting ourselves .
They will gain strength from actions we take , such as this )

Kyrgyzstan 's president has told the BBC " the doors are not closed " concerning talks over the US airbase which is due to close .
The Manas base is critical to US and Nato operations in Afghanistan .
Kurmanbek Bakiyev said negotiations with Washington would have to take a different format , and cover new conditions of use .
His latest remarks , the first since announcing the closure last month , have yet to draw an American response .
President Bakiyev said the old agreement on the use of the base was no longer valid but Kyrgyzstan was open to negotiation .
" We are ready for any new proposals from the US government aimed at stabilising the situation in Afghanistan . "
Our partners - be it the United States or Russia - should listen to what we have to say
President Kurmanbek Bakiyev
The US has already said that it would look at what it could offer to keep the base open - but was not prepared to pay any price .
Kyrgyz MPs have already passed a bill on the closure , and the US is actively exploring alternative supply routes .
Kyrgyzstan 's parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of closing the strategic US air base .
President Bakiyev has suggested that peace talks be held in Kyrgystan under the auspices of the United Nations between President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Taliban leaders .
" We should be respected more , " he said in his BBC interview .
" Our partners - be it the United States or Russia - should listen to what we have to say . "
See map of existing and possible supply routes in the region " We decided to close the base because our proposals have been ignored for years and I do n't consider such relations as being equal . "
Mr Bakiyev said at the time of the announcement that the base would be closed because Washington had refused to pay more rent for it .
Militant threat Thousands of US soldiers pass through the Manas base every month on their way in and out of Afghanistan .
It is also home to the large tanker aircraft that are used for airborne refuelling of fighter planes on combat missions , and it serves as a key supply hub .
MANAS AIRBASE IN FIGURES
Two hours ' flight time from Kabul 15,000 US soldiers pass through every month on their way in and out of Afghanistan Houses 1,000 US soldiers alongside 100 Spanish and French troops
Home of large tanker aircraft used for in - air refuelling of fighter planes 3,294 refuelling missions flown in 2008 providing 11,419 aircraft with fuel over the skies of Afghanistan
For the US , the decision comes at a critical moment , as the new administration of President Barack Obama plans a sharp rise in the number of its troops in Afghanistan .
With supply lines to Afghanistan via Pakistan increasingly threatened by militant attacks , Washington has intensified talks with other countries in the region .
Uzbek President Islam Karimov has said the US will be allowed to transport non-military supplies through his country , which has rail links with Afghanistan .
The US has also reached similar deals with Russia and Kazakhstan .
Washington used to have an air base in Uzbekistan that served troops operating in Afghanistan .
But Uzbek authorities closed it in 2005 after criticism from the US and EU over a crackdown on a mass protest in the town of Andijan .
EXISTING / POSSIBLE SUPPLY ROUTES TO TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN 1 .
Manas airbase : the only US base in Central Asia , a vital transit point for Nato and US operations .
Kyrgyz government wants it closed .
2 . Karshi-Khanabad airbase : US forces were ordered out in 2005 .
Uzbekistan may agree to allow it to be used for non-military transports .
3 . Bridge over Panj river : part - funded by the US , it was completed in 2007 .
May serve as another supply route into Afghanistan .
4 . Khyber Pass : most supplies to US and Nato troops come through Pakistan .
Increasing number of attacks in the area mean the US army is looking for back - up routes .

NEW YORK  Citigroup has struck a deal that allows it to shore up a key financial measure while giving the government up to a 36 % stake in the beleaguered bank , vs. 8 % now .
The deal is the government 's third major effort to turn around Citigroup ( C ) , the nation 's third - largest bank by assets .
Already , the government holds $ 45 billion of preferred shares in Citigroup and has agreed to share losses on $ 301 billion of troubled bank assets .
In the latest action , the government will exchange some of its preferred shares in Citigroup for common shares , matching the actions of private investors , including The Government of Singapore Investment Corp. , Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal , Capital Research Global Investors and Capital World Investors .
WHO HAS GOTTEN BAILOUT MONEY : Sortable list of banks , other financial companies .
In a conference call Friday , Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said the company has gotten a commitment from " almost all of the large private shareholders that they will participate in this conversion . "
The conversion of shares from preferred to common will not require more taxpayer money .
The conversion boosts a key measure of financial health for Citigroup : tangible common equity .
Investors and the government have been increasingly turning to this yardstick to gauge banks ' financial health , and their capital on hand .
That should help Citi with the government 's " stress test " of its financial condition .
Tangible common equity , also known as tangible equity capital or sometimes tangible common book value , is defined as book value , minus intangible assets , goodwill , and preferred equity , according to Wikinvest .
" Tangible common equity can be considered the most conservative valuation of a company and the best approximation of the company 's value should it be forced to liquidate , " the definition says .
The conversion of preferred stock to common shares , however , does dilute the value of existing Citi common stock .
And as part of the agreement , Citi will suspend dividends on both its common stock and its preferred shares , which will help the bank conserve cash .
Citi will also reshape its board of directors , by installing a majority of new , independent directors .
And it will record a goodwill impairment charge of about $ 9.6 billion in the fourth quarter because of the deteriorating global economic situation .
The goodwill charge was added to Citi's 2008 results along with a $ 374 million impairment charge tied to its Nikko Asset Management unit .
The charges resulted in Citi revising its 2008 loss to $ 27.7 billion , or $ 5.59 per share .
The government 's talks to expand its stake in Citigroup had raised concern that the banking system or key banks would have to be " nationalized " to restore them to health .
Citigroup CEO
Vikram Pandit said this deal with the government " should put that concern ( about nationalization ) to rest . "
Pandit said Friday , " This securities exchange has one goal — to increase our tangible common equity ... an important measure .
This transaction — which requires no additional investment from U.S. taxpayers — does not change Citi 's strategy , operations or governance . "
Federal officials have said they do not want to nationalize major U.S. banks , though they might have to temporarily take a large stake in some big banks .
Earlier this week bank regulators , including the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve , detailed plans to " stress test " 19 large lenders — those with assets of $ 100 billion or more — to determine whether they have enough cushion to survive a sharper downturn in the global economy .
At the conclusion of the stress tests , expected by the end of April , regulators will tell the banks how much capital they need and will commit to provide federal aid , by buying preferred shares that could later be converted into common stock .
But before that , banks will be given six months to see if they can instead raise capital from private sources .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also said Thursday that the number of problem U.S. banks has spiked , and voted today to increase premiums it charges to lenders , to replenish its insurance fund .
The FDIC , through 2009 , will insure 100 % of non-interest - bearing accounts , such as those used by small businesses to process payroll .
Other accounts are insured up to $ 250,000 .
President Obama has said the government may need more money , above the $ 700 billion in last year 's financial rescue law .
The White House budget plan released Thursday included a $ 250 billion reserve that could support up to $ 750 billion in new aid — though the administration has not yet decided how much will be needed .
The banking crisis is being felt worldwide .
The World Bank Group , European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development jointly announced Friday that they will provide up to 25.4 billion euros to support Eastern Europe 's banking sector .
Investors sent shares of Citigroup plunging on anxiety about the deal .
Citi shares fell 42.7 % , or $ 1.05 , to $ 1.50 a share .

I keep saying the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians .
People think I ’m joking , but who would ’ve guessed that computer engineers would ’ve been the sexy job of the 1990s ?
Varian then goes on to say :
The ability to take data – to be able to understand it , to process it , to extract value from it , to visualize it , to communicate it ’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades , not only at the professional level but even at the educational level for elementary school kids , for high school kids , for college kids .
Because now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data .
So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it .
I think statisticians are part of it , but it ’s just a part .
You also want to be able to visualize the data , communicate the data , and utilize it effectively .
But I do think those skills – of being able to access , understand , and communicate the insights you get from data analysis – are going to be extremely important .
Managers need to be able to access and understand the data themselves .
And you thought it was hard to make sense of your own little checkbook with each month 's statement .
The omnibus budget bill passed by the House today funds most of the federal government for this entire fiscal year , which actually began more than two months ago .
The bill costs $ 516 billion , plus more money yet to be added for Iraq .
It is more than 3,000 pages long , an unwieldy package that would normally be contained in 11 separate bills .
( The Pentagon budget was passed separately . )
Now , the Roll Call newspaper reveals on its subscription - only website that this mammoth spending bill also includes nearly 9,000 earmarks , special provisions originated by individual legislators to benefit someone or something back home and buried inside a larger bill for a legislative ride relatively free of public scrutiny .
Earmarks for $ 136,000 here , $ 250,000 there , $ 1 million over there and a lot more sprinkled throughout .
Just listing them took 700 spreadsheets .
Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates that the 8,983 special earmarks will cost taxpayers more than $ 7.4 billion , though additional costs will become apparent in coming months .
Democrats boasted the earmark number was smaller than last year , but it still works out to 20 special spending provisions for each House member .
Do you think these earmarks might get mentioned by incumbents campaigning for reelection next year ?
" It ’s totally fiscally irresponsible to lump everything together in one spending bill and put it to a vote less than 24 hours later , ” said David Williams , vice president of policy for Citizens Against Government Waste .
“ It does n’t have to be this way .
They had all year to do this . "
It must be the fault of that long vacation the Iraqi parliament took last summer that got similarly vacationing American legislators so hot and bothered .
Anyway , it 's a darned good thing we had all that talk and all those promises by new Congressional leaders about earmark reform earlier this year .
Otherwise , this earmark business could have become costly and stayed out of control .

Seeking " review " of sentence imposed on mom who battered sex offender
This ABC News account of the state sentence given to a mom who battered a sex offender with a baseball bat has me thinking hard about what kind of sentence I might have given to the defendant in the case .
The ABC News story is headlined " Mother Who Beat Sex Offender : ' I 'd Do It Again ' : Tacoma Woman Sentenced to Three Months in Jail for the Attack , " and here are the details of the crime and punishment that got me to thinking :
Was Tammy Gibson protecting her young daughter or just beating up a neighbor , unprovoked ?
Either way , she will now spend three months behind bars for taking a baseball bat to a sex offender last summer who was talking with her daughter .
Gibson said she has no remorse for the June 19 assault but pleaded no contest Friday to assault charges .
She could have received as much as eight months in jail , but the judge sentenced her to three .
" No , I 'd do it again if not better , " she told ABC News Seattle affiliate KOMO - TV .
" I do n't care if it hurts me , I do n't regret it .
It got him away from my kids and all the other kids in the neighborhood . "
According to police documents , Level - 3 sex offender William A. Baldwin had moved into his uncle 's home in Tacoma in early June .
Following his move , county deputies distributed flyers around the neighborhood to alert residents of his presence .
On June 19 , Gibson went to the house in the trailer park and asked for Baldwin .
When Baldwin stepped outside , she claimed she was going to kill him because Baldwin had molested her children .
Gibson then proceeded to hit Baldwin repeatedly with her bat , the document said , leaving him with an injured arm .
" I kept swingin ' and swingin ' , and swingin' , " Gibson told investigators .
Contrary to what she had said to Baldwin , Gibson later told investigators Baldwin had not molested her children .
But she did say that she recognized Baldwin from the flyer as the man who had chatted up her then - 10 - year - old daughter during the previous summer .
Baldwin is the memorable height of 7 feet , 3 inches tall .
" For him to be right there , in front of my house and talking to my child -- made me crazy , " she told KOMO .
" And I told him I thought he was a piece of crap and I smacked him , " she added .
" I just did n't stop hitting him .
I just told him that ' if it were up to me , I 'd kill ya . " '...
The daughter she was protecting was in tears during the sentencing on Friday .
" He tried to give me fireworks and I would n't take it , " the girl , Renee Maria Perez , said of Baldwin .
Gibson 's other daughter , Rachael Porter , added , " I think it 's crap ; that she was protecting her kids like she should have been .
They locked her up for way too long . "
Gibson said she hoped that the attention created by her case would lead to a change in the laws regarding released sex offenders .
" I would hope that me doing this and going to jail would change something , change some kind of law , change something where people like him can't be standing around little kids you know what I mean ? "
Gibson said in her interview with KOMO - TV .
" It 's not right , it 's not fair to the kids at all . "
Because the defendant here shows no remorse for her vigilantism and seem eager to champion the right of this kind of violent behavior , I am more than a bit concerned that a three - month jail term is not a truly effective or sensible sentence .
In my view , this case calls out for some kind of alternative sentencing / shaming scheme in which the defendant can be educated more fully about the reality of sex offending and existing sex offender laws and also have an opportunity to reflect on the risks to society if every individual citizen feels justified to act on their fears in violent ways .
I am very sympathetic to the concerns of parents who are eager to protect their kids from serious threats ( this is why , for example , I am a vocal advocate for tougher drunk - driving sentences and a big supporter of the work of groups like MADD ) .
But there is every reason to think that modern sex offender laws ( including national registration and notification requirements ) already do a pretty good job empowering parents to deal with real risks in responsible law - abiding ways .
And , especially since I surely make my students crazy all the time in class , I am worried about a world in which persons feel justified violently attacking anyone who " makes them crazy " without first seeking to employ more socially valuable ways to express their concerns and fears .
UPDATE : Scott over at Simple Justice has lots of deep thoughts about this case in this long post .

It makes me a little crazy when reporters do n't answer questions that seem obvious to me , like " what was this guy 's original offense ? " , " what does ' level - 3 sex offender mean in Washington ? " , " was the guy still on probation / parole ? " , and " if so , was he violated on his probation / parole for approaching a young child ? "
I mean , obviously , the non-vigilante way to handle this is to report to the authorities that this guy , who is supposedly being closely monitored , is doing things that he presumably is not allowed to do , like chatting up little kids , and push the authorities to investigate / enforce some type of consequences .
It would be interesting to know if such investigation / consequences happened here .

@anon :
Washington 's definition of Level III sex offenders is :
These offenders pose a potential high risk to the community and are a threat to re-offend if provided the opportunity .
Most have prior sex crime convictions as well as other criminal convictions .
Their lifestyles and choices place them in this classification .
Some have predatory characteristics and may seek out victims .
They may have refused or failed to complete approved treatment programs .
http://ml.waspc.org/FAQ.aspx
And this particular guy is convicted of " Child Molestation - 1 " .
http://ml.waspc.org/offender.aspx?pid=935945&name=Baldwin,%20William%20Allen&address=12xx%20Everett%20Ave%20-&city=Everett%20&zip=98201
The statute ( RCW 9A.44.083 ) reads :
A person is guilty of child molestation in the first degree when the person has , or knowingly causes another person under the age of eighteen to have , sexual contact with another who is less than twelve years old and not married to the perpetrator and the perpetrator is at least thirty - six months older than the victim .
As to my own view , I sympathize with the mother , but do n't we have much more civilized ways of doing things ?

Civilly - Commit her ... she is clearly disordered ;)

If I remember correctly Michael Baldwin 's conviction was in the 1998 which meant he was about 14 years old at the time .
Who is the real danger ?
Posted by : lawdoc | Mar 2 , 2009 6:20:00 PM
Did these sex offenders " employ " God , ethics , and / or respect before attacking their victims ?
This sickness needs to stop .
the fear must be redistributed back to the criminal as a deterant and to fear ( God ) eternal justice !
Posted by : Mandy | Mar 3 , 2009 12:55:46 AM
The mother is arguably a certifiable moron and certainly a danger to society and her name should be on some registry specially created for people like her .
People might like to know that they live near someone prone to exceptional violence who is prone to taking the law into her own hands .
One reader asks what Level III means .
The answer is that it refers to a crude system of classification by alleged experts making intuitive , off - the - cuff judgments concerning the dangerousness of the offenders .
It lacks all scientific basis .
In many cases , perhaps most , Level III offenders ought to be classified as Level II offenders .
Level I offenders are among the most abused members of society and face worse discrimination than people released from prison after serving time for murder , rape or robbery .
Pickpockets , burglars and an assortment of other offenders are far more likely to be recidivists than Level I sex offenders and their crimes are at least as despicable .

Of course , Sidney , I am sure you'd be cool if you had little kids and lived near a sex offender , like , I do n't know , Lawrence Singleton .
I get that people cannot do what this woman did , and she should spend some time in jail , but people rightly fear sex offenders and feel powerless .

Python descriptors are great for customizing access to attributes on a class or instance .
They are a big win for tasks like mapping Python objects to data from non-Python sources ( such as SQL ) , since mapped attributes will need to be encoded / decoded and connected to other attributes in some way .
Below is a very simple descriptor ; as you can see , accessing it from both the class and the instance invoke the descriptor protocol :
class Test ( object ) : pass class Descriptor ( object ) : def __get__ ( self , instance , owner ) : return " Hello , world . " >>> Test.x = Descriptor ( ) >>>
Test .x ' Hello , world . ' >>> test = Test ( ) >>> test .x ' Hello , world . '
However , in order to add descriptors to an object , they must be added to the object ’s class .
Descriptors added to an instance do not invoke the descriptor protocol :
>>> test.y = Descriptor ( ) >>> test.y < __main__.Descriptor object at 0x16fe810 >
This means that creating an instance with dynamic ( determined at runtime ) descriptors requires either the heavy - handed approach of generating a class just for that object ( since adding descriptors to its class will add them to all other instances of the class ) , or the ad - hoc approach of redefining getattr / setattr behavior ( essentially re-implementing your own descriptor protocol ) .
It turns out the latter approach is not as messy as it first sounds .
Below is a class that enables “ instance descriptors ” :

Fiorenzo Magni , a bridge between the legendary past and the modern era of cycling
By Valeria Paoletti and Bill McGann
Fiorenzo Magni photo gallery
Battered and riding with a broken collarbone , Magni could n't pull on the bars so he gripped a length of inner tube in his teeth in the 1956 Giro
This interview was conducted in January , 2006 .
Fiorenzo Magni passed away October 19 , 2012 .
We 've left the introduction as we wrote it in 2006 .
Modern cycling owes a lot to Fiorenzo Magni .
This great man displayed a virtuosity and versatility that is part of a long - gone age in cycling .
He is a three - time winner of both the Tour of Flanders and the Giro d'Italia .
Remarkably , he walked out on the Tour de France while wearing the Yellow Jersey .
This distinguished 86 - year old man raced toe to toe with some of the greatest champions in the history of the sport : Coppi , Bartali , Geminiani , Bobet , Kubler and Koblet .
But more than that , he changed the face of cycling by bringing sponsors to cycle racing from outside the bike trade .
His way of winning was almost Merckxian .
He would attack , and if that assault did n't succeed he would attack again .
He would continue to batter away until the peloton capitulated .
His application of pure power yielded a list of wins that included , in addition to the races listed above , the Tour of Tuscany , the Baracchi Trophy , the Italian Championship , Milan - Turin and many others .
As he notes in the interview below , his list of wins is particularly eloquent because he was riding during a golden age , when the men he had to beat were true giants .
And by being able to beat them , he was a giant himself .
In reading the interview , one is struck by two things , and perhaps they are parts of his same big heart and character .
First , he is fully accepting of the occasional bad cards fortune dealt him .
He does n't place blame , sound vindictive , nor does he express a desire for a replay .
Second , he is very generous in his praise of others , even when their success consigned him to a lesser status in cycling 's history .
Today Signor Magni is a busy man , running a large car dealership in Monza , a town just east of Milan , and is the president of the new cycling museum next to the Madonna del Ghisallo church near Como , Italy .
When I met him on a snowy day in January , 2006 , I was impressed by his sturdiness and by his strong personality .
He introduced me to his wife and two daughters and invited me into his office where he keeps souvenirs of the fondest memories of his extraordinary career .
He showed me that cycling in the 50s had more fans than Soccer ( the big sport in today 's Italy ) and how his Giro wins made a bigger splash in the newspapers ' headlines than a soccer championship won by Milan or Juventus .
Magni's career is so full of interesting details that I would have talked with him all day .
His commitments to the soon - to - be - opened - museum gave us only one intense hour filled with his talk of a legendary era of cycling .
Valeria Paoletti : Before we go over your fantastic career and your memories of the great riders of the 1940s and 1950s I would like to talk about one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of cycling , your abandonment of the 1950 Tour de France .
So that readers can understand the circumstances , let 's step back just a bit .
In the Spring of 1950 you had won the Tour of Flanders for the second year in a row as well as coming in 3rd in Paris - Roubaix and you came in 6th in the Giro .
The Giro win included a solo victory in the 16th stage to Campobasso where you left Bartali , Kubler and Koblet behind .
Would it be safe that when you started the Tour you were in superb form ?
Fiorenzo Magni : Yes , safe enough .
( Signor Magni smiles ) .
VP : There were two Italian teams at the Tour , the " A " team with Gino Bartali and a " B " team called the " Cadets " .
In which team you where riding ?
Was it agreed upon by the Italian team that you and the Cadets would all ride for Bartali , or you were given freedom race for your own victories ?
FM : I was in the " A " team .
We all rode for Bartali , but I was still given freedom .
I have always been allowed the freedom to seek my own victories , except for the episode we are talking about .
VP : So let 's go to that fateful stage 11 that went from Pau to St. Gaudens , crossing the Aubisque , Tourmalet and the Aspin .
The Italians had so far won half the stages of that year 's Tour .
The French spectators watching the race along the mountain roads were in a bad , surly mood because the French had not won the Tour since 1947 and it looked like 1950 would not be a winning year for them either .
At the top of the Aspin , at the front of the race , Bartali and Jean Robic crashed into a photographer .
Robic remounted but Bartali was surrounded by angry spectators .
Bartali said he was kicked , punched and insulted .
Can you tell us about this ?
Did you see this happen ?
FM : I did n't see it , but many others , journalists and men from the other teams , saw what happened .
And I believe what Bartali said .
VP : After the crowd was dispersed you and Bartali chased the field and caught the leaders , Bobet , Geminiani and Ockers , gaining back the 12 minutes you needed to take the overall lead from Bernard Gauthier .
That day you got 9th in the stage but you were now in Yellow , ahead of Swiss rider Ferdy Kubler by two and a half minutes !
FM : That was quite something , was n't it ?
VP : But after the end of the stage Bartali , furious at his treatment at the hands of the crowd when he crashed , decided to quit the Tour and wanted both Italian squads to quit as well .
What happened that evening ?
Fiorenzo Magni today , in his office in his car dealership .
Valeria Paoletti photo
FM : Bartali has always been a combative man , a true fighter .
If he made this decision it was because it was no longer safe for the Italians to race .
He was concerned about the situation .
VP : What was your relationship with Bartali like at that time ?
FM : It was good , as it has always been .
My abandonment was because of Bartali 's decision , which was shared by the team manager Alfredo Binda and by the Italian Federation .
VP : What were your emotions ?
How did you feel about this , since you were the Yellow Jersey ?
FM : Of course I felt bad about that but I believe that there are bigger things than a technical result , even one as important as winning the Tour de France .
VP : It 's written that Binda gave you the freedom that evening to continue to ride the Tour for victory .
True ?
Who made the decision then ?
FM : Binda and the Italian Federation made the decision , on Bartali 's suggestion .
VP : Did you feel that asking you to make this sacrifice was fair ?
FM : I stuck to the rules and accepted their decision .
In my life I have never pretended to have a role that was not mine .
When they decided to withdraw I did n't pretend that I would go on in the race alone .
This would n't be my style .
VP : The next morning at 8 you announced your withdrawal .
Would you do it again today ?
FM : I would do just the same thing today .
VP : Do you think you would have won the Tour ?
FM : That 's another story .
Hindsight is easier than foresight !
I think I had a good chance of winning .
But I think that saying now that I would have won would not be very smart .
I did n't like renouncing the Yellow Jersey , of course !
But I respected the rules and I am happy that I did it .
VP : And your relationship with Bartali remained good after all this , did n't it ?
FM : Yes , absolutely .
VP : Let 's step back to 1948 now .
You won that Giro by a razor thin margin of 11 seconds .
This would have been the first of 3 Giro victories and was accompanied by whistles and controversy .
FM : Yes , it was .
VP : Was this due to what happened during the 17th stage to Trento , with the Falzarego and Pordoi passes ?
Coppi won the stage and you took the Pink .
But it seems that you were helped with some pushes by other riders .
The judges handed you a penalty of 2 minutes .
Coppi felt this was not enough and that the judges were helping you .
He decided to quit with all his team ( Bianchi ) .
What happened ?
FM : I do n't think this was the reason why Coppi quit , I was Coppi 's friend and , as with Bartali , nothing changed between us after this episode .
I do n't know why he withdrew .
VP : Why your victory was accompanied by whistles then ?
FM : This is what happens in sport .
That Giro's victory was a matter between me and Coppi and the spectators were torn between us .
Coppi's tifosi [ passionate fans ] showed their letdown in Milan with their whistles .
VP : Why were n't you , the Giro winner , sent to the Tour de France in 1948 ?
FM : It was a technical choice made by the Italian Federation .
Coppi did n't go either that year .
We all were sent to the Tour the year after , in 1949 .
VP : In 1949 you started that wonderful run of 3 straight Flanders victories .
You prepared your bike and equipment for the Flanders race very carefully .
I read that you used wooden rims , for their elasticity and strength , aged tubulars and foam - rubber all around the handle bar , true ?
More details ?
FM : I had never been to Belgium , but I had heard and read in the newspapers that the roads were very tough , much harder than those of the Paris - Roubaix .
Today the Tour of Flanders is not as tough as it was in my years .
So I thought it would a good idea to use wooden rims , which are less rigid than the traditional [ aluminium ] ones .
It was hard to find those rims , but I found out that Clement produced them .
Then I had a special kind of tubulars , larger and heavier than the normal ones , made .
And I put foam - rubber all around the handle bar to cushion the blows .
I repeated all of these preparations the next year , in 1950 , when I won again .
I did n't use wooden rims in 1951 .
VP : But you won all the same in 1951 , for the third time !
For a man of the Tuscan sun , Flanders seems a long , cold world away .
Yet you thrived on these tough conditions .
What was it about your body or mind that made you able to win this super tough - race ?
FM : Thanks to Mother Nature , cold , windy , rainy or snowy days were music to my ears !
It was the same with extreme heat !
I had no problems in the torrid summer days .
In all three of my Tour of Flanders ' victories I remember cold , terrible weather .
I was in my element !
VP : Let 's come to the 1949 Tour .
You rode it on the second team of Italians , the Cadets .
Did this team ride for it's own victory or in support of the Coppi / Bartali Italian team ?
FM : We were free .
But , as is fair , there was no rivalry between us .
I was in good shape .
I had skipped the Giro because of a sore throat and I was well prepared and fresh for that Tour .
VP : Yes , Stage 10 shows that !
Jacques Marinelli was wearing the Yellow Jersey .
You broke away with 3 of the greatest rides of the era , Raymond Impanis , Edouard Fachleitner and Serafino Biagioni .
How did it go ?
FM : I beat the field into Pau by 20 minutes !!
And I gained the Yellow Jersey .
The next day was a tough day .
VP : Well , it was about as tough a day of racing as can be imagined with the Aubisque , Tourmalet , Aspin and Peyresourde .
You lost 16 minutes .
What happened to you ?
Robic won .
FM : I crashed during a descent and I was seriously hurt .
VP : You still had the lead , with Fachleitner a couple of minutes behind , and you kept the Yellow Jersey until the 16th stage ( Allos , Vars , Izoard climbs ) .
There , Coppi and Bartali won their famous victory , winning together .
Did you expect to lose the Yellow there since Coppi was starting to demonstrate his strength ?
FM : I expected that .
After the crash my body weakened and I had been running a fever for many days .
I should have quit but I did n't want to and in the end I finished in 6th in General Classification .
I would have been on the podium if I had been in better health .
Magni , in the Italian Champion 's jersey ( which he won in ' 51 , ' 53 , ' 54 ) , leads Fausto Coppi .
VP : How did wearing Yellow compare to wearing Pink ?
How did racing the Tour differ from racing the Giro ?
FM : Wearing the Pink Jersey and racing in my country has always been very appealing to me .
The appealing part of the Tour was its the great organization .
Jean Gaudet was the greatest race organizer of all time .
In each of the five and half Tours that I rode , I wore the Yellow Jersey and I was always in breakaways .
So in some regards it was my race .
I can't say which one was better for me .
I liked stage races very much .
The longer I raced during the 3 weeks of the Tour , the better I felt .
VP : That was thanks to your distinctive physical strength and endurance .
FM : For sure .
But there was more .
During the weeks of a Grand Tour I lost weight and got down to 72 - 73 kilograms .
That helped a lot in the climbs , which usually came in the third week of the Giro and the Tour .
In the later years of my career I was always at the front of the race when we were in the mountains .
You may wonder why I did n't lose weight before the beginning of the Giro or Tour !
It 's not easy to lose weight and stay strong .
You can not just lose weight with a sauna for example .
VP : You are considered , with Alfredo Martini [ former pro and former Italian national team coach ] , the " Sage of the Pedal " .
How is your relationship with him ?
FM : I have known Alfredo Martini since 1936 , when we started racing .
He was my teammate at the time and then again some years later on the team Nivea .
I rode my first race with him !
He was first and I was second .
We have a fraternal friendship based on respect .
We still call each other at least twice a week .
In all these years we never had a misunderstanding .
VP : Tell me about the great tripod of Italian cycling , Fausto Coppi and Gino Bartali and you .
Your feelings and experiences ?
FM : Contrary to what one may think , I believe I had been very lucky to race with them , even if this meant winning far less often because they were so extraordinary .
But in life defeats are more likely to happen than wins .
Losing to Coppi and Bartali , and therefore congratulating them , is an experience that I am happy to have had and an experience that taught me a lot .
I recognize and I have always recognized that they were .
simply fantastic .
They were born to climb as fast as they rode on the flats .
My wife often came to races to be on the climbs to support me .
Usually she first saw them passing by , riding like motorcycles , without even breaking a sweat .
Then it was my turn and I was usually sweaty !
Coppi was my age and we were very close .
Bartali was almost my fellow citizen [ both being from nearby small cities in Tuscany ] and we met very often .
I have always admired them for what they could do and esteemed them for who they were .
Not only they were champions , they were also great men .
Why do you think we are still speaking about them ?
Because they made history .
VP : So you consider yourself lucky because racing with them you could be part of this history ?
FM : Right !
I would have won more without them but it would n't have been during a legendary cycling era !
Magni , in an undated photo .
VP : One of the most beautiful episodes of this era happened during the Giro of 1955 .
This would have been your third Giro win when you were 35 years old .
You wore Pink from the second stage through the ninth stage , then it was worn by Raphael Geminiani and then Gaston Nencini .
During the penultimate stage ( Trento - San Pellegrino ) , with Nencini in pink , you and Coppi went for an incredible breakaway of 170 km !
This was one of those exploits that make history .
Nencini got a flat on a descent and you and Coppi attacked .
It was like a 2 - man time trial .
Coppi won that stage and you took the Pink .
Is it true that the Italian radios interrupted their programs to report this break ?
FM : Yes , true .
During the break I first saw signs saying " Viva Nencini ! " .
Then people quickly changed them to " Viva Coppi ! " and " Viva Magni ! " .
After the radio had reported our break , with 80 km to go , the roads were overflowing with people .
Thousands of people were waiting for this couple of " elderly " champions .
When today I hear that a 35 - year old athlete is considered old , I smile .
It depends on the way you reach this age !
I think that my passion for cycling and my managerial spirit kept me young .
In 1951 I started my first company , " Fiorenzo Magni srl " , a motorcycle dealership .
I trained in the morning and worked for my company in the afternoon .
I could have continued racing for a many more years , but my managerial commitments started to keep me too busy .
So , after 1956 I decided to quit racing , even though I had the strength to continue .
VP : Your physical and mental strength is not common .
FM : These virtues are not mine , they are my parents ' .
Human values come first .
I have always put them before sport .
VP : Tell me about your 1954 .
You changed the face of cycling , bringing sponsors into cycling from outside the cycling world .
I heard that the manager of your team , Pino Ganna ( son of Luigi Ganna , the first Giro winner ) told you in 1953 that he could not invest more money in cycling .
Was he having a tough time ?
FM : All the cycling companies , Atala , Bianchi , Legnano , Gloria were having a tough time .
I was very friendly with the entire Ganna family but they had to stop running my team , so I was without a place .
I started to think about a solution .
I had some offers from other companies but they did n't fulfil my needs .
I though I could find something better .
I thought about this .
First of all I needed the OK from the Italian Federation and that was n't easy .
I attended the meeting of the Federation in Turin , but I was n't allowed to talk .
Luckily I had some friends who pleaded my cause and the President saw in my idea an important chance for cycling .
VP : You ended up with the Nivea face cream company .
Were they the first company you approached ?
FM : I already had contacts with the men running Nivea , so I thought about this company first .
I presented them with my program and they accepted .
VP : What were the details of the agreement ?
Do you remember the actual amount ?
Did they supply most of the money needed for the team or just part ?
FM : They gave me 20 million Italian Lire [ about 200.000 Euros or $ 260,000 in 2006 currency ] .
This money was for everything the team needed .
At the end of the year there was not much left !
But they were very generous and gave me a check for a similar amount of money plus they renewed our agreement for two more years .
VP : They liked the idea and they had a good return from all this , did n't they ?
FM : They earned big profits from this operation .
If you remember that cycling was more popular than soccer and that I was the first to do this then you can understand the success of this action .
Nivea always thanked me for my idea , even years later .
This was the beginning of the salvation of cycling .
VP : Did you know that many French think Géminiani's St - Raphaël team was the first extra-sportif sponsored team even if Geminiani did it in 1962 ?
FM : I consider France a country with a big sports tradition and culture .
I did n't know that .
Well , what can I say ?
They should know that I did it 10 years before !
VP : What was the reaction of the other sponsors ?
I heard they did n’t like your idea at all .
The French tried to ban your team from riding the Paris - Roubaix .
Is it true that you could take part in the race only thanks to Fausto Coppi 's intervention ?
FM : Yes , they did n't want me to wear my Nivea Jersey and told me that I could race only if I wore the Italian Champion 's Jersey .
But Coppi said he would not race without my wearing the Nivea jersey that day .
He understood this was the future of cycling .
The French did n't want to lose Coppi so I raced with my jersey that day and every other day !
The 3 great men .
Left to right : Fiorenzo Magni , Gino Bartali , Fausto Coppi .
VP : What is your fondest memory ?
What is what you consider your greatest win ?
FM : I consider my greatest win my second place in GC at the Giro of 1956 , my last year as a pro .
VP : You were a very brave second in that incredible Giro .
Tell us what happened .
FM : During stage 12 , from Grosseto to Livorno , I crashed on the descent out of Volterra and broke my left collarbone .
At the hospital they said I should put on a plaster cast and quit .
But I did n't want to .
Since the next day was a rest day , I told the doctor to do nothing and that we should wait and see .
The day after I asked the doctor to put on an elastic bandage instead of a cast because I wanted to try to ride the following stage , Livorno to Lucca .
It worked !
I was n't among the first riders but I finished .
VP : There is the famous picture of your riding holding a piece of inner tube in your mouth during the 13th stage , the individual time trial of San Luca .
Can you explain ?
FM : Just before the stage started I tried to ride my bike on a climb and I noticed I could n't use the muscles of my left arm to pull on the handle bar very hard .
So my mechanic , Faliero Masi , the best mechanic of all time , cut a piece of inner tube and suggested I pull it with my mouth .
That was a great idea !
VP : Then , during stage 16 , from Bologna to Rapallo , through the Apennines , you crashed again and broke your humerus .
FM : Yes , I didnt have enough strength in my left arm and I crashed after hitting a ditch by the road .
I fell on my already broken bone and fainted from the pain .
The ambulance came to bring me to the hospital .
In the ambulance they gave me water and I got back on my feet .
When I realized that I was being taken to the hospital I screamed and told the driver to stop .
I did n't want to abandon the Giro !
I mounted my bike again and restarted pedaling .
The peloton had waited for me , so I arrived in Rapallo in a relatively good position .
I had no idea of how serious my condition was , I just knew that I was in a lot of pain but I did n't want to have X - rays that evening .
During the days that followed I could hold my own .
VP : You were even able to ride the Stelvio Pass ( Stage 19 ) !
FM : Yes , there I did n't have problems on the climb , but the descent was hard .
On the climb I could go up at my own speed .
At that point my aim was just to finish the Giro , not to win it of course .
I did n't want to abandon the Giro in the year of my retirement .
VP : Why did you have problems on the descent ?
FM : Because I could not brake with my left hand and I skidded .
That was tough !
La Gazzetta dello Sport hails Magni 's second of 3 Giro wins in 1951 .
VP : Then there was Stage 20 from Merano to Trento , over the Costalunga , Rolle , Brocon and Bondone climbs .
Pasquale Fornara was the Pink Jersey .
That day 60 people abandoned !
What happened ?
FM : It snowed the whole day and it was very cold , I had not noticed how much .
Along the way I saw many bikes parked next to bars and I asked what was going on .
They told me that most of the peloton froze and had to quit .
Then , before reaching Trento I saw the Pink Jersey quitting too !
" What ??
Am I seeing things ? " I wondered .
If I were the Pink Jersey I would have continued , even if I had to walk , but I would never abandon !
VP : What happened next ?
FM : When we were in Trento my team car came up to me and said I was third .
" Third ? ! " , I wondered again .
I was third that day and became second in the GC .
VP : Gaul won that stage and went from 16 minutes behind to winning the 1956 Giro .
FM : Actually , I thought about attacking Charly Gaul in the following stages and trying to win my fourth Giro .
I tried attacking him a couple of times during the last two stages , but he was too strong .
The day after the end of the Giro I went to an institute that specialized in bone injuries .
And they gave me a dressing - down !
They said I had two fractures - I thought I had only one - and forced me to put a plaster cast on .
The next day I went to my machine shop and asked my mechanic to cut the plaster cast away with the special scissors he used for sheet metal .
This way I could start training again .
Well , my shoulder is a little crooked now , but that 's that .
Can you notice that ??
VP : No , no , I can 't !
( Signor Magni laughs ) .
After your retirement in 1956 you started a successful career as manager .
Tell me about it .
FM : To begin with I was coach of the Italian Team at the World Championships in ' 65 and ' 66 , then I was President of the Association of the Riders ( Associazione dei Corridori ) and of the Cycling League .
Then , and this was very gratifying for me , I was President of the " Azzurri d'Italia " for many years .
That means president of all the athletes , from all the sports , wearing the blue jersey of the Italian National Team .
I left all these roles after some time , even if I enjoyed them , when I felt it was time to change .
I needed to do other things and give more time to my family .
VP : You are now President of the " Fondazione Museo del Ciclismo " .
This is an association promoting the building of a new museum of cycling next to the famous Sanctuary of the " Madonna del Ghisallo " ( Como ) .
The " Madonna del Ghisallo " is considered the patron saint of cyclists and its Sanctuary contains trophies , bikes , jersey and photos from legendary champions .
There are so many donations of cycling memorabilia that the little church can't contain them anymore and you are giving those mementos a real museum .
When I visited the Sanctuary last year the new building was almost ready .
What is the status now ?
Tell us about this enterprise .
Will it be the biggest cycling museum in the World ?
FM : This museum is dedicated to cycling , not to one single champion .
It will contain the trophies and the mementos of all the greatest riders , starting from 1909 , the year of the first Giro d'Italia .
But even the riders who did n't have much luck in their careers will be remembered .
Then there will be a section for the teams and a section dedicated to the best sport journalists .
I owe a lot to the Regione Lombardia and to many sponsors , such as Mapei and Fassa Bortolo , who helped me in many ways in this big project .
I received donations from individuals , and even from other countries like the U.S. I am very grateful to all of them .
VP : How did you get this idea ?
FM : I thought that the future generations should have a memento of what cycling was and is today .
The museum will have souvenirs such as the very first Yellow Jersey and Pink Jersey .
Andrea Bartali , son of Gino Bartali , will donate it .
Then there will be a database , accessible to everybody , containing information about all the riders .
The museum and the sanctuary of the " Madonna del Ghisallo " are on the Pass of Magreglio , a spectacular spot very popular among cyclists .
So I am also working on having a Giro stage passing by the Magreglio Pass .
This museum will be the place for all people who love cycling .
Signor Magni offered me a coffee and proudly showed me pictures of his nephews .
It was nice to exchange a few words with his wife , who was next to him during all those incredible exploits .
It was snowing hard outside and I would have talked with them longer , but Mr. Magni had four more meetings that day !
He confessed that he has fun when he is busy with many different things and I am sure that this is the secret of this amazing man .

Covering Afghan women must be an especially hard task for many Western journalists .
I say this because every piece I have read about Afghan women makes them seem like they are some of the most oppressed women in the world , with little to no hope for happiness , sans intervention by a Western savior or “ Western ” inspired program of some sort .
A recent New York Times piece on Afghan women fleeing domestic violence , unfortunately , does little to break from this pattern .
Even before reading the article , the reader is already presented with a big image of the poor , oppressed Muslim woman , literally .
A picture of Mariam ( shown left ) , a woman who fled an abusive husband , is shown with her face covered by what appears to be a knitted scarf .
Reading the story , it appears that she probably had her face covered to protect her identity .
However , I still question why that image was the image to introduce the story when there were plenty of images to choose from including a few of women doing ordinary tasks .
The picture has obvious Orientalist overtones and instead of humanizing the women , Miriam included , in the story , it instead otherizes them .
We do n’t see them as victims of domestic abuse but instead as victims of a foreign Muslim culture that abuses women .
The article itself is no better .
We ’re told Miriam ’s story , which is tragic , and then we ’re basically given a spin on “ the West saved Muslim women from the Muslim brutes ” idea with this statement :
Since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 , a more egalitarian notion of women ’s rights has begun to take hold , founded in the country ’s new Constitution and promoted by the newly created Ministry of Women ’s Affairs and a small community of women ’s advocates .
You would think from this quote that there has n’t been a grassroots women rights movement in Afghanistan for decades now and long before the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001 .
However , that is n’t the case .
The wording is also troubling .
What does “ a more egalitarian notion of women ’s rights ” mean ?
If activists are fighting for women ’s rights , would n’t it be assumed that they want equality ?
Were women ’s rights activists in Afghanistan fighting for non-egalitarian rights before the U.S. invasion ?
The rest of the article highlights stories of other abused women and blames the plight of the women solely on culture , tradition , and patriarchy .
While patriarchy certainly has a part in what happened to these women , I am tired of the narrative that blames culture and does not look at other factors .
Miriam was sold to pay off the drug debt of her father .
Why is there no discussion of the abject poverty that created the condition for her to be sold ?
Why is there no discussion of the role that Western countries played in creating this poverty ?
Blaming the abuse that women receive purely on “ culture ” and “ tradition ” is very over - simplistic .
It does n’t help the reader to actually relate to the women in the article and , once again , it makes a Muslim culture look inherently oppressive and misogynist .
The article did discuss the efforts of Afghan women activists to help abused women , but it was hard to focus on these efforts in the face of an overwhelmingly biased story .
Because we ’re presented with the usual narrative of oppressed Muslim women , it ’s difficult to read the article and feel that Afghan women have much agency or hope .
The article is n’t nuanced and presents an all - t0o - familiar narrative on Afghan women .
Gordon Brown today rejected controversial proposals from the chief medical officer to establish a minimum price for alcohol , which would double the price of many beers and spirits .
The prime minister said that he would protect the interests of the " sensible majority of moderate drinkers " when responding to proposals from Sir Liam Donaldson for a minimum charge of 50 p per unit of alcohol to be imposed on beer and wine .
At a news conference this morning in Downing Street , Brown said that the government had already taken action to tackle binge drinking and underage drinking .
But he said that it was also important " to take action that is properly targeted and effective " .
The prime minister went on : " We do not want the responsible , sensible majority of moderate drinkers to have to pay more or suffer as a result of the excesses of a small minority .
And that 's the context in which we look at the problems that the chief medical officer has raised . "
Brown spoke out as Donaldson was explaining his plans , which were first reported in the papers yesterday , at the publication of his annual report .
Although the government will respond formally to Donaldson at a later date , Brown 's comments made it clear that the proposal as it stands has no chance of being adopted .
The Scottish government is planning to introduce minimum prices for alcohol and these could come into force by the end of the year .
It would make Scotland the first country in Europe to introduce minimum pricing , which would be accompanied by a ban on certain drinks promotions .
A Commons committee is to investigate the price of alcohol as part of a wider inquiry and call for evidence from Scotland .
Labour MP Kevin Barron , the chairman of the Commons health committee , said the idea at least deserved consideration even if it proved unpopular with voters .
The proposals for England and Wales , which are backed by health professionals but opposed by drink manufacturers , could double the cost of some beverages sold as " loss leaders " by supermarkets .
It would double the cost of a £ 10 pack of lager , nearly double the cost of a bottle of vodka to £ 20 and set the minimum price for a bottle of wine at £ 4.50 .
The Department of Health indicated yesterday there was little prospect of the proposal being adopted in England while households were being squeezed by the recession .
Nuffield , the UK's leading health charity , backed the proposal , saying increasing prices was the most effective way of cutting consumption .
Drink - related illnesses cost the NHS £ 3bn a year , while the total expense to the taxpayer of alcohol misuse is thought to be £ 25 bn a year .
But there was also strong opposition to the idea from those who argue that responsible drinkers would be punished for the misbehaviour of a few .
David Poley , the chief executive of the Portman Group , set up by drinks manufacturers to promote sensible drinking , said : " This would hit the pockets of hard - working families who are already struggling to make ends meet , and it would not deter those people who drink to get drunk . "
Jeremy Beadles , the chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association , which represents wine and spirits producers and wholesalers , said : " It is worrying that , in the midst of a recession when sales and consumption of alcohol are falling , that the government should be talking about raising prices for all consumers at a time when many are already struggling to make ends meet . "
James Purnell , the work and pensions secretary , said yesterday the government would not punish the responsible majority of drinkers .
He told the BBC1's Politics Show : " We want to focus on the irresponsible minority rather than I think punishing everyone equally .
Clearly we will look at Sir Liam Donaldson 's proposals .
He 's a very eminent person in his field .
" But we are very clear we do n't want to punish the majority for the sins of the minority .
I think certainly at a time of economic difficulty that looks like it would be the effect .
" We need to look at the proposals but we are saying we have no intention of going ahead with something that would punish the responsible majority . "
The shadow health secretary , Andrew Lansley , said : " Sir Liam Donaldson 's report is a frank admission that the government 's alcohol strategy has failed .
The government 's response to his report is another example of Labour 's confusion and incoherence .
" If there was an ounce of leadership from Labour ministers on this issue there would be no need for Liam Donaldson to try his shock tactics to kick - start government policy . "
He also made it clear that the Tories had no intention of putting the chief medical officer 's proposal into practice .
He added : " There is clearly a need for action .
But it is very important to recognise that to deal with this problem we need to deal with people 's attitudes and not just the supply and price of alcohol .
" Our proposals , which include measures to tackle loss - leader promotions and higher taxes on high - alcohol drinks aimed at young people , would address this without penalising the majority of moderate drinkers .
This would seem to be a much better route to go down than distorting the whole drinks market . "
The Liberal Democrats also said that " ridiculously " cheap alcohol was contributing to the problem of binge - drinking and called on the government to act .

Announcements by President Obama that his government was to ban torture , honour the Geneva conventions and close down Guantánamo Bay were greeted with delight by opponents of these notorious relics of the Bush era .
Maybe it was simply relief , a gratitude for small mercies .
But looking at how much has actually changed , maybe it was naivety .
Much was made , rightly , of the unprecedented ruling in the English high court last week when Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones made it abundantly clear they wanted evidence to be disclosed of how Binyam Mohamed , the former British resident held in Guantánamo Bay , was tortured .
But they could not order disclosure , they added , because of claims by the foreign secretary , David Miliband , that the US had threatened to stop sharing intelligence with the UK , its closest ally , if the information – obtained from US officials – was released .
And that , said Miliband , would " cause real damage to the national security and international relations interests of the United Kingdom " .
Lives may be put at risk , he claimed .
As a result material was withheld in Mohamed 's case not because the material itself was sensitive , but because America was sensitive about it .
The documents themselves could not possibly be described as " highly classified US intelligence " , the judges said , and concluded : " If the information ... which we consider so important to the rule of law , free speech and democratic accountability is to be put into the public domain , it must now be for the United States government to consider changing its position or itself putting that information in the public domain " .
Of course the Obama administration would change its position – many assumed – and Miliband 's claim that a post - Obama US was unmoved was met with disbelief .
But the valuable lesson to be learned from recent events is that , in the case of American policy – whether under Obama or not – respecting human rights and the rule of law does not necessarily involve openness .
Promising not to torture detainees does not necessarily mean releasing documents detailing the sins of the past .
It was this realisation that led to a palpable sense of disappointment when Obama 's government came to the aid of the beleaguered Miliband .
The day after the high court judgment , the British foreign secretary told the House of Commons that the US national security council " reaffirmed the longstanding position concerning the importance of protecting sensitive national security information and preserving the longstanding intelligence - sharing relationship between our two countries " .
Then on Monday , Obama 's justice department repeated the Bush administration 's policy of citing " state secrets " to prevent the release of evidence concerning extraordinary renditions – specifically , how Jeppeson Dataplan , a subsidiary of Boeing based in San Jose , California and Crawley , West Sussex , allegedly helped the CIA transfer them to countries where they faced torture .
Bush 's justice department warned against revealing the CIA 's methods in holding and interrogating terrorism suspects , as well as details of the co-operation of foreign governments .
Obama 's justice department says the same .
The new US attorney general , Eric Holder , had instructed officials to review the " state secrets " policy , a justice department spokesman said : " It is vital that we protect information that , if released , could jeopardise national security . "

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 81-23 1982.SCT.5 , 454 U.S. 370 , 102 S. Ct. 703 , 70 L. Ed. 2d 556 , 50 U.S.L.W. 3540 January 11 , 1982 HUTTO , DIRECTOR , VIRGINIA STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS , ET AL .
v. DAVIS ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT AUTHOR : PER CURIAM Respondent was convicted in a Virginia state court of possessing with intent to distribute and distribution of nine ounces of marihuana , and was sentenced to 40 years in prison as authorized by Virginia law .
After exhausting direct appeal , respondent brought an action in Federal District Court seeking a writ of on the ground that the 40 - year sentence was so grossly disproportionate to the crime that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments .
The District Court issued the writ , and , ultimately , the Court of Appeals affirmed , after its prior affirmance had been vacated by this Court and the case had been remanded for reconsideration in light of Rummel v. Estelle , 445 U.S. 263 .
Held :
By affirming the District Court 's decision after this Court 's decision in Rummel , supra -- which stands for the proposition that federal courts should be reluctant to review legislatively mandated prison terms , and successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences should be exceedingly rare -- the Court of Appeals sanctioned an intrusion into the basic line - drawing process that is properly within the province of legislatures , not courts .
More importantly , the Court of Appeals ignored the hierarchy of the federal court system created by the Constitution and Congress .
On October 26 , 1973 , law enforcement officers raided respondent 's home and seized approximately nine ounces of marihuana and assorted drug paraphernalia .
Several days before the raid , officers had tape - recorded a transaction in which respondent had sold marihuana and other controlled substances to a police informant .
With the aid of the seized evidence and the tape recording , respondent was convicted in Virginia state court of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of marihuana .
The jury imposed a fine of $ 10,000 and a prison term of 20 years on each of the two counts , the prison terms to run consecutively .
At the time of respondent 's conviction , Virginia law authorized fines of up to $ 25,000 and prison terms of not less than 5 nor more than 40 years for each of respondent 's offenses .
Davis v. Davis , 585 F.2d 1226 , 1229 ( CA4 1978 ) .
After exhausting direct appeal , respondent brought a habeas action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia , asserting that a 40 - year sentence was so grossly disproportionate to the crime of possessing less than nine ounces of marihuana that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment as proscribed by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments .
The District Court , relying primarily upon the four factors set forth in Hart v. Coiner , 483 F.2d 136 ( CA4 1973 ) , cert .
denied , 415 U.S. 938 ( 1974 ) , agreed : " After examining the nature of the offense , the legislative purpose behind the punishment , the punishment in the Commonwealth of Virginia for other offenses , and the punishment actually imposed for the same or similar offenses in Virginia , this court must necessarily conclude that a sentence of forty years and twenty thousand dollars in fines is so grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crimes as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution . "
Davis v. Zahradnick , 432 F.Supp. 444 , 453 ( 1977 ) .
Accordingly , the District Court issued a writ of .
A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed .
Davis v. Davis , supra .
The panel correctly noted that this Court " has never found a sentence for a term of years within the limits authorized by statute to be , by itself , a cruel and unusual punishment , " 585 F.2d , at 1229 , and held that respondent had failed to show that his sentence , in light of the factors known to the jury * fn1 and the punishment authorized by Virginia , was sufficiently extraordinary to violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments .
Id. , at 1233 .
The decision was short - lived .
Sitting en banc , the Court of Appeals reheard the case and , " for reasons sufficiently stated by the district judge in his opinion , " affirmed the award of habeas relief .
Davis v. Davis , 601 F.2d 153 , 154 ( 1979 ) .
We granted certiorari , vacated the judgement of the Court of Appeals , and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of our decision in Rummel v. Estelle , 445 U.S. 263 ( 1980 ) .
Sub nom .
Hutto v. Davis , 445 U.S. 947 ( 1980 ) .
The Court of Appeals again affirmed the District Court , this time by an equally divided vote .
Davis v. Davis , 646 F.2d 123 ( 1981 ) .
Because the Court of Appeals failed to heed our decision in Rummel , we now reverse .
The petitioner in Rummel was sentenced to life imprisonment under the Texas recidivist statute upon being convicted of his third felony : obtaining $ 120.75 by false pretenses .
He had previously been convicted of passing a forged check in the amount of $ 28.36 , and of fraudulently using a credit card to obtain $ 80 worth of goods or services .
445 U.S. , at 265-266 .
Like the respondent in this case , Rummel argued that the length of his imprisonment was so " grossly disproportionate " to the crime for which he was sentenced that it violated the ban on cruel and unusual punishment of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments .
In rejecting that argument , we distinguished between punishments -- such as the death penalty -- which by their very nature differ from all other forms of conventionally accepted punishment , and punishments which differ from others only in duration .
This distinction was based upon two factors .
First , this " Court 's Eighth Amendment judgments should neither be nor appear to be merely the subjective views of individual Justices . "
Id. , at 275 .
And second , the excessiveness of one prison term as compared to another is invariably a subjective determination , there being no clear way to make " any constitutional distinction between one term of years and a shorter or longer term of years . "
Ibid .
Thus , we concluded that " one could argue without fear of contradiction by any decision of this Court that for crimes concededly classified and classifiable as felonies , . . . the length of the sentence actually imposed is purely a matter of legislative prerogative . "
Id. , at 274 .
Accordingly , we held that Rummel 's life sentence did not violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
As mentioned above , the District Court found respondent 's sentence to be unconstitutional by applying the four - part test of Hart v. Coiner , supra .
Hart also was relied upon by the lower - court dissenters in Rummel , and was implicitly disapproved by our rejection of the dissenters ' view .
Not only did we expressly recognize Hart as the primary opposing authority , 445 U.S. , at 267 , 269 , but our opinion also disapproved each of its four " objective " factors .
* fn2 Because the District Court 's grant of habeas relief was clearly guided by these factors , the Court of Appeals erred in affirming .
In short , Rummel stands for the proposition that federal courts should be " to review legislatively mandated terms of imprisonment , " id. at 274 , and that " successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences " should be " exceedingly rare , " id. at 272 . * fn3
By affirming the District Court decision after our decision in Rummel , the Court of Appeals sanctioned an intrusion into the basic linedrawing process that is " properly within the province of legislatures , not courts . "
Id. , at 275-276 .
More importantly , however , the Court of Appeals could be viewed as having ignored , consciously or unconsciously , the hierarchy of the federal court system created by the Constitution and Congress .
Admittedly , the Members of this Court decide cases " by virtue of their commissions , not their competence . "
And arguments may be made one way or the other whether the present case is distinguishable , except as to its facts , from Rummel .
But unless we wish anarchy to prevail within the federal judicial system , a precedent of this Court must be followed by the lower federal courts no matter how misguided the judges of those courts may think it to be .
Accordingly , the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted , the judgement of the Court of Appeals is reversed , and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss respondent 's habeas petition .
It is so ordered .
The Honorable Justice POWELL , concurring in the judgment .
The Court holds that the Eighth Amendment countenances a prison term of 40 years and a fine of $ 20,000 for respondent 's possession and distribution of approximately nine ounces of marihuana said to have a street value of about $ 200 .
I view the sentence as unjust and disproportionate to the offense .
Nevertheless , for the reasons stated below I reluctantly conclude that the Court 's decision in Rummel v. Estelle , 445 U.S. 263 ( 1980 ) , is controlling on the facts before us .
Accordingly , I join the judgement only .
I The respondent Davis met Eads in prison .
During Eads ' confinement , his wife had become a drug user .
Concerned about this development and its effect on their 2 - year - old child , Eads offered to cooperate with the police " to assist in the exposure and arrest of those supplying drugs to his wife and any illicit drug distributor in the area , including Davis who Eads identified as an active drug dealer in Wythe County . "
Davis v. Davis , 585 F.2d 1226 , 1228 ( CA4 1978 ) .
On furlough from prison , Eads told Davis he wished to buy drugs for himself and some mutual friends currently in prison .
Shortly thereafter , the two went to Davis ' home where Davis sold Eads three ounces of marihuana for $ 74 .
Davis also gave Eads " drug pills which included L. S. D. and another illicit controlled drug . "
Ibid .
A police raid on Davis ' home later uncovered about six ounces of marihuana , two scales , and other drug paraphernalia .
Davis was found guilty of both distributing marihuana and of possessing marihuana with intent to distribute .
On each count , he received a sentence of 20 years ' imprisonment and a $ 10,000 fine .
These sentences were imposed on a consecutive basis .
The District Court granted his petition for a writ of because the sentences were " so grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crimes as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment .
. . . "
* fn1
This judgement was reversed on appeal , Davis v. Davis , supra , but reinstated by the Court of Appeals on rehearing en banc .
* fn2
We remanded for reconsideration in light of our decision in Rummel v. Estelle , supra .
* fn3
By an equally divided vote en banc , the Court of Appeals again affirmed .
* fn4 II
The sole authority upon which the Court today relies is its decision in Rummel v. Estelle .
Rummel decided that the Eighth Amendment 's proscription of cruel and unusual punishments * fn5 was not transgressed by the imposition of life imprisonment for a recidivist 's third felony , each a nonviolent fraud involving less than $ 125 .
The Court also observed , however : " This is not to say that a proportionality principle [ viz. , that grossly disproportionate punishments are unconstitutional ] would not come into play in the extreme example mentioned by the dissent , post , at 288 , if a legislature made overtime parking a felony punishable by life imprisonment . "
445 U.S. , at 274 , n. 11 .
The Rummel Court therefore did not reject the proportionality principle long settled by our cases .
* fn6
It did take such a restricted view of the principle that -- in the future -- appellate courts , duty bound to follow the decision of this Court , often will be compelled to accept sentences that arguably are cruel and unusual .
I recognize , of course , that under our system the limits of a prison sentence normally are a matter of legislative prerogative , and trial courts have the primary responsibility to determine an appropriate sentence -- within these limits -- in light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case .
Review of sentencing is not generally a function of appellate review .
Yet , our system of justice always has recognized that appellate courts do have a responsibility -- expressed in the proportionality principle -- not to shut their eyes to grossly disproportionate sentences that are manifestly unjust .
I therefore have no criticism of the District Court or the Court of Appeals for exercising this responsibility and reaching the judgments that are reversed here today .
There are features of this case that arguably distinguish it from Rummel .
I identify these briefly .
The first is a letter from the Commonwealth Attorney who successfully prosecuted Davis .
The letter is set forth in full below .
* fn7
It was solicited by Davis ' lawyer , some three years after Davis had commenced to serve his 40 - year term .
One can say , of course , that such a letter often can be obtained from a prosecutor who may have second thoughts as to the justness of a sentence he had sought at trial .
I normally would give little weight to such a letter .
But the prosecutor here , in a thoughtful letter , did advance a non-frivolous reason for his conclusion that Davis ' sentence was a " gross injustice . "
He referred to the " grave disparity in sentencing " in comparable drug offenses in the " Commonwealth [ of Virginia ] and the nation . "
* fn8
The second and more important factor that arguably distinguishes Rummel is the action of the Virginia State Legislature in 1979 .
It then reduced the maximum penalty for offenses of which Davis was convicted to 10 years on each count -- regardless of aggravating circumstances .
See Va. Code § 18.2-248.1( a) ( 2 ) ( Supp. 1981 ) and § 18.2 -10(e ) ( 1975 ) .
This maximum is less than half the sentence Davis received .
Because it sets a maximum , the legislative action takes all relevant aggravating circumstances into account .
This reduction -- five years after Davis ' conviction and two years after his prosecutor 's letter -- evidences Virginia 's present sentencing judgement that marihuana possession and distribution in small amounts no longer would justify Davis ' sentence .
* fn9
Although this change in law was not made retroactive , it is evidence from the most authoritative state source that Davis ' sentence was unjust and no longer would be valid .
III Based on this evidence of comparative sentencing and the relatively minor degree of Davis ' criminality , affirmance of the judgement of the Court of Appeals arguably could be justified .
I conclude , however , that Rummel requires reversal .
Davis was convicted of distributing marihuana , and had dealt in other drugs as well .
He was willing to sell marihuana for use by prison inmates and " probably as well to the wife of an inmate left alone with an infant child . "
585 F.2d , at 1233 .
He previously had been sentenced on a drug - related offense .
* fn10 By comparison , Rummel 's offenses -- three minor frauds involving almost trifling sums of money -- were far less serious .
Rummel 's sentence , moreover , was more severe than Davis ' .
And Davis has been unable to show -- by means of statutory comparisons -- that his sentences suffer from a greater degree of disproportionality than Rummel 's did .
Compare Davis v. Zahradnick , 432 F.Supp. 444 , 452-453 ( WD Va. 1977 ) , with 445 U.S. , at 296-302 .
These cases illustrate the seriousness of the disparity in sentencing that may distinguish our system of justice from other mature systems .
Sentencing disparity in our country primarily results not from varying statutory limits among the States .
Rather , in a nation of our size and with the sentencing decision in particular cases vested -- as it should be -- in trial courts , a good deal of disparity is inevitable .
Effort to minimize this , at least on a state - by - state basis , certainly should be continued .
Nor should reform in this respect be addressed only to prevent excessive penalties .
The criticism of courts occurs more frequently , often fully justified , when persons guilty of crimes of violence , or serious drug distribution offenses , are given sentences that are disproportionately light in view of their offenses , as well as disparate in comparison with other sentences .
Sentencing that is just should take into account the paramount interest of society in being protected from criminal conduct as well as the right of convicted persons to be dealt with fairly according to law .
I join the judgement of the Court .
The Honorable Justice BRENNAN , with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS join , dissenting .
The increasingly alarming penchant of the Court inappropriately to invoke its power of summary disposition could not be more evident than in this case .
With the benefit of neither full briefing nor oral argument , the Court holds that Rummel v. Estelle , 445 U.S. 263 ( 1980 ) , precluded the courts below from holding that respondent has been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments .
Rummel considered whether the application of the Texas habitual offender statute to petitioner William Rummel constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment .
The Texas statute prescribed a mandatory life sentence following a third conviction on a felony charge .
Rummel became subject to this provision in 1973 , when he was convicted of obtaining $ 120.75 by false pretenses , then a felony under Texas law .
On two earlier occasions , Rummel had been convicted of felonies under Texas law : in 1964 for fraudulently using a credit card to obtain $ 80 worth of goods or services , and in 1969 for passing a forged check in the amount of $ 28.36 .
Rummel argued that the imposition of a mandatory life sentence in his case amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment , as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment , see Robinson v. California , 370 U.S. 660 , 667 ( 1962 ) .
The Court rejected Rummel 's constitutional attack .
While noting that " one could argue . . . that for crimes concededly classified and classifiable as felonies , . . . the length of the sentence actually imposed is purely a matter of legislative prerogative , " 445 U.S. , at 274 , the Court adopted a much narrower basis for decision , holding that , in the context of Texas ' habitual offender statute , the imposition of a life sentence on Rummel served the legitimate state interests of deterring recidivism and of segregating habitual offenders " from the rest of society for an extended period of time . "
Id. , at 284 .
Because this narrower ground was chosen , the Court found it unnecessary to decide whether the Eighth Amendment would have been violated if , in the absence of the habitual offender statute , a life sentence had been imposed on Rummel " merely for obtaining $ 120.75 by false pretenses . "
Id. , at 276 .
The Court stated in this respect : " interest of the State of Texas here is not simply that of making criminal the unlawful acquisition of another person 's property ; it is in addition the interest , expressed in all recidivist statutes , in dealing in a harsher manner with those who by repeated criminal acts have shown that they are simply incapable of conforming to the norms of society as established by its .
By conceding the validity of recidivist statutes generally , Rummel himself concedes that the State of Texas , or any other State , has a valid interest in so dealing with that class of persons . "
Ibid .
Relying on Rummel , the per curiam suggests that because the punishment imposed on respondent was within the maximum prescribed by the state legislature , the Court of Appeals , which affirmed the District Court 's grant of habeas relief on Eighth Amendment grounds , " sanctioned an intrusion into the basic line - drawing process that is ' properly within the province of legislatures , not courts . ' "
Ante , at 374 , quoting Rummel , supra , at 275 -276 .
Even if I viewed Rummel as properly decided , and I do not , the per curiam , by suggesting that it was improper for the courts below to engage in a disproportionality analysis , represents a serious and improper expansion of Rummel .
Rummel acknowledged that prior decisions of this Court , see , e. g. , Ingraham v. Wright , 430 U.S. 651 , 667 ( 1977 ) ; Trop v. Dulles , 356 U.S. 86 ( 1958 ) ( plurality opinion ) ; Weems v. United States , 217 U.S. 349 ( 1910 ) , recognized that the Eighth Amendment includes a principle of proportionality that requires the invalidation of a sentence that is " grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime , " Rummel , supra , at 271- 272 .
Rummel did not overrule those cases but cited them approvingly .
* fn1 Rummel rests on the understanding that , as a consequence of the overwhelming state interests in deterring habitual offenders , the Eighth Amendment does not preclude a State from imposing what might otherwise constitute a disproportionate prison sentence on an individual determined under state law to be a habitual offender .
Of course , in the instant case , the Commonwealth of Virginia has expressed no will to punish Davis as a habitual offender , and there has been no determination that he is one .
The per curiam nevertheless reverses the judgement below on the basis that " Rummel stands for the proposition that federal courts should be ' to review legislatively mandated terms of imprisonment ' . . . and that ' successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences ' should be ' exceedingly rare . ' "
Ante , at 374 , quoting Rummel , supra , at 274 , 272 .
But this general principle of deference surely cannot justify the complete abdication of our responsibility to enforce the Eighth Amendment .
The question presented here is whether the sentence imposed on respondent in this case comports with the limitation contained in the Eighth Amendment .
To reverse on the basis of Rummel , the Court must at least demonstrate why this is not one of those " exceedingly rare " cases in which the Eighth Amendment invalidates a sentence as disproportionate .
But the per curiam engages in no such analysis .
* fn2
We may be sure , however , that the Court of Appeals , directed to reconsider this case in light of Rummel , did undertake that analysis -- upon full review and with the benefit of a substantial record , oral argument , and briefs .
It is obvious to me , as it apparently was to at least five judges of the Court of Appeals , that this case is one of those " exceedingly rare " cases in which a sentence should be invalidated on Eighth Amendment grounds .
First , the indications are that the punishment imposed on respondent for the possession and distribution of less than nine ounces of marihuana -- 40 years ' imprisonment and fines of $ 20,000 -- is not simply harsh , but is in cruel and painful excess of the punishments imposed by the Virginia courts on other defendants convicted of similar offenses .
As the District Court noted : " From October 31 , 1975 to August , 1976 one hundred and seventeen ( 117 ) inmates were committed to the State Department of Corrections for possessing , selling , or manufacturing marijuana .
The average sentence for these offenses was three years and two months , the minimum was sixty days , and the maximum was fifteen years . "
Davis v. Zahradnick , 432 F.Supp. 444 , 453 ( WD Va. 1977 ) .
Second , this case is unique in that the very prosecutor who brought the charges against the respondent was forced to concede in light of his experience that the case represents a " grave disparity in sentencing , " and that the continued incarceration of Davis " is grossly unjust . "
* fn3 Finally , by its subsequent action , the Virginia Legislature has implicitly indicated that it views the punishment imposed on the respondent as too severe : in 1979 it reduced from 40 years to 10 years the maximum sentence that can be imposed with respect to each of the two offenses for which the respondent was convicted .
See Va. Code § 18.2-248.1( a) ( 2 ) ( Supp. 1981 ) ; § 18.2-10(e ) ( 1975 ) .
Under the current statute , respondent could , at maximum , be sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment -- two consecutive 10 - year terms .
This legislative reappraisal of criminal punishment for marihuana offenses does not necessarily render unconstitutional respondent 's substantially longer term .
But it plainly confirms the views of the courts below , which I share , that the punishment inflicted on Davis is unconstitutionally disproportionate and unsupported by any considered legislative judgement that the punishment inflicted is appropriate for the offenses committed .
* fn4 See Coker v. Georgia , 433 U.S. 584 , 597 ( 1977 ) ( plurality opinion ) ( " legislative rejection of capital punishment for rape strongly confirms our own judgment , which is that death is indeed a disproportionate penalty for the crime of raping an adult woman " ) .
See also Trop v. Dulles , 356 U.S. , at 101 ( " The Amendment must draw its meaning from the revolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society " ) .
For these three reasons , and in the absence of full briefing or oral argument , I think that the judgement below -- that Davis has indeed been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment -- is not an unreasonable one .
* fn5 Today 's decision is profoundly disturbing not only because the Court has misused precedent in order to place its imprimatur on a punishment that the courts below have determined , with ample justification , to be cruel and unusual , but also because it represents yet another instance of this Court 's " growing and inexplicable readiness . . . to ' dispose of ' cases summarily . "
Harris v. Rivera , ante , at 349 ( MARSHALL , J. , dissenting ) .
I am , of course , cognizant that , because of an ever - increasing docket , the Court has come under extraordinary pressure to accelerate its disposition process .
But I do not believe that summary disposition on the basis of the certiorari papers is a proper response to such pressure * fn6 where , as here , it is employed to change or extend the law in significant respects .
Here , the Court reverses the judgement of the Court of Appeals , which had the benefit of our decisions , a concrete record , and a thoughtful District Court opinion .
And the Court does so in a context in which the Court of Appeals affirmed by an equally divided court , without opinion ; there is accordingly no statement of law below that requires correcting .
I can only believe that the Court perceives this case as one in which the narrow Rummel ruling concerning recidivist statutes can be extended to new terrain without the necessary exertion of argument and briefing .
Unfortunately , it is Roger Trenton Davis who must now suffer the pains of the Court 's insensitivity , and serve out the balance of a 40 - year sentence viewed as cruel and unusual by at least six judges below .
I dissent from this patent abuse of our judicial power .
* fn7 Opinion Footnotes * fn1
In addition to the evidence seized during the raid and the tape recording of the drug transaction , all of which demonstrated that respondent was an active drug dealer , the jury knew from evidence presented at trial that respondent had knowingly sold drugs to be smuggled into prison , had sold drugs to an inmate 's wife who was alone with an infant child , and had himself been imprisoned in the past .
Davis v. Davis , 585 F.2d , at 1227 - 1228 .
* fn2
Applying the first
Hart factor to this case , the District Court found " no element of violence and minimal , debatable danger to the person . "
Davis v. Zahradnick , 432 F.Supp. 444 , 452 ( WD Va. 1977 ) .
In Rummel , however , we noted that " the presence or absence of violence does not always affect the strength of society 's interest in deterring a particular crime or in punishing a particular criminal . "
445 U.S. , at 275 .
Hart 's second factor calls for an examination of the purposes behind the criminal statute and the existence of less restrictive means of effectuating those purposes .
On this factor the District Court was inconclusive , but noted that the amount of marihuana involved was less than nine ounces , implying that such minimal possession could adequately be deterred with shorter prison sentences .
432 F.Supp. , at 452 .
Such analysis was implicitly rejected by our conclusion in Rummel that the " ' small ' amount of money taken " was in apposite , because to acknowledge that the State could have given Rummel a life sentence for stealing some amount of money " is virtually to concede that the lines to be drawn are indeed ' subjective , ' and therefore properly within the province of legislatures , not courts . "
445 U.S. , at 275-276 .
Applying the third Hart factor , the District Court found that respondent 's sentence for possession with intent to distribute exceeded the maximum penalty available for that offense in all but four States , and that his sentence for distribution exceeded the maximum penalty available for that offense in all but eight States .
432 F.Supp. , at 452-453 .
We rejected such comparison in Rummel , stating that " a constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to traditional notions of federalism , some State will always bear the distinction of treating particular offenders more severely than any other State . "
445 U.S. , at 282 .
Finally , the fourth Hart factor led the District Court to conclude that respondent 's sentence was disproportionate when compared to punishments applicable to other offenses under Virginia law .
432 F.Supp. , at 453 .
This comparison was rejected in Rummel because " crimes . . . implicate other societal interests , making any such comparison inherently speculative . "
445 U.S. , at 282 , n. 27 .

We noted in Rummel that there could be situations in which the proportionality principle would come into play , such as " if a legislature made overtime parking a felony punishable by life imprisonment . "

The letter from the Commonwealth Attorney to Davis ' attorney reads as follows : " This will confirm our recent telephone conversation wherein I advised I would pose no objection to the release of Mr. Davis from the Virginia penal system on a suspended term basis .
" Heretofore , I have steadfastly opposed his release .
However , the sentences now being imposed throughout the majority of the Commonwealth and the nation for comparable acts of drug distribution are extremely light and in most cases insignificant .
In view of such , I think a gross injustice would be done should I not recommend his immediate release with the remainder of his term suspended .
" I do wish to make it expressly clear that my recommendation should not be construed as being critical of the jury that convicted Mr. Davis .
I actually asked for a heavier sentence than was imposed .
The citizens of this county have not softened their views toward drug offenders , and neither have I , but by the same token I cannot condone such grave disparity in sentencing .
" I think our community , our jury , and our Court were correct in their approach to the drug problem .
However , that we may be correct and others wrong in their assessment , does not enable me to continue to ignore the wrong that would be perpetuated upon Mr. Davis by his continued confinement .
My dictates that in view of the lack of any semblance of uniformity of sentencing throughout the nation in dealing with the drug problem , that Mr. Davis 's continued incarceration is grossly unjust .
" I trust that this is a fair summary of the content of our conversation , and if it is not , I hope you will please advise me . "
Letter of Feb. 28 , 1977 ( emphasis added ) .
In the District Court , the parties stipulated that , had this prosecutor testified " with respect to the severity of the sentences imposed upon Petitioner for marijuana - related offenses , his testimony would comport with the contents of the attached letter .
. . . " Supplemental Stipulation of Fact , Mar. 18 , 1977 .
* fn8 Davis also prepared a study of drug - related sentencing in Virginia over a 9 1/2 - month period in 1975 - 1976 .
This study summarized sentencing of 117 inmates convicted of possessing , selling , or manufacturing marihuana .
The average of these sentences was three years , two months .
The maximum -- for any quantity -- was 15 years .
I give this study only slight weight because of its short time period and its failure to give information about relevant aggravating circumstances .
* fn9 Rummel also involved a legislative revision of the relevant crimes .
The basis for Rummel 's life sentence was his conviction as a habitual offender .
After conviction for two prior felonies , this habitual offender law provided for automatic imposition of a life sentence upon a third felony conviction .
445 U.S. , at 278 .
Rummel 's third felony was theft by false pretext .
After his conviction on that count and as a habitual offender , Texas reclassified his third offense as a misdemeanor .

Unlike Virginia 's 1979 amendment with respect to Davis , however , Texas ' statutory reduction did not convey any basic change in its attitude toward the statutory basis for Rummel 's lengthy sentence : recidivism .
* fn10 " While not given all the details , the jury knew from Eads ' testimony that this was not Davis ' first trouble with the law in a drug related offense . "
Davis v. Davis , 585 F.2d 1226 , 1228 ( CA4 1978 ) . " trial judge , who could have sentenced concurrently , sentenced consecutively .
Not only had he heard the witnesses testify , which we have not ; he knew , for example , which the jury did not , that Davis previously had been convicted of selling LSD , and that the two offenses for which Davis had just been found guilty were committed while on bail pending appeal from the previous conviction for selling LSD . "
Id. , at 1233 .
Cf. Vines v. Muncy , 553 F.2d 342 , 349 ( CA4 1977 ) ( jury sentence not final under Virginia practice , since its findings are subject to suspension by the trial judge ) .

That there should be any doubt as to the continued validity of the proportionality principle is particularly incomprehensible in view of the Rummel Court 's reliance on the proportionality principle in a footnote , where the Court , responding to the fanciful hypothetical of the dissent , stated that this principle would bar a legislature from making " overtime parking a felony punishable by life imprisonment . "

The per curiam notes that the District Court applied the four - factor proportionality test of Hart v. Coiner , 483 F.2d 136 ( CA4 1973 ) .
Ante , at 371 , 373 , and n. 2 . It then suggests that the test is inconsistent with the decision in Rummel and that reversal is therefore appropriate here .
Even if the Court were correct in its suggestion that the Hart test is inconsistent with Rummel , reversal would not be appropriate , because there is simply no basis for saying that the judgement of the Court of Appeals rests on the Hart test .
The Court of Appeals , sitting en banc , affirmed the judgement of the District Court by an equally divided court , and therefore did not issue an opinion .
Accordingly , the five judges of the Court of Appeals that voted to affirm the judgement of the District Court may have based their view of the unconstitutionality of Davis ' punishment on reasoning entirely unrelated to that offered by the District Court -- particularly since the District Court 's opinion had been issued prior to Rummel .
In any event , this Court reviews judgments , not opinions , and therefore the Court can reverse the judgement of the Court of Appeals only if it is not sustainable on any basis .

The prosecutor 's comments were contained in the following letter that he sent to Davis ' attorney : " This will confirm our recent telephone conversation wherein I advised I would pose no objection to the release of Mr. Davis from the Virginia penal system on a suspended term basis .
" Heretofore , I have steadfastly opposed his release .
However , the sentences now being imposed throughout the majority of the Commonwealth and the nation for comparable acts of drug distribution are extremely light and in most cases insignificant .
In view of such , I think a gross injustice would be done should I not recommend his immediate release with the remainder of his term suspended .
" I do wish to make it expressly clear that my recommendation should not be construed as being critical of the jury that convicted Mr. Davis .
I actually asked for a heavier sentence than was imposed .
The citizens of this county have not softened their views toward drug offenders , and neither have I , but by the same token I cannot condone such grave disparity in sentencing .
" I think our community , our jury , and our Court were correct in their approach to the drug problem .
However , that we may be correct and others wrong in their assessment , does not enable me to continue to ignore the wrong that would be perpetrated upon Mr. Davis by his continued confinement .
My conscious dictates that in view of the lack of any semblance of uniformity of sentencing throughout the nation in dealing with the drug problem , that Mr. Davis 's continued incarceration is grossly unjust .
" I trust that this is a fair summary of the content of our conversation , and if it is not , I hope you will please advise me . "
Letter from Thomas B. Baird , Jr. , to Edward L. Hogshire ( Feb. 28 , 1977 ) .

This legislative action also undermines any claim that the state interest in having Davis serve a 40 - year prison sentence is sufficiently strong to preclude invalidation of the sentence as disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment .
See ( supra ) , at 381-383 .
5 JUSTICE POWELL , concurring in the judgment , nevertheless concludes that the punishment imposed on Davis is not as disproportionate as that imposed on Rummel and that therefore the instant case is controlled by the facts of Rummel .
Ante , at 379-380 .
But even if the punishment in the instant case could be determined , in the abstract , to be less severe than that imposed on Rummel , the fact remains that Rummel was sentenced as a habitual offender and this Court determined the State 's interest in imposing unusually harsh sentences on habitual offenders to be a substantial one .
No comparable state interest has been offered to support the punishment inflicted here .
Although it may be true that the respondent in the instant case has previously been convicted of a drug offense , he was not sentenced as a habitual offender , but for possession and distribution of less than nine ounces of marihuana .
Indeed , while the trial judge , who made consecutive the jury 's recommended sentences of 20 years on each count , was aware of the respondent 's prior conviction , the jury , which awarded the sentences , was unaware that the respondent had previously been convicted .
See Davis v. Davis , 585 F.2d 1226 , 1233 ( CA4 1978 ) .
6 Indeed , an increased rate of summary dispositions may prove to be counterproductive .
As the bar becomes alert to the increased probability of summary disposition , lawyers responding to a petition for certiorari will likely choose to minimize the risk of summary disposition by taking the additional step of providing a full statement of their argument on the merits .
As others have noted , this will only " mean additional and unnecessary work for the lawyer , expense to the client , and unessential reading matter for the already overburdened Court . "

In view of this abuse , it is certainly startling that the Court should suggest that the Court of Appeals ' affirmance of the District Court in this case was tantamount to " anarchy . "
Ante , at 375 .
Quite to the contrary , the Court of Appeals has only fulfilled its constitutional responsibility to apply the Court 's precedents in light of reason and experience -- something that this Court today has plainly failed to do .

Today my little sister is on her way back from a few months in Ethiopia teaching art at an orphanage for children who have lost their parents to AIDS .
From what I ’ve heard so far , she ’s had an amazing impact , so I ’m obviously overwhelmingly proud of her .
It ’s hard to imagine what life without a family is like , but there are millions of children all across the world who know all too well what it ’s like .
That ’s why we ’re taking a look at Kidsave today ( not the organization that my sister was working with ) .
They ’re a Los Angeles , CA based non-profit that is aiming to “ to ensure that no orphan or foster child is forgotten and that every child grows up in a family with love and hope for a successful future . ”
It all started when friends and business partners Terry Baugh and Randi Thompson , both adoptive parents , realized how tragic the stories of orphaned children really are .
They started Kidsave in 1997 , and since then they have helped “ more than 2700 children [ find ] parents and lasting connections with adults . ”
Saving Kids
Kidsave operates all across the globe with the specific goal of helping children find permanent families .
Kidsave has 6 main programs – Weekend Miracles , Summer Miracles , Russian Programs , Colombian Programs , Model Programs , and Advocacy .
All of these programs appear to be based on the Family Vist Model , which “ draws from a broad base of research on orphaned and abandoned children ’s needs and how best to meet those needs . ”
It looks like a fantastic program , and it should be something that you want to be a part of .
Luckily , they ’re hiring .
They only have one job opening , but it ’s perfect for a new grad .
It ’s not posted on Kidsave ’s Jobs page , but you can find it on Idealist .
The position title is Summer and Weekend Miracles Program Coordinator .

“ We are treating everything as hostile right now .
We were told not to take chances – to shoot rather than ask questions . ”
That is the policy of the invading Israeli soldiers as described by one of their lieutenants .
And indeed , they ’re doing plenty of shooting .
As for who they ’re shooting , that ’s one of those questions that not only are they not supposed to ask , they ’d just as soon not answer .
Even among the invading army there is no small amount of shock at the destruction of residential neighborhoods .
To quote the same soldier “ it looks destroyed , demolished , like we were bombing it for years .
You ca n’t imagine what damage we have done . ”
Nor can we rely on the international press to cover that damage , because they are still being kept from entering the strip by the Israeli military .
But we do get plenty of eyewitness accounts from the ground .
The death toll has reportedly exceeded 975 now , with untold thousands wounded , and the promised “ phase three ” of the attacks have n’t even started in earnest yet .
Israeli rights group B’Tselem reported that Israeli soldiers opened fire on a group of civilians trying to flee their homes , even though they had been ordered out by the Israeli military and were waving white flags at the time .
The toll seems bound to rise as the troops move into the most densely populated parts of Gaza City .

African Americans have a shorter life expectancy than whites .
A new study finds that for most types of cancer , the disparity in mortality is almost entirely due to the fact that African Americans are more likely to get cancer in the first place .
A new UCLA study , published in Journal of General Internal Medicine , says that for most types of cancer , their stage at presentation and survival after diagnosis play a much smaller role .
Overall , African American men live 1.47 fewer years than white men , and African American women 0.91 fewer years than white women , due to all cancers combined .
The results spotlight the need for greater prevention efforts aimed at African Americans .
The study is available online at www.springerlink.com/content/u3u072071t08xl1u/fulltext.html.
This is the first time that researchers have quantified the role that disparities in cancer incidence , stage at diagnosis and survival after cancer plays in African Americans ' shorter life expectancy , according to lead author Dr. Mitchell D. Wong , associate professor of medicine in the division of general internal medicine and health services research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" Putting a number on it is very informative , because when you look at the figures , you see that the reason their mortality is worse is almost entirely due to the fact that blacks are more likely to get cancer , " Wong said .
" This highlights the importance of prevention — it 's where most of the efforts should be . "
A notable exception to this pattern was breast cancer .
While white women are more likely to get breast cancer than African American women , the disparities between whites and blacks in stage at presentation and survival after diagnosis for breast cancer had a large impact on the racial gap in life expectancy .
" This argues for much more research and efforts to close the gap in breast cancer screening and treatment , " Wong said .
The researchers analyzed data from the Surveillance and Epidemiology End Result ( SEER ) cancer registry and the National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS ) .
Together , the data sets covered about 2.7 million white and 291,000 African American cancer patients from 12 geographic regions in the United States : San Francisco / Oakland , Connecticut , Detroit , Hawaii , Iowa , New Mexico , Seattle ( Puget Sound ) , Utah , Atlanta , Alaska , San Jose / Monterey and Los Angeles .
Among the other findings :
• Cancer incidence , stage at diagnosis and post - diagnosis survival accounted for 1.12 , 0.17 and 0.21 years , respectively , in the life - expectancy disparity among men . •
Among women , those categories accounted for 0.41 , 0.26 and 0.31 years , respectively . •
The difference in incidence of cancer had a greater impact on the racial gap in cancer mortality than did the stage at which the cancer was diagnosed . •
The differences in post - diagnosis survival were significant with only two types of cancer : breast ( 0.14 years ) and prostate ( 0.05 years ) .
" Continuing to improve cancer treatment and screening is undoubtedly important to improving life expectancy and quality of life for all adults , yet substantial disparities in cancer mortality will persist unless we can find ways to address the enormous impact of racial differences in cancer incidence , " the researchers concluded .
In addition to Wong , study authors included Susan L. Ettner and Martin F. Shapiro of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA , and John Boscardin of the division of geriatrics at the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center .

This is the text of a talk by Chris Hedges that will be read at anti-war gatherings to be held by The World Ca n’t Wait in New York ’s Union Square , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle , Nashville , Louisville , Chicago and Berkeley on March 19 to protest the sixth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq .
Barack Obama has shown that he is as capable of doublespeak as any other politician when he announced an end to the war in Iraq .
Combat troops are to be pulled out of Iraq by August 2010 , he said , but some 50,000 occupation troops will remain behind .
Someone should let the Iraqis know the distinction .
I doubt any soldier or Marine in Iraq will notice much difference in 19 months .
Many combat units will simply be relabeled as noncombat units .
And what about our small army of well - paid contractors and mercenaries ?
Will Dyncorp , Bechtel , Blackwater ( which recently changed its name to Xe ) , all of whom have made fortunes off the war , pack up and go home ?
What about the three large super - bases , dozens of smaller military outposts and our imperial city , the Green Zone ?
Will American corporations give up their lucrative control of Iraqi oil ?
The occupation of Iraq will not be disrupted .
Lies and deception , which launched the war in the first place , are being employed by Democrats to maintain it .
This is not a withdrawal .
It is occupation lite .
And as long as American troops are on Iraqi soil the war will grind on , the death toll on each side will continue to mount and we will remain a lightning rod for hatred and rage in the Middle East .
Add to this Obama ’s decision to increase troop levels in Afghanistan and even his most purblind supporters will have to admit the new president is as intent on maintaining American empire as the old .
The occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan has not promoted U.S. security or stability in the Middle East .
These occupations have furthered the spread of failed states , increased authoritarianism and unleashed savage violence .
They have opened up voids of lawlessness , including in the tribal areas of Pakistan , where our real enemies can operate and plot against us .
These occupations have scuttled the art of diplomacy and mocked the rule of law .
We have become an outlaw state intent on creating more outlaw states .
The occupations have , finally , empowered Iran , as well as Russia and China , which gleefully watch our self - immolation .
And , in the end , we can not win these wars .
We will withdraw all our troops in an orderly manner or see these occupations collapse in an orgy of bloodshed .
Iraq , because of our invasion and occupation , no longer exists as a unified country .
The experiment that was Iraq , the cobbling together of disparate and antagonistic patches of the Ottoman Empire by the victorious powers in the wake of World War I , will never come back .
The Kurds have set up a de facto state in the north .
The Shiites control most of the south .
The center of the country is a battleground .
There are at least 2 million Iraqis who have fled their homes and are internally displaced .
Another 2 million have left the country , most to Syria and Jordan , which now has the largest number of refugees per capita of any country on Earth .
And perhaps as many as 1.2 million Iraqis are dead because of what we have done .
The eight - year war in Afghanistan has seen the Taliban re-emerge from the ashes .
An additional 30,000 troops will do little to prop up the detested and corrupt regime of Hamid Karzai .
Our attempt to buy off Afghan tribal groups with money and even weapons has collapsed , with most slipping back into the arms of the Taliban insurgents .
The U.N. estimates that the Taliban is now raking in $ 300 million a year from the expanded poppy trade to fund the resistance .
The Taliban controlled about 75 percent of Afghan territory when we invaded eight years ago .
It has recaptured about half of the country since its initial defeat , and its reach has expanded to the outskirts of major cities such as Kabul and Kandahar .
Twenty - nine American troops died in Afghanistan the first two months of 2009 , a threefold increase compared with the eight who died during the same period last year .
And more Afghan civilians are dying in allied operations than at the hands of the Taliban , according to a count by the Associated Press .
In the first two months of the year , American , NATO or Afghan forces have killed 100 civilians , while militants have killed 60 .
Do the cheerleaders for an expanded war in Afghanistan know any history ?
Have they studied what happened to the Soviets , who lost 15,000 Red Army soldiers between 1979 and 1988 , or even the British in the 19th century ?
Do they remember why we went into Afghanistan ?
It was , we were told , to hunt down Osama bin Laden , who is now apparently in Pakistan .
Has anyone asked what our end goal is in Afghanistan ?
Is it nation - building ?
Have we declared war on the Taliban ?
Or is this simply the forever war on terror ?
Al - Qaida , which we have also inadvertently resurrected , still finds plenty of recruits .
It still runs training facilities .
It still carries out attacks in London , Madrid , Iraq and now Afghanistan , which did not experience suicide bombings until December 2005 .
Al - Qaida has moved on .
But we remain stuck , confused and lashing about wildly like a wounded and lumbering beast .
Obama , during the campaign , promised that he would pull out one combat brigade per month over a 16 - month period from Iraq .
But this promise has been scrapped .
Instead , troop levels will remain steady for most of this year and into the first few months of 2010 .
Troops will only start leaving , we are told , in large numbers in the spring and summer of next year , but even the pace of this downsizing will be left to the discretion of commanders .
The troops left in Iraq after the “ withdrawal ” will , the Obama administration says , train Iraqi soldiers , protect U.S. assets and conduct “ anti-terror operations . ”
The U.S. agreement with Iraq , known as SOFA , or status of forces agreement , calls for all U.S. forces to be out of Iraq by the end of December 2011 .
But this seems very unlikely .
The Pentagon has , despite the SOFA agreement , built its long - range planning around the assumption that anywhere from 30,000 to 50,000 troops will be based in Iraq long after 2011 .
The U.S. - Iraq agreement ( which was ratified by the Iraqi parliament but never brought to the U.S. Senate for ratification , as mandated by the Constitution ) calls for a national referendum to be held in Iraq during the summer of 2009 .
Iraqis will supposedly be able to approve or reject the agreement .
The some 50 U.S. bases in Iraq are , under the agreement , to be turned over to the Iraqis .
Will Obama defy the results of a referendum and ram the continued occupation down the throats of Iraqi voters ?
It certainly looks like it .
Of course , all this will be handled , I suspect , by having our client government in Baghdad “ request ” that we remain , making an even greater farce of our public commitment to democracy .
There are huge corporations who are making a lot of money off this war .
Obama seems intent on not impeding the profits .
So much for our anti-war candidate .
We should have known better than to trust the Democrats after they rode to power in Congress in 2006 on an anti-war platform and then continued to fund our wars and approve increased troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan .
If the delicate cease - fire we have negotiated with the former Sunni insurgents in Iraq breaks down , how will we respond ?
Suppose the some 100,000 Sunnis , who have been allowed to ethnically cleanse the areas they control and build militias , turn on the central Shiite - led government .
Suppose we can no longer buy off these Sunni “ Awakening ” militias with the $ 300 - a- month salaries we dispense to these fighters .
Suppose the war heats up again .
This is what happened in Afghanistan when we tried to bribe tribal groups with money and support .
A deterioration of the security situation in Iraq could instantly scuttle even a reduction of forces .
And the military , if some troops do leave Iraq , will have to rely more heavily on airstrikes to control territory and keep insurgents at bay .
The airstrikes in Afghanistan have , along with the expanded fighting , driven tens of thousands of Afghan refugees into Iran and Pakistan .
Even the Karzai government has vigorously protested these airstrikes , which feed scores of recruits to the Taliban .
Expect the same ugly backlash in Iraq .
I could live with the prolonged injustice of the occupation in Iraq if I thought there would really be peace , that we could then help rebuild the country we destroyed and that we had restored the rule of law by rejecting the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war , something that under post - Nuremberg laws is defined as a criminal “ war of aggression . ”
I could live with 19 months more of the war if I knew it would really be the end .
But the war in Iraq , like Afghanistan , will go on .
Our imperial projects and killing will continue under the Obama presidency .
Many more , including some of our own , will die .
The only hope now lies in renewed protests against the war and a reinvigorated anti-war movement .
This time the movement should hold fast , as stalwarts like Cindy Sheehan , Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader have , to the moral imperative of peace and not the false hopes offered by the Democrats .
They can not be trusted .
Politics is a game of pressure .
Abandon that pressure and you lose .

While some industry watchers are incessant in their pleas for Apple to trim the cost of its Mac computer line in order to better compete , a fresh analysis argues that new iMacs introduced Tuesday already compare quite favorably with their Windows - based counterparts and are likely to boost sales of the sluggish Mac desktop segment .
In a report released to clients on Tuesday , Oppenheimer analyst Yair Reiner compliments Apple for its sweeping overhaul of its much - neglected desktop business — which includes new iMacs , Mac minis , and Mac Pros — and commended its efforts to engineer and market greener products .
" We believe the product refreshes announced today will bring renewed momentum to Apple 's flagging desktop sales , " he wrote .
" While the much anticipated update did not break new ground in terms of form factor ( as we had hoped ) , the extent of the hardware improvements is a positive surprise . "
Reiner , who 's modeling Apple to generate second - quarter per-share earnings of $ 1.02 on revenues of $ 8.017 billion , made no changes to his estimates but said " pent up demand " for the new systems could drive upside to his March and fiscal year 2009 desktop predictions .
He 's currently modeling quarterly shipments of 619,000 desktops and 1.437 million notebooks for the three - month period ending March , while his fiscal year estimate has the Mac maker selling 2.776 million desktops and 6.371 million notebooks .
i Macs deliver more for less
The Oppenheimer analyst also used his report Tuesday to perform a side - by - side comparison of the new iMacs against all - in - one desktops from Dell and HP .
He found that the mid-range $ 1,499 model sports faster CPU and RAM while delivering better or comparable graphics than its rivals while still coming in $ 100 to $ 250 cheaper .
He noted that even though the iMac lacks a TV tuner , the $ 60 to $ 100 upgrade price for that part does n't negate the full savings .
A comparison of the low - range models on the market gave a slight edge to the HP TouchSmart IQ500t 's two - inch larger and touch - sensitive screen , but the iMac wins handily in the processing , memory , and graphics segments .
Reiner gave kudos to Apple for its iLife digital lifestyle suite , which comes with every new Mac and lacks a strong rival .
The iMac and HP are priced at $ 1,199 , while the Dell XPS One 20 sells for $ 899 as configured .

Comparing the mid-range 24 " iMac ( $ 1,499 ) with the Dell XPS One 24 ( $ 1,599 ) and HP TouchSmart IQ800t ( $ 1,749 ) reveals a similar pattern .
While the iMac 's screen is just an inch and a half smaller than the TouchSmart 's , Apple 's all - in - one desktop with Intel and NVIDIA technology again stands out in terms of performance .

For nearly 40 years , Israelis have known Haim Yavin ’s face .
Now they also know his opinions .
Whether that is leading to any deeper understanding of his message about the functioning of the Israeli media is less certain .
“ Since 1967 , we have been brutal conquerors , occupiers suppressing another people . ”
It is in such terms Yavin has been expressing his disgust for the Israeli occupation in the five - week series of reports “ A Land of Settlers ” currently being broadcast on Israeli Channel Two .
Haim Yavin
TV
Yavin is not Gideon Levy or Amira Hass , Haaretz journalists long classified as left - wingers and outspoken critics of the occupation .
In the June 4 edition of Haaretz , Levy described Yavin as “ a Zionist to the depths of his soul , the paragon of consensus . ”
From every corner of the political spectrum , people used to , somehow , identify with Yavin , as he represented neutrality par excellence .
Thus , hearing such views expressed from Yavin is “ much more jarring ” than from anybody else , says Levy .
Hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil
“ Where were he and his colleagues , the television broadcasters … while the outrage was created - the nightmare that Yavin is now discovering , ” Levy asked in an interview with the Palestine Report .
“ By criticizing the occupation , Yavin took one step to save his dignity .
As a former director of Israel Television and the head of its news department he was part of a system that is hiding the truth about the territories from the Israeli public . ”
According to Levy , in Israel there is a sort of unspoken collusion by which journalists do n’t want to write , editors do n’t want to publish and the public does n’t want to read about the situation in the occupied territories .
“ In Israel there is strong self - censorship on behalf of the media , which is much more dangerous than any government or military censorship . ”
Israeli journalists , says Levy , have a relatively large freedom of expression but consciously choose not to cover some important issues .
For Daniel Dor , professor at Tel Aviv University ’s Department of Communication and Social Sciences , “ choosing not to cover an issue that is recognized by many as an important topic is actually making a very strong statement on what is our collective identity .
This is exactly the case when the Israeli media decides not to cover the issue of the wall , though all the European media are focused on it . ”
Dor suggests that the media , along with patriotism and military service , is a strong component of the collective Israeli identity .
Though “ brainwashed ” , in Dor ’s opinion , is too strong a term to characterize this identity , the Israeli public does not have access to the full picture .
Levy goes further in his analysis of the misinformation prevalent in Israeli society , saying Israelis are habitually fed “ half - truths and sometimes even lies .
European citizens know better what is happening in the Palestinian territories than most Israelis who live only a few kilometres away . ”
Dor ’s research points to the presence of a triangular mechanism of systematic reinterpretation of events in the Israeli media .
First , the amount of information about the Palestinian territories available to the Israeli public is scant .
Second , the dominant Israeli narrative reframes this information according to the conventional Israeli collective identity .
Finally , “ there is , in Israel , an acute sense of being blamed by the whole world for whatever is happening in this part of the world , ” says Dor .
“ We , Israelis , think the whole world is blaming us for something that never happened .
And it never happened because we did n’t receive any information about it .
And we did n’t receive any information about it because if something sounds different from the mainstream Israeli narrative , then it is immediately reframed . ”
Barak ’s lies
This kind of misinformation reached a climax some five years ago .
Dor and Levy both finger “ Barak ’s lies ” about Camp David as the trigger for a state of affairs that has been perpetuated ever since .
When the former Israeli prime minister came back from Camp David with no agreement and blamed that entirely on the Palestinian camp , saying there was “ no partner for peace ” , it had a tremendous effect on Israeli public opinion .
Both the left and right complied with this view , and as a result the peace camp virtually disappeared as it was no longer able to propose any alternative to the rightist view on the Palestinians .
“ Since that time the Palestinians have been constantly suffering and their agony has had no echo in the Israeli media ” , says Levy .
“ On the Israeli side , the media only shows the suffering of its own people , ignoring the roots of terror , which is the Israeli occupation .
For this [ state of affairs ] , every Israeli citizen is responsible as these actions are taken in their name . ”
After many years in the media , Haim Yavin decided to assume this responsibility and see for himself what was happening in the land next to him .
For two - and - a - half years he travelled through Palestinian cities and Israeli settlements with his private hand - held camera .
Though not a dovish left - winger , “ what he saw profoundly changed him , ” says Levy .
In his series of reports , Yavin explains that the least he could do to fight the occupation “ was to document it ” .
“ This time , Yavin fulfilled his mission not only to tell the truth , but to tell the whole truth … and he did not hesitate to jeopardize his statesmanlike status and the widespread popularity he has enjoyed for years ” , Levy wrote in Haaretz .
For documenting his view on the occupation , Yavin has been vigorously criticized by Benzi Lieberman , leader of the Yesha ( settlers ’ ) Council .
The latter has demanded that the news anchor be dismissed as , according to his view , Yavin can not be objective anymore .
“ Haim Yavin ’s credibility as a news anchor is not at all questioned in this affair .
The settlers are doing their usual manipulation .
They are attacking him personally to avoid dealing with the issues he raises ” , says Levy .
“ It is extremely doubtful that Yavin is powerful enough to bring an end to the settlement enterprise , but the message that emerges from the series has already stirred more public debate than any other television program in a long time . ”
No wind of change
That Yavin ’s program has stirred debate within Israeli society may be seen as progress in itself but according to Dor , the controversy is far from a sweeping wind of change in the Israeli media and society .
Referring to the past few years , he points out that “ it is not the first time that a personality representing the general Israeli consensus expresses sudden criticism of the Israeli occupation ” .
As an example , he points to the refusal of the highly - esteemed Israeli air force fighter pilots to serve in the occupied territories .
“ The most important element is what the public does with such a strong criticism of the Israeli machine .
Yavin ’s reports will not change the audience ’s perception of the conflict but only their perception of Haim Yavin as a person .
Now they know he is a leftist and this is where the public discussion stops . ”
“ A Land of Settlers ” , says Dor , though a five week series , cannot document the complex issues of the Israeli occupation and the media ’s ignorance of the Palestinians ’ lives .
Dor projects that Israeli media obliviousness will only diminish “ when people ‘ up there ’ , like the Prime Minister , decide to make peace with the Palestinians and then adopt another kind of narrative ” .
On a similarly pessimistic tone , Levy argues that as long the Israeli media continues avoiding covering what he says is the main cause of terror , the Israeli occupation , chances are that terror will start again because the plight of the Palestinians has n’t improved .
“ Before anything changes in the Israeli media ’s coverage of the territories , we will have to go through much more blood and many more lies . ”

See how the island nation Niue is relying on techniques new and old to save itself .
One of YouTube 's main attractions is the plethora of music videos available for instantaneous viewing -- it 's a modern - day MTV without the reality shows and attempts to regain coolness .
The problem is , those videos are locked under copyright and are n't making money for the labels or artists when played for free , so they 're often yanked from the site and become available only in grainy , bootlegged iterations .
Universal Music Group and YouTube want to change all that .
The two media giants are working on a deal that would launch a YouTube sister site that would be a music video cornucopia , according to sources cited by CNET .
The intended sister site , tentatively called Vevo , would be " closely linked " with YouTube and thus attract billions of viewers , and , hopefully , big advertising dollars .
Universal is the nation 's largest recording company , and with a little help from its friends , Vevo hopes to attract all of the major labels to create a one - stop shop for music videos .
Also planned are " editorial content , merchandising , Webisodes , or artist - generated videos , " sources close to the negotiations told CNET .
This kind of content would truly be culling from the YouTube 's philosophy of giving audiences reams of content from a variety of sources .
This news comes only a few months after MTV revamped its online music video source , titled MTV Music .
Instead of adapting to the Web 2.0 age , MTV simply slapped its videos online , propped up a few advertisements , and called it a day .
Now faced with such an ambitious project , MTV has to pull its players together and develop a strategy for beating YouTube at the game it invented or else further fade into cultural obscurity .

Update : Equifax announced on October 2 that an additional 2.5 million US consumers may have been impacted by the massive data breach that was first disclosed on September 7 .
The company in charge of the forensic analysis of the hack has revised the number , Equifax said , bringing the total of potentially impacted consumers to 145.5 million .
Equifax has maintained the web page where you can check whether your personal information may have been stolen in the hack .
The firm is offering free credit monitoring through TrustedID Premier , and most experts suggest implementing a credit freeze at all three of the major credit reporting companies ( Equifax , Experian and TransUnion ) if you believe your information was compromised .
Original article below ...
Credit reporting firm Equifax revealed today that hackers gained unauthorized access to personal information of up to 143 million US consumers – more than a third of the country 's population .
According to Equifax , the breach occurred around mid-May through July of this year , exploiting a website application vulnerability .
While primarily a US - based cyber attack , Equifax also said " limited personal information " was accessed pertaining to some UK residents , with more details to come regarding users affected outside the US .
The company says it became aware of the breach on July 29 , and acted to stop the leak and conduct a forensic review for law enforcement .
Among the data stolen was customers ' names , Social Security numbers , birth dates , addresses and some driver 's license numbers .
Equifax says approximately 209,000 US users also had their credit card information comprised , and about 182,000 had dispute documents accessed .
Equifax is mailing notices to those users .
How to find out if your information was stolen
Though a hugely worrying breach , Equifax claims it has found " no evidence of unauthorized activity " on the company 's core consumer or credit reporting databases .
Still , the information stolen is highly sensitive .
Equifax has set up a dedicated webpage to help customers establish whether their data has been compromised , and if so what steps they can take to protect their identity .
Once on the page , you need to click the ' Potential Impact ' button .
You 're asked to enter your last name and the last six digits of your social security number ; we were admittedly wary of giving this information considering the hack .
While Equifax says it will send a message indicating whether your personal information may have been compromised , one TechRadar staffer received a message but another did n't .
Whether or not your information was stolen , Equifax is offering consumers free enrollment in its TrustedID Premier program .
It appears that there 's a waiting list for this credit file monitoring and identity theft protection program ; we were given an enrollment date of September 13 and told to return to this site then .
No additional alert will be sent reminding you to enroll , and enrollment will end on November 21 .
You can also call an information line at 866-447-7559 .
In the wake of the breach , it 's important to be wary of suspicious emails , especially those claimed to be from Equifax or other official sources .
Do n't click on links or download material from emails that seem suspicious , as phishing attempts often run rampant after breaches like this .
It 's also a good idea to change your passwords , and keep an eye on your credit card and bank accounts .
You can also monitor your credit with the two other large US credit reporting companies , Experian and TransUnion .

UXBRIDGE , Canada , Jan 28 ( Tierramérica ) – Current rates of deforestation suggest there will hardly be any tropical forests left in 20 years .
Sixty percent of the rainforests , which survived for 50 million consecutive years , are already gone .
However , some experts say widespread planting of previously logged forests offers hope for preserving some of the region ’s rich and unique biodiversity .
Recent satellite data have shown that about 350,000 square kilometres of the original forested areas are growing back , Greg Asner of the Washington - based Carnegie Institution said at the Smithsonian symposium Jan. 12 at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History , also in the U.S. capital .
That is only 1.7 percent of the immense planetary belt of original forest that once covered 20 million square kilometres .
Twelve million sq km have already been cleared while another five million have been selectively logged , Asner reported .
“ There is going to be lots of tropical forest left in the future but it will be different forest , ” says Joseph Wright of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute ( STRI ) in Panama .
Marginal farmland is being abandoned in the tropics and there is also a large - scale migration of people from rural areas into cities .
“ The key question is , what is the conservation value of this land ? ” Wright told Tierramérica from Washington .
“ I think there will be a high level of biodiversity . ”
Tropical rainforests are estimated to contain 80 percent the planet ’s terrestrial biodiversity .
They also produce 20 to 30 percent of the world ’s oxygen and are part of the planet ’s climate regulating system .
Ira Rubinoff , STRI director emeritus , wonders if the new second - growth forest can provide a home to millions of unique tropical species and the same ecosystem services .
“ These are not trivial questions .
The services tropical forests provide are extremely important for the entire planet , ” Rubinoff told Tierramérica .
“ We do n’t know the answers .
We know more about the moon than the Amazon forest , ” he added

Late last Monday , the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado filed a lawsuit in State District Court here arguing that by seizing and retaining confidential tax information , the Weld County authorities had violated privacy rights of thousands of taxpayers .
“ If the sheriff and the D.A. can comb through thousands of records in a tax preparer ’s office on the theory that some of their clients are doing something wrong , then none of our confidential information is safe , ” said Mark Silverstein , the legal director for the group .
Mr. Buck said all information from the investigation would be kept confidential .
Both sides agree that the issue has exposed a hole in federal immigration policy .
Since 1996 , the I.R.S. has distributed about 15 million Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers to enable people without Social Security numbers to pay taxes .
Many illegal immigrants also buy fake or stolen Social Security numbers on the black market to show to potential employers .
Image  They are committing felonies through identify theft ,  District Attorney Ken Buck said .

While not commenting specifically about the Colorado operation , an I.R.S. spokesman , Frank Keith , said , “ We are concerned when information provided by taxpayers to meet their legal tax obligations is used for purposes other than federal tax administration . ”
Sheriff Cooke said the federal policy was tantamount to “ the government turning its back on victims of identity theft . ”
If a stolen or false Social Security number is used only to get work , “ there is no negative impact on the rightful owner , ” said a Social Security Administration spokesman , Mark Hinkle ; but it can wreak financial havoc if used to gain access to bank accounts or to obtain credit cards .
Research by an Iowa State University scientist suggests that cholesterol - reducing drugs known as statins may lessen brain function .
Yeon - Kyun Shin , a biophysics professor in the department of biochemistry , biophysics and molecular biology , says the results of his study show that drugs that inhibit the liver from making cholesterol may also keep the brain from making cholesterol , which is vital to efficient brain function .
" If you deprive cholesterol from the brain , then you directly affect the machinery that triggers the release of neurotransmitters , " said Shin .
" Neurotransmitters affect the data - processing and memory functions .
In other words -- how smart you are and how well you remember things . "
Shin 's findings will be published in this month 's edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Cholesterol is one of the building blocks of cells and is made in the liver .
Low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -- often referred to as bad cholesterol -- is cholesterol in the bloodstream from the liver on the way to cells in the body .
High - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -- so - called good cholesterol -- is cholesterol being removed from cells .
Too much LDL going to cells and not enough being removed can lead to cholesterol deposits and hardening of the cells .
" If you have too much cholesterol , your internal machinery is not going to be able to take away enough cholesterol from the cells , " said Shin .
" Then cells harden and you can get these deposits . "
Cholesterol - reducing statin drugs are helpful because they keep the liver from synthesizing cholesterol so less of the substance is carried to the cells .
This lowers LDL cholesterol .

It is the function of reducing the synthesis of cholesterol that Shin 's study shows may also harm brain function .
" If you try to lower the cholesterol by taking medicine that is attacking the machinery of cholesterol synthesis in the liver , that medicine goes to the brain too .
And then it reduces the synthesis of cholesterol which is necessary in the brain , " said Shin .
In his experiments , Shin tested the activity of the neurotransmitter - release machinery from brain cells without cholesterol present and measured how well the machinery functioned .
He then included cholesterol in the system and again measured the protein function .
Cholesterol increased protein function by five times .
" Our study shows there is a direct link between cholesterol and the neurotransmitter release , " said Shin .
" And we know exactly the molecular mechanics of what happens in the cells .
Cholesterol changes the shape of the protein to stimulate thinking and memory . "
While reducing the cholesterol in the brain may make you have less memory and cognitive skills , more cholesterol in the blood does not make people smarter .
Because cholesterol in the blood cannot get across the blood brain barrier , there is no connection to the amount of cholesterol a person eats and brain function .
Shin says that for many people taking cholesterol - lower statins can be very healthful and they should listen to their doctor when taking medication .

Space flight is a tough business .
In the 52 years since the beginning of American efforts to reach space , more than 160 launches , including that of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory on February 24 , have failed .
Here are some of the most devastating failures .
December 6 , 1957 : Vanguard TV3
The United States ’ first attempt to launch a satellite into orbit was also its first failure .
Two seconds after leaving the launch pad at Cape Canaveral , this rocket lost thrust and sank back down , rupturing and exploding its fuel tanks .
It had reached a height of about four feet .
Though the rocket was destroyed , the Vanguard satellite it was carrying was thrown clear , its transmitters still signaling .
It is now on display at the Smithsonian ’s Air and Space Museum .

April 4 , 1968 : Apollo 6
This was the final unmanned test for the Saturn V rocket before it would carry a three - man crew around the moon and back , and things did not go as planned .
Two minutes and five seconds into launch , the rocket was severely shaken by “ pogo oscillations ” — variations in thrust caused by changing fuel rates ( and named after the bouncy children ’s toy ) .
In unrelated flaws , parts flew off the lunar module adapter , and two of the five engines shut down prematurely during the second stage burn .
Apollo 6 did manage to reach space , but never made it to its planned 100 - mile circular orbit .
Later , the third rocket stage would also fail to reignite .

January 28 , 1986 : Challenger
Many were watching live when the space shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds into its flight , killing all seven astronauts on board .
At fault was the O -ring seal on the right solid rocket booster , which ruptured upon liftoff and allowed a jet of pressurized gas to rush from the motor .
The resulting destruction caused the shuttle ’s liquid hydrogen fuel to explode and aerodynamic forces to tear apart the orbiter .
The shuttle program was suspended for 32 months while the accident was investigated .

May 3 , 1986 : GOES - G__
Sometimes when it rains , it pours .
This NOAA weather satellite was to be NASA ’s first launch following the Challenger disaster .
But the rocket was struck by lightning shortly after launch .
Only 71 seconds after liftoff , an electrical fault caused the Delta 3194 rocket 's first - stage engine to shut down prematurely .
NASA destroyed the rocket 20 seconds later to avoid having it fall dangerously back to Earth .

Cosmos 1 , a project of the Planetary Society and Cosmos Studios , would have been the first solar sail spacecraft , and the first space mission by a space advocacy group .
Instead , the Volna rocket used to launch it from a Russian submarine never completed its scheduled burn , and the spacecraft crashed into the Barents Sea .

US arms globocorp Northrop Grumman have claimed a significant raygun first - producing a 100 + kilowatt laser beam using electrically powered equipment .
Blaster rays of this intensity formerly required the use of troublesome , toxic chemical fuels producing equally annoying wastes .
Not exactly portable yet .
According to Northrop , their record - breaking electric energy weapon actually put out slightly better than 105 kW in this latest test .
The firm claims that the blast was maintained for better than five minutes without problems , that it took " less than one second " to power up and that the beam quality was " very good " .
The 100 kW threshold , while somewhat arbitrary , is generally accepted as the point at which a laser beam becomes truly weapons grade - able to achieve useful battlefield tasks .
Such tasks might include the expeditious blasting of enemy rockets , shells , missiles or mortar bombs in mid flight - so preventing the harassing attacks on military bases which are such a common problem for western troops in combat right now .
" This achievement is particularly important because the 100 kW threshold has been viewed traditionally as a proof of principle for ' weapons grade ' power levels for high - energy lasers " , says Northrop raygun veep Dan Wildt .
Previously the only tech which could deliver powerful beams was that of chemical lasers - for instance the massive chemical oxygen iodine laser ( COIL ) cannon fitted in the mighty Airborne Laser jumbo jet , intended to blast possible future North Korean ICBMs as they boost upward from their launch pads .
But COIL weapons require immense amounts of dangerous , corrosive , toxic fuel and their exhaust products are equally nasty .
They can only be justified in rare circumstances like standing off nuclear attack - or perhaps some kind of one - off , unattributable spec-ops mission by the COIL laser gunship .
Hence the push for electrically driven lasers .
These are bulky , difficult to cool and require very large amounts of ' leccy ( Northrop 's kit is said to be about 20 per cent efficient , meaning that a 100 kW war - beam requires half a megawatt of juice - in the heavy tank ballpark rather than handheld or humvee mounted ) .
Nonetheless , they 're a lot simpler to take to war than the chemical jobs .
Northrop 's line is that achieving a hot electric beam is simple using their 15 kW " laser chain " units , which the company says can be hooked up together to make a raygun of any desired power output .
" Getting to 100 kW with replicated building blocks proves we can scale to these higher power levels if required , " said Jay Marmo , Northrop programme chief .
" Northrop Grumman is ready to bring high - power , solid state lasers to the defense of our deployed forces . "
It can't have been as easy as all that , though .
Northrop said ages ago they would produce a 100 kW beam by the end of last year : but they only felt confident enough to have government reps in for a test as of last month .
Meanwhile , despite the firm 's claim that it has done much work on " ruggedising " the kit for field use , it still looks rather fragile and cumbersome .
Much more significantly to the average home raygun user , the unit is very large and heavy - in line with previous Northrop figures indicating about 1.5 tonnes of machinery for a battle - grade beam - and that 's without power supply or beam pointing .
Such equipment will never do for head - mounted shark use .
It seems that the supervillain seeking up - to - the - minute cranial energy weapons for his execution pool menagerie may need to dabble in a bit of Jurassic Park style retro-creature production as well . ®
Malaysian Woman Jailed For Worshipping Tea Pot
I have heard of some pretty weird cults in my time , but this … well this one might just be my cup of tea .
Seriously , although the Malaysia constitution guarantees freedom of religion , a woman was recently arrested for joining a ‘ Tea - Pot Worshiping ’ cult .
The eccentric sect emphasizes unity between all religions and considers the teapot the symbol of purity and love â€œpouring from heaven.â€ 
According to Malaysian Muslim law , born Muslims , such as Mrs. Ali who was arrested , are forbidden from converting to other religions .
This lady had been arrested back in 1992 for the same reason and her case is an indication of the growing dissatisfaction of the non-Muslim Malaysians .
This narrow majority of ethnic Malays composes almost half of the total population , which is divided between Hindus of Indian origin , Christian and Buddhist ethnic Chinese .
Their interests among all others are supposed to be protected by the government .
â€ œThis has to stop .
They ca n’t be sending her again and again to prison for this .
She informed the court that she is not a Muslim .
She does n’t come under Sharia court anymore , â€ said her lawyer , Sa’adiah Din , to the press .
The community stands behind the woman and has long standing grievances with the policies of the government concerning religious freedom .
In the wake of this particular event , Christian churches made a rare political intervention , urging voters for the up and coming election to choose candidates who support freedom of worship .
Here ’s to the teapot .
May you pour forever free .

It looks like prosecutors in South Carolina are looking to charge Michael Phelps in connection with the bong - smoking photograph :
COLUMBIA , S.C. ( AP ) — Even if a South Carolina sheriff is successful in building a marijuana case against swimming superstar Michael Phelps , it might be hard to make the charges stick , defense attorneys say .
The case took a turn Thursday when lawyers for two people said their clients were among eight arrested last week and questioned at length about the November party near the University of South Carolina where Phelps was photographed smoking from a marijuana pipe .
At the time , the men were renters at the house .
The effort to prosecute Phelps on what would be at most a minor drug charge seems extreme compared to similar cases , lawyers said , and have led some to question whether the sheriff is being overzealous because he ’s dealing with a celebrity .
There are quite a lot of people smoking marijuana , especially when it comes from canadianmoms , and they do n’t face this kind of prosecution so it seems he ’s only receiving this treatment because of his celebrity status .
” The efforts that are being made here are unlike anything I ’ve ever seen before , ” said Jack Swerling , a defense attorney in South Carolina .
” I know Leon Lott , I know him to be an honorable guy .
I ’ve known him for 30 something years .
But the efforts here are extraordinary on simple possession cases . ”
Given that , it probably should n’t come as a surprise that the prosecutor in question here has made a career out of being flamboyantly aggressive in pursing the War on ( some ) Drugs :
Lott has made fighting drug crimes a central plank of his career .
He rose from patrol officer to captain of the narcotics division in the early 1990s and was well - known in the county for wearing stylish suits like the drug agents on ” Miami Vice ” and driving a Porsche seized from a drug dealer .
He was elected sheriff in 1996 .
The attention that Lott is giving to this case seems disproportionate considering the relatively light sentence that Phelps would receive if he were charged and convicted of possession of marijuana :
A person who violates this subsection with respect to twenty - eight grams or one ounce or less of marijuana or ten grams or less of hashish is guilty of a misdemeanor and , upon conviction , must be imprisoned not more than thirty days or fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred dollars .
In other words , this is a relatively low - level misdemeanor .
But this is a misdemeanor that could have an effect on Michael Phelps and his swimming career , and the employment of other people who smoke marijuana on a daily basis .
But how do we know that Phelps did n’t decide to buy cannabis to help him cope with the pressures of being a professional athlete ?
To help reduce his stress and anxiety ?
If this is the case , and it was for medicinal purposes and , being the high - profile athlete that people recognize him to be , it might have been in his best interests to consult with a medical practitioner first so that people would n’t get the wrong idea .
That ’s why users should decide to check out this page so that they have a better idea of how long marijuana stays in their body , just in case they get caught by law enforcement , or if you are subject to a random drug test at work .
If people are caught , they may only face a low - level misdemeanor .
So , why the attention from law enforcement ?
The answer , I think , is obvious .
Arresting and convicting Phelps , even on this relatively minor charge , would be a big “ get ” for a prosecutor , particularly a politically ambitious prosecutor who has built his career on being some modern - day version of Don Johnson with a law degree .
If Michael Phelps were just some guy from Baltimore who smoked marijuana while visiting the Palmetto State , this would n’t be happening .
That ’s what ’s wrong with the War on Drugs and proprietorial discretion .

Upper -Income Taxpayers Look for Ways to Sidestep Obama Tax - Hike Plan Obama 's new tax plan has some wondering how they can avoid paying higher taxes .
March 2 , 2009  -- Editor 's Note : Yesterday ABC
News published a version of this story which some readers felt did not provide a comprehensive enough analysis of Obama 's tax code for those families making $ 250 k or more .
ABCNews.com has heard those concerns and after review has decided to post an updated version of the story below .
President Barack Obama 's tax proposal -- which promises to increase taxes for those families with incomes of $ 250,000 or more -- has some Americans brainstorming ways to decrease their pay in an attempt to avoid paying higher taxes on every dollar they earn over the quarter million dollar mark .
A 63 - year - old attorney based in Lafayette , La. , who asked not to be named , told ABCNews.com that she plans to cut back on her business to get her annual income under the quarter million mark should the Obama tax plan be passed by Congress and become law .
" We are going to try to figure out how to make our income $ 249,999.00 , " she said .
" We have to find a way out where we can make just what we need to just under the line so we can benefit from Obama 's tax plan , " she added .
" Why kill yourself working if you 're going to give it all away to people who are n't working as hard ? "
But Gary Schatsky , a financial advisor and the president of NY - based Objectiveadvice.com , said that reducing your income wo n't help a great deal because of the way the country 's tax system is set up .
" Just going over $ 250,000 does n't mean it impacts your tax liability for every dollar before that , " said Schatsky , " It impacts you at the margin . "
Marginal or graduated tax systems like the one in the U.S. means only the money earned over a certain amount -- $ 250,000 in the case of Obama 's proposal -- will be taxed at an increased percentage .
For instance , for a person earning $ 350,00 , the first $ 250,000 of income would be taxed at lower tax rates , while the last $ 100,000 would be taxed at Obama 's higher rate .
" Only the incremental earnings above [ a quarter of a million dollars ] are taxed at a higher rate , " said Schatsky .
" [ T ] o focus keeping your income below a quarter million dollars is not going to have any spectacular magic for individual tax payers , " said Schatsky .
" The difference between $ 249,999 and $ 251,000 will probably have zero tax impact . "
Schatsky adds that he is not aware of very many people who would rather take a pay cut than pay taxes on the income that falls into a bracket that is taxed more .
" The last time I offered someone $ 500,000 of additional income there was very little instance of people saying ' no thank you , ' " he said .
Obama 's budget proposal calls for $ 989 billion in new taxes over the next 10 years , most of which will be earned from increased taxes on individuals who make more than $ 200,000 and from families who make more than $ 250,000 .
The expiration of the Bush administration 's tax cuts at the end of 2010 would garner an estimated $ 338 billion , $ 179 billion would come from reducing the size of some itemized deductions , such as mortgage interest and charitible donations , for higher - income taxpayers and $ 118 billion would be brought in from a hike in the capital gains tax .
The remaining $ 353 billion would come from taxes on businesses .
So far , Obama 's tax plan is being looked at skeptically by both Democrats and Republicans and therefore may not pass at all .
Dr. Sharon Poczatek , who runs her own dental practice in Boulder , Colo. , said that she too is trying to figure out ways to get out of paying the taxes proposed in Obama 's plan .
" I 've put thought into how to get under $ 250,000 , " said Poczatek .
" It would mean working fewer days which means having fewer employees , seeing fewer patients and taking time off . "
" Generally it means being less productive , " she said .
Poczatek argued that by reducing her income from her current $ 320,000 to under $ 250,000 by having her dental hygienist work fewer days and byl treating fewer patients , she would avoid paying higher taxes on the $ 70,000 that would be subject to increased taxation if Obama 's proposal is signed into law .
Additionally , any interest from a checking or savings account or capital gains from stocks , would also count as taxable income .
" The motivation for a lot of people like me -- dentists , entrepreneurs , lawyers -- is that the more you work the more money you make , " said Poczatek .
" But if I 'm going to be working just to give it back to the government -- it 's de-motivating and demoralizing . "
Can Obama 's Tax Plan Be Gamed ?
Schatsky did say that there are several commonly used techniques tax payers use to fall into a particular tax bracket .
" It 's very possible that there are plenty of things you can do with general tax planning techniques – attempting to recognize loses , pushing gains to years when your income is lower and increasing retirement plan contributions – to come below $ 250,000 , " said Schatsky .
" But Obama 's proposal has yet to be hammered out and the devil is in the details , " he added .
So far , Obama 's proposal does outline new limits on tax deducations for families earning more than $ 250,000 , including those on charitable donations , mortgage interest and state and local taxes .
Additionally , Obama said that the elimination of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans will benefit 95 percent of working families .
Because we have a marginal tax system , said Schatsky , what Obama 's plan means is that the amount of tax you pay on each incremental dollar is higher only when your income is pushed into a higher tax bracket .
Schatsky said that the incentive to get under $ 250,000 may be more so if the tax plan outlines that an individual who goes over a prescribed limit would face a reduced value of their itemized deductions .
" If the value of all your itemized deductions goes from a 33 percent level to a 28 percent level than there would be a reason for people to do dramatic things to reduce their incomes , " said Schatsky .
Peter Morici , a professor of business at The Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland , agrees that while it may be possible to sneak around the taxes , it wo n't be as simple as some may think .
" You have to be pretty close to $ 250,000 in terms of your income to get underneath it , " said Morici .
Does Obama Tax Plan Promote Class Warfare ?
Morici says that he believes Obama 's tax proposal could spark a kind of class war .
" What Obama is doing is pitting the poor against the upper middle class , " said Morici .
" He 'll tax the rich for the health benefits everyone else wants . "
Obama has said the new taxes on those making over $ 250,000 would go toward a fund that would support a gradual move to universal health care coverage .
Supporters of Obama 's budget plans say that those who are at the top and complaining need to look at the bigger picture .
" Those who are going to be taxed more are obviously going to complain but I think they may miss the point , " said Lisa Rotenstein , the chair of the Harvard Healthcare Policy Group at the Institute of Politics .
" This could have broader implications for the American economy as a whole improved health care means a healthier workforce that is more productive , " said Rotenstein .
But Colorado dentist Poczatek says those who support the increase in taxes misunderstand what it means for those who will end up paying more .
" I 'd like these people to know that we pay a lot of taxes , and have been paying a lot of taxes through the past administration , " said Pcozatek .
" We make a lot of money , it 's true , but we also already pay a lot of taxes , " she said .
" So maybe we got a little bit successful but we worked very hard , " she said .
" It 's taken us over 30 years and it did n't happen overnight .
Every day is a lot of work .
" We 're working for it and we 're still overtaxed . "
Or the year .
Frightening .
I ’ve been wondering why the impact of the financial crisis on the overall retirement “ system ” has n’t gotten more attention in the media .
We already knew the system was in bad shape before September 2008 .
According to the Fed ’s Survey of Consumer Finances , in 2007 , only 60.9 % of households where the head of household was age 55 - 64 had retirement accounts . . . and their median retirement balance was $ 98,000 .
Given that the stock market has fallen by over 50 % from its October 2007 peak – and that , for decades , the standard investment advice has been that stocks do better than any other asset class in the long term – we would be lucky if that median balance were more than $ 70,000 today .
The Bloomberg article linked to above describes the fragile state of state and local pension systems .
These systems suffer from two major problems today .
One is that even if they had been managed in a reasonable way , the fall in asset prices over the last year would have blown a huge hole in their long - term solvency .
The second , and the focus of the article , is the perverse behavior that is caused by accounting rules governing pension funds .
The key question for a pension fund is whether the assets it has today will be enough to pay off its future liabilities .
The assets are relatively easy to value , at least most of the time ; the future liabilities are relatively easy to predict actuarially ( although unanticipated developments , such as a sudden change in life expectancy , could mess up that calculation ) ; but the hard part is estimating the rate of return on the assets .
So . . . public pension funds are allowed to assess their long - term solvency using assumed annual rates of return , generally around 8 % per year .
Of course , as we know , things do n’t always work out that way : the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund ( which indexes virtually all U.S. stocks and bonds ) has an average annual rate of return of 0.9 % over the last 10 years , and even since its inception 1992 its annual return is only 6.0 % .
These optimistic assumptions are bad enough , because they allow underfunding of pensions .
But what ’s even more bizarre is the behavior this causes .
As the Bloomberg article explains , local governments issue pension obligation bonds to raise cash for their pension funds .
These bonds usually pay fixed interest rates , say 6 % , and the proceeds are then invested in risky assets .
But the magical thing is that because you are allowed to assume an 8 % return , for pension accounting purposes , the difference between 8 % and 6 % is free money !
Well , it ’s free money as far as this year ’s assessment of the pension is concerned .
In the long term , of course , it ’s a crazy investment strategy ( and a mistake many people make – comparing a risk - free interest rate you borrow money at with a risky expected rate you hope to earn ) .
And the results in the future are predictable : either higher taxes , or yet more value - destroying pension obligation bonds .
Sometimes people get caught saying stupid things , like Christine Whitman saying , “ You ’d be crazy not to have done this .
It ’s not a gimmick .
This is an ongoing benefit to taxpayers , ” but it ’s really a systemic problem .
Our retirement “ system ” has four main legs : Medicare , Social Security , corporate or government defined - benefit pensions , and private saving ( IRAs , 401 ( k ) s , etc. ) .
Right now it looks like Medicare and Social Security are the stronger legs .
Note :
The Bloomberg article refers disapprovingly to Jon Corzine ’s proposal to reduce state pension contributions during the recession .
I actually agree with Corzine , at least on principle .
When the pension fund ’s assets fall because of a recession , you do n’t want to force the state to make up the difference immediately , because that would be extremely procyclical – it would cripple the state budget right when you want to be spending more , not less .
The converse , of course , is that when the economy is good and tax revenues are high you should over - contribute to the pension fund – not just make up for the recession years , but also build up a surplus .
We ’ll see if that happens .
Art Therapy ?
Drawing Enhances Emotional Verbalization , Say Researchers
Research at the new School of Creative Arts Therapies at the University of Haifa : Drawing enhances emotional verbalization among children who live under the shadow of drug - addicted fathers
" The use of art seems to help with verbalizing trauma .
It is usually difficult to express the trauma through speech , yet the body remembers it , " said Prof.
Rachel Lev-Wiesel , Head of the Graduate School of Creative Arts Therapies who carried out the study .
Drawing helps children whose fathers are drug addicts to express their feelings , concludes a new study carried out at the School of Creative Arts Therapies at the University of Haifa .
" It is difficult to verbally describe a trauma , yet the body remembers it , " said Head of the school Prof.
Rachel Lev-Wiesel , who carried out the study alongside Revital Liraz of the Hosen Center in Beer Sheba .
People who have experienced trauma often find it difficult to describe their feelings and experiences in words .
Art therapy enables the client to expose these feelings first through non-verbal symbols , and then narrate them .
" The importance of therapy through the arts has increased over the past years , and as with every other discipline of therapy , much weight ought to be placed on basing therapist training on research , " said Prof. Lev-Wiesel .
Participating in this study were 60 children , aged nine to fourteen , who were arbitrarily divided into two groups .
The children in the first group were asked to draw their life in the shadow of a drug - addicted father and then to describe their experiences to a social worker who interviewed them .
The second group was asked to describe life with a drug - addicted father without use of drawings .
It was observed that already while drawing the first group of children spoke freely about their lives .
An analysis of the narratives provided by the two groups revealed that the descriptions given by those children who had been asked to draw first included more feelings and sensations , were longer , and expressed optimism for the future .
The children in the second group , however , were more reluctant to talk .
Their narratives were shorter , without feeling , and less coherent .
" Emotional - verbal ability is crucial for growth and for social skills , so enabling a child to increase ability of expression and sharing by means of drawing pictures is beneficial in contributing to the efficiency and effectiveness of therapy , " Prof.
Lev-Wiesel concluded .
Therapy through art is a relatively new field , she said , there is still a lack of empirical studies .
One of the goals of the new school is to expand the pool of researchers in the field .

Jennifer Hudson delivered an outstanding performance at Sunday night 's Super Bowl , but American Idol music director said the singer had lip - synched the national anthem .
American Idol music director Ricky Minor , told The Associated Press that , at his request , Hudson lip - synched the anthem to a previously recorded track .
This was such an important performance , because it 's the first time everyone has seen Jennifer .
But she 's in such a great place , with such great spirits , and time can heal her wounds .
She 's on fire right now and totally grounded , said Minor .
Hudson 's performance followed a tribute to the crew of U.S. Airways Flight 1542 and a performance of America the Beautiful by Faith Hill , who reportedly also lip - synched the song .

Update 2009 -01-08 : Typos fixed .
These are some remarks on the State and the conceptual possibility of consent , which I originally prepared for my appearance at the Molinari Society ’s Authors - Meet - Critics last week in Philadelphia , but which I opted not to read because of time constraints .
Fortunately , blogs are not subject to the same constraints of time or topicality , so I have expanded a bit on what I originally prepared , and now I offer them to you , gentle reader .
In their remarks on Crispin Sartwell ’s Against the State , both Christopher Morris and Jan Narveson object to Sartwell ’s conclusion that existing states are conceptually incompatible with the very possibility of consent ( 40 , emphasis added ) .
Specifically , they object to the strength or the sweep of the incompatibility claim : Morris thinks that this is an exaggeration and an unnecessary one , and Narveson insists that such a strong claim of incompatibility cannot be taken literally .
Each attempts to refute the incompatibility claim , at least as originally stated , by means of counterexamples .
Presumably , if you can point to at least one case where individual consent to be ruled is actually secured by an existing state , then clearly ( modal logic and all that ) it must not be logically impossible for existing states to secure it .
And each argues that Sartwell could have done just as well , for the purpose of undermining consensualist accounts of legitimacy , with a much weaker claim .
Narveson goes so far as to attribute this weaker claim to Sartwell , insisting that Sartwell really must have meant to say , not that existing states operate in a way that logically precludes any of their subjects from consenting to their rule , but rather that they operate so as to preclude the unanimous consent of all their subjects — that is , that there must always be at least one dissenter in any given state , not that there never can be any non-dissenters .
What then are the counterexamples to be considered ?
Narveson mentions those who voted in a government election for the party currently in power .
Morris , for his part , says that at least some people seem voluntarily to perform acts that seem to constitute consent , and they seem to do so with the requisite understandings .
I ’d be interested to know whether the performances Morris has in mind are performative utterances like the Pledge of Allegiance or citizenship oaths , where the utterer explicitly declares her support for a particular government , or whether he also means to include other kinds of acts , which have some other purpose but from which consent can reasonably be inferred .
But whatever sorts of spontaneous or ritualized performances Morris or Narveson may have in mind , what puzzles me is that , while they indicate these cases as counterexamples to Sartwell ’s strong claim — as presented on page 40 of Against the State — neither Morris nor Narveson seems to engage with the direct argument for which the strong claim is the conclusion — as presented on page 50 — in which Sartwell explicitly considers and rejects the claim that these sorts of individual performances could count as consenting to the State ’s rule .
Thus :
… consent is always compromised by force ; the mere existence of effective force dedicated to some end constitutes coercion toward that end , whatever you may think or want .
If I consent to abide by the law when that law is enforced by a huge body of men with guns and clubs , it is never clear , to say the least , whether my consent is genuine or not .
…
It will always be prudent for me , under such circumstances , to simulate consent , and there are no clear signs by which a simulation could be distinguished from a genuine consent in such a case .
That I am enthusiastic in my acquiescence to your overwhelming capacity for violence — that I pledge my allegiance according to formula , sing patriotic songs and so on — does not entail that I am not merely acquiescing .
…
[ T ]he mere existence of an overwhelming force by which the laws will be enforced compromises conceptually the possibility of voluntarily acceding to them .
Or put it this way : the power of government , constituted by hypothesis under contract , by which it preserves the liberties and properties of its citizens , is itself conceptually incompatible with the very possibility of their consent .
( 50 - 51 )
That is , the standing threat of overwhelming force ensures that any individual performance is made under duress , ruling out the preconditions for any genuine consent .
I ’d be interested to hear what Narveson and Morris make of this argument for rejecting their purported counterexamples to the strong claim .
Unless there is some response to it , then it seems like the attempt to use individual performances as evidence for the actual existence of ( at least some ) individual consent to the State , which is to say , as evidence against Sartwell ’s strong incompatibility claim , is simply question - begging .
Now , I think it would be perfectly fair for Narveson and Morris to object that Sartwell ’s argument , as stated , does need some tightening , and may also need some elaborating .
But I think that once the tightening and the elaborating have been done , the argument does in fact provide a basis for a very strong version of Crispin ’s strong incompatibility claim — and the strong version of that strong claim will be of general interest for anyone who intends to connect their notion of political right to respect for individual liberty , and their notion of liberty to respect for individual consent in the use of person or property .
Now , if someone goes through the motions of consenting while under a background threat of force against dissenters , for Narveson or Morris to be able to insist that it is possible for that to express genuine consent only if they deny at least one of the following principles :
Any seeming expression of consent to a condition C , if given under a standing threat of force against refusers , is given under duress .
Any seeming expression of consent to a condition C , if given under duress , cannot be treated as a genuine expression of consent to C .
If you cannot do anything that could be treated as a genuine expression of consent to a condition C , then you do not count as having consented to C .
All three seem initially plausible , to me at least , but if Narveson or Morris accepts all three , then it quickly follows that he cannot count as having consented to any condition C when there is a background threat of force against those who refuse to consent to C .
Since that ’s how existing states roll , nobody could do anything that would count as having consented to the state — and that would remain the case even for those who say that they consent with all their heart out of an earnest feeling of duty and with a great deal of pride .
If all three principles are accepted , then even if you want to give your consent to the State ’s rule over you , you ca n’t do it , because the state ’s unilateral imposition of the terms preempts your efforts to consent to the terms .
So , if Narveson or Morris wants to avoid that conclusion , he ’ll have to pick one of the principles to reject , and the question is which one to pick .
Principle ( 1 ) looks like it ’s not very far off of a definition of acting under duress ( or performing the specific action of seemingly - expressing - consent under duress ) .
I doubt that much of anyone will be inclined to reject that — or , if they are so inclined , it will probably be because they first rejected a principle very similar to principle ( 2 ) — basically , ( 2 ) modified so that under a standing threat of force against refusers substitutes for under duress — but are inclined to think that any case of genuine consent should ( therefore ) not be considered a case of action under duress .
In which case you have a counterexample to ( 1 ) rather than to ( 2 ) , as I ’ve stated the principles .
But if so , then the motivations for rejecting ( 1 ) will be similar enough to the motivations for rejecting ( 2 ) that my comments below should apply equally to either .
Principle ( 2 ) may look much more promising to someone who wants to defend the claim that people may be voluntarily consenting to state authority — even though they would have been forced to acquiesce even if they had tried to refuse .
The idea would be something like this :
Look , you ’ve given us a perfectly good reason to think that there are at least some people who would seem to be consenting but are n’t actually consenting .
Fine , but why think their situation affects those who sincerely do want to agree to the terms the State sets down ?
At most this seems like an epistemological problem — that we may have trouble finding out whether somebody consented or not just on the basis of their outward actions .
It does n’t make it logically impossible for them to have done so .
Some of the ways in which Sartwell tries to state his case might indeed incline you towards a worry like this — as when he argues that It will always be prudent for me , under such circumstances , to simulate consent , and there are no clear signs by which a simulation could be distinguished from a genuine consent in such a case .
The mere fact that a second or third party could n’t distinguish a simulation from genuine consent would n’t ( just by itself ) warrant the conclusion that there can be no such thing as genuine consent .
But I think that there are two possible responses to this worry .
First , if the worry is purely epistemic , it still poses a serious problem for any consensualist justification of the state — if it is the case , as I think it is , that it is illegitimate not only to use someone ’s person or property without her consent , but also to use someone ’s person or property when there is no possible way for you to find out whether she has consented or not .
( Consider this an argument to the effect that the State cannot be legitimate because it has no reliable procedure for determining whether its rule over any given subject is in fact legitimate or illegitimate .
Take that , Robert Nozick . )
But , secondly , and more to the point , I think that there is a stronger interpretation of Sartwell ’s argument , on which the worry is logical rather than epistemological , because the lack of clear signs of a distinction is not just a lack of diagnostic symptoms , but rather a lack of necessary criteria .
Think of it this way .
The claim that a seeming expression of consent does not count , when given under duress , is usually justified by something like the following principle :
Principle of the Alternative : If Norton wants to place Twain ’s person or property under a condition C , then Twain ’s performing an action A expresses consent to C only if there is some alternative action B , which Twain could have performed , which would have counted as refusing consent to C .
I take this principle to be a necessary condition for a performance to meet the concept of expressing consent .
An expression of consent is necessarily a choice among alternatives ; if there is nothing that would even count as a refusal , then what we have is just not a matter of consent .
Whatever Twain ’s personal feelings about A or C may be , what he ’s doing when he does A may be an expression of deference , or of obligation , or of some other similar sort of commitment .
But whatever it is , it ’s just not an expression of consent .
More strongly , and more importantly for the purposes of our argument , it is not enough that there just be something that would count as refusing consent .
Consent is a property of transactions between two or more parties , and for you to have it , there must not only be something that would count as a refusal ; your partner must also be willing to count that performance , whatever it is , as a refusal which she is bound to respect .
An alternative must not only be available ; there must be some reasonable expectation that the alternative would be practically effective .
Opt -Out Principle : If Norton wants to place Twain ’s person or property under a condition C , then Twain ’s performing an action A expresses consent to C only if there is some alternative action B , which Twain could have performed , which would have counted as refusing consent to C , and which Twain can reasonably expect Norton to accept as a decisive reason not to place Twain ’s person or property under C .
Again , I take this principle to be a necessary condition for a performance to count as expressing consent ; just as the lack of a possible refusal makes the issue one of obligation rather than consent , if Twain performs an expressive act without any expectation that there is some expression of refusal that Norton would consider himself bound to respect , then the issue is no longer one of consent , but rather of unilateral command .
And again , it hardly matters what Twain ’s personal feelings about the command may be .
Maybe he ’s into that kind of thing .
But whatever he is doing , he is not succeeding at doing anything that would count as expressing consent .
You ca n’t consent if you ’re never asked , and if there really is nothing that Norton would count as a binding refusal , then Twain has never even been asked , in any meaningful way .
I think the Principle of the Alternative and the Opt - Out Principle , or something a lot like them , are central to Sartwell ’s worry about the difficulty of telling a genuine willingness to accept the state ’s terms apart from a willingness simulated only under duress .
I also think that these principles , or something a lot like them , provide the only reasonable explanation for why , as a general thing , we should disregard a seeming expression of consent that was only given under duress , and would not have been given but for the threat .
( It might seem important that such seeming expressions are not sincere reflections of the utterer ’s inner state .
But that by itself is not enough .
I might freely give an insincere expression of consent — say I consent to let you use my car , but I secretly intend to call the cops on you and report it stolen .
But then the expression , even though insincere , is still genuine consent ; given my expression of consent to you , it would be false for me to claim that you had stolen my car from me , no matter what I may have whispered to myself in the dark recesses of my soul . )
But if both principles , or something a lot like them , express necessary conditions for a performance to genuinely express consent , then it looks like Principle ( 2 ) follows without much delay .
And it follows in its full logical force — the worry here , remember , has nothing to do with whether or not Norton knows that Twain is genuinely expressing consent ; it has to do with whether or not necessary criteria have been met for Twain ’s expressions to count as expressions of consent .
If the state rigs the situation in such a way that there is nothing it would count as opting out , then it has also rigged the situation in such a way that there is nothing it could really count as opting in ; opting just is n’t part of this game .
Neither expressing consent nor expressing dissent are even options that are on the table ; if the state gives non-negotiable , unilateral commands , merely being cheerfully responsive to those commands is not enough to count as consent in any meaningful sense .
And if this is the case , then it ought to be clear that it immediately defeats any claim that , for example , voting , or paying taxes , or reciting the Pledge of Allegiance , or anything of the sort , could count as giving your consent to be ruled by the government that you vote for , or pay taxes to , or pledge your allegiance to .
If not voting , not paying your taxes , not reciting the Pledge , or whatever , would exempt you from the terms that the United States imposes on you , then those who chose to do so anyway might well be counted as consenting to be ruled by the United States .
But anarchist activism would also be an awful lot easier than it is , and the United States would not , in fact , even amount to a State — at least , not in any sense of the word that anarchists use when they proclaim all States to be illegitimate ( because nonconsensual ) .
In the real world , where government taxes and government prohibitions fall on the heads of the voters and the non-voters alike , there is , as Lysander Spooner argues , no way that an performance under such conditions can count as consent to government .
In truth , in the case of individuals , their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent , even for the time being .
On the contrary , it is to be considered that , without his consent having ever been asked , a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist ; a government that forces him to pay money , render service , and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights , under peril of weighty punishments .
He sees , too , that other men practise this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot .
He sees further that , if he will but use the ballot himself , he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others , by subjecting them to his own .
In short , be finds himself , without his consent , so situated that , if he use the ballot , he may become a master ; if he does not use it , he must become a slave .
And he has no other alternative than these two .
In self - defence , he attempts the former .
His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle , where he must either kill others , or be killed himself .
Because , to save his own life in battle , a man attempts to take the lives of his opponents , it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing .
Neither in contests with the ballot – which is a mere substitute for a bullet – because , as his only chance of self - preservation , a man uses a ballot , is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered ; that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights , as a stake against those of others , to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers .
On the contrary , it is to be considered that , in an exigency , into which he had been forced by others , and in which no other means of self - defence offered , he , as a matter of necessity , used the only one that was left to him .
Doubtless the most miserable of men , under the most oppressive government in the world , if allowed the ballot , would use it , if they could see any chance of thereby ameliorating their condition .
But it would not therefore be a legitimate inference that the government itself , that crushes them , was one which they had voluntarily set up , or ever consented to .
Therefore a man ’s voting under the Constitution of the United States , is not to be taken as evidence that he ever freely assented to the Constitution , even for the time being .
Consequently we have no proof that any very large portion , even of the actual voters of the United States , ever really and voluntarily consented to the Constitution , even for the time being .
Nor can we ever have such proof , until every man is left perfectly free to consent , or not , without thereby subjecting himself or his property to injury or trespass from others .

Spooner , for his own reasons , couches his argument in epistemological terms — or , more specifically , in terms of legally cognizable proof .
But , once again , the argument that he frames epistemically can be reframed in terms of the conceptual criteria for a public expression of consent by means of the Principle of the Alternative and the Opt - Out Principle .
I suspect , then , that someone who wants to defend the claim that it is possible to consent to the state ’s authority — in spite of the background threat of coercion against anyone who attempts to refuse — will ultimately have to fall back on rejecting Principle ( 3 ) .
That is , in order to defend the claim the claim they are trying to defend , they will need to make some kind of distinction between the property of consenting as such , and the property of expressing consent .
In fact I think it ’s likely that this is the real core of Morris ’s and Narveson ’s intuitive sense that of course there must be some people who are consenting to existing states .
It may seem like we just know that it ’s possible to consent to the state , because we think we see it in people all around us , in their everyday practices and beliefs — whatever attitude the state may have towards them , their personal attitudes involve an acceptance of the state .
We might have the same feelings ourselves , or even if we do not , we might imagine that we have them .
We might even express this attitude of acceptance with a form of words like I want the State to rule me , or even I consent to the authority of the state .
But if the discussion is about consent , and not merely about acceptance or desire , and if consent is supposed to have any kind of weight in ethical deliberation about the transactions between two or more agents , then I doubt that such a notion of private attitudes of consent — attitudes which might not only be unexpressed at the moment , but might not even be expressible in principle , under the prevailing circumstances — is likely to be coherent .
That is , I doubt that private acceptance of the state can be understood as consent , at least in any sense that would preserve the connection between consent and political legitimacy , which is after all what inspired us to introduce the question of consent into the discussion of political theory in the first place .
If there is no effective possibility of refusal , then there is no possibility of publicly expressing consent , and if there is no possibility of publicly expressing consent , then there is no possibility of consenting .
If existing states make a standing threat to force people to submit to their terms , even if they do not agree to those terms , then governments cut off any effective possibility of refusal , and thus nobody can do anything that would count as consenting to be ruled by an existing state — even if she wants to do so , and even if she sincerely says that she agrees to the terms .
Since all existing states do make that standard threat , no existing state rules by consent over any individual subject .
And if governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed , then no government has any just powers at all .
Even the most patriotic pledger or the most dutiful voter has not consented to be bound by the terms the state imposes , even if she tried to get herself bound by them ; she is not bound in conscience to pay taxes , or to obey government prohibitions , or to obey the government ’s requirements in any other way , for even one second longer than she wants to .
And no existing state has either the duty or the right to enforce those terms on her .
It sounds counter - intuitive , but in fact it has worked .
The number of serious accidents has dropped since the signs – and even some of the traffic lights – were removed .
Kensington and Chelsea council in the heart of London is also stripping some of its thoroughfares and again the result has been encouraging .
Killerspiele mal wieder am Pranger : World Of Bullshit
Wie wäre es , statt der " Computerspiele " mal populistische Studien zu verbieten ?
Oder deren Lektüre erst " ab 18 " zu erlauben ?
Es würde nichts helfen , die " Experten " sind nicht mehr zu stoppen .
BERLIN taz Zwölf Seiten , vollgeschrieben von elf Autoren , liefert der aktuelle Spiegel zum " Amoklauf des Tim K. " .
Und weil sich in dieser haarsträubend voyeuristischen Titelgeschichte kein einziges die Tat erhellendes Wort findet , schiebt die Redaktion sicherheitshalber gleich im Anschluss drei Seiten zu einem völlig anderen
Thema hinterher , denn : " Deutschlands größte Jugendstudie kommt zu alarmierenden Ergebnissen : Neuntklässler verbringen jeden Tag im Schnitt etwa 140 Minuten mit Computerspielen - mehr als 14.000 gelten als spielsüchtig .
Hauptattraktion : das Online - Spektakel , World Of Warcraft ' . "
Was uns das sagen soll ?
Dumme Frage , Tim K. " liebte " doch auch diese ganzen " Computerspiele " , und da kann man mal sehen , wohin das führt und woher so was kommt .
Erst " duschen " sich die " Jugendlichen " vor lauter Gedaddel nur noch " alle zwei Wochen " , trinken nur noch " Cola light " statt selbst gepressten Orangensaft und essen " Pizza " , wovon sie Pickel bekommen und Ränder unter den Augen , und der Rest ergibt sich dann wie von selbst : schlechte Noten , Vereinsamung , Massaker .
Eine noch dümmere
Frage wäre , nebenbei bemerkt , ob so ein schicker Auftritt auf dem Spiegel - Titel für labile Jugendliche mit Ich - Schwäche nicht auch ein entscheidender Anreiz zum Amoklauf sein könnte .
Aber das fragen wir besser mal nicht , das führt zu weit , nämlich zu öden Diskussionen über den Bildungsnotstand oder die journalistische Ethik .
Selten jedenfalls ist nach einem Ereignis , bei dem es so wenig zu verstehen gibt , die öffentliche Debatte so schnell ins Groteske und Ärgerliche verrutscht wie in diesem Fall .
Je boulevardesker das Medium , desto dringlicher muss es seinem Publikum eine Erklärung liefern , ein Motiv , einen Grund , einen letzten , nicht weiter hinterfragbaren und doch sofort einleuchtenden Anstoß - und kann nicht .
Es sei denn , ein Christian Pfeiffer vom Kriminologischen Forschungsinstitut Niedersachsen kommt daher mit seiner Studie zu " World Of Warcraft " , für die er 44.610 Neuntklässler befragt und ermittelt haben will , dass 3 Prozent der Jungs " süchtig " sind , so richtig süchtig , als wärs Alkohol oder Kokain - und kein Spiel .
Ein Spiel übrigens , das , wie jedes gute Spiel , zwar durchaus einen gewissen " Suchtfaktor " aufweist , ansonsten aber so " blutrünstig " ist wie Poker .
Hier trifft das , was Harald Staun in der FAS sehr richtig als medialen " Aufklärungsfanatismus " bezeichnet hat , ungebremst auf das " Medienwirkungsgequatsche " von Leuten wie Christian Pfeiffer - der , wir erinnern uns , 2000 vermittels seiner Expertise und eines " Gutachtens " den peinlichen Sebnitz - Fall erst losgetreten hat : Rechtsextreme hätten im Schwimmbad der sächsischen Kleinstadt unter dem Beifall der übrigen Besucher den 8 - jährigen Joseph Kantelberg - Abdullah ertränkt .
Wenn man " World Of Warcraft " etwas vorwerfen kann , dann höchstens , dass es die Jugendlichen auf spielerische Weise mit den Grundgesetzen des Kapitalismus vertraut macht .
Als " Charakter " begegnet der Spieler anderen Figuren , mit denen er kommunizieren , handeln oder auch kämpfen kann , wobei es allerdings wesentlich zahmer zugeht als beim Massengemetzel in Filmen wie " Herr der Ringe " .
Nun mag man von Rollenspielwelten à la " Herr der Ringe " halten , was man will - zur " Vereinsamung " tragen sie nicht bei , stehen die Spieler doch gerade im Onlinemodus in regem Kontakt miteinander , tauschen sich aus , treffen sich bisweilen sogar ganz wirklich zu LAN - Partys .
Natürlich kann mans mit " World Of Warcraft " auch übertreiben .
Aber womit kann man das nicht ?
Natürlich würde es helfen , wenn Eltern nur den Hauch eines inhaltlichen Interesses für den spielerischen Zeitvertreib ihrer Kinder aufbringen könnten - verbotswütige Experten wie Christian Pfeiffer haben dafür keine Zeit , die sind offenbar zu sehr mit ihren Studien und ihrer medienwirksamen Agenda beschäftigt .
Wesentlich ausdauernder noch als vorm Computer übrigens hocken die Jugendlichen übrigens noch immer vor dem Fernseher .
Dort stehen ihre Chancen derzeit sehr gut , Christian Pfeiffer persönlich zu begegnen .
Heute Abend etwa sitzt er um 22.15 Uhr bei Phoenix in der " Expertenrunde " zum Thema : " Nach dem Amoklauf - Wie gefährlich sind Killerspiele ? "
In der offiziellen Ankündigung dieser wichtigen Sendung ist allen Ernstes von " , Ego - Shootern ' wie , World Of Warcraft ' " die Rede .
Schon klar .
Diskutieren die Experten demnächst auch über " Pornofilme wie , Bambi ' " ?
Daraus spricht mehr als nur Dummheit oder Desinteresse .
Hier verbirgt sich das eigentliche Problem : eine totale und selbstgefällige und unerschütterliche Ignoranz gegenüber jugendlichen Lebenswelten .
Das kann wirklich aggressiv machen , aggressiver noch als sechs Stunden " Counter Strike " am Stück .
Posted on 01 March 2009 by ShepRamsey
For the longest time I had Christopher Nolan ’s The Dark Knight to look forward to , sating my geeky need for anticipation .
And then that came .
And it was glorious .
And attached to that was the stunning first trailer for the twenty - years - in - the - making screen adaptation of Alan Moore ’s Watchmen .
And that ’s been keeping me pretty damn busy since ( and hell , before too ) .
Now we are less than a week ( !!! ) away from the film finally hitting theaters .
We have less than a week before Zack Snyder slaps us in the face with his mind - blowing visuals , bringing to life one of the most complex , fascinating and culturally relevant superhero stories ever told .
And then what ?
What ’s next after we finally get our Watchmen ?
Well , do n’t worry , because there ’s certainly more Watchmen on the way .
March 24 sees the release of the accompanying film , the animated Tales of the Black Freighter , taken from the comic book within the comic book of Moore ’s original Watchmen novel .
The trailer looked quite promising and what ’s possibly even more exciting than that is the included “ documentary ” version of Hollis Mason ’s Under the Hood , which we know from the excerpts between early chapters of Watchmen .
And on top of that , we ’ve also got the two different alternate cuts of the film ahead of us , currently slated for a July DVD / Blu- Ray release and possible limited theatrical release .
Snyder ’s director ’s cut of his already 158 - minute superhero epic will run 190 minutes and another alternate version will be the 205 - minute cut that will incorporate the Tales of the Black Freighter material .
So I think after this Friday , we ’re pretty much covered for another little while in terms of more Watchmen , but what else is on the horizon ?
Any other event - movies translating some great source material to the silver screen ?
This summer is looking pretty bleak .
There are a lot of pretty bad - looking sequels as well as more than one big - budget blockbuster based on a toy .
The new Harry Potter film is coming out , but even that is starting to look like it might not be so great .
And I ’m sorry , but X - Men Origins : Wolverine , Star Trek , and Angels and Demons just are n’t doing it for me .
Way off on the horizon , though , there is hope .
There is a piece of comic book gold that is currently in development by Columbia Pictures to blow all our minds away and if Watchmen pulls in some big business , we can look forward to this one being all that much closer to a reality .
I speak of course of Garth Ennis ’s Preacher series .
Currently attached to the project is Sam Mendes , the Oscar - winning director of the films American Beauty , Road to Perdition , Jarhead , and Revolutionary Road .
For the uninitiated , Preacher is an excellent , certainly transgressive and controversial series involving a Texas preacher named Jesse Custer , who becomes possessed by a supernatural angel - demon spawn called Genesis and spends the majority of the comic getting into some pretty fucked up adventures , accompanied by his girlfriend , Tulip , and an Irish vampire named Cassidy .
He literally searches for God so that he might , for all intents and purposes , tell him “ fuck you ” for abandoning Heaven .
Various topics include intense gluttony , bestiality , orgies , suicide , torture , murder , removing faces , and the anal rape of crazy one - eyed German guys , to name a few .
Not to mention the constant profanity and general blasphemy .
So you can see what I mean by controversial .
It ’s all pretty rough stuff , but if you can stomach it , it ’s an incredibly well - written , dark - humored , and fascinating read that flips normal perception of religion on its head .
Mendes is certainly not the director I would have thought of for this material , but I ’m nevertheless encouraged by the choice .
To read the comic , its Texas charm and over - the - top violence make it seem as if it were tailor - made for a director like Robert Rodriguez , who had expressed interest in the project , but I fear that he would ’ve given us exactly what we expected and ultimately underwhelmed us because of that .
Also , I do n’t quite know if Rodriguez has the right sense of humor for the material .
Personally , I always thought if you were to give the Coen brothers a nice big budget , they could whip up something terrific with it .
But I like the pick of Mendes .
He ’s a terrific director , and you can tell that by choosing him , they ’re planning on making a movie that ’s actually going to be pretty good instead of just watering down the material with some hack director so they can just sell a few tickets .
( Although if you water down this material , you really do n’t have much left . )
I only worry that he might try to use his clout to completely reinvent the source material , kind of like what Darren Aronofsky ’s plans were when he was attached to Batman : Year One and he wanted to make Bruce Wayne homeless .
Hmmm … I wonder .
The project has had a rocky history , tracing back to the late nineties .
Ennis had completed a script , based mostly on Gone to Texas , the first story arc .
He was shopping it around and it ended up in the hands of Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier , who were planning on producing and financing the film through their View Askew production company with Rachel Talalay ( director of the terrible Freddy ’s Dead : The Final Nightmare and Tank Girl ) set to direct and James Marsden set to star in the lead .
That all eventually fell through some time after Smith and Mosier could n’t get Bob Weinstein , then - co- chairman of Miramax , involved .
In 2006 , HBO announced plans to turn it into a series , which format - wise would have been great .
However it was being championed by Mark Steven Johnson , of Daredevil and Ghost Rider shame .
His plan was intriguing , though , as he wanted to turn each individual comic of the series into an episode of the show , nearly shot - for - shot .
But from the guy that made the aforementioned travesties , it still made myself and fellow Preacher fans understandably nervous .
But all that ended , anyway , when in August 2008 , new executives at HBO decided to abandon the project completely .
Now Columbia
Pictures is trying their hand at it , with Mendes in the director ’s chair .
And if he does n’t Revolutionary Road this up , then I think we ought to have one hell of an interesting picture on our hands .
So there .
I have something pretty big and awesome to look forward to , and if Watchmen makes R- rated comic book fare the hot new thing , then we can certainly look foward to this dream becoming a reality in the not - too - distant future .
My fingers are crossed !
I have but one request , however , that I shall end on , and that is this : Josh Brolin .
Read the damn comic , look me in the face , and tell me I ’m wrong .
Josh .
Fucking .
Brolin .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The dollar will remain the world ’s dominant reserve currency and a strong U.S. currency is key to lifting the world out of economic and financial crisis , World Bank President Robert Zoellick said on Tuesday .
Speaking at a newsmaker event at Thomson Reuters ’ London office , Zoellick announced a $ 50 billion program to reverse a sharp drop in trade in the global crisis and urged G20 leaders to back the effort .
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said on Tuesday that world trade was in free fall and should decline by 13.2 percent in 2009 as the economic crisis cuts demand across the globe .
Zoellick said the program would include funding from governments , starting with contributions from Britain and the Netherlands , regional development banks and private - sector banks such as Standard Chartered , Standard Bank and Rabobank .
He said it was an example of how multilateral institutions like the World Bank could be used to help fix problems related to the financial crisis .
But he played down the chances of a dethroning of the dollar as the world ’s leading currency .
“ I think the dollar will remain the principal reserve currency .
The question will be whether you have complementary measures , ” Zoellick said in an interview with Reuters .
CHINESE PROPOSAL
China has provoked debate about the dollar ’s status as the world ’s main unit of exchange by suggesting the wider use of Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) created by the International Monetary Fund as an international reserve asset .
While those ideas were worth discussing , for instance to increase international liquidity , Zoellick said that did not change the importance of the dollar .
“ A dollar - based system and a strong dollar ... will be critical to pull us out of this hole .
Over time , however , you will see discussions over the role of the dollar , ” he said .
Given the important role the U.S. dollar plays in the global financial system , it is incumbent upon the United States to pursue sound economic , fiscal and monetary policies , he said .
It would take more than a G20 summit to establish a new reserve currency , which requires functioning financial markets .
“ To create a reserve currency you need to have more than a summit or a meeting , you have to create financial markets where people feel comfortable moving in and out of the currency . ”
If the Chinese yuan is to start playing a larger role , it will require full convertibility of its currency and greater transparency , he said .
However , China ’s contribution to the debate was a healthy development showing its engagement in the international financial system .
DANGEROUS YEAR
The World Bank chief said the world economy faced a “ dangerous year ” and could stumble deeper into recession .
“ Everyone needs to approach this crisis with a healthy dose of humility because we ’ve seen surprises , we still face high uncertainty , ” he said .
“ It remains a dangerous year in terms of downside risks . ”
Zoellick said the Bank had revised down its growth forecast for the world economy in 2009 to - 1.7 percent -- below the IMF ’s most recent forecasts but still well shy of a 4.3 percent contraction predicted on Tuesday by the OECD .
He said growth would continue in China , albeit at a lower level , and the United States should begin to show signs of recovery , seeding a broader upturn .
“ If the U.S. can follow through on its banking program - there is a reasonable chance that you will start growth in the U.S. first .
Whether it is 2009 or 2010 is a little bit hard for me to tell , ” Zoellick said .
G20
The World Bank president said his priority at the G20 financial summit of the world ’s largest industrialized and developing countries on Thursday was to ensure that leaders not only debate reform and regulation , but also consider balanced global growth .
“ It would be a big mistake if it were to become a summit of high finance without focusing on the poor , ” he said .
He is pressing leaders to contribute 0.7 percent of their stimulus packages to a World Bank - run vulnerability fund for the poor .
Investment in the poorest regions , such as Africa and Asia , to raise productivity will bear dividends by achieving more balanced economic development , he said .
To this end , the World Bank is promoting a trade finance initiative .

I ’ve been reading tons of articles about yesterday ’s Facebook announcements and have been trying to digest them .
What has been most amazing is the wide range of semi-accurate reporting taking place .
For example , Brendan Gahan at Gigaom inaccurately states that , “ In another move that mimics the Twitter functionality , Facebook announced that from now on there will no longer be a limit to the number of friends a user can have ( the previous limit was 5,000 ) .
There will also no longer be Facebook ‘ Pages ’ everyone will have profiles instead . ”
I can understand why Brendan perceived that to be the case and I can also understand that some of these announcements do more to confuse companies then help them even though many of the changes were made with benevolent intentions .
So what exactly are the primary changes and why are some of them being so misconstrued ?
Also , were these updates a move against Twitter , FriendFeed , or none of the above ?
Why Did Facebook Update the Pages Product ?
The first thing that many people are wondering is why on earth did Facebook update the Pages products when there were thousands of businesses functioning under the existing design ?
While it was n’t clearly articulated to brands , this was simply part of the Facebook pages evolution .
When Facebook redesigned the site , they did not redesign the Pages product .
This redesign was a way to bring it up to par with the other products .
What Are the Benefits of the New Pages ?
With the upgrade in designs comes a few new features .
There is one feature ( or upgrade ) that ’s most significant which is that all information posted to a Page ’s stream ( aka “ Feed ” ) will go out to a user ’s feed .
This gives brands much greater exposure within the feed in general .
That information also includes status updates which were previously not available to Pages .
The Friend Limit Has Not Been Removed
Dubbed the “ Mike Arrington ” feature yesterday by Chris Cox , this was presented as a way to open up specific information within a profile to the public .
This is not immediately happening .
Instead , Mike Arrington is being encouraged to create a “ Page ” not a “ profile ” where he can post information that will enter users ’ feeds .
Are you confused still ?
We can understand why !
According to Facebook , “ Chris Cox jokingly referred to the fact that at some point , user profiles will have the ability to share with more than 5,000 people .
This is not available right now , just the direciton in which we are heading . ”
Why Do Users Now Land On My Feed Instead of Information About My Product ?
Many individuals that I ’ve spoken to have complained that they invested time and effort to create a nice landing page with activities for users to engage in and now that time has gone to waste .
Ultimately , the time has not gone to waste and page administrators can choose which tab new visitors and fans land on .
This means that if you ’d like to have a custom HTML landing page that all new visitors of your Page view on their first visit , you can now control that .
Is This A Move Against Twitter ?
Yes , Facebook has tried to acquire Twitter and now they are opening up even more but not all of these changes are a significant shot at Twitter .
People keep referencing Twitter ’s streaming feed , which as far as I know , still is not streaming ( unless of course you are using TweetDeck , Twhirl , or any other add - on ) .
Facebook also invented the feed so it ’s hard to say that Facebook ’s redesigned homepage is a direct shot at Twitter .
Is This A Move Against FriendFeed ?
Yes !
Well it is n’t really a move directly against FriendFeed necessarily , but Facebook clearly lifted a lot of the features and layout that FriendFeed currently provides .
Many of the features that Facebook previously had on their homepage feed is still there except this time around , the filters are a bit more prevalent .
WASHINGTON -- U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown sounded a decidedly antiprotectionist note in an address to Congress on Wednesday , telling lawmakers that " the challenges we all face are all global . "
In a speech to a special joint session of Congress , Mr. Brown said that governments should avoid the temptation to erect trade barriers as their economies struggle in the face of the worsening recession .

In what should come as no surprise to anyone but the auto executives , GM , Chrysler May Need ‘ Considerably ’ More Aid .
General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC may need “ considerably ” more government aid than their request for as much as $ 21.6 billion , said Steven Rattner , the U.S. Treasury ’s chief auto adviser .
“ It could be considerably higher , I wo n’t deny that , ” Rattner said , when asked whether U.S. aid sought could rise to $ 30 billion or $ 40 billion .
My Comment
Rattner and President Barack Obama ’s auto task force are assessing proposals from GM and Chrysler and deciding whether to recommend additional aid or tip the car companies into bankruptcy .
Rattner said the task force will give its “ sense of direction ” before March 31 .
Chrysler and GM have received $ 17.4 billion since December and requested more last month .
My Comment
GM ’s bondholders “ are looking to the government to help them solve their problem , ” Rattner said .
“ The government cannot solve everybody ’s problems , and we need for the bondholders to become part of this in a constructive way . ”
“ There ’s no real uptick , no real sense that the company would generate meaningful amounts of cash flow on a stand - alone basis , ” Rattner said of Chrysler .
“ We have not made a determination on whether they could exist on a stand - alone basis , but we do find their idea of partnership with Fiat a worthy idea to consider . ”
My Comment
Rattner said any decision about GM and Chrysler management would be tied to the ultimate configuration of the companies “ and I ’m not in a position to comment on that today . ”
My Comment
GM Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner and Chrysler ’s Robert Nardelli have been “ exceptionally cooperative , ” “ thoughtful , ” and “ energetic , ” Rattner said .
“ They ’re good guys really trying hard to run those companies , ” Rattner said .
“ I have nothing bad to say about them . ”

Is China dumping the dollar ?
You may have seen that Matt Drudge has a screaming headline up right now , BEIJING TO PITCH NEW GLOBAL CURRENCY ; DUMP DOLLAR . "
( Drudge links to a muuh more carefully worded Financial Times story . )
This strikes me as a significant moment , but let ’s hang on a second before we lose our heads .
The story , also reported by the Wall Street Journal , is based on this rather mildly worded speech by Zhou Xiaochuan , the head of China ’s central bank .
In it , Zhou asks , " What kind of international reserve currency do we need to secure global financial stability and facilitate world economic growth , which was one of the purposes for establishing the IMF ? "
Theoretically , an international reserve currency should first be anchored to a stable benchmark and issued according to a clear set of rules , therefore to ensure orderly supply ; second , its supply should be flexible enough to allow timely adjustment according to the changing demand ; third , such adjustments should be disconnected from economic conditions and sovereign interests of any single country .
The acceptance of credit - based national currencies as major international reserve currencies , as is the case in the current system , is a rare special case in history .
The crisis called again for creative reform of the existing international monetary system towards an international reserve currency with a stable value , rule - based issuance and manageable supply , so as to achieve the objective of safeguarding global economic and financial stability .
Though Zhou does not say so explicitly , the clear implication is that the dollar is n’t doing these things .
Interestingly , he cites John Maynard Keynes :
Back to the 1940s , Keynes had already proposed to introduce an international currency unit named " Bancor " , based on the value of 30 representative commodities .
Unfortunately , the proposal was not accepted .
The collapse of the Bretton Woods system , which was based on the White approach , indicates that the Keynesian approach may be more farsighted .
But , he admits , " The re-establishment of a new and widely accepted reserve currency with a stable valuation benchmark may take a long time . "
As the WSJ explains :
[ T ]he technical and political hurdles to implementing China ’s recommendation are enormous , so even if backed by other nations , the proposal is unlikely to change the dollar ’s role in the short term . …
The central banker ’s proposal reflects both China ’s desire to hold its $ 1.95 trillion in reserves in something other than U.S. dollars and the fact that Beijing has few alternatives .
With more U.S. dollars continuing to pour into China from trade and investment , Beijing has no realistic option other than storing them in U.S. debt .
Looks like you can hang on to those greenbacks for a little while longer .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bank may be the dirtiest of four - letter words these days .
A close second is the acronym TARP .
Several top banks have taken billions of dollars in government aid from the Troubled Asset Recovery Program during the past few months but there has been little evidence that they have used the funds to boost lending to consumers and businesses .
Lawmakers and taxpayers are rightfully outraged about how little has seemed to change in the banking business .
Even though financial firms are now beholden to you and me , many are still spending heavily on outlandish bonuses and seemingly frivolous things like stadium naming rights deals .
That 's why Treasury Secretary unveiled a new initiative Tuesday called the Financial Stability Plan ( RIP TARP ! ) to try and get banks to start lending again .
It 's also why the CEOs of the eight banks that took part in the first round of TARP , including the heads of Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , are set to appear before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday to explain how they 've used government funds .
But not all banks deserve our scorn .
In fact , there 's a handful of banks that amazingly are trading at higher stock prices now than they were six months ago , just before Lehman Brothers blew up .
Take a look at TFS Financial ( TFSL ) , a savings and loan in Cleveland with $ 10.9 billion in assets .
Despite the fact that the company is headquartered in a city that has been hit hard by rising foreclosures , the bank has continued to perform well .
Shares are up 11 % in the past six months .
While some banks have reported a decrease in assets due to reduced lending activity , TFS said that assets rose slightly in its most recent quarter due to an increase in mortgage loans .
The company raised its dividend by 40 % in January .
And here 's what will probably be of most interest to readers : TFS has not asked for any funding from the much - maligned Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Chairman and CEO Marc A. Stefanski said in a statement in late October that " we 've got money for mortgages " and that he did n't think " our customers want us to use their taxpayer money to run our business .
We should be able to generate our own funds . "
Stefanski added in the bank 's annual report that it would be " inappropriate " to apply for TARP funds .
TFS is not the only bank to have scorned government funding ... and win the hearts of investors as well as taxpayers .
People 's United Financial ( PBCT ) , a bank based in Bridgeport , Ct. with $ 20 billion in assets , has also spurned TARP .
And with good reason , the bank reported that net charge - offs as a percentage of loans in 2008 was unchanged from 2007 , despite the recession .
And the ratio is a ridiculously low 0.1 %
" Our disciplined underwriting standards have resulted in consistent asset quality results , " noted People 's United Financial CFO Paul D. Burner in the bank 's latest earnings report .
That 's an understatement .
A spokesman for the bank added that the bank has about $ 2.5 billion in excess capital and that the bank never made subprime mortgage loans or alt - A loans .
Not surprisingly , the stock has held up much better than its banking brethren , rising 3 % in the past six months compared to a more than 50 % drop in the KBW Bank Index .
Shares of Capitol Federal Financial , a Topeka , KS .- based bank and fellow TARP avoider , are also up 3 % in the past six months .
The bank , with about $ 8.2 billion in assets , is a rarity in the sector : its earnings are actually expected to increase this fiscal year .
And like People 's United , Capitol Federal Financial ( CFFN ) has largely steered clear of the subprime mortgage mess .
The bank reported that non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans was just 0.35 % at the end of December .
So there you have it .
Some banks acted responsibly during the housing boom and did n't need to go running to the government for help .
They 've been rewarded for doing so .
And rightfully so .
Too bad they 're part of a small club .
DNA evidence from a multimillion - euro jewelry heist in Berlin leads to twins with a criminal record , but since the evidence could point to either one , German law says that neither can be convicted :
German law stipulates that each criminal must be individually proven guilty .
The problem in the case of the O. brothers is that their twin DNA is so similar that neither can be exclusively linked to the evidence using current methods of DNA analysis .
So even though both have criminal records and may have committed the heist together , Hassan and Abbas O. have been set free .
Both brothers have stolidly refused to comment ever since their arrests on February 11 .
Since no further evidence has become available , police cannot detain them .
Rails Underground - A London - Based Rails Conference for 2009
Last month , David A Black announced that O'Reilly and Ruby Central would n't be putting on a European Rails conference - as they have for the past few years :
Ruby Central and O’Reilly have decided to take a hiatus from producing RailsConf Europe this year , for the simple reason that it did n’t bring in enough revenue last year to justify doing it again , particularly given the tight economy and the need to err on the side of caution .
The enterprising Mark Coleman decided , however , that Europe must have a big Rails conference and he 's put together Rails Underground 2009 .
Based in London , it takes place over July 24 - 25 , 2009 and at least several luminaries will be in attendance , including Yehuda Katz , Dr Nic Williams , Jason Hoffman , and Geoffrey Grosenbach .
David Heinemeier
Hansson wo n't be there but will attend " virtually " to give a presentation over a video link ( as he did at Euruko 2008 ) .
Registration is currently in a very limited ( 30 tickets only ! ) " very early bird " phase costing £ 160 , but the regular early bird rate of £ 180 will kick in once those have been sold .
If you want to speak , the deadline for proposals is noon on May 18th .

Stars forced to relocate near the Southern Fish [ heic0902 ]
3 March 2009
About 100 million light - years away , in the constellation of Piscis Austrinus ( the Southern Fish ) , three galaxies are playing a game of gravitational give - and - take that might ultimately lead to their merger into one enormous entity .
A new image from the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope allows astronomers to view the movement of gases from galaxy to galaxy , revealing the intricate interplay among them .
The three pictured galaxies - NGC 7173 ( middle left ) , NCG 7174 ( middle right ) and NGC 7176 ( lower right ) - are part of the Hickson Compact Group 90 , named after astronomer Paul Hickson , who first catalogued these small clusters of galaxies in the 1980s .
NGC 7173 and NGC 7176 appear to be smooth , normal elliptical galaxies without much gas and dust .
In stark contrast , NGC 7174 is a mangled spiral galaxy , barely clinging to independent existence as it is ripped apart by its close neighbours .
The strong tidal interaction surging through the galaxies has dragged a significant number of stars away from their home galaxies .
These stars are now spread out , forming a tenuous luminous component in the galaxy group .
Ultimately , astronomers believe that the stars in NGC 7174 will be redistributed into a giant ' island universe ' , tens to hundreds of times as massive as our own Milky Way .

' There definitely is a God ' : Christians hit back at atheist buses with own adverts
Christian groups are launching their own advertisements to run across the side of London buses following an atheist campaign .
The British Humanist Association launched adverts earlier in the year proclaiming : ' There is probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . '
It sparked almost 150 complaints to the Advertising Standard Authority from people claiming the campaign was offensive .
Oh yes there is : The Trinitarian Bible Society and the Russian Orthodox Church have paid for their own pro-God adverts in response to the British Humanist Association 's ' offensive ' campaign
Oh no there is n't ( probably ) :
The atheist adverts were launched earlier in the year , sparking 150 complaints .
It was later ruled they were unlikely to cause offence
Now the Christian party , the Trinitarian Bible Society and the Russian Orthodox Church have paid for their own pro-God adverts that will run on 175 buses across central and east London and the West End for two weeks from Monday .
The advert for the Christian Party includes the slogan : ' There definitely is a God .
So join the Christian Party and enjoy your life . '
The Russian Orthodox Church , meanwhile , has booked 25 bus adverts , backed with a sponsorship deal with Russian Hour TV .
The Trinitarian Bible Society 's advert uses a line from Psalm 53 that reads : ' The fool hath said in his heart , there is no God . '
It will appear on 100 buses .
The ASA ruled that the Humanist Association 's campaign did not break any advertising rules , concluding that the adverts were an 'expression of the advertiser 's opinion and that the claims in it were not capable of objective substantiation ' .
As a result it was ruled that it was unlikely to mislead or to cause widespread offence .
Joe Conason writes this week about how companies keep their corporate interests offshore - to evade paying their fair share of taxes :
According to the Government Accountability Office , nearly all of America 's top 100 corporations maintain subsidiaries in countries identified as tax havens .
As the GAO notes , there could be reasons other than avoiding the IRS to set up branches in places such as Singapore , Luxembourg and Switzerland , where taxes are light or nonexistent and keeping clients ' illicit secrets is considered a matter of national pride .
But what reason other than evasion could there be for Goldman Sachs Group to set up three subsidiaries in Bermuda , five in Mauritius , and 15 in the Cayman Islands ?
Why did Countrywide Financial need two subsidiaries in Guernsey ?
Why did Wachovia need 18 subsidiaries in Bermuda , three in the British Virgin Islands , and 16 in the Caymans ?
Why did Lehman Brothers need 31 subsidiaries in the Caymans ?
What do Bank of America 's 59 subsidiaries in the Caymans actually do ?
Why does Citigroup need 427 separate subsidiaries in tax havens , including 12 in the Channel Islands , 21 in Jersey , 91 in Luxembourg , 19 in Bermuda and 90 in the Caymans ?
What exactly is going on at Morgan Stanley 's 19 subs in Jersey , 29 subs in Luxembourg , 14 subs in the Marshall Islands , and its amazing 158 subs in the Caymans ?
And speaking of AIG , why does it have 18 subs in tax - haven countries ?
( Do n't expect to find out from Fox News Channel or the New York Post , because News Corp. has its own constellation of strange subsidiaries , including 33 in the Caymans alone . )
When the cost of these shenanigans was last estimated two years ago , the U.S. government 's annual loss in revenue due to tax avoidance by major corporations and super - rich individuals was pegged at about $ 100 billion -- considerably more than a rounding error , even today .
But of course that is only a rough assessment , as is the estimate of $ 12 trillion in untaxed assets hidden around the world .
Nobody will know for certain until the books are opened and transparency is established .
[...]
None of these tax havens could exist without the connivance or at least the cooperation of the world 's most powerful governments , which remain dominated by financial industry lobbyists even now .
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has sought greater transparency from the tax havens for years , hearing promises from most and defiance from a few .
[...]
Perhaps the UBS case indicates a change in that unwholesome trend and a renewed willingness on the part of American authorities to crack the tax havens -- which was not a priority , to put it mildly , of the Bush administration .
As a senator , Barack Obama supported legislation to break open the secret financial regimes , by retaliating against countries and principalities that refuse to cooperate .
Now Congress and the White House should pass such legislation and make breaking the tax havens a high priority in partnership with the European Union , the OECD and World Bank .
They could start by threatening to outlaw transactions between American banks and financial institutions in any country that rejects new rules for transparency and reciprocal information .
Hey , you did n't have to agree quite so quickly .
Here 's the genesis of today 's self - flagellation :
An hour or two ago my desktop computer began emitting an unfamiliar audible alert .
At first I did what I always do when my computer does something unusual : I ignored it .
But the alert continued at what seemed to be regular intervals ; so regular as to shake me from inaction .
My initial thought was that it must be an Outlook appointment alert -- a feature I use so infrequently as to be uncertain about its auditory characteristics .
However , there did n't appear to be any visual confirmation of that suspicion , either from the Outlook UI or settings .
TweetDeck ?
No , I am very familiar with the sounds of TweetDeck and long ago ( long ago being relative in Twitterese ) disabled its alert both to quiet the cacophony and convince my wife to stop packing that suitcase .
Perhaps , I posit next , it is some rude Web site on one of the dozens of windows I have open at any given moment , so I closed both browsers .
To no avail .
Every ... five ... minutes .
Yes , I understand that muting the volume most likely would have provided at least temporary relief , but by this point I wanted more than that , I wanted an answer .
So I close every application , shut down the machine , remove it from its docking station , reinsert and reboot .
I 'm telling you The Terminator has nothing on this thing .
Every ... five ... minutes .
By now I 've spent a good 20 minutes trying and at least five times that long enduring .
It 's time to seek assistance , but rather than trouble the help desk I decide to first send a plaintive e-mail to my Network World colleagues .
Here is that e-mail , which you will see next was never actually sent :
" Please spare me a help desk encounter and looming insanity ...... every 5 minutes I am getting an audible alert from my computer and I have n't the foggiest notion what application is doing it or why .
This started this morning .
It sounds like something Outlook might use to remind one of an appointment or a boring cell phone ringtone ... "
Flash !
The light comes on at the exact moment I finish typing the word ringtone :
It 's my bleeping cell phone -- in my bleeping pants pocket -- that is doing all this bleeping bleating .
The device is telling me that its battery is low .
And that I am an idiot .
How could someone not recognize their own phone 's low - battery warning , you ask ?
You must be new here , I answer , for it 's well established in the minds of regular readers that I have little use for my mobile phone .
In fact , the one in my pocket is relatively new , I almost never have it turned on , and , truth be told , this was the very first time it had made any noise of any kind .
So that 's my excuse .
That and I 'm such an idiot .

Update : New York Attorney General takes credit for rescinding Chase fee
Citing “ customer feedback , ” Chase Card Services is rescinding a controversial $ 10 - a - month maintenance fee it began charging nearly 400,000 credit cardholders in January .
According to a company spokeswoman , the credit card company will refund any maintenance fees collected so far and discontinue charging the fee .
“ Beginning in April , we will be crediting affected customers ’ accounts for the full amounts that were charged , ” says Stephanie Jacobson , vice president of public affairs for Chase .
Asked for a reason for the turnaround , she responded : “ Based upon customer feedback . ”
Chase is one of several major credit card issuers who have added fees , cut credit limits , raised interest rates and changed terms as they struggle to manage riskier cardholder accounts .
The changes have been met with consumer and Congressional outrage — especially since the banks tightening lending standards were recipients of billions in federal taxpayer bailout funds designed to help increase lending and jumpstart the economy .
According to Jacobson , the 400,000 accounts that were charged maintenance fees represented “ less than one half of 1 percent ” of Chase ’s card portfolio .
It included cardholders who took advantage of Chase ’s low - interest introductory card offers , but who had “ made little progress in paying down these loans , ” Jacobson wrote in a follow - up e-mailed statement .
“ Our desire is to have these loans repaid in a reasonable period of time . ”
She indicated most of the customers who have taken advantage of Chase ’s low introductory rate financing repaid the loans within 24 months .
She says one change implemented by Chase — increasing minimum monthly payment amounts on those 400,000 accounts — will remain in place .
Those cardholders must pay at least 5 percent of their total balances each month , instead of the previous 2 percent .

( CNN ) -- Police in the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca Wednesday arrested a woman for violating the country 's ban on women driving , according to the Saudi English - language daily Arab News .
The woman , whose nationality and name were not released but who was described as being in her 20s , attempted to flee when she realized police had spotted her driving , Saudi authorities said .
" The woman tried to escape when she saw a police car and in the process hit another car , which was slightly damaged , " Maj .
Abdul Mushin Al - Mayman , a police spokesman , told Arab News .
According to the spokesman , the woman was turned over to the Saudi Prosecution and Investigation Commission for investigation .
Women are barred from driving in most of Saudi Arabia , with rural areas being the exception .
It is not known how frequent such arrests are in Saudi Arabia , and arrest statistics are not released .
The issue has become one of the more controversial ones for Saudi Arabia in recent years .
While women 's rights activists in the country have been openly campaigning for the right to drive , many high ranking officials maintain it is a societal issue and will be resolved only when Saudis feel the time is right .
Last year , more than 125 women signed and sent a petition to Saudi Interior Minister Nayef bin Abdul Aziz , asking that the ban on women driving in the kingdom to be overturned .
CNN 's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report .

Jim Rogers : What He 's Saying , Where He 's Gone By Bryan Caplan
Jim Rogers , investment biker and co-founder with Soros of the Quantum Fund , says we should let AIG fail :
“ Suppose AIG goes bankrupt , it is better that AIG goes bankrupt and we
have a horrible two or three years than that the whole US goes
bankrupt , ” Rogers said .
“ AIG has trillions of dollars of obligations ,
let them fail , let the courts sort it out and start over .
Otherwise
we ’ll never start over . ” [… ]
“ You are watching something in front of our
eyes , very historically , which is basically the destruction of New York
as a financial center and the destruction of America as the world ’s
most powerful country . ”
A lot of this seems over the top even to me .
But he ’s no hypocrite .
Unlike Alec Baldwin , Rogers actually has fled the country .
He now resides in … [ drum roll please ] … Singapore !
In December 2007 , Rogers sold his mansion in New York City for about 16 million USD and moved to Singapore .
This is due mainly in his belief that this is a ground - breaking time
for investment potential in Asian markets .
Rogers ’ first daughter is
now being tutored in Mandarin to prepare her for the future , he says .
“ Moving to Asia now is like moving to New York City in 1907 , ” he said .
Also , he is quoted to say : “ If you were smart in 1807 you moved to
London , if you were smart in 1907 you moved to New York City , and if
you are smart in 2007 you move to Asia . ”
Hmm .
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
China 's first lunar probe landed on the moon in a controlled collision Sunday , marking the first phase of the nation 's three - stage moon mission , the state - run Xinhua news agency reported .
The second stage involves sending a second probe to practice soft landings , the Xinhua news agency said .
The mission will culminate with the launch and landing of a rover on the moon to collect mineral samples in 2012 .
The probe -- Chang 'e - 1 , named after a legendary moon goddess -- launched into space 16 months ago on October 24 , 2007 .
China became only the third nation , after the United States and Russia , to send a manned spacecraft into orbit .
It did so in October 2003 .
All About China
Let me get this out of the way : I am a cradle Catholic .
This means that Catholicism chose me , I did not choose it .
As a result , there have been times when I fit the description of a churchgoer to a tee , and then others when I do n’t think twice about frittering away my Sundays at home .
Churchgoer or not , I do have a strong faith in my personal Lord .
This means that I pray , not long prayers every night before going to sleep , but small prayers throughout the day to my idea of an empathetic and helpful Lord .
For instance , milliseconds before repast I ’ll sing a little ditty to myself – Thank you , Dear Lord , for this food .
Or , when I ’m down 30 - 40 on my service game during a Saturday tennis match and cannot afford a fault , I ’ll sing a similar little ditty , this time not to myself but with bated breath – C’mon , Dear Lord .
I ’m not alone in believing that prayers like this have a function .
In fact , there are an inordinate amount of people who ask for assistance through prayer on a daily basis .
Of these , Barack Obama is one of a select few who have the ability to convert a five - second prayer into a marketable commodity .
Even as a senator running for president , Obama ’s prayer - writing , in terms of consumer demand , is on par with Brian Dettmer Zorro ’s act of brandishing his sword on so - called forgotten books and slicing them into works of art .
Alright , I ’ll stop beating the bush : Barack Obama can write a regular old prayer on a regular old sheet of paper , slip it between the ancient stones of the Western Wall to join a million and one other prayers and , by virtue of his Barackness , his prayer is automatically more valuable than everyone else ’s , at least in the eyes of the Consuming Public , not God ’s , and definitely not my personal Lord ’s .
I wo n’t speak for yours .
As evidence of this demand , on July of 2008 , shortly after now - President Obama doffed the skullcap and left the holy Wailing Wall of Jerusalem , someone who had been watching snatched the folded paper from between the ancient stones and sold it to Maariv , an Israeli daily newspaper .
In this way , more than the eyes of the Lord saw what Barack had written even though he had declined to tell the media anything regarding the folded paper ’s contents , claiming it was a private conversation between him and God .
Here ’s a transcription of the widely - read prayer that is also pictured above :
Lord – Protect my family and me .
Forgive me my sins , and help me guard against pride and despair .
Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just .
And make me an instrument of your will .
With 20 - 20 hindsight , it would appear as though the Kotel served him well .
It got me wondering what would happen if I were to place a prayer in the holy wall , too .
Seeing as I will probably not travel to Jerusalem anytime soon , I thought it convenient that Aish HaTorah offers an online service that makes it possible for anyone to have their prayer printed and placed between the stones of the Western Wall for free .
Of course , they do accept donations , but preferably in increments of $ 18 because in Hebrew eighteen is the value of chai , which means “ living ” and is related to the term chaim , which means “ life ” .
For better or worse , unlike Barack ’s circulated prayer , no other eyes will see what I wrote other than those of the disinterested Aish HaTorah student charged with walking my conversation with my personal Jesus hot off the printer to in between the cracks .

Likening obesity ’s risks to those of smoking , a large European study spanning decades has found that young men who were overweight at age 18 were as likely to die by 60 as light smokers , while obese teens , like heavy smokers , were at double the risk of dying early .
While obesity is linked to a slew of health problems , the new findings fly in the face of numerous recent studies showing that people who are merely overweight may not be at higher risk of premature death than those of normal weight .
The new study , published in this week ’s British Medical Journal , tracked the death rates of 45,920 Swedish men over 38 years .
The researchers found that men who were obese when they signed up for service in the Swedish Army in 1969 and 1970 were at more than twice the risk of dying by age 60 , compared with those who were of normal weight .
That is about the same increase in risk faced by normal - weight recruits who smoked half a pack of cigarettes or more a day .
Recruits who were overweight but did not smoke were about one - third more likely to die prematurely , an increase in risk about the same as that for men of normal weight who smoked up to 10 cigarettes a day , the study found .
The American invasion of Iraq began six years ago , and a lot has happened : the nation descended into a civil war , 4,259 American soldiers were killed , over 1.3 million Iraqis are estimated to have died , and victory has been declared countless times .
But while the war has largely fallen off the front pages , it continues on with no real end in sight .
Sure , the Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) only covers a US deployment through the end of 2011 , but the Iraqi government has already made it clear they ’re operating on a much longer timeframe .
President Obama has certainly gone a long way toward supporting the notion that the war is all - but - over as well , with his talk of ending the combat operations on August 31 , 2010 .
Yet the fine - print in the Obama Administration “ pullout ” plan is that 50,000 troops will remain in Iraq indefinitely past that date , and will continue to engage in combat operations .
The reality is that the US force was 90,000 - strong at the end of the initial invasion , while the current troop level is 138,000 : still above the pre-surge levels despite claims that the surge has succeeded .
Combat deaths may well be at their lowest level since the war began , but portions of the country remain completely out of control and despite a number of new regulations alarming incidents of US troops killing innocent civilians have not vanished .
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki made it clear this week that pullouts must only happen with his approval , and then only in areas which are 100 percent secured .
Six years on , it seems unlikely any part of Iraq could fairly be called 100 percent secured , and that seems likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future .
It has suited government ministers , the CBI and the most backward parts of the British media to present the multiple walkouts by engineering construction workers at refineries and power stations across Britain during the past week as a spasm of xenophobic protest against foreign workers and migration .
For Gordon Brown , Peter Mandelson and champions of free - market globalisation , this is an indefensible rejection of free trade based on a self - defeating misunderstanding of the facts .
As Philippe Legrain wrote in the Guardian yesterday , the strikers have " got it all wrong " by allegedly blaming foreign workers for the mess we 're in .
Meanwhile , the anti-union Mail , Express and Sun have expressed their honeyed " understanding " for people they would normally castigate as wreckers and layabouts .
So ingrained has this view of the strikes become that BBC news on Monday managed to edit a striker 's comment in such a way that it appeared he was refusing to work with Italian and Portuguese workers , when he was in fact complaining that he had no chance to do so .
But in reality - as Derek Simpson - joint leader of the Unite union , said , the campaign of strikes " is not about race or immigration , it 's about class " .
This is a battle for jobs in a deepening recession and a backlash against the deregulated , race - to - the - bottom neoliberal model backed by New Labour for a decade and now so clearly falling apart .
There certainly has been a danger that the dispute could be diverted into a chauvinistic blind alley , not least because of the cue given by Brown 's cynical and fatuous use of the British National Party 's slogan " British jobs for British workers " , which was then thrown back in his face by the strikers .
But it has n't happened .
The strikers have n't scapegoated the non-union Italian , Portuguese , Spanish and Polish workers brought in by subcontractors to replace local labour , let alone called for their sacking or repatriation .
They 've targeted the employers and the government .
The more nationalistic slogans have largely been replaced - " workers of the world unite " even made an appearance at Total 's Lindsey oil refinery - and union activists have made short work of BNP infiltrators .
Far from being any kind of echo of the small minority of east London dockers who backed Enoch Powell in 1968 , the real nature of this dispute was shown by the hundreds of Polish workers who joined the sympathy stoppage at Langage power station in Plymouth on Tuesday : not a campaign for privileges for indigenous against foreign workers , but for the rights of access of all workers in Britain to jobs , and against the use of foreign - based contract labour to exclude or undercut them .
That was underlined yesterday by a joint statement in the name of engineering , construction and chemical workers ' unions across Europe identifying the British strike campaign as part of a wider expression of " anger by working people at the prevailing EU settlement which prioritises the needs of business and capital over those of labour " .
The signs were yesterday that the striking workers at the Lindsey refinery had made a significant breakthrough after shop stewards agreed to recommend a Total offer reportedly opening up half the construction work currently contracted to the Sicilian firm Irem to British employees , without loss to the Italian or Portuguese workers .
Total insists that union - negotiated pay rates were n't undercut by the Irem contract ( subcontracted through a US firm ) , though British workers suspect they may have been through charges or tax arrangements .
But the effect of such contracting chains is to give the whip hand to employers to play one national group off against another and , in this case , to deny jobs to local workers at a time of sharply rising unemployment .
The dispute in any case goes far wider than one site .
The focus is now expected to shift to the new Staythorpe power station in Nottinghamshire , where Alstom is using subcontracted Polish and Spanish labour , the refusal to employ British - based workers has been more direct , and the undercutting less open to question .
Underlying it has been the unpicking of the much - vaunted European social model - and the 1996 posted workers ' directive in particular , intended to protect EU workers from exactly the kind of social dumping through contracted labour which is at the heart of this dispute .
As usual , the government went for the weakest version , only requiring the minimum wage and basic rights for groups of workers shipped in from elsewhere in the EU .
Both the directive and wider union rights have now been undermined by a series of European court judgments which have tilted the balance further in favour of corporate freedom and against workers ' protection .
And once again last month , Britain opposed efforts to reverse the impact of the court decisions and strengthen the directive .
No doubt New Labour ministers would regard such moves as protectionism , locked as they are in a discredited free - market mindset .
But the idea that encouraging European corporations to send groups of workers back and forth around the continent to live on barges hundreds of miles from home , while others are thrown out of work , is a progressive step - or that it will generate the productivity growth to propel Europe out of recession - is evidently absurd .
Whether these unofficial strikes now fizzle out or not , they represent the first time since the economic crisis went critical that any section of the British public has moved beyond the role of passive spectators and taken matters into its own hands .
And although the walkouts are illegal under anti-union legislation , such is the strength of the workforce and public support that employers have so far stayed well away from the courts .
By promising talks with the industry about giving local labour its share , Brown yesterday finally seemed to be recognising that inaction is no longer an option .
But talks wo n't go far enough .
Britain likes to hide behind European legislation , but other governments have shown local employment and social clauses can be included in public contracts under EU rules - and the authority to impose such conditions on new power station licences already exists if ministers are prepared to use it .
The strikers have driven the corporate threat to jobs and working conditions to the top of the national and European agenda .
Unless the government moves fast , it risks inflaming the very xenophobia it has been warning against .

Class Aliases
This is a proposal for a language extension which will hopefully mitigate the issues holding back evolution of the standard prelude as well as provide useful class abstraction capabilities in general .
It 's main goals are to
remove the false tension between the granularity of a class hierarchy and its practical usability .
Allow one to modify a class hierarchy while retaining 100 % backwards compatibility with a class API .
with a specific use being able to replace the prelude 's numeric hierarchy while retaining full Haskell 98 compatibility , including the fact that libraries that only know about Haskell 98 will have their instances automatically propagated to the new class hierarchy ( and vice versa ) , so switching over can be fully incremental .
allow one to provide simple and advanced interfaces to a class hierarchy , much as one can do with functions .
it incidentally allows certain things that have been requested on the list as ' nice to have ' but not world shattering .
not interfere with separate compilation and be describable by a straightforward source -> source translation .
feel free to skip the next section if you know the issues involved in replacing the numeric hierarchy of the prelude transparently :)
The Problem
Many alternate preludes have been proposed , however to date none have gained popularity beyond the extensions to the standard libraries provided by fptools .
Since as a general rule , the Haskell community only likes to standardize changes that have been actively used and implemented already ( a very good policy ) this makes evolution of the standard problematic .
Although it is easy enough to provide new functions and datatypes , providing wrapper routines with the old interfaces to allow incremental use of a new prelude or any library .
there is no way to hide the fact that you changed a class hierarchy .
if you split a class into two , every instance has to change , even if the split is irrelevant to a given datatype .
Furthermore , depending on how you split or join classes , many type signatures will have to be rewritten .
Since Haskell projects tend to be amalgamations of many different libraries and code from previous projects , this makes using alternate preludes with anything larger than a toy project unpossible .
The problem is compounded when you consider the fact that we ideally want multiple competing preludes or certainly different versions of the same one .
Imagine a library that provides a handy new Numeric datatype .
the writer of the library only knows about the main prelude and does n't concern himself with the various experimental preludes out there so declares an instance for Num .
Bill comes along and realizes he needs an instance for the new Prelude so declares it an instance of ExperimentalNum , Phil , who also uses the library and the new experimental prelude needs to declare his own ExperimentalNum instance .
suddenly Bill 's and Phil 's libraries cannot be combined by Susan who just wants to get work done and needs both Bill 's and Phil 's libraries .
The basic issue is that you end up with a quadratic number of instances for every datatype combined with every alternative prelude and it is not clear who should be providing these instances .
every library writer should not need to know about every alternate prelude out there and vice versa .
Not only that but most of the instances will be very redundant , ExperimentalNum and Num most likely provide many of the same operations , you should only need to declare an instance for one and have it automatically propagated to the other .
The Extension
In Haskell , you may create abstract data types , where you are free to change the internal representation without affecting the visible interface , you may create function impedance matching libraries , providing alternate interfaces to the same functionality .
however , there is no way to abstract your class hierarchy .
there is no way to hide your class layout in such a way you can change it behind the scenes , once a sizable codebase is built up expecting a certain class layout , there is no incremental migration path to something better .
This extension allows the creation of class aliases , or effectively different views of the class hierarchy .
this allows library writers to change the class hierarchy under the hood without affecting the visible interface as well as providing cleaner interfaces to begin with , hiding unimportant implementation details of how the classes are laid out from regular users , while providing the more advanced interfaces to power users .
This extension may be carried out completely in the front end via a source -> source translation and does not inhibit separate compilation .
given
> class
Foo a where > foo :: a -> Bool > foo x = False > > class Bar b where > bar :: Int -> b -> [ b ]
We allow new constructs of this form :
> class alias FooBar a = ( Foo a , Bar a ) where > foo = ...
what this does is declare ' FooBar a ' as an alias for the two constraints ' Foo a ' and ' Bar a ' .
This affects two things .
FooBar a may appear anywhere a class constraint may appear otherwise , it 's meaning is simply ( Foo a , Bar a ) and the expansion may be carried out as a simple macro replacement , like type synonyms .
The other thing is that one may declare instances of FooBar .
> instance FooBar
Int where > foo x = x >
0 > bar n x = replicate n x
this expands to :
> instance Foo Int where > foo x = x > 0 > > instance Bar
Int where > bar n x = replicate n x
The meaning of declaring a type an instance of a class alias is that it declares the type an instance of each class that makes up the alias , distributing the method definitions to their respective classes , using the default methods declared in the class alias if available , otherwise using the default methods of the underlying class .
This also may be carried out as a simple translation in the front end .
let us look at a more concrete example :
the current Num class in the Prelude is ( more or less ) this
> class Num a where > (+ ) , (* ) :: a -> a -> a > (-) :: a -> a -> a > negate :: a -> a > fromInteger :: Integer -> a
ideally we would want to split it up like so ( but with more mathematically precise names ) :
> class Additive a where > (+ ) :: a -> a -> a > zero :: a > > class Additive a => AdditiveNegation where > (-) :: a -> a -> a > negate :: a -> a > x - y = x + negate y > > class Multiplicative a where > (* ) :: a -> a -> a > one :: a > > class FromInteger a where > fromInteger :: Integer -> a
now this presents some problems :
people using the new prelude have to write the ungainly ( FromInteger a , AdditiveNegation a , Multiplicative a ) and declare separate instances for all of them .
if at some point a HasZero class is separated out then everyone needs to modify their instance declarations .
Num still must be declared if you want it to work with old prelude functions , containing completely redundant information .
all the problems mentioned in the second section above about alternate preludes in general .
these can be solved with the changing of Num into a class alias .
> class alias Num a = ( Additive a , AdditiveNegation a , > Multiplicative a , FromInteger a ) where > one = fromInteger 1 > zero = fromInteger 0 > negate x = zero - x
now , all of the above problems are solved .
You may use the short ' Num a ' notation for numbers , if a HasZero class is split out then it does n't matter because declaring something a ( Num a ) will propagate your methods to it properly .
declaration of an instance for Num will automatically create instances for all the other classes , declaring separate instances for each of the other classes will give you the equivalent of an instance for Num .
people writing libraries need not concern themselves with the alternate prelude or the Haskell 98 one , they can pretend the other does n't exist and their instance declarations will automatically create appropriate instances in the alternate prelude .
Another Example
This example is unrelated to creating an alternate prelude but shows how this extension is a useful abstraction tool in general .
imagine we want to create a great lattice class library .
I mean , a super really flexible one .
> class Lattice a where > meet :: a -> a -> a > join :: a -> a -> a
of course , you want to be able to express lattices with a distinguished top and bottom .
> class Lattice a => BoundedLattice a where > top :: a > bottom :: a > meets :: [ a ] -> a > joins :: [ a ] -> a > meets xs = foldl meet top xs > joins xs = foldl join bottom xs
hmm .. but then you realize you might want semi lattices .. so you change it too
> class SemiLatticeMeet a where > meet :: a -> a -> a > > class SemiLatticeJoin a where > join :: a -> a -> a > > > class ( SemiLatticeMeet a , SemiLatticeJoin a ) =>
BoundedLattice a where > top :: a > bottom :: a > meets :: [ a ] -> a > joins :: [ a ] -> a > meets xs = foldl meet top xs > joins xs = foldl join bottom xs
but then you realize you might want bounded semilattices so you come up with the following .
your final super flexible lattice class .
> class BoundedAbove a where > top :: a > > class BoundedBelow a where > bottom :: a > > class SemiLatticeMeet a where > meet :: a -> a -> a > > class SemiLatticeJoin a where > join :: a -> a -> a > > > meets :: ( BoundedAbove a , SemiLatticeMeet a ) = > [ a ] -> a > meets xs = foldl meet top xs > > joins :: ( BoundedBelow a , SemiLatticeJoin a ) = > [ a ] -> a > joins xs = foldl join bottom xs
notice two things beyond the points mentioned above :
1 . You have pissed off all your users ... they just wanted to declare a simple bounded lattice and now they have to type a whole lot of crud to do so .
refer to the docs several times to see how you named things and know some non-trivial things about lattices .
2. creating a simple bounded lattice instance for Bool requires writing 4 instances , none of which actually say ' BoundedLattice ' !
not very intuitive or flexible .
3. you can no longer make meets and joins members of a type class , meaning you cannot create optimized versions of them for certain types which most definitely exist and are important for many applications of lattices .
you have traded flexibility in one direction for flexibility in another .
of course , you could do something like
> class ( BoundedBelow a , SemiLatticeJoin a ) => BoundedBelowJoinable a where > joins :: [ a ] -> a
but things are already getting absurd .
no user is going to type BoundedBelowJoinable constantly when they just want a lattice .
there is a fundamental weakness in Haskell here in that it creates a false tension between these two types of flexibility , this is compounded by the inability to change type classes without changing your interface so it is hard to tweak things if it turns out you chose something non-ideally .
now , lets look at the above with class aliases .
> class SemiLatticeMeet a where > meet :: a -> a -> a > > class SemiLatticeJoin a where > join :: a -> a -> a > > class alias Lattice a = ( SemiLatticeMeet a , SemiLatticeJoin a ) > > class BoundedAbove a where > top :: a > > class BoundedBelow a where > bottom :: a > > class alias Bounded a = ( BoundedAbove a , BoundedBelow a ) > > > class BoundedBelowJoinable a = ( BoundedBelow a , SemiLatticeJoin a ) where > joins :: [ a ] -> a > joins xs = foldl join bottom xs > > class BoundedAboveMeetable a = ( BoundedAbove a , SemiLatticeMeet a ) where > meets :: [ a ] -> a > meets xs = foldl meet top xs > > class alias BoundedLattice a = ( BoundedBelow a , BoundedAbove a , SemiLatticeMeet a , > SemiLatticeJoin a , BoundedBelowJoinable a , BoundedAboveMeetable b)
this looks complicated but you really wanted to write a super - ultra fancy lattice class .
But from a library users point of view it is great :
The library user simply need to declare
> instance BoundedLattice
Bool where > top = True > bottom = False > meet = ( && ) > join = ( | | )
and _all_ of the above classes are filled in properly .
someone else can write
> instance Lattice Integer where > join = max > meet = min
while a power user is free to declare his SemiLattices or BoundedAboveMeetables or whatever .
this is a great benefit IMHO .
There has always been a false tension between the granularity of your class hierarchy and its practical usability .
this extension gets rid of that tension .
Interaction With Superclasses and More Details
lets look at a slightly different formulation for the class alias for Num .
> class alias Num a = Eq a =>
( Additive a , Multiplicative a )
notice that the alias now has an Eq superclass .
What this means is that although having an instance for Num means a type must have an instance for Eq , writing an instance definition for Num will not create an instance for Eq , it must be specified separately since it is a superclass and acts just like Haskell superclasses .
what the above alias means is :
If I have f :: Num a => ... then I can use any of the class ops of Eq , Additive , Multiplicative in the body of f .
Dually , a call of f can be satisfied if ( Eq , Additive , Multiplicative ) are all available ( or Num of course ) .
One can declare an instance of Num either by giving separate instances for Eq , Additive , Multiplicative ; or by giving a separate instance for Eq , and an instance for Num itself .
The two ways of creating an instance for Num are identical , declaring an instance of an alias is equivalent to declaring separate instances for its constituents .
If a type T is an instance of Additive , then it's an error to also give a Num instance , even if the instance only gives the methods for Multiplicative .
This is because declaring an instance of a class alias is equivalent to declaring instances of each of it constituents and normal Haskell overlapping instance rules apply .
The instances created are independent of which methods you actually override , since normal defaulting occurs for unsupplied methods .
In the class declaration for Num one can override the default methods for Additive and Multiplicative .
These new default methods will be used ( only ) when an instance is declared for Num .
The default methods may refer to any methods of constituents of the alias , including mutual recursion across classes .
You may also use the methods of the superclasses of the alias or any of its constituents , but not override their defaults .
There is no reason you could n't have a superclass of one of the constituents as another constituent , and in fact this is quite useful .
for example
> class alias EqOrd a = ( Eq a , Ord a ) where > a == b = compare a b == EQ
even though Eq is a superclass of Ord , making it a constituent of the class means that declaring an instance of EqOrd will declare both an Eq and an Ord instance .
instances only get declared for the constituents of the alias and not their superclasses .
note that this alias lets you provide full Eq and Ord instances by only declaring a single ' compare ' function .
Notes
How these interact with other type class extensions would have to be figured out .
it should n't present an issue and I think even if class aliases needed to be restricted to single parameter type classes ( unlikely ) then they would still be useful .
deciding what to display in error messages is an issue .
but no more complicated than deciding whether to show a type synonym or an underlying type .
a heuristic like show the most general constraint that can be expressed with the names in scope should suffice .
although it is basically a source -> source translation , in practice it could not be carried out by a preprocessor because all the names needed would not be in scope and we would want to propagate the class alias information in the ' hi ' files ( or equivalent ) of the compiler .
I had an earlier supertyping proposal you might know about , I feel this is a much better proposal even though it does n't fully subsume my supertyping proposal , I feel it solves the problems it was meant to solve in a cleaner and easier to implement way .
You may wonder why for the Num example I put Additive a in the class alias even though it was already a superclass of AdditiveNegation .
that is because class aliases do not change the meaning of superclasses , you need to explicitly list a class if you want instance declarations to propagate methods to it .
superclasses are checked just like normal in class aliases .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - With “ no end in sight ” for U.S. job losses amid a recession that could stretch into 2010 , American workers will soon have to contend with another blow to their confidence : stagnant , or even falling wages .
Job seekers -- already coping with the highest unemployment rate in a quarter century , their savings mugged by a plunging stock market -- can also expect lower pay once they land a new job , labor market experts say , because the current downturn shows no signs of turning around anytime soon .
“ There ’s no end in sight , ” said Tig Gilliam , chief executive of Adecco Group North America , the third - largest U.S. employer behind Wal - Mart Stores and the postal service .
“ March is going to be the same , and I do n’t see anything that will make April better . ”
Lower wages , in turn , could further erode the outlook for the U.S. economy by hurting consumers ’ spending power .
The government ’s February employment report showed 651,000 jobs eliminated outside the farm sector , while losses in the previous two months were revised upward .
The unemployment rate jumped to 8.1 percent , highest since 1983 .
Job losses in professional services categories are accelerating , and temporary payrolls -- typically a leading indicator -- show no signs of improving , Gilliam said .
The temp sector , where losses preceded the decline in the wider labor market by a year , must stabilize before any hint of a wider jobs recovery .
Temporary workers as a percentage of the total workforce are down to 1.42 percent , a level not seen since May 1994 .
The bottoming of this metric typically correlates with the end of recession , said BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeffrey Silber in a research note .
“ Unfortunately , we ’re not there yet , ” Silber said .
TEMP PAYROLLS DOWN
Temp payrolls are down by a quarter from a year ago , and have declined for 26 months in a row .
In the recession of the 1980s -- the one many economists say most compares to the current situation -- temp employment fell by a third from peak to trough .
To be sure , job openings still exist .
Adecco cited engineering and technical job postings , as well as legal and finance positions , including in the mortgage business where a pickup in refinancing activity has spurred demand for sales and processing professionals .
But while job openings remain , employers are increasingly able to keep a lid on wages , further stretching consumers .
The latest jobs report showed wage growth slowed in January and February from its pace at the end of last year .
According to Adecco , many clients are looking to hire people at lower rates than in the past , with the biggest wage pressure at the lower end of the pay scale , he said , among people earning around $ 10 or $ 12 per hour .
Small business salaries posted their biggest drop last month since December 2004 , according to SurePayroll , which handles payroll for 25,000 small businesses .
“ Declining salaries make it easier for businesses to survive in the short term , but decreased consumer purchasing power is a recipe for disaster over the long term , ” said SurePayroll President Michael Alter .
U.S. small business paychecks average $ 31,317 , down about $ 1,300 over the past year .
LONG RECESSION
“ We ’re going to see continued contraction , at least to the end of the year , and possibly the first quarter of next year , ” said J.P. Donlon , editor of Chief Executive magazine , whose monthly survey finds CEO confidence at a record low .
Seventy - seven percent of CEOs expect jobs to continue to deteriorate over the next quarter .
“ They just do n’t see any horizon at this stage , ” Donlon said , adding that the monthly survey , which dates back to 2002 , typically precedes GDP and employment trends by about six months .
The unemployment rate could easily reach double digits , and if it tops 9 percent , will suggest the Obama Administration stimulus package is not working , Adecco ’s Gilliam said .
He cited a recent conversation with government procurement lawyers who expressed concern it could take nine months to dole out money to help the economy .
“ You see the market voting on the reaction to the Obama policies already , ” he said .
“ You ’re not getting great confidence . ”
Confidence in the stimulus among workers , by contrast , remains high , with nearly three - quarters telling an Adecco / Harris interactive survey they are optimistic the plan will boost jobs .
The outlook for job pay , however , is grim .
“ Wages are going to take a hit , ” said Chad Sowash , vice president of the Direct Employers Association , a nonprofit that represents the interests of senior recruiters .
Sowash met Friday with Fortune 500 employers in the healthcare , IT and defense sectors , who told him anyone looking for a job now should expect to earn 10 percent to 20 percent less , depending on the position and the industry .
“ The days of springboarding a career into another $ 10,000 a year , this is just not the situation for that , ” Sowash said .

Electricity flexes strong , bendy aerogel .
The nanotube aerogel can expand and contract up to 1,000 times a second .
Science Technology Education Media
As light as air , yet stronger than steel and bendier than rubber .
A new material made from bundles of carbon nanotubes combines all of these characteristics in a substance that twitches like a bionic man 's biceps when a voltage is applied .
The ' artificial muscle ' is an aerogel — a lightweight , sponge - like material consisting mostly of air — drawn into a long ribbon .
Applying a voltage across the width of the ribbon electrically charges the nanotubes that thread through the material .
This makes them repel one another , and the ribbon can expand sideways by up to three times its original width in an instant .
" These muscles are remarkably fast , " says Ray Baughman at the University of Dallas , Texas , who led the research .
The artificial muscle can expand about 4,000 times faster than human muscle does , says Baugman , and can be switched on and off up to 1,000 times a second with no deterioration ( see video ) .
Applying a voltage along the length of the ribbon has a very different effect .
It triggers the nanotube structure to contract , making the material more dense and very stiff ( see animation ) .
This means that the ' muscles ' could pack a mighty punch — along the length of the ribbon , the nanotube aerogel is , weight for weight , stronger than steel .
The work is published today in Science1 .
" What really impresses me is that the ribbons show an incredibly large difference in stiffness depending on which direction is probed , " says John Madden , a materials scientist from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada .
" They are perhaps a million times stiffer in one direction than in the other two .
Imagine feeling a material that is like diamond in one direction and rubber in the other two . "
Hot stuff
Baughman is excited about another property of these muscles : their ability to withstand extreme temperatures .
They keep their properties down to 80 K ( - 193ºC ) and up to 1900 K ( 1627 ºC ) , and Baughman sees no reason why these temperatures need be the limits — the reported temperature range was restricted only by their ability to make measurements in those conditions , he says .
This means that the muscles could easily be used in harsh environments such as the cold of space , or the heat of a combustion chamber , says Madden .
" There are no artificial muscles that I know of that can operate over the wide range of temperatures that these nanotube devices can , " he adds .
The stretched out muscles can be frozen in position by placing them on to a substrate .
This may allow them to be used as a transparent electrode that could sit atop a solar cell , with the nanoscale pores in the material helping to trap or channel the electrons generated , says Baughman .
And a tiny amount of the material would go a long way .
" One ounce of this material would cover an acre , " he says .
As shoe models are becoming increasingly otherworldly in colors and design one may wonder if our leading fashion designers are in competition for the weirdest pair of shoes .
Over recent years , we ’ve seen drastic changes to the design of heels and wedge shoes .
First , we were offered to try incredibly high stilettos and less - than - comfortable wedges .
But designers did n’t stop here and now they are offering us the kind of shoes that you need some time to recognize where their heel is and what part of them will make it possible not to be thrown off balance .
Modern shoes are more of a fictitious nature and supernatural designs .
Thigh high boots came to replace jackboots , heels are shaped into very weird forms ( and sometimes there is no heel or wedge at all as with heel - less boots ) and the diversity of colors can blear the eyes .
Designers are not afraid of going over the top , marrying the weirdest forms with the boldest colors .
Get a load of a pair of shoes presented at Moschino Cheap and Chic Fall - 2009 show .
These are two - colored or brightly one - colored shoes set on what seems to be unfinished wedge , both at the heel and the toe .
At their new shows Dolce &Gabbana and Roberto Cavalli came up with a bunch of fresh definitions of what a heel should look like .
The former actually extended a heel into a sole and the latter presented thigh high wedge boots .
Nobody got where those boots ended on female legs , though .
The latest Olivier Theyskens ’ shoe collection for Nina Ricci was filled with shoes strongly recalling a hoof –shoes with a high wedge at the front and without any support at the back .
Such a design ca n’t help but draw attention .
Yet Theyskens went further and added dazzling colors to his “ hoofs ” , from shimmering purple to navy .
And even if the heel is right where it should be , its design is still staggeringly mind - blowing .
It seems that traditional “ bare ” heel is way in the past .
Do you remember the Chanel gun heel shoes that Madonna wore recently ?
It ’s not been long since we saw them but the shoes do n’t look strange to us anymore .
This season , the House of Dior unveiled stucco heels and a popular duo Proenza Schouler came up with spring - shaped heel .
And these fashion designers are not alone in their efforts to offer incomprehensible designs .
Sergio Rossi presented “ spiral - stiletto ” , Marchese fashion house offered crystal - encrusted heel and Giuseppe Zanotti created wedge shoes which simply ca n’t be put into words .

Unless you ’ve been living under a rock for the past 50 years , or you ’re 12 years old , you must have ...
The Service Employees ’ internal battle broke wide open late Tuesday when International President Andy Stern put the dissident United Healthcare Workers - West into emergency trusteeship .
Financial assets for the 150,000 - member local were immediately seized , the executive board was dissolved , and full - time officers were removed from payroll .
Reports circulated among workplace leaders that SEIU also dismissed UHW stewards , and that employers are holding captive - audience meetings to introduce new SEIU - appointed staff representatives .
Stern named Executive Vice Presidents Eliseo Medina and Dave Regan as trustees of UHW .
Regan said rank - and - file worksite leaders remain in place .
As word of the trusteeship spread , hundreds of members and supporters rallied at the union ’s Oakland headquarters , vowing to resist SEIU ’s hostile takeover .
UHW leaders announced the formation of an independent union , the National Union of Healthcare Workers , and signaled their intention to decertify SEIU in hospitals and nursing homes , declaring that they would not permit appointed staffers to decide which union members belonged to .
ULTIMATUM REJECTED
The trusteeship came a day after UHW rejected an ultimatum from SEIU ’s top body to split their local in two .
Following meetings with more than 5,000 stewards and other rank - and - file leaders , UHW ’s elected officers refused the order , reiterating earlier proposals that would guarantee members a right to vote before a merger would take place .
SEIU ’s ultimatum mandated that UHW move 65,000 nursing home and homecare workers into a new statewide local for long - term care workers .
Such a local would be led by Stern appointees , and UHW argues it would produce weaker contract standards , citing their experience with the International ’s partnership in the California nursing home industry .
“ Merging long - term members into another local will lower the bar , making us take a step back , ” said Ruby Guzman , a nursing assistant at Creekside Nursing Home in San Pablo .
“ This will affect me , my family , and my patients .
I can not allow this . ”
Before Tuesday 's trusteeship UHW proposed a series of steps to mediate the conflict between their local and the International .
TRUSTEESHIP REPORT
The trusteeship followed recommendations from Ray Marshall , the former secretary of labor hired by SEIU to investigate alleged financial improprieties at UHW .
Marshall concluded that UHW set up a not - for - profit organization in 2007 to finance looming battles with the International , but did not find these violations sufficient to warrant trusteeship .
In a surprise move , Marshall still recommended trusteeship for UHW — if they failed to comply with the earlier decision by SEIU ’s top body to split off the UHW long - term care workers .
UHW leaders said it is unprecedented to have a trusteeship request denied , and argued that Marshall linked two unrelated disputes by tying his recommendations to the fate of UHW ’s long - term care members .
SUPPORT LABOR NOTES BECOME A MONTHLY DONOR Give $ 10 a month or more and get our " Fight the Boss , Build the Union " T - shirt .
“ We suspect that the hearing report from Secretary Marshall got amended by SEIU lawyers to get their desired outcome , ” UHW 's former head Sal Rosselli said .
“ Frankly we do n’t have a lot of respect for it being some independent report or process . ”
Medina , a trustee , said the financial improprieties by UHW leaders were sufficient grounds alone for trusteeship .
UHW 's refusal to comply with the forced transfer of long - term care workers provided additional justification for the International 's actions .
WHAT ’S NEXT ?
UHW members see few other options than leaving SEIU .
" Our health care workers want to be a part of a democratic , progressive movement , " said Angela Glasper , an optical receptionist at Kaiser Permanente in Martinez , California .
" Every thing that has happened in these last several days has proven that it 's not possible for that to happen in SEIU .
All workers deserve to be part of a union that workers control , not leaders in Washington , D.C. "
Under the SEIU constitution , the bar for disaffiliation is high .
If seven or more members wish to remain in SEIU , disaffiliation is not possible .
Members and ousted leaders of UHW announced plans Wednesday afternoon to form a new union .
Chartering an independent local would require members to file for an election during the “ open period ” prior to contract expiration .
It would require separate votes wherever UHW currently has an employer under contract , representing hundreds of worksites across the state .
With more than 100 contracts re-negotiated in 2008 such a process would take years to complete .
Even before the Marshall report was released SEIU began preparing for a hostile takeover of UHW , renting large offices in both Oakland and Los Angeles and dispatching dozens of staff to California .
Although many staffers were initially told that UHW - related assignments would be voluntary , the International informed organizers that failure to travel to California will be “ considered a resignation . ”
UNDERMINING LABOR ’S AGENDA
Labor 's allies worry that the war between UHW and the International could derail labor ’s efforts to secure health care reform and pass the Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) early in 2009 .
Hearing officer Ray Marshall concluded his report by noting that “ the main beneficiaries of this conflict are anti-union employers and politicians who have geared up to use this conflict against our efforts to pass legislation to help workers , especially the Employee Free Choice Act . ”
Nelson Lichtenstein , a labor scholar at the University of California Santa Barbara , shares similar concerns .
“ This internal fight will come back to haunt labor when EFCA gets rolling , ” Lichtenstein noted .
“ The right wing is paying close attention , and this gives them plenty of fresh meat . ”
Well , I 'm 47 years old , and I think that , at 4 cm , my willy might be somewhat below average length .
Are there any stretches or exercises that I might do , in order to increase the length of my willy ?
I do n't need to be a porn star , I just want to hit at a respectable 10 cm .
Maybe there are some appliances I could use to aid in the lengthening of my willy ?
I heard that some people were capable of using duct tape , the hose of a vaccuum and a mouse trap in order to achieve these results .
So my question is , how do I go about making my willy bigger ?
Kurt Schelfthout has just released FsCheck 0.4 , a tool similar to QuickCheck but for F# .
While working at my internship for Credit Suisse I spent a little bit of time modifying FsCheck to include automatic generators ( so you do n't have to describe how to generate arbitrary values ) and failure shrinking ( so the counter - examples are smaller ) .
Both these changes have now been incorporated in to the main FsCheck tool .
It is really nice to see the work being contributed back , and that big companies are taking the time to get the necessary legal clearance etc .
I find shrinking to be a particularly potent feature .
In one real - world task I struggled to debug a test failure for 8 hours , before shrinking was available .
Attacking the same example with FsCheck and shrinking made the reason for the test failure immediately obvious .
Perl patching experiences part 2
Success with patching Email :: Stuff !
I saw that it was a part of the Perl Email Project .
I got in touch with them about the Email :: Stuff bug on their mailing list then followed up on IRC ( irc.perl.org #email ) .
Ricardo SIGNES was good enough to help me investigate if this was an issue with Email : : Stuff or one of the underlying Email : : modules .
He confirmed this was a stuff issue , and also pointed out a couple of other bugs I offered to supply patches to fix all these bugs .
RJBS pulled Email :: Stuff into github and gave me a fork to work on ( which for me also meant getting a github account and learning the basics of git ) .
A few hours later I had a fully working fork fixing the header loss issue , unused clone issue , and also multipart / alternative issue .
I went further to write unit tests to check that these were working properly and ensure they continued to do so in the future .
I also updated the docs a little , although I should probably have documented the new conforming functionality a bit more .
With the minor patch I submitted to Params :: Util getting applied but giving me no mention in the changelog .
This time I was very chuffed to see my name appear in the credits :) Patched Email :: Stuff 2.07 now on cpan ;) Clone issue fixed , RT BUG fixed and other problems Ricardo found all fixed .
Lyle
It ’s Thanksgiving weekend .
Saturday now and so the body feels clearly over the slight ( heh heh ) “ lapses ” in diet control that occurred with the family on Thursday afternoon .
Though I did n’t do too badly , actually .
One of the shifts that ’s been occurring is that of course the whole family seems more interested in eating closer to a plant - based , lower fat diet .
While we had the usual turkey ( of course , a nice Vermont free - range non-injected non-pen raised bird who no doubt died self - actualized and content ) , even the in - laws basically do n’t eat meat , fat or much by way of carbs as a rule .
So it ’s not like I have to go it alone and haul a bag of my own sad little salad off to feasts .
There were a lot of healthy veggie dishes at the dinner .
Though I did have a bit of the traditional fare , I could n’t really eat as much as I would have a year ago .
And that was fine with me .
I thought it was actually a good thing that by the end of the “ pre-meal snacks ” of olives , deviled eggs , nice cheeses and so on , I felt stuffed .
I ’m happy to have finally hit the 20 pound weight loss mark , which I did on Thanksgiving and the scale shows me is still where I am two days afterward .
My goal is to get down to 200 by the end of the year — thirteen more pounds to go .
Psychological impact of the weight changes
This brings lots of nice changes .
It ’s not just being off insulin ( which happened fast , and I ’ll discuss later . )
It ’s not just the physical measurements .
There is a set of psychological changes that have been occurring , and one of these in particular that I want to talk about in this post .
For instance , the sense of my body , how it moves through space , seems to be different .
It seems to me that my body moves more easily .
Likely true — stick 20 or 30 pounds into a backpack on your shoulder , and see how different it feels just to get out of a chair and walk across the room — that ’s the literal difference between myself a couple of months , and two years , ago , and now .
I seem to walk faster , and there is a sense of a lighter , smaller upper body which is of course true .
It takes a large weight loss in a short amount of time to notice this difference .
I have noted more energy which seems to be a function of both exercise and blood sugar control , though the latter is still very much a work in progress .
My face is different in the mirror .
Clothing is looser , which has a definite impact on my sense of self .
I find things in the bottom of my dresser that I bought when I was a bit lighter , some things like rain jackets I ’ve owned for ten or twenty years , and I ’m realizing that I ’d stopped wearing them because they ’d gotten too tight .
So while I ’m holding off on buying new clothes , I ’m actually finding some “ preserves ” tucked away that may tide me over , and that I can enjoy for the first time in years .
I also feel like people are reacting a bit differently to me .
Maybe it ’s my imagination , but I think I ’m getting flirted with a bit .
Which may seem to be kind of juvenile for a 60 year old guy to even think about .
Except that having been heavy since childhood , I know for a fact that this was a big developmental deal .
Decades of being the “ invisible fat person ” ( or even , I think , the repulsive fat person ) leave marks in the psyche .
And because I ’ve had a couple of brief periods of temporary thinness , where I had those reactions in the past , I know very well that I was not imagining it .
During my brief weight loss in my early twenties in grad school , women who were previously “ way out of my league ” started hitting on me .
Okay , not like thousands of them , but enough that I could definitely tell that despite all the well - meaning “ it ’s not your looks , it ’s your personality that matters ” talk fat people all hear , bottom line is , it ’s your looks .
Thanksgiving thoughts of childhood
On Thanksgiving , middle - aged people think back to childhood .
I thought with some longing about people who were my whole world back then , who are now long gone .
Grandparents , parents , uncles and aunts .
Even my once “ baby ” brother , who died relatively young a few years ago , a casualty of decades of extremely heavy drinking , heavy smoking , obesity and finally , of a horrible , fast - killing cancer .
During my childhood , one of the “ facts about the world ” I learned was that 60 was old .
I mean , really old .
As a child growing up in the 1960s , though adults never talked about it , I gradually concluded that when adults hit the age –60 milestone — if they made it that far at all — they did n’t have long to live .
Whether it was relatives ( my grandfather died in his early sixties when I was about eight ) , or famous people I ’d seen on TV who I heard had suddenly died , the message was clear .
We all have about sixty years to live .
That is why , for instance , when the Social Security Administration was founded and set a retirement age at which people could get government benefits , they set the retirement age in the early sixties .
Because frankly , by that age , more people were already dead than alive .
Of course , nowadays , dying at 70 is considered premature by many people in this country .
One of the reasons we are more used to hearing of people passing at 85 or 90 nowadays is that people have in the main stopped smoking .
Cigarettes were the primary reason , it turns out , that adults were dropping so young .
The lethal threat of diabetes
But weight , particularly weight that causes diabetes and similar problems , is still the big threat .
In fact , diabetes is likely to replace smoking as the thing that will kill you in your middle - aged years .
And even little kids are getting it .
I did not know any children who were diabetic when I was small .
And aside from just me and a very few peers , I did n’t know kids who were overweight , either .
I ’ve certainly known that the heavy , razor sharp sword of a searingly painful premature death by diabetes has been dangling by a thin thread over my head for years now .
A few years and thirty pounds ago , my usually very pleasant and optimistic doctor — the kind of guy who I ’m convinced would tell you that you have “ just a little bit of Black Plague — nothing to be too concerned about ” — made an uncharacteristicly blunt comment to me : “ Guys like you do n’t live to be very old . ”
He was referring to the obesity and diabetes , of course .
And it ’s true .
On Thanksgiving , I thought about that .
About how the difference between my very likely developing — in the next couple of years — a host of crippling and terminal medical problems , and living perhaps thirty or even forty more years , is this weight loss project .
Because that is the very real difference in probable futures for me .
I can be statistically pretty sure of developing some horrible conditions relatively soon …or I can look forward to probably decades of … well , something better than I ’ve perhaps known before .
Like getting hit on by ladies in nursing homes , maybe .
So these changes , and hopefully , the gift of decades of life to come , are truly something nice to give thanks for on Thanksgiving .
Over 400 years ago today , Guy Fawkes and his co-conspirators placed 20 barrels of gunpowder beneath the British House of Lords .
Today , the Houses of Parliament are getting a much more peaceful , but perhaps equally incendiary , delivery .
Chafing beneath Britain ’s widespread surveillance and increasingly restrictive laws , the Libertarian Party UK is sending each Member of Parliament a warning shot on the direction of their nation : a copy of George Orwell ’s anti-totalitarian novel Nineteen Eighty - Four .
Yesterday , the Libertarian Party announced the launch of its “ 1984 Campaign , ” and by today , each Member of Parliament will have received a copy of Nineteen Eighty - Four from volunteer members of the grassroots campaign .
The books will be inscribed with the admonition : “ This book was a warning , not a blueprint . ”
But some MPs have been angered by the comparison between modern day Britain and Orwell ’s dystopian nightmare .
Tom Harris , MP for Glasgow , received his copy of the book a few days ago .
In his blog , Harris railed against the intended message in his blog :
[ T ] here seem to be an awful lot of people out there - perhaps dozens of them - who seem to get strangely exercised at the prospect of a “ police state ” .
Except that what they define as a “ police state ” is a million light years from what Orwell himself described .
CCTV cameras in the street ?
That ’s just like Nineteen Eighty - Four , when families were monitored in their own homes , 24 hours a day !
Ca n’t use racist terms to vilify people any more ?
Well , surely that ’s thought crime , just like Orwell predicted !
What rubbish .
As I ’ve written here before , this is all paranoid fantasy , and why so many people get off on it , I ’ll never know .
I recently had the latest in a series of requests from constituents regarding CCTV .
Requests to have the cameras removed ?
No , no , no … Requests for more cameras …
We live in a democracy , and just because those — including my anonymous benefactor — who get excited about such things are unhappy that Labour is in power , that does not make us anything other than a democracy .
And democratically - elected governments govern with the consent of the people .
Yes , even this one !

The UK government may be democratically elected , but with four million CCTV cameras , Britain is the most - surveyed nation in the world .
And censorship of online material , and legislation like the 2006 Terrorism Act , have put increasingly severe restrictions on speech .
It might be worthwhile for British legislatures to take this opportunity to pause and reflect on what kind of country they 're creating .
Press Release Libertarian UK [ via The Labour Party via Reddit ]
Two years ago , we wrote an article discussing the historical pattern of the boom and bust in counterterrorism spending .
In that article we discussed the phenomenon whereby a successful terrorist attack creates a profound shock that is quite often followed by an extended lull .
We noted how this dynamic tends to create a pendulum effect in public perception and how public opinion is ultimately translated into public policy that produces security and counterterrorism funding .
In other words , the shock of a successful terrorist attack creates a crisis environment in which the public demands action from the government and Washington responds by earmarking vast amounts of funds to address the problem .
Then the lull sets in , and some of the programs created during the crisis are scrapped entirely or are killed by a series of budget cuts as the public 's perception of the threat changes and its demands for government action focus elsewhere .
The lull eventually is shattered by another attack — and another infusion of money goes to address the now - neglected problem .
On March 13 , The Washington Post carried a story entitled " Hardened U.S. Embassies Symbolic of Old Fears , Critics Say . "
The story discussed the new generation of U.S. Embassy buildings , which are often referred to as " Inman buildings " by State Department insiders .
This name refers to buildings constructed in accordance with the physical security standards set by the Secretary of State 's Advisory Panel on Overseas Security , a panel chaired by former Deputy CIA Director Adm.
Bobby Inman following the 1983 attacks against the U.S. embassies in Beirut and Kuwait City .
The 1985 Inman report , which established these security requirements and contributed to one of the historical security spending booms , was also responsible for beefing up the State Department 's Office of Security and transforming it into the Diplomatic Security Service ( DSS ) .
It has been 11 years since a U.S. Embassy has been reduced to a smoking hole in the ground , and the public 's perception of the threat appears to be changing once again .
In The Washington Post article , Stephen Schlesinger , an adjunct fellow at the Century Foundation , faults the new Inman building that serves as the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York for being unattractive and uninviting .
Schlesinger is quoted as saying : " Rather than being an approachable , beckoning embassy — emphasizing America 's desire to open up to the rest of the globe and convey our historically optimistic and progressive values — it sits across from the U.N. headquarters like a dark , forbidding fortress , saying , ' Go away . ' "
When opinion leaders begin to express such sentiments in The Washington Post , it is an indication that we are now in the lull period of the counterterrorism cycle .
Tensions Over Security
There has always been a tension between security and diplomacy in the U.S. State Department .
There are some diplomats who consider security to be antithetical to diplomacy and , like Mr. Schlesinger , believe that U.S. diplomatic facilities need to be open and accessible rather than secure .
These foreign service officers ( FSOs ) also believe that regional security officers are too risk averse and that they place too many restrictions on diplomats to allow them to practice effective diplomacy .
( Regional security officer — RSO — is the title given to a DSS special agent in charge of security at an embassy . )
To quote one FSO , DSS special agents are " cop - like morons . "
People who carry guns instead of demarches and who go out and arrest people for passport and visa fraud are simply not considered " diplomatic . "
There is also the thorny issue that in their counterintelligence role , DSS agents are often forced to confront FSOs over personal behavior ( such as sexual proclivities or even crimes ) that could be considered grounds for blackmail by a hostile intelligence service .
On the other side of the coin , DSS agents feel the animosity emanating from those in the foreign service establishment who are hostile to security and who oppose the DSS efforts to improve security at diplomatic missions overseas .
DSS agents refer to these FSOs as " black dragons " — a phrase commonly uttered in conjunction with a curse .
DSS agents see themselves as the ones left holding the bag when an FSO disregards security guidelines , does something reckless , and is robbed , raped or murdered .
It is most often the RSO and his staff who are responsible for going out and picking up the pieces when something turns bad .
It is also the RSO who is called before a U.S. government accountability review board when an embassy is attacked and destroyed .
In the eyes of a DSS special agent , then , a strong , well - protected building conveys a far better representation of American values and strength than does a smoldering hole in the ground , where an " accessible " embassy once stood .
In the mind of a DSS agent , dead diplomats can conduct no diplomacy .
This internal tension has also played a role in the funding boom and bust for diplomatic security overseas .
Indeed , DSS agents are convinced that the black dragons consistently attempt to cut security budgets during the lull periods .
When career foreign service officers like Sheldon Krys and Anthony Quainton were appointed to serve as assistant secretaries for diplomatic security — and presided over large cuts in budgets and manpower — many DSS agents were convinced that Krys and Quainton had been placed in that position specifically to sabotage the agency .
DSS agents were suspicious of Quainton , in particular , because of his history .
In February 1992 , while Quainton was serving as the U.S. ambassador to Peru , the ambassador 's residence in Lima was attacked by Shining Path guerrillas who detonated a large vehicular - borne improvised explosive device in the street next to it .
A team sent by the DSS counterterrorism investigations division to investigate the attack concluded in its report that Quainton 's refusal to follow the RSO 's recommendation to alter his schedule was partially responsible for the attack .
The report angered Quainton , who became the assistant secretary for diplomatic security seven months later .
Shortly after assuming his post , Quainton proclaimed to his staff that " terrorism is dead " and ordered the abolishment of the DSS counterterrorism investigations division .
Using a little bureaucratic sleight of hand , then - DSS Director Clark Dittmer renamed the office the Protective Intelligence Investigations Division ( PII ) and allowed it to maintain its staff and function .
Although Quainton had declared terrorism dead , special agents assigned to the PII office would be involved in the investigation of the first known al Qaeda attacks against U.S. interests in Aden and Sanaa , Yemen , in December 1992 .
They also played a significant role in the investigation of the World Trade Center bombing in February 1993 , the investigation of the 1993 New York Landmarks Plot and many subsequent terrorism cases .
Boom - and - Bust Funding
One of the problems created by the feast - or - famine cycle of security funding is that during the boom times , when there is a sudden ( and often huge ) influx of cash , agencies sometimes have difficulty spending all the money allotted to them in a logical and productive manner .
Congress , acting on strong public opinion , often will give an agency even more than it initially requested for a particular program — and then expect an immediate solution to the problem .
Rather than risk losing these funds , the agencies scramble to find ways to spend them .
Then , quite often , by the time the agency is able to get its act together and develop a system effectively to use the funds , the lull has set in and funding is cut .
These cuts frequently are accompanied by criticism of how the agency spent the initial glut of funding .
Whether or not it was a conscious effort on the part of people like Quainton , funding for diplomatic security programs was greatly reduced during the lull period of the 1990s .
In addition to a reduction in the funding provided to build new embassies or bring existing buildings up to Inman standards , RSOs were forced to make repeated cuts in budgets for items such as local guard forces , residential security and the maintenance of security equipment such as closed - circuit TV cameras and vehicular barriers .
These budget cuts were identified as a contributing factor in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam .
The final report of the Crowe Commission , which was established to investigate the attacks , notes that its accountability review board members " were especially disturbed by the collective failure of the U.S. government over the past decade to provide adequate resources to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. diplomatic missions to terrorist attacks in most countries around the world . "
The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi was known to be vulnerable .
Following the August 1997 raid on the Nairobi residence of Wadih el - Hage , U.S. officials learned that el - Hage and his confederates had conducted extensive pre-operational surveillance against the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi , indicating that they planned to attack the facility .
The U.S. ambassador in Nairobi , citing the embassy 's vulnerability to car bomb attacks , asked the state department in December 1997 to authorize a relocation of the embassy to a safer place .
In its January 1998 denial of the request , the state department said that , in spite of the threat and vulnerability , the post 's " medium " terrorism threat level did not warrant the expenditure .
Old Fears
The 1998 East Africa embassy bombings highlighted the consequences of the security budget cuts that came during the lull years .
Clearly , terrorism was not dead then , nor is it dead today , in spite of the implications in the March 13 Washington Post article .
Indeed , the current threat of attacks directed against U.S. diplomatic facilities is very real .
Since January 2008 , we have seen attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities in Sanaa , Yemen ; Istanbul , Turkey ; Kabul , Afghanistan ; Belgrade , Serbia ; and Monterrey , Mexico ( as well as attacks against American diplomats in Pakistan , Sudan and Lebanon ) .
Since 2001 , there have also been serious attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia ; Karachi , Pakistan ; Damascus , Syria ; Athens , Greece ; and Baghdad , Iraq .
Even if one believes , as we do , that al Qaeda 's abilities have been severely degraded since 9/11 , it must be recognized that the group and its regional franchises still retain the ability to conduct tactical strikes .
In fact , due to the increased level of security at U.S. diplomatic missions , most of the attacks conducted by jihadists have been directed against softer targets such as hotels or the embassies of other foreign countries .
Indeed , attacks that were intended to be substantial strikes against U.S. diplomatic facilities in places like Sanaa , Jeddah and Istanbul have been thwarted by the security measures in place at those facilities .
Even in Damascus , where the embassy was an older facility that did not meet Inman standards , adequate security measures ( aided by poor planning and execution on the part of the attackers ) helped thwart a potentially disastrous attack .
However , in spite of the phrase " war on terrorism , " terrorism is a tactic and not an entity .
One can not kill or destroy a tactic .
Historically , terrorism has been used by a wide array of actors ranging from neo -Nazis to anarchists and from Maoists to jihadists .
Even when the Cold War ended and many of the state - sponsored terrorist groups lost their funding , the tactic of terrorism endured .
Even if the core al Qaeda leaders were killed or captured tomorrow and the jihadist threat were neutralized next week , terrorism would not go away .
As we have previously pointed out , ideologies are far harder to kill than individuals .
There will always be actors with various ideologies who will embrace terrorism as a tactic to strike a stronger enemy , and as the sole global superpower , the U.S. and its diplomatic missions will be targeted for terrorist attacks for the foreseeable future — or at least the next 100 years .
During this time , the booms and busts of counterterrorism and security spending will continue in response to successful attacks and in the lulls between spectacular terrorist strikes like 9/11 .
During the lulls in this cycle , it will be easy for complacency to slip in — especially when there are competing financial needs .
But terrorism is not going to go away any time soon , and when emotion is removed from the cycle , a logical and compelling argument emerges for consistently supplying enough money to protect U.S. embassies and other essential facilities .

It ’s hard enough meeting someone who understands and appreciates your atheism .
Now , we have the relationship “ experts ” working against us ?
Steve Harvey appeared on The Tyra Banks
Show the other day to promote his new book Act Like a Lady , Think Like a Man : What Men Really Think About Love , Relationships , Intimacy , and Commitment .
He was discussing a section of his book in which he tells women to find out certain things about the man they ’re interested in before pursuing something more serious .
Here ’s the clip ( 5:57 mark ) :
And the transcript :
You need to get into some personal stuff :
What ’s his relationship with his mom ?
How does he feel about children ?
Does he have a relationship with God ?
You sitting up there talking to a dude and he tells you he ’s an atheist , you need to pack it up and go home .
You talking to a person who do n’t believe in God … what ’s his moral barometer ?
Where ’s it at ?
It ’s nowhere .
You gotta get into this stuff .
First of all , my answer to the children question should already give the girl an indication of my atheism .
Secondly , if the girl is foolish enough to actually believe what Harvey is saying , then she deserves what she can find .
Not every God-fearing man is a great catch .
If any lady asks that question , I would hope the atheist moves on to someone more worthy of his affection .
Harvey is n’t the only relationship advice giver who has it out for atheists .
A couple weeks ago , Dr. Gian Gonzaga wrote an article for eHarmony in which the following was stated :
There are types of people that are more vulnerable to engage in affairs .
It ’s probably not surprising that men are more likely to cheat ( especially those who feel powerless and socially isolated ) , but both genders can easily fall into the following groupings :
Those who crave excitement
Those who have a history of divorce , sexual abuse or such psychological problems as depression or bipolar disorder
Those who are not religious
Ouch .
My feelings .
I do n’t have access to the research cited for this data , but I ’d like to know how accurate that statement is .
Can anyone give some real advice to atheists who are single ?
What should we look for in another person ?
What should be our warning signs that this relationship wo n’t work out ?
Dalai letters tell truth of 1959 revolt
( Xinhua )
Updated : 2009-03-14 00:21
BEIJING --
When the Dalai Lama on Tuesday lambasted the Chinese government over its policy in Tibet and labeled , as usual , the March 10 failed armed rebellion in 1959 as " a peaceful uprising , " letters he wrote publicized 50 years ago may help people gain insight into the event .
On Tuesday , in India 's northern town of Dharamsala , the Dalai Lama said the Chinese government 's " desperate developments left the Tibetan people with no alternative but to launch a peaceful uprising . "
But according to three signed letters made public by the Chinese government on March 29 , 1959 , the Dalai Lama 's attitude towards the rebellion was clear then : he was against it and had vowed to quiet the disturbance .
The three letters were verified by the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru after a meeting with the Dalai Lama on April 24 , 1959 , according to previous reports of the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) and Agence France Press ( AFP ) .
According to documents released by the Chinese government March 2 , on February 7 , 1959 , the Dalai Lama asked officers of the Tibet Military Area Command to arrange a performance for him .
Based on the witness account made by Thubten Dampa , an official with the Tibetan local government and participant of the rebellion , the Dalai Lama had admitted to the rebels on March 14 that he had personally requested the performance from the military and did not go through a third person .
On March 9 , The Dalai Lama told Galoins ( cabinet ministers ) that they could go directly to the performance , slated for March 10 at the Tibet Military Area Command Auditorium , without gathering at his residence at the Norbulingka Palace .
On March 10 , the rebels coerced more than 2,000 people to gather at Norbulingka .
They also spread rumors such as " the Military Area Command is planning to poison the Dalai Lama , " and shouted slogans such as " Independence of Tibet " and " Away with the Hans . "
The Dalai Lama 's attitude toward the rebellion , which was revealed in his letters , is quite different from the statement that is now being posted on the Web site of " Tibetan government - in - exile " and what he has repeatedly emphasized in his speeches .
From March 10 to March 16 in 1959 , the Dalai Lama exchanged three rounds of letters with Tan Guansan , the acting representative of the central government and political commissar of the Tibet Military Area Command .
After the rebellion broke out on March 10 , Tan managed to send a letter to the Dalai Lama , expressing his understanding of the Dalai Lama 's situation .
The next day , in his first reply to Tan , the Dalai Lama wrote of the rebellion , " reactionary , evil elements are carrying out activities endangering me on the pretext of ensuring my safety .
I am taking steps to calm things down . "
Having been informed that the rebels were making reckless military provocations since March 10 , The Dalai Lama wrote , in his second letter on March 12 , " the unlawful activities of the reactionary clique cause me endless worry and sorrow ... . "
He wrote , in the same letter , " as to the incidents of yesterday and the day before , which were brought about on the pretext of ensuring my safety and have seriously estranged relations between the Central People 's Government and the local government , I am making every possible effort to deal with them . "
However , the official Web site of the " Tibetan government - in - exile , " presents a different version of " chronology of events . "
It stated that " tens of thousands of Tibetans gathered in front of Norbulingka Palace , Lhasa to prevent His Holiness from going to a performance at the Chinese Army Camp in Lhasa .
Tibetan People 's Uprising begins in Lhasa , " according to the Web site .
The statement contradicts the letters written to Tan , removing words such as " unlawful " or " reactionary clique . "
In his March 16 letter to Tan , the Dalai Lama said that he had " educated " and " severely criticized " officials of the local Tibet government and was dividing separatist officials from those who did not want to be involved in the rebellion .
He also said he might go to the Military Area Command a few days later .
However , on the evening of March 17 , the Dalai Lama , together with his associates , fled from Lhasa .
His flight was solid evidence that his letters were intended to mislead .
In his autobiography , the Dalai Lama admitted that his letters to Tan aimed at gaining some time for his escape and was his delaying strategy .
The mismatch of the Dalai Lama 's words and deeds , though led to his successful flight , seems to prove that what he had done were against the commandments followed by Tibetan Buddhists .
Though the commandments followed by Tibetan Buddhists vary , they are all based on the " four precepts " : no killing , stealing , adultery , or lying .
The Gelugpa School , or the yellow sect , of Tibetan Buddhism , headed by the Dalai Lama , is better known for its strict observance of these commandments .
The tomb of a 45 year old male from 2700 years ago is analyzed :
The grave goods included bridles , archery equipment , a harp , a leather basket , and a wooden bowl .
Both the basket and the bowl were filled with vegetative matter - about 789 grams ( ~ 1 pound 11 ounces ) .
Radiocarbon dating was performed and a calibrated date of 2,700 years BP was returned .
Analysis of the vegetative material indicated it was Cannabis sativa .
Furthing testing indicated it was psychoactive .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - The U.S. federal government budget widened to $ 192.8 billion in February as tax receipts plunged to the lowest level in 14 years , the Treasury Department reported Wednesday .
It 's the second largest monthly deficit on record , exceeded only by $ 237.2 billion gap in October .
For the first five months of the fiscal year , the deficit has increased by a half trillion dollars to a record $ 764.5 billion .
Outlays were flat compared with a year earlier at $ 280.1 billion , while receipts dropped 17 % to $ 87.3 billion , the lowest since February 1995 .
In February , individual income taxes fell 64 % to just $ 8.7 billion .
That 's the lowest monthly total for individual income taxes since May 1985 .
Japanese police on Thursday arrested a business executive who built a cult - like status among thousands of investors whom he reportedly defrauded of at least 1.4 billion US dollars .
Kazutsugi Nami , chairman of now bankrupt bedding supplier L&G K.K. , had promised 36 percent annual returns .
His company even issued its own electronic money , which he predicted would be a hit during the global economic crisis .
Many of the victims were elderly people , who initially bought everything from vegetables to futons with the currency and would attend promotional fairs set up by the 75 - year - old Nami .
The arrest comes two months after US broker Bernard Madoff was arrested and charged with using billions of US dollars from new investors to pay off older ones in a pyramid scheme .
Soon before his arrest , Nami told a swarm of reporters and camera crew that he had done nothing wrong .
I somehow missed this earlier in the week , but Ellen at NewsHounds and Jason Linkins at HuffPo caught Bernard Goldberg 's being the classic conservative wanker that he is .
Goldberg , on Bill O'Reilly 's show Wednesday , started out claiming , like Angela McGlowan , that Jackie Mason 's use of the racial slur " schvartze " is n't " a bad word . "
Then Bill O'Reilly noted that his dictionary , quite accurately , notes that the word is frequently used as a pejorative :
O'Reilly : OK , but here 's what the dictionary says .
The dictionary says the word s - c - h - v - a - r - t - z-e -- " often disparaging and offensive . "
Goldberg : Forgive my arrogance .
The dictionary is written by some liberal person .
See , in Bernie Goldberg 's world , even the dictionaries have a liberal bias .
Or , as Stephen Colbert puts it :
" Reality has a well - known liberal bias . "
It 's only natural for professionals to feel uneasy , given today 's bleak economy .
It seems every day another company announces a round of new layoffs , so could you be next ? >
Bill Driscoll , New England district president for staffing firm Robert Half International says these six warning signs could indicate that your job might be in jeopardy .
As if we needed another reminder of how bad things are , the US government released its latest unemployment figures on Friday .
The bureau of labour statistics reports unemployment currently at 8.1 % , the highest level in 15 years .
This puts the total number of unemployed Americans at 12.5 million .
Over four million jobs have been lost since the recession began a year ago .
More than half of those disappeared in the last four months alone – pointing to an acceleration of job loss as the recession deepens .
The problem with unemployment figures is they do n't tell the full story .
Unemployment , by definition , only counts those who are actively looking for work but cannot find it .
Once you have simply given up , perhaps due to six months of steady rejections and hiring freezes , you are no longer unemployed .
Rather , you are considered a " discouraged worker " and not counted as part of the labour force , along with children and retirees .
If discouraged workers were to be factored in , the total jobless rate would be 14.8 % , the highest level on record since the labour department began keeping tallies .
As any recession wears on , fewer jobs become available and more job seekers become discouraged .
Therefore the longer this recession lasts , the less reliable a barometer the unemployment rate will be , and the more it will understate the severity of the crisis .
Also hidden in unemployment figures is the number of workers who are underemployed .
Technically , you could have worked just one hour in the past week and still be considered employed .
The ranks of " involuntary part - time " workers are growing , as some employees avoid the axe by allowing their hours to be cut .
The average work week is now down to 33 hours .
Besides the obvious negative effect on family income , workers who are shifted from full - time to part - time work usually lose their health benefits .
In this country , a job crisis is by necessity also a public health crisis .
Another depressing metric is mass layoffs .
Economists distinguish between different types of unemployment : frictional ( when workers move from one job to another ) , structural ( when labour markets are unable to clear ) and cyclical ( when the entire economy tanks ) – the type that 's of interest to us now .
When companies are firing hundreds of workers at a time , that is not a sign of the relatively more benign types of unemployment .
Since the beginning of the recession , 2.6 million workers were laid off in 25,712 mass " events " .
These were concentrated in manufacturing , especially in the south and midwest .
Mass layoffs are more pernicious because they speak to the collapse of entire industries and , in towns and cities dependent on a single industry , the demise of entire communities .
The extent of job loss throughout the economy illustrates the recession 's spread from its roots in the mortgage - backed securities crash .
Predictably , financial services , real estate and construction were hit the hardest , as well as the long - suffering manufacturing sector .
But job losses have also been pronounced in retail , transportation , hospitality and the information sector .
Only healthcare has weathered the crisis , for now at least .
People will always get sick .
But as they lose health coverage along with their jobs , there will be fewer patients able to pay for treatment .
Price indices give further indication that things will get worse before they get better .
Unemployment is normally associated with inflation .
But today 's crisis is marked by precisely the opposite : job loss accompanied by deflation .
What sounds like a good thing – who does n't like paying less for gas ?
– is actually quite chilling .
As commodity prices continue to fall , consumers hoard their money , anticipating that prices for that new TV will be even lower next month .
Less consumer spending means less demand , more layoffs and a continuing spiral of falling prices .
Deflationary crises are rare – they have n't been seen in this country since the Great Depression – and are notoriously difficult to counter .
The Federal Reserve has already exhausted its ammunition by cutting the federal funds rate effectively to zero .
Japan is one of the few countries to have dealt with deflationary unemployment in recent history , after an eerily similar housing bubble burst .
They too responded by slashing interest rates to zero .
In the end , it took Japan an entire " lost decade " to crawl out – a legacy that does not bode well for us .
What can be done ?
Also on Friday , the labour department – hoping to temper the bad news – announced it would make $ 3.5 bn available to states for job training programmes .
Training funds are key to addressing frictional and structural unemployment .
But as demand for labour falls across sectors , there will be fewer " safe " industries ( typically healthcare ) for workers to train into .
What remains to be seen is whether stimulus spending will have the desired long - term impact on demand and , in turn , job growth .
If it does not , we will see if this administration has the will to take more drastic measures – something that Japan did after years of joblessness and moribund growth .
After all , in 2003 , it nationalised the banks .
NEW YORK --
The chief executives of the nation 's three largest banks on Friday pushed back against legislation that would heavily tax Wall Street bonuses .
Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit and Bank of America Corp.'s Kenneth Lewis both issued memos to employees criticizing a tax that would make it hard to retain workers .
And J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon reassured his 200 top executives in a conference call that the bank is actively engaging Washington on the matter .
The executives are responding to Washington 's latest salvo against Wall Street bonuses .
Outrage about massive payouts came to a head this week when it was learned that embattled insurer American International Group Inc. , which has received federal government funding to keep it operating , would pay $ 165 million in bonuses to employees of a unit that caused massive losses at the company .
The House passed legislation on Thursday to impose a 90 % surtax on bonuses granted to employees with household income of more than $ 250,000 at companies that received at least $ 5 billion from the government 's financial rescue program .
The Senate is considering a similar plan that could be up for a vote as soon as next week .
Eight banks -- Citi , JPMorgan , BofA , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Morgan Stanley , PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and U.S. Bancorp -- have each received more than $ 5 billion from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Plan , known as TARP .

But , in that post , I conveniently only covered plain vanilla Drupal nodes ; what if the nodes you need to work with have CCK ( Content Construction Kit module ) defined fields ?
These are specified through Drupal ’s administrative GUI , and so , its not obvious how to programmatically reference them .
This post will show you the way that I commonly deal with this situation , and I ’m embarassed to say , it relies more on knowing a few Drupal tricks than any deep knowledge of the inner workings of Drupal .
But these methods easily and reliably show you how to programmatically reference , access and change CCK defined fields just like any other node attribute .
Michael Jackson Has Recorded 100 Secret Songs
The King of Pophas recorded over 100 " secret " songs throughout the years and we wo n't hear them until he dies .
Only his three children Prince , 11 , Paris Katherine , 10 , and Prince Michael II , 5 , have heard the songs .
This is all according to biographer Ian Halperin , who is working on an upcoming book , Unmasked , The Michael Jackson Story .
" I was astonished by the number of songs which have been held back .
I was told that he will not let them come out now but wants to leave them for his kids , a very personal legacy to them . "
With all of Jackson 's financial struggles over the years , one would think he would release a couple of songs in order to stay afloat and escape some negative press .
The photo above was taken last week of Jackson , pictured with fashion designer Christian Audigier , while shopping at Dior and Dolce and Gabbana .

A life assurance company is trying to prevent the Equality Authority dealing with a complaint by a policyholder who is claiming discrimination due to her weight .
Eagle Star Life Assurance has asked the High Court to prevent the authority from dealing with the complaint by a woman after she was told her policy was subject to 100 % loading due to her alleged obesity .
The hearing follows a complaint against from 49 - year - old Bernadette Treanor , from Dowdalls Hill on Newry Road in Dundalk , who is an equality officer by profession .
Ms Treanor claims she was discriminated and victimised by Eagle Star and its chief medical officer , who informed Ms Treanor 's GP that the decision to load her income protection cover was taken due to her being ' overweight ' .
The case is being heard before Mr Justice John Hedigan .
Early Look : Asus W90 Dual Radeon HD 4870 Notebook

We never thought we'd see the day to be honest , but the mammoth W90 notebook from Asus comes withMobility Radeon HD 4870s and an Intel Core 2 Duo T9600 45 nm CPU , buried in a 18.4 " 5 kg behemoth .
" Notebook " is a loose term where the W90 is concerned and it's more of a compact desktop than a notebook .
With two 320 GB hard drives it 's got a tonne of storage space and 6GB of memory exceeds most desktop systems .
The Altec Lasingspeakers and a plethora of extra ports for expansion including several USB 2.0 , eSATA , IEEE1394a Firewire ( 4 - pin ) , VGA , HDMI , Ethernet and modem ( why ? ) , and 3.5 mm headphone and microphone jacks .
An SD card and Express card slot sit above the DVD - RW drive , which will be swapped out for a Blu-ray drive on the production model .
That 's perfectly suited to the 1080 p capable 1,920 x 1,080 16:9 screen .
Asus also squeezes in Bluetooth and 802.11n wireless connectivity in , as well as a " subwoofer " in the base although we 'd hardly consider this a " feature " having sampled some music - just like the 93Wh , 8800 mAh battery which seems , like all desktop replacement laptops , as a token to make it a " notebook " rather than a desktop PC .
The buttons along the top and down the left side are of the funky touch sensitive variety although the fine dot pitch TFT screen is also glossy too to improve contrast .
The volume and backlight control are touch sliders that work very well at the flick of a finger so no more fishing for function key shortcuts .
One of these buttons was an auto - overclock one - similar to the MSI Turbo button on its G - series gaming notebooks , it overclocks the CPU frontside bus by a notch giving it a few extra horses .
The function does n't overclock the graphics cards and we found in our engineering sample at least it was still quite buggy crashing the machine after only several seconds .
The thickness is a pretty uniform 5 cm - the display with its brushed aluminium shell covering the back is 1.5 cm of that too .
This brushed aluminium continues around the keyboard providing a great look - and as a bonus it warms up nicely from the PC underneath .
It 's probably a little unfair to compare this to the other end of the market - the Samsung NC10 shown here is about as portable as you can get but it does show the two extremes of what you can buy .
Likewise , the power brick for this beastie is suitably large , but still smaller than your grey Xbox 360 power box - yet , the Asus W90 features an extra hard drive , graphics card and the other connectivity as well .
The Future of Deployment
Listen to this article
Application deployment is changing .
In relatively short order I ’ve gone from buying hardware , to monthly hosting , to metered CPU time , and from building my open - source software manually , to package managers , to fancy config tools and recipes to pre-build whole machine images .
What ’s next ?
The Old Way
I can deploy Rails apps in a traditional hosting environment pretty quickly .
For a small app , I might make a new unix user and database on a personal Slicehost slice and do a quick code checkout .
After setting up a few permissions and twiddling my Nginx config , in a matter of fifteen minutes or so my app is online .
Not bad at all .
For a bigger app , it takes more time .
In days of yore I ’d build a server from parts or buy one of the excellent Pogo Linux servers and put it in a colo .
OS install , Xen setup , guest OS install , OS package setup , security lockdown , then on to the task of all the stack setup ( database , Rails , source control ) specific to the application to be run .
Once you get into multiple servers , the complexity multiplies out quickly .
There are dozens of small decisions to make about how resources are allocated .
More RAM or more CPU for the database machine ?
One slave database , or two ?
Hardware load balancer vs. multiple IPs vs. something else ?
All of these require both detailed knowledge about hardware and software deployments , combined with a huge amount of predictive guesswork to try to foresee the quantity and type of load that the app being deployed is likely to face in the next 3 , 6 , or 12 months .
There ’s an enterprisey word for this process : provisioning .
The New Way
Amazon ’s EC2 is the vanguard of the new generation of cloud computing .
Provisioning a server was formerly a phone call and days or weeks of waiting .
Now it ’s a REST call and 30 seconds of waiting .
Awesome .
But this is a very raw resource : there are still many provisioning decisions to be made , software to set up , and then on to deployment of the app itself .
Excellent services like RightScale and Engine Yard ’s new offering Solo can help automate a lot of this process and minimize the management burden .
So far , so good .
But what if provisioning was instantaneous , requiring no upfront decisions about resource allocation ?
What if you did n’t need to think at all about the server hardware or software , but only about your application code ?
How would this change how we build applications ?
The Future
When technology breakthroughs make something smaller , or faster , or cheaper , it does n’t just change current use ; it creates whole new types of use .
If app deployment is instantaneous , without having to plan for resources , allocate servers , or beg approval from the IT department , what kind of apps will we build that do n’t get built today ?
In the past decade we ’ve seen widespread adoption of agile methodologies in the development of software .
This has transformed software development from a slow , failure - prone , and sometimes downright painful process into one that is fast , fun , and fulfilling .
But deployment of applications has changed hardly at all during that same time period .
The way you deploy a Rails , Merb , Sinatra , or Django app today is very similar to how you deployed a Perl app in 1999 .
This coming decade is going to see an agile revolution for the deployment side of the equation .
The manual , guesswork - heavy methods of provisioning that we use today are soon to be superseded by methods that will make deploying an app fast , easy , and fun .
No one knows quite what that will look like yet ( though at Heroku we certainly have our own opinion ) , but one thing is for sure : the time is ripe for a revolution in IT .

( this is where I use my hands by rubbing the butter into the flour ) .
Add milk gradually , stirring until soft dough is formed .
Turn out on slightly floured board and lightly " knead " for 30 seconds , enough to shape .
Roll 1/2 inch thick and cut with 2 inch floured biscuit cutter .
Bake on ungreased sheet in a 400 degree oven for 12 - 15 minutes .
Makes 12 biscuits .
You can also make tiny tea biscuits that are only 1 1/2 inches wide with a small cutter or glass bottom .
These are great served with tea , jam or honey .

In a large bowl , combine baking mix and pecans .
Add cream and stir until a soft dough forms .
On a lightly floured surface , use a floured rolling pin to roll out dough to 1/2 inch thickness .
Use a floured 2 - inch biscuit cutter to cut out dough .
Place on greased baking sheet and brush tops with butter .
Bake 7 - 10 minutes or until light brown .

Marx once generated publicity for the Marx Brothers film " A Night in Casablanca " ...
In 1950 , at the first Formula One World Drivers ’ Championship , it was Team Alfa Romeo ’s Nino Farina who became the first F1 champion .
In the 68 years since , there have been a total of 33 F1 champions .
Of course , several of which have won multiple championships , with Michael Schumacher being the most successful driver in F1 history , winning seven championships during his career .
Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel have dominated the sport in recent years and should clearly be in the discussion of top drivers all - time , but for this list we wanted to remember some of the pioneers of the sport , one of which we ’ve lost today .
Niki Lauda is a Formula
One legend and three time champion , and he has passed away at the age of 70 .
Determining a list like this can be quite tricky , with storied racing careers shortened due to wars and fatal crashes , but we ’ve done our best to compile our list of the Top Seven retired drivers .
7 ) Niki Lauda
Nationality : Austrian
Championships : 3 ( 1975 , 1977 , 1984 )
Championship Teams : Ferrari ( 2 ) , McLaren ( 1 )
Races : 171 starts
Wins : 25
Pole Positions : 24
Niki Lauda is the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren , the two most successful constructors in the sport .
Sadly Lauda is probably best known for the tragic crash that scarred his face with terrible burns to the head .
Ironically the crash came in a race that Lauda personally had urged his fellow drivers to boycott due to unsafe racing conditions .
He participated in the race anyways and on August 1st 1976 at the German Grand Prix on the Nurburgring , Niki swerved off the track , hit an embankment , and his car burst into flames .
Despite the life - changing crash , Niki returned to the sport to compete for several more years , and even went on to win two more championships in his career .
6 ) Jackie Stewart
Nationality : British
Championships : 3 ( 1969 , 1971 , 1973 )
Championship Teams : Marta ( 1 ) , Tyrrell ( 2 )
Races : 99 starts
Wins : 27
Pole Positions : 17
Sir John Young Stewart , nicknamed The Flying Scot , was known for his exceptional driving skills in the dry and wet .
The year after his dominant win in F3 , he signed with BRM alongside Graham Hill .
But it was n’t until he signed with Marta in 1968 that his F1 career started to blossom .
In the same year , Stewart was forced to miss two races due to an F2 injury , causing him to lose the 1968 F1 World Drivers ’ title to Hill .
He then went on to win the WDC next year , and two more in the in 1971 and 1973 with Tyrrell .
5 ) Jim Clark
Nationality : British
Championships : 2 ( 1963 , 1965 )
Championship Team : Lotus ( 2 )
Races : 72 starts
Wins : 25
Pole Positions : 33
Without a doubt , Jim Clark is one of the most badass F1 drivers ever .
He was a handsome and talented man admired by millions of fans and drivers all over the world .
With only 72 starts , he managed to achieve 25 victories and 33 pole positions .
Clark was the most dominant driver in his era .
His most memorable performance is the Italian Grand Prix in 1967 , where he lost a lap after a tire punctured while he was leading the race .
After rejoining sixteenth , he eventually caught up and took the lead again in the last lap , but finished third after his car ran out of fuel .
Like Senna , Clark ’s life tragically ended at the peak of his brilliant racing career .
4 ) Alain Prost
Nationality : French
Championships : 4 ( 1985 , 1986 , 1989 , 1993 )
Championship Teams : McLaren ( 3 ) , Williams ( 1 )
Races : 199 starts
Wins : 51
Pole Positions : 33
Alain Prost is the first French , and the only French to this date , to have won an F1 World Drivers ’ Championship .
He held the record of having the most Grand Prix victories from 1987 to 2001 .
Prost raced in the years of having many champions as teammates and opponents .
In the late 80s to early 90s , he formed strong rivalries with Ayrton Senna , Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell .
But it was his battles with Senna that were particularly notable and exciting to watch .
During his 13 years in F1 racing , Prost beat nearly all his teammates on total points season by season , including five World Champions .
3 ) Juan Manuel Fangio
Nationality : Argentine
Championships : 5 ( 1951 , 1954 , 1955 , 1956 , 1957 )
Championship Teams : Alfa Romeo ( 1 ) , Mercedes ( 1.5 ) , Ferrari ( 1 ) , Maserati ( 1.5 )
Races : 51 starts
Wins : 24
Pole Positions : 29
Juan - Manuel Fangio was the most dominant driver in the 50s .
In his eight years of F1 career , he has won WDC five times and finished second place twice .
He is known to have the ability to win a race with any car .
During his time , one could only rely on their raw driving skills when safety gear and electronic driver aids such as ABS , active suspension , and traction control were not available .
Although his record for winning five championships was surpassed by Schumacher in 2003 , his race winning percentage of 47 % remains the highest even to this date .
2 ) Michael Schumacher
Nationality : German
Championships : 7 ( 94,95,00,01,02,03,04 )
Championship Team : Benetton ( 2 ) Ferrari ( 5 )
Races : 306 starts
Wins : 91
Pole Positions : 68
Shumacher is statistically the most successful driver in Formula
One history , and utterly dominated the sport for the early part of the 2000s .
Schumacher was known for his work ethic , supreme fitness , and great desire .
His career was frequently controversial though , as he was twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that determined the outcome of the World Championship
1 ) Ayrton Senna
Nationality : Brazilian
Championships : 3 ( 1988 , 1990 , 1991 )
Championship Team : McLaren ( 3 )
Races : 161 starts
Wins : 41
Pole Positions : 65
Ayrton Senna is regarded by many as the greatest driver in the history of F1 .
He was known for his qualifying speed and aggressive driving style .
He held the record for most pole positions , but was later surpassed by Schumacher in 2006 with just three more after a whopping 87 more starts .
As mentioned earlier , Senna shared an intense rivalry with Alain Prost , and is probably the worst in F1 history .
Since 1988 when their rivalry started , their competitions went so fierce that the two could only see each other on the track .
Both would either block each other from advancing using dangerous maneuvers or intentionally crashed into each other .
In 1989 , he lost to Prost after a championship - deciding collision , but immediately got his revenge next year after another championship - deciding collision .
Despite all the controversies between the two , both had had mutual respect for each other .
In 1994 , while he was leading the race , Senna lost his life as his car left the track at high speed and hit the concrete retaining wall at around 135 mph .
When roboticist David Hanson thinks of the future , he fears that man will accidentally create a super - sentient artificial intelligence that is heartless and clinically insane .
So to save the world , he formed Hanson Robotics and built Zeno , a 17 - inch robot boy , who smiles , laughs , recognizes your face and remembers your name .
Fending off the end of the world may be a heavy mantle to hang on the shoulders of a 17 - inch robot that ’s still in prototype stage , but Hanson does call Zeno the superhero of the singularity .
" We want to be damn sure that by the time [ robots ] become as smart as we are , they have a conscience and compassion and that we are friends . , " Hanson said .
" There ’s no guarantee .
They could be psychotic . "
Zeno is himself a visitor from the future — a robot who reached consciousness in 2029 , but is found by government web crawlers .
From there he ’s put into a government academy for artificially intelligent robots , where those in charge may have nefarious motives .
" The world will need a superintelligent hero , " Hanson said .
" Superintelligent agents are also able to spawn technology that could destroy us all . "
This narrative , crafted by Hugo award winner Tony Daniel and University of Texas performance professor Thomas Riccio , is intended to make Zeno into a character that people identify with and want to to see develop — something with the depth of a movie character or a figure from a Homerian epic .
That makes Zeno into as much of a sociological experiment as it is a technical marvel or fun toy .
" The idea is to create a cultural phenomenon and accelerate the use and humanization of the technology , " Hanson said .
" Robots have gotten steadily more capable but humans ’ expectations that robots should have minds keeps biting robot developers . "
Which is to say that Hanson wants Zeno to change robots and humans .
Zeno has charmed visitors at Wired ’s NextFest tech celebration for the last two years , including an ongoing run in the 2008 pavilion in Chicago ’s Millennium park ( open through Oct. 12 ) .
Still , Zeno is clearly a work in progress , prone to hip problems , battery issues or overly long diatribes about the singularity , when a wink or smile would be more charming .
Zeno already does " know " people , and in his mind , has a knowledge container that stores a photo of the person and details about that person .
The next step is getting Zeno to start making theories about the world , discarding the dumb ones and amplifying the plausible ones .
That , according to Hanson , is the essence of intelligence , and once a robot can combine that ability with the knowledge available on the internet , superintelligence wo n’t be far off .
Hanson Robotics hopes to begin selling a mass market version of Zeno for about $ 300 starting sometime in 2010 .

A missile suspected to have been fired by a US drone has killed at least five people in north - western Pakistan , officials say .
The missile hit a house in Janikhel , in the Bannu district of North West Frontier Province , late on Sunday .
Correspondents say this is the sixth drone attack on Pakistani territory since Barack Obama became US president .
Pakistan is critical of the tactic because , it says , civilians are often killed , fuelling support for militants .
Separately , an attack on a terminal on the outskirts of Peshawar has destroyed supplies bound for Nato troops in Afghanistan , the second such attack in as many days .
Criticised
Local tribesmen in Janikhel said the house destroyed in the missile attack was frequented by the Taleban and foreign militants .
All the men killed were militants and they included two Arabs , the tribesmen said .
Local administration officials confirmed the missile attack but said the identity of the dead could not be confirmed .

This is the second attack in the region in the past five days .
Twenty - five people were killed in a missile strike on a Taleban compound in the tribal region of Kurrum on 12 March .
The attacks are believed to have been carried out by US drones , although this has never been formally acknowledged by the US authorities .
Pakistan 's government has strongly criticised the attacks , which have led to an increase in anti-Americanism in the country .
The attack on the Peshawar terminal took place at 0300 on Monday ( 2200 GMT Sunday ) when militants used rockets to strike lorries parked at the terminal .
At least eight trucks were destroyed and several others damaged as a blaze engulfed the terminal .
A policeman told the BBC that all the supplies loaded on the trucks had been destroyed .
This is the second such attack on Nato terminals in as many days .
Before dawn on Sunday , about 40 militants attacked the Pak - Afghan Container Terminal near Peshawar burning dozens of vehicles and containers .
The road from Peshawar to Afghanistan is a major supply route for US and Western forces battling the Taleban .

Father Stott , at the Bishops House , asked me to put my request for a formal act of defection in writing , for it to be entered into the public record .
Here ’s what I am sending him this afternoon , with personal details omitted .
EDIT : March 21 , 2009 , 10:35 PM .
The first draft of this letter failed to address my concerns over Knights of Columbus donations to Yes on Proposition 8 and did n’t take into account the Church ’s reply to the accusation of carelessness in the Pope ’s message on condom use .
I ’ve amended the letter as follows and will send this version of the letter first post Monday morning .
Thanks to everyone who has contacted me via reddit and email with messages of support .
Dear Father Stott ,
Further to our telephone conversation March 18 , 2009 , on my seeking advice on how I might have a formal act of defection entered into the public record , here are my details , as requested .
I was born on the xx / xx / xxxx , at North Tees Hospital .
I was baptised by Father Hussy , at Saint Patrick ’s Church , Fairfield , Stockton On Tees , on x / xx / xxxx and for the first 14 years of my life , through first confession , first communion and confirmation , I believed everything my parents , the church and my teachers told me about the Catholic faith , attending mass and confession every week .
You asked that I give an explanation of my decision to leave the chruch .
One is almost tempted to recall the Americanism , if you have to ask , you ’ll never know .
But my protest is not a frivolous matter .
On the contrary , I take the decision very seriously indeed and although I ’m sure you will be grateful if I refrain from a lengthy statement , nonetheless I would appreciate a moment of your time to cover some of the primary reasons I am seeking this clarification .
Firstly , I can no longer quiet my moral objections to certain Vatican policies .
This extends from matters raised in the investigative works of David Yallop , in his books ‘ In God ’s Name ’ and ‘ The Power and the Glory ’ up to recent statements which have been made by Pope Benedict XVI , such as his holiness ’s refusal to acknowledge matters of basic scientific fact concerning the preventative spread of HIV AIDS , through condom use .
The Catholic church is in a unique position to educate and prevent the spread of this disease , but instead chooses to make it 10 times worse on the fundamentally flawed assumption that without the temptation of protected sex , the destitute underclass will opt for bronze - age fallacies and chastity .
This is something which I find morally repugnant , that in any other reality would see those responsible for this policy permanently removed from office — if not exposed to criminal proceedings .
That we are instructed instead to view these comments with reverence , simply because of who uttered them , is perhaps the single best explanation of why church attendance figures are in decline one could wish to find .
The Pope has also made illogical pronouncements on greed and corruption , whilst sitting atop a throne made of gold and precious stones .
He has called the unearthing of a secret Vatican policy of over 40 years standing , which was designed to protect pedophiles in the priesthood while silencing their victims , “ a media exaggeration ” .
He has failed to punish Holocaust deniers in the Bishopric while excommunicating the mother of a nine year old rape victim who became pregnant by her own step father , who himself remained free to attend mass .
He has an attitude from the dark ages towards people who are genetically predetermined to be attracted to members of their own sex .
He has turned a blind eye to Knights of Columbus donations to political campaigns in the hundreds of millions of dollars while in the poorest countries of the world denouncing liberation theology , welcoming money lenders back into the temple to literally pontificate on the very opposite of humility and sacrifice contained in the teachings of Christ .
But more than all of this , Father Stott , I tend to agree with Agnesë Mother Teresa Gonxhe Bojaxhiu , when she said , “ I no longer feel God ’s presence , even in the Eucharist ” , because to my mind , it is a simple matter of deductive logic that there is no such omnipotent being as God , least of all the petulant sadist worshipped by those of my former faith from which I now seek final and public excommunication .
If , anywhere in the ever expanding universe , there were such a being as that which you describe in Yahweh , I find it unlikely that He would allow the things which take place in His name to continue , were he capable of intervening to prevent them .
Since , for the last 13.7 billion years , God has failed to do this , one can only conclude that He is incapable of such an act , in which case
He is not the benevolent God of the good book we are dogmatically told by those in your profession
He is , while failing to present the slightest shred of evidence to back - up one deluded axiom after another , spanning centuries of war , hate , oppression and greed in defence of this intolerant and shrivelling credo .
For these reasons and myriad others , which I am almost certain you are equally uninterested in hearing about as you are those above , I hereby formally request that I am no longer , as a matter of public record , to be considered a Catholic .
I would be grateful for written confirmation of this request as and when you are able to provide it .
Look on the bright side , father .
You lose me , you gain Tony Blair .

DON'T USE HAIR REMOVAL CREAMS - they are NOT for ' down there '!
I shaved there recently and I can give you a tip :
if the hair is long at first trim it , because when you shave it will get caught in the blade and well .. just trim it lol .
then take a new shaving blade and apply shave gel on ' down there ' and shave GENTLY and carefuly ( best to look at the mirror while doing it ) and well that 's it .
WAXING hurts like hell , so dont try it !
Good luck :)
From ThinkWiki
Reducing system power consumption will extend battery life , reduce system temperature and ( on some models ) reduce system fan noise .
Power consumption can be greatly improved from a stock distribution configuration to a fine tuned system .
The general rules are :
Unload drivers for unused devices ( ie. USB 1.1 , Yenta / PCMCIA , Wireless , IRDA , Bluetooth , ...)
Reduce polling on devices ( drives , USB subsystem , nvram , use SATA AN , ...)
Reduce hard drive activity
Reduce LCD brightness to the minimum you can stand
Reduce CPU wakeups , so it can stay longer in deep power saving c-states
Make use of every hardware devices availables power saving features ( AHCI ALPM , USB autosuspend , Alsa and Wireless powersaving modes , HPET timers , ... )
Arjan van de Ven 's PowerTOP utility is a gold mine to improve energy efficiency , but is almost only CPU - oriented .
This tool helps to easily detect the top power offenders , both userland and kernel modules , which prevent the use of CPU power saving mechanisms and sometime suggest fixes accordingly .
PowerTOP users collected some tips & tricks and an informative faq .
Alternatively ( or complementary ) to PowerTOP , running strace -p $ ( pidof yourapp ) for all your favorite or background running applications while they are expected to be idle , will show the misbehaviors .
Beside CPU wakeups , disks spins are also power hungry .
To detect what make your disk spinning ,
sysctl vm.block_dump=1
will list all applications causing disks wakeups on the kernel 's dmesg .
Other useful tools for this purpose are blktrace , iostat and lm-profiler ( from laptop - mode - tools suite ) .
See also # Misbehaving Userland .
BIOS settings
Enabling Power Management
Some Thinkpad BIOS ( like 2.08 BIOS on X40 ) offer two very lame options , with a very misleading online help ( saying " Usually not needed " ) .
That 's
CPU power management : ( default disabled ) PCI bus power management : ( default disabled )
You should indeed enable them , else the deepest C3 and C4 ACPI C - states are disabled .
Disabling I/O Ports
The BIOS ( at least version 3.11 on X200 ) can also be used to disable I/O ports , like PCMCIA / CardBus .
Although this requires a reboot to change settings , using the BIOS rather than a configuration file will survive distribution changes and may make it easier to remember how to re-enable a port .
Disabling these devices can reduce power consumption by several watts .
CPU
Look at :
A good thing to keep in mind is that every CPU wakeup , even if it's for a trivial light job , reduce the time the CPU stays on a deep power saving C - state ( like C3 or C4 ) .
Therefore you should ensure your applications stay really idle when they meant to be idle ( track shorts select timeouts in loop , etc. with PowerTOP ) .
Also note that manually locking the CPU in the lowest P - state ( frequency ) available is not an efficient way to improve battery lifetime .
This will cause the CPU to stay longer in C0 ( power hungry C- state ) doing hard work when there is something to do , while it could have done this work faster by augmenting the CPU freq , and returned back faster to a deeper , economic , C - state and to a lower frequency ( P - state ) .
The best is to let the kernel select the appropriates CPU frequencies by itself with the help of in kernel CPU governors .
Have a look at this explanation from Intel 's kernel developer Arjan van de Ven .
Kernel settings and patches
General settings
The 2.6.21 kernel brought some very effective changes ( like dynticks ) .
Later , 2.6.24 - rc2 brought a lot of other power efficiency improvements .
If it 's not already on your distribution and you value power efficiency , you may think about compiling a recent kernel yourself .
Here are a few options ( beside the ACPI and APM related one ) that matter to reduce power consumption or to help diagnosing consumers :
# From PowerTOP's FAQ : CONFIG_NO_HZ CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS
CONFIG_HPET CONFIG_HPET_TIMER
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND
CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE
CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE
CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT=3
CONFIG_TIMER_STATS
CONFIG_ACPI_BATTERY
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_STAT
CONFIG_INOTIFY
# Not from the PowerTOP FAQ : CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IO_TRACE
CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO
depreciated as of kernel 2.6.24 , use CONFIG_X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_ICH
CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_SMI CONFIG_CPU_IDLE CONFIG_CPU_IDLE_GOV_LADDER
CONFIG_CPU_IDLE_GOV_MENU
Those options are already in Fedora Core 7 and Ubuntu Gutsy ( not Feisty ) default i686 kernels .
PowerTOP FAQ also suggest to disable CONFIG_IRQBALANCE and CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG .
Also , you need to properly set APM and ACPI .
Look at :
Kernel boot and module loading options
If you have an Intel chipset ICH5 or later ( cf. lspci output ) , as in most modern Thinkpads , you should be using the integrated HPET timer ( saves about 30 CPU wake ups per second ) .
To see if hpet is enabled on your laptop :
grep hpet / proc/timer_list
If this does not display " Clock Event Device : hpet " , then add
hpet=force
ATTENTION !
The ICH4 does have an HPET , but it is disabled for a good reason : Intel did n't test / validade it !
Use of the ICH4 HPET is not recommended
to your kernel boot options ( usualy in / boot / grub / menu.lst or lilo.conf ) .
Note that " hpet=force " is only available by default in 2.6.24 - rc2 and above ( or as a separated patch for 2.6.22 and 2.6.23 , see below ) .
On modern ThinkPads the HPET timer is automatically detected and enabled .
On certain older machines hpet=force is required such as on the following machines :
Help needed please add your ThinkPad to the above list , if hpet=force was required
Useful Patches
Thomas Gleixner High Resolution Timers ( hrt ) patchset brings many improvements , like the cpuidle work and Udo A. Steinberg and Venki Pallipadi " force enable HPET " patches ( non HPET timers causes about 20 - 40 CPU wakeups / second , but HPET is often hidden by the BIOS due to Windows XP deficiencies ) .
Those are fully merged in 2.6.24 - rc1 vanilla kernel .
See http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/
Kristen Carlson Accardi from Intel has a patchset to turn on " Aggressive Link Power Management " ( ALPM ) for the AHCI driver ( for SATA bus ) .
Also from Accardi , SATA Asynchronous Notification ( SATA AN ) , alows SATA link to notify media insertions ( thus avoid hal polling the cdrom ) .
Those patches were merged in 2.6.24 - rc2 kernel ( AN needs also support in hal to be used ) .
See : http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/kristen/patches/SATA/alpm/
As of now ( 2.6.24 - rc8 ) , the linux kernel does n't support PCI Express power management ( aka PCIe ASPM , aka PCIe LPM ) .
Shaohua Li from Intel submited a patch on LKML ( http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/17/544 ) though , and reported it to reduce power consumption by 1.3 watts for a system with three PCIe links .
The HDAPS disk protection systems can reduce battery life .
Matthew Garrett provides a patch that prevents hdaps kernel module to generate interrupts when this feature is n't used .
Useful sysctls
The meaning of those settings is explained case by case on the relevant sections of this document .
But for convenience sake , we group them here too .
Note that the " ondemand " scaling governor is recommended by Intel developers for energy efficiency : it 's expected to be more efficient than the " powersave " governor , or than userspace daemons ( like cpufreq - utils , cpufreqd , powernowd ... ) .
Look here , here , or here for a kernel developer explanation about " ondemand " being better on modern Intel CPUs .
The " link_power_management_policy " tunable wo n't be available unless you run a 2.6.24 - rc2 or more kernel , or applied Kirsten patchset , have an Intel AHCI compatible chipset , and use SATA drives .
echo 5 > / proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode echo 0 > / proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog echo Y > /sys/module/snd_ac97_codec/parameters/power_save echo 1 > /sys / devices/system/cpu/sched_mc_power_savings echo ondemand > /sys/ devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor echo 1500 > / proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs for i in / sys / bus / usb / devices /*/ power /autosuspend ; do echo 1 > $ i ; done # those sysctl's are only available if you have an AHCI compatible SATA # controler and use kernel > 2.6.24-rc2 ( or use Kristen ALPM patchset ) : echo min_power >
/sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy echo min_power >
/sys/class/scsi_host/host1/link_power_management_policy echo min_power >
/sys/class/scsi_host/host2/link_power_management_policy
If you 're running a kernel older than 2.6.22 do this .
Not needed for kernels 2.6.22 onward :
cd /sys / devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq cat ondemand/sampling_rate_max > ondemand/sampling_rate
ATA drives
Hard drives and CDRom drives spinning is very costly .
To improve battery lifetime , you should reduce disks access ( or devices polling ) the more you can .
Hard Drives
The files access time update , while mandated by POSIX , is causing lots of disk write access ; even accessing files on disk cache may wake the ATA or USB bus .
If you do n't use this feature , disable it by adding the relatime option to all relevant lines in the /etc / fstab , for example :
/dev/sda1 / ext3 relatime,errors=remount-ro 0 1
( On older kernels you may need to use noatime instead of relatime . )
Also consider merely using a larger value for the commit option .
This defines how often changed data is written to the disk ( it is cached until then ) .
The default value is 5 seconds .
See man mount ( 8 ) for details on how the rel / noatime and commit options work .
Use laptop_mode to reduce disk usage by delaying and grouping writes .
You should enable it , at least while on battery .
See Laptop - mode for more details :
echo 5 > / proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode
The default kernel dirty page writeback frequency is very conservative .
On a laptop running on battery , one might find more appropriate to reduce it :
echo 1500 > / proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs
Some power saving hard drives features can be activated with hdparm ( beware that " - B 1 " may reduce your drive lifetime , if you have lot of intermittent disk activity causing lots of heads load / unloads : so reduce I / O activity first , as explained above , in order to get longer disks idling periods ) .
For more details look at How to make use of Power Management features :
hdparm -B 1 -S 12 / dev/sda # and / or any other disk device
SATA Link Power Management
On kernels 2.6.24 and new this enables SATA Link Power Management :
echo min_power >
/sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy echo min_power >
/sys/class/scsi_host/host1/link_power_management_policy echo min_power >
/sys/class/scsi_host/host2/link_power_management_policy
Disable it by replacing min_power with max_performance .
Which host - number to use depends on your laptop .
It is typically 0 for the main drive , but for example on the T61 the 0 and 1 are for the pata interface used for the optical drive , and the main hard - disk is on host2 .
On Ubuntu Hardy Heron with a 2.6.24 - 16 kernel , a suspend / resume cycle is much quicker if you disable SATA Link Power Management before initiating the suspend .
As of Intrepid Ibex and kernel 2.6.27 , this should be fixed .
( Launchpad bug 234047 , Kernel bug 10817 )
The Laptop Mode Tools utility implements many of the above power - saving measures from disks , and some others .
Optical drive
The optical drive is reported to consume power even when not accessed .
See
Eject the UltraBay optical drive , or just turn off its power supply ( i.e. , run the appropriate eject script but leave the drive inserted ) .
Reduce the spinning speed of the optical drive .
The hald daemon polling tends to maintain the ATA buses out of power saving modes , and to wakeup CDROM drive ( except if you have a kernel >= 2.6.24 , hal >= 0.5.10 , and SATA AN compatible devices ) .
If you have a recent hald version , you can stop this polling when on battery :
hal - disable - polling -- device / dev/scd0 # or whatever your CD drive is
start polling again when on ac :
hal - disable - polling -- enable - polling -- device / dev/scd0 # or whatever your CD drive is
If your hald is not recent enough , consider suspending it when running on battery .
Some moderns SATA buses and drivers supports a notification mechanism ( SATA AN - Asynchronous Events Notifications ) that obsolete the need for polling on modern hardware ; support for this feature had been merged in Linux 2.6.24-rc1 and HAL 0.5.10 .
LCD Backlight / Brightness
The LCD backlight is one of the very major power drain .
Reducing brightness to the lowest readable level will save a lot of battery lifetime .
Also , do n't forget to configure your screen saver to shutdown the screen backlight ( rather than displaying some eye candy ) , when no activity for a few minutes .
You can also let the system automatically reduce brightness after a period of inactivity .
If you 're choosing your Thinkpad laptop model , keep in mind that the screen size affect the battery time greatly : more power needed for larger screens .
The very recent , but xorg standard way to control backlight from CLI is using xbacklight .
ie . to set backlight at half the brightness :
xbacklight - set 50
You should configure the DPMS to shutdown the screen when idle ( rather than displaying a fancy but power consuming screensaver ) .
ie . to turn off the display after 5 minutes of idling :
xset +dpms xset dpms 0 0 300
Screensaver method
Alternatively , you can add a screensaver that does nothing but blank the screen and turn off the display .
In this example , I 'm using Linux Mint MATE 17.2 , please adjust the keywords below accordingly .
Also , you will need to enable DPMS as above , or as in How to make ACPI work # Screen blanking ( Standby ) .
We need to create 2 files , the first one is /usr / share / applications / screensavers/screenoff.desktop :
[ Desktop Entry ] Name =Screen off Comment =Turns the screen off Exec= / usr / lib/ mate - screensaver / screenoff TryExec= / bin/ true StartupNotify=false Terminal=false Type=Application Categories =Screensaver ; Keywords=MATE;screensaver ;dpms ; OnlyShowIn=MATE ;
The second one is / usr / lib / mate - screensaver / screenoff , which needs to be executable :
#!/bin/sh pidof mate - screensaver - preferences | grep -w $ PPID && exit 0 xset q | grep -q " Monitor is On " && xset dpms force off
The Keywords section and the mate - screensaver - preferences should be customized according to your desktop ( like Cinnamon , or GNOME , etc ) .
After creating those files , open the Screensaver preferences dialog and choose the screensaver with the name " Screen off " .
Now , when the screensaver is activated , the screen will fade to black and backlight will be turned off by DPMS .
Graphic controllers
All xorg Thinkpad graphics chipsets drivers ( ati , radeon , fglrx , i810 ) have the same bug causing very frequent CPU wakeups when DRI is activated , even when you do n't use any 3D application .
This problem is partly fixed on xorg git tree but not released as of xorg 7.2 .
If you value more battery than 3D , you should disable DRI : put this on the /etc/X11/xorg.conf " Device " of you graphic controller :
Option " NoDRI "
Also be sure that DPMS is working : grep DPMS / var/log/Xorg.0.log should output " DPMS enabled " .
If not , put Option " DPMS " in your config .
See the section above about how to enable dpms driven display power saving .
On recent xrandr / xorg versions , you can disable the TV output ( or any other detected as connected but not used outputs ) when you 're not using it : it 's known to consume power .
xrandr # see all displays listed here , but that you do n't actually use and disable them .
xrandr -- output TV -- off # for instance ( if " xrandr " above listed a connected output named " TV " that you do n't use )
When you do n't have an external monitor plugged , disable CRT and DVI output ( for some , this can make a difference in power usage ) :
echo crt_disable > / proc/acpi/ibm/video echo dvi_disable > / proc/acpi/ibm/video
Some drivers have specials power saving mode , and / or allows underclocking the GPU .
See also :
USB Subsystem
The kernel support an efficient USB 2.0 power saving feature if you enabled CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND .
This may not trigger in when you have an USB device plugged ( and beside , USB devices tends to suck power on their own ) , so avoid using such devices when on battery .
To enable it by default , you must add the line
options usbcore autosuspend=1
to your /etc/modprobe.conf or add it to ( and create if necessary ) the file /etc/ modprobe.d/ usbcore depending on how your distribution organises modprobe configuration .
If on the other hand , you have usbcore built into your kernel , you can add this in the kernel boot options ( ie. in grub 's menu.lst ) :
usbcore.autosuspend=1
or at runtime , per device , with :
for i in / sys / bus / usb / devices /*/ power / autosuspend ; do echo 1 > $ i ; done for i in / sys / bus / usb / devices /*/ power / level ; do echo auto > $ i ; done
USB 1.1 is worst .
It needs polling the bus frequently , hence can't really go in a low power mode when you enabled it , even if you do n't have any device plugged .
You 'd better remove it when you do n't use a 1.1 device :
rmmod uhci_hcd
If you do n't intend to use any device needing USB 1.1 ( unfortunately , the built - in bluetooth and fingerprint - reader are USB 1.1 devices ) , the USB 1.1 support can also be totally avoided .
On Debian and derivatives , just do :
echo " blacklist uhci_hcd " >>
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
PCMCIA / CardBus
Same for PCMCIA / CardBus .
Some users experiences interrupts clouds ( sometime up to several thousands interrupts / second ) causing CPU wakeups , thus totally preventing the CPU to reach lower C- states .
If you do n't use PCMCIA , you may disable it the same way ( unloading seems insufficient to restore the system properly , you have to boot without it ) :
echo " blacklist pcmcia " >>
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist echo " blacklist yenta_socket " >>
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
Sound
ALSA has a power saving feature that should be enabled on your kernel ( CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE ) .
Note that this low power mode wo n't trigger in unless you muted all sound inputs ( micro , line in etc . ) .
This feature has to be activated with :
amixer set Line mute nocap amixer set Mic mute nocap echo Y > /sys/module/snd_ac97_codec/parameters/power_save
Intel HD Audio
If you have Intel HD audio as your onboard sound controller , substitute the following for the last line in the above sequence :
echo Y > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save_controller
You also may wish to decrease the sound poweroff timeout to something shorter , like 1 second after last playback :
echo 1 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save
Additional Tweaks
You can unload all sound related modules when you are on battery , or mute the sound system ( echo mute > / proc/acpi/ibm/ volume ) .
See also How to enable audio codec power saving .
Wireless Interface
intel wireless
Wireless network consume a lot of power .
To save power , you can kill the Wi-Fi radio when it 's not in use :
echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/*/rf_kill
If you need Wi -Fi , you can also reduce power consumption ( at the price of performances ) by activating the power saving modes :
iwpriv eth1 set_power 5
For drivers using the new Wi -Fi kernel framework ( mac80211/cfg80211 ) , the canonical way to do this is now :
for i in /sys / bus / pci/ devices /*/ power_level ; do echo 5 > $ i ; done
Most drivers , like ipw2200 , that do n't use the new mac80211 framework place the interfaces in aggressive scanning mode when they are not associated with any Access Point , even when the interface is down ( more info about this on Intel 's LessWatts website ) .
This behavior consumes a lot of power , even more than when the interface is plain active and in use .
But this can disabled at module 's load time :
rmmod ipw2200 modprobe ipw2200 associate=0
You can fix this setting by placing the following in /etc/ modprobe.d/options ( Debian / Ubuntu ) or in /etc/modprobe.conf ( Red Hat / Fedora ) :
options ipw2200 associate=0
Reducing beacon intervals on your Access Point to 1 per second will also reduce network card interrupts , therefore power savings .
This should n't have negatives side effects .
In recent kernels , the powersaving on the intel ipw3945 has been disabled , as for some it is unstable .
For others it worked just fine .
See this patch .
You may wish to try changing '.broken_powersave=true ' to false , in /usr / src/linux / drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-3945.c if you wish to enable powersave .
See also , to activate power saving on the wireless network card :
Ethernet Controler
If you do n't use Wake - on - LAN , you should disable it for your network card , because it sucks a lot of power :
ethtool -s eth0 wol d
If you can , try to reduce useless network activity on your ethernet segment , coming to your NIC ( ie. uneeded broadcasts ) , those cause interrupts and CPU wakeups .
Forcing 100
Mbps full - duplex speed on a gigabit ethernet NIC can also save a lot of power ( ~ 1W ) on most network workloads .
This also reduces components temperature ( e.g. , thermal sensor 0xC0 on the T43 cools down by 5 degree between 1000 Mbps and 100 Mbps , and another 1 degree for 10 Mbps ) .
ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off speed 100
Note , however , that if the network device on the other side has auto - negotiation enabled ( which is very common ) and you turn auto - negotiation off , the other side will assume half - duplex mode and you will experience a significant loss of performance .
Bluetooth
When you do n't need bluetooth , disable it .
Because of its radio , bluetooth is not power friendly .
hciconfig hci0 down ; rmmod hci_usb echo disable > / proc/acpi/ibm/bluetooth
Modem
When was the last time you used your analog modem ?
If you can't remember , you probably just do n't need it .
If it is on a separate module in your laptop , simply remove it .
Store it in a ESD safe place ( like the bag in which your last addon card or hard drive was packed ) , in case you should need it again .
This wo n't save you a lot of power and weight , but why carry something around you never use .
System Fans
Fans consumes power when running , so you may look at the ACPI fan control script .
Misbehaving Userland
You should avoid using Beagle , Compiz , Beryl , XMMS , gnome - power - manager and Evolution while on battery .
Look at the PowerTOP 's known problems list .
Deactivate desktop animations ( blinking cursor on the terms , animated wallpapers , ... ) : they cause regular X ( therefore kernel and CPU ) wakeups .
In short , while on battery , you should stop all applications that do n't really stay idle when you 're not using them .
This means applications that :
Wakes up the CPU too often ( by polling something , because of too short select ( ) timeouts , ... )
Access the disks at regular intervals
Access an hardware bus ( USB , ATA , ... ) at regular intervals
To find those offenders run :
strace -p $ ( pidof yourapp ) # for all your running applications
# for all your running applications powertop
dstat -t -c -- power -- top - cpu -- top - io -- top- bio -- top- latency -- top- cputime
sysctl vm.block_dump=1 # and look at dmesg
# and look at dmesg ps aux | awk ' { print $ 10 , $ 11} ' | sort -n # will list all running softs sorted by used cpu time
Please , do n't forget to fill a bug when you find such a misbehaving software .
NOTE !
Not all software is evil , buggy or badly written .
Some produce regular activity because they have to , in order to provide their intented functionality .
Think twice before filling bugs about this .

16 Killed in Gun Rampage Germany Shocked by Teenager 's Killing Spree
Germany was in shock on Wednesday after a 17 - year - old youth killed 15 people in a shooting rampage that began at his school , where he shot dead 10 pupils and three teachers .
He later took a gun to his own head during a shootout with police .
His motive remains a mystery .
So in 2007 the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation — which stands behind corporate pensions — switched from bonds only to lots of stocks , buying in at , natch , the peak of the market .
Oops .
And this is big stuff : the Bush administration may have left us all a gratuitous loss of hundreds of billions .
Why did this happen ?
I ’m sure we ’ll find some nasty stuff , but at least part of the reason was that the Bush administration , like many conservatives , was under the spell of the following pseudo - syllogism :
1 . The stock market captures the essential spirit of capitalism .
2. Capitalism roolz !
3 . Therefore , stocks will go up .
The most influential disseminator of this fallacy is the Wall Street Journal , which as far as I can tell has cheered on every bubble since the 1920s , always dismissing the skeptics as fools and promoting the dumbest bull - market arguments available .
I do n’t have time to search for it right now , but I think there was an editorial circa 2000 saying precisely that anyone who questioned the bull market of the time was anti-capitalist .
And now the cost for that attitude is falling on you and me .
A rain barrel or two may seem like the perfect solution for watering the garden without waste and without adding to your water bill .
Before you build your rainwater harvesting system , though , you might want to make sure that it ’s legal to do so .
There are three states that say the water that falls from the sky belongs to them , not to just anyone .
Utah
Homeowners who want to use rainwater in Utah have to purchase a water right through the state , but Utah Senator Scott Jenkins wants to change all that .
He ’s planning to sponsor a bill that would allow residents to collect up to 2500 gallons of water in their home systems .
I was n’t able to find any stories about this that were more current than December .
Anyone from Utah want to give us an update on how the bill is progressing ?
As in the other two states where rainbarrels are against the law , the Utah law is rarely enforced .
Colorado
Rainbarrels are illegal in Colorado .
From the EPA handbook on rainwater harvesting :
Colorado law , for instance has assumed that all rainfall eventually reaches groundwater or surface waters and is therefore appropriated .
In the dry regions of the state , however , a study has found that the majority of rainfall on undeveloped lands is lost to evaporation and transpiration and only a small fraction actually reaches surface waters .
[ emphasis mine ]
The law is a pretty vague as far as penalties , and the state rarely enforces it .
The Colorado water laws strikes me as especially fishy , because they seem to love giving water away for free to private interests .
According to the Wall Street Journal , this includes :
oil companies , ski resorts , fire districts and breweries .
The international food conglomerate Nestlé has applied for a permit to draw water from a Colorado aquifer and sell it in plastic bottles under its Arrowhead brand .
Yet it ’s technically illegal for state residents to collect a barrel or two to water their gardens !
State Representative Marsha Looper is working on a couple of bills that would allow some folks in Colorado to harvest rainwater .
Even if both bills pass , though , most residents would still be breaking the law by setting up a simple rainbarrel .
Washington
Yes , it ’s illegal to have a large rainwater harvesting setup in the state of Washington .
It is , however , legal in Seattle .
Wait , what ?
Check it .
This is from the EPA rainwater harvesting guide :
The City of Seattle , however , obtained a citywide water - right permit to ensure the legality of water harvesting efforts .
The state ’s Department of Ecology claims the reasoning behind this is that catching the water before it hits the ground robs water rights holders .
They call it “ impairment . ”
The Department of Ecology does clarify that “ a traditional residential rain barrel ” is legal in the state of Washington , but larger cisterns require a special permit .
From what I ’ve been reading , it sounds like rainwater harvesting laws can vary by municipality in other places , too .
Is rainwater harvesting allowed where you live ?
MUSIC NEWS - Trent Reznor , leader / founder of NINE INCH NAILS ( NIN ) has never kept quiet about the music industry issues , this week ripped Ticketmaster and Live Nation ( and their proposed merger ) for what he believes is their real reason for joining together - to start offering an " auction or market - based pricing scheme " for tickets that could ultimately increase prices for consumers .
In a post on the band 's official site , Reznor questions the merits of the merger , but also questions the secondary ticket market , which he accuses Ticketmaster of profiting from .
NIN 's upcoming tour with Jane 's Addiction will certainly be one of the top draws of the summer , especially since the band plans a lengthy break from the road when this tour is done , so Reznor used the opportunity to blast ticket scalpers , who he feels are part of the problem with the concert industry .
A portion of what he says : " The venue , the promoter , the ticketing agency and often the artist camp ( artist , management and agent ) take tickets from the pool of available seats and feed them directly to the re-seller ( which from this point on will be referred to by their true name : SCALPER ) , " Reznor wrote .
" I am not saying every one of the above entities all do this , nor am I saying they do it for all shows but this is a very common practice that happens more often than not .
There is money to be made and they feel they should participate in it .
There are a number of scams they employ to pull this off which is beyond the scope of this note . "

I found myself wondering where Aiken , or The Authors Guild for that matter , had been for the last decade while we Songwriters unilaterally struggled to protect our rights against the music industry , their lawyers , the RIAA and the insatiable consumers .
I suppose Aiken and his author friends were busy working on their newest novel , of course , while listening to that new song they ripped or illegally downloaded onto their iPods .

Consider the congruence of the form :
n is a quadradic residue ( mod p ) .
What is x ?
In normal arithmetic , this is equivalent to finding the square root of a number .
In modular arithmetic , x is the modular square root of n modulo p .
Now , in the general case , this is a very difficult problem to solve .
In fact , it 's equivalent to integer factorization , because no efficient algorithm is known to find the modular square root modulo a composite number , and if the modulo is composite it has to be factored first .
But when p is prime , an efficient polynomial algorithm exists for computing x .
This is the Tonelli - Shanks algorithm .
Computing modular square roots is probably not one of those things you do daily , but I ran into it while solving a Project Euler problem .
So I 'm posting the Python implementation of the Tonelli - Shanks algorithm here .
It is based on the explanation in the paper " Square roots from 1 ; 24 , 51 , 10 to Dan Shanks " by Ezra Brown , as I found the Wikipedia algorithm hard to follow .
The code is tested , and as far as I can tell works correctly and efficiently :
A healthy diet can help Over 40 % of breast and bowel cancer cases in rich countries are preventable through diet , physical activity and weight control alone , experts say .
Simple measures like cycling to work and swapping fatty foods for fruit can make all the difference for these and many other cancers , they say .
Globally , each year there are millions of these preventable cancer cases , the World Cancer Research Fund estimates .
Its report makes recommendations for " clean living " policies .
After not smoking , it is clear that diet , physical activity and weight are the most important things people can do to reduce their cancer risk
Professor Mike Richards
National Clinical Director for Cancer According to the report , about a third of the 12 most common cancers in high - income countries and about a quarter in lower income countries could be prevented through diet , exercise and weight control .
This include cancers of the throat , lung and bowel .
See figures on cancers that could be prevented
The figures do not take into account the impact of smoking , which alone accounts for about a third of cancers .
The panel of 23 experts who compiled the report say urgent action is needed to avert a crisis , with cancer rates set to increase .
Not inevitable Professor Martin Wiseman , project director , said : " We are expecting a substantial increase in cancer rates with the ageing population , obesity rates soaring , and with people becoming less active and increasingly consuming highly processed and energy dense foods and drinks .
The good news is that this is not inevitable . "

More from BBC World Service Panel chair Professor Sir Michael Marmot said : " This report shows that by making relatively straightforward changes , we could significantly reduce the number of cancer cases around the world . "
The report says all sections of society " from governments to households " should make public health , and cancer prevention in particular , a higher priority .
Among the 48 recommendations is the advice for schools and workplaces to actively encourage physical activity and ban unhealthy food .
Governments should require widespread walking and cycling routes to encourage physical activity .
And the people who do the weekly food shopping for their family should check food labels to make sure the food they buy is healthy .
Professor Mike Richards , National Clinical Director for Cancer , said : " The evidence linking diet , physical activity , obesity and cancer has become stronger over the last decade and this report can play a part in people adopting healthier lifestyles .
" After not smoking , it is clear that diet , physical activity and weight are the most important things people can do to reduce their cancer risk . "
Major step forward Dr Francesco Branca , Head of Nutrition at the World Health Organization , called the report a major step forward in understanding how policies and actions can help prevent cancer and other chronic diseases .
He said : " The recommendations will inspire policy - makers and decision - takers to act in a way that will play an important role in the fight against cancer . "
Richard Davidson , of the charity Cancer Research UK said around 13,000 cancer cases in the UK were linked to being overweight or obese , and even more were linked to poor diet , drinking too much alcohol and not doing enough exercise .
He said : " Doing nothing could be disastrous .
" There is no magic bullet , no one single fix to the problem .
If we are to tackle the situation we need individuals , business and government to work together to encourage healthy lifestyles by promoting things like cycle lanes and food labelling . "

Two houses with discontinued construction surround an empty lot , next to a finished home , in Miami on Jan. 22 .

2005 : 2.0 %
2006 : 2.7 %
2007 : 2.8 %
2008 : 2.9 % Note : Does not include vacation homes
Source : U.S. Census Bureau
A record 1 in 9 U.S. homes are vacant , a glut created by the housing boom and subsequent collapse .
" The numbers are further documentation of the gravity of the housing problem , " says Nicolas Retsinas , head of Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies .
" This inventory is delaying any kind of housing recovery . "
The surge in empty houses , condominiums and apartments is creating a wave of problems for communities desperate to shore up property values and tax revenues that pay for services .
Vacant homes create upkeep and safety problems that ripple through neighborhoods .
" It has a contagion effect , " Retsinas says .
" A house that is vacant is often a house that is less well kept up . "
A construction frenzy began pushing the vacancy rate up in 2005 but empty homes sold quickly at that time .
" This is a different problem , " says Dowell Myers , housing demographer at the University of Southern California .
" It 's high now because of lack of demand .
Now , vacancies we see are from units that have been empty for a period of time . "
Census numbers show : • More than 14 million housing units are vacant .
That number does not include an estimated 4.8 million seasonal or vacation homes , most of which are occupied part of the year .
The combined vacancy rate of almost 15 % is higher than during previous recessions : 11 % in 1991 and 9.4 % in 1984 .
• About 3 % of owned homes are vacant .
In normal times , " maybe 1 % should be vacant , " Myers says .
•
More than 9 % of homes built since 2000 are vacant compared with about 2 % for older homes .
•
Homes priced at $ 500,000 or more are just as likely to be empty as homes that cost less than $ 100,000 .
Historically , vacant housing was more of a concern in cities that have poor neighborhoods .
Now , it has hit suburbs and new subdivisions .
" You have abandoned vacant housing in Detroit but you also have it in Henderson , Nev. , and Mesa , Ariz . ( suburbs of Las Vegas and Phoenix ) , " Retsinas says .
The stimulus bill before Congress contains $ 2 billion to help communities buy and fix foreclosed , vacant properties .
One place hit hard is Rialto , Calif. , an inland town that boomed by offering shelter from astronomical housing prices in coastal Southern California .
Property values have dropped 50 % since 2007 .
In a 40 - unit development , only four are occupied , says John Dutrey , housing program manager .
Vacant homes , he says , bring " squatters , you have maintenance issues , security issues . "

WASHINGTON -- Biometric security technology promises to secure users through a " key " that 's uniquely their own , like a fingerprint or a face .
But as it turns out , it 's not that hard for an attacker to get a hold of a biometric key .
They just need to replicate it .
No , the process does n't involve cloning or harvesting organs .
Instead , researcher Duc Nguyen demonstrated in a presentation here at the Black Hat security conference that all it takes is a photo to defeat biometric face - recognition technology found on notebooks from Asus , Lenovo and Toshiba .
Nguyen 's findings come as enterprises and hardware vendors are seeking methods other than simple passwords to provide secure login information .
Biometric locks are often seen as being more secure and more convenient .
That 's partly because their keys are thought to be difficult for a third party to acquire or fake , and because they avoid relying on passwords , which users often keep trivially simple to ensure they 're not forgotten .
But Nguyen 's findings could call into question how secure facial recognition technology actually is in its current state .
" All the face recognition techniques on all three laptops can be broken with a photo , " Nguyen said during his talk .
" I still do n't believe it . "
Though Asus , Lenovo and Toshiba each have their own unique algorithms , the basic mechanism for creating a legitimate biometric login is the same for all three : A user sits in front of their notebook while its built - in Webcam scans their face to create an image used for future identification .
Despite different names and approaches -- Lenovo 's technology is named VeriFace , while Asus calls its solution Smart Logon and Toshiba 's simply goes by Face Recognition -- Nguyen claimed that all three technologies had flaws that can enable an attacker to gain access .
He showed off the technique on an Asus laptop , demonstrating that a randomly selected audience member could successfully defeat the machine 's security using just a color copy image of the owner 's face .
" It means that this laptop is broken , " Nguyen said .
" We found that the algorithm for face recognition has a weakness , and based on that , a bad guy can create a fake face recognition login . "
Nguyen added that while the Asus notebook enables its user to define the level of security for face recognition , he was able to defeat the technology at all security settings .
Bypassing biometric security with ease
Making matters worse is the straightforwardness by which an attacker could gain access to the machines , Nguyen said .
He claimed that a hacker could use either a picture of the user or simply rely on a brute - force attack , in which he or she tests different facial elements in a composite image .
But brute force might not even be necessary , considering how simple it is to find a user 's picture .
Nguyen pointed to sources like Flickr and Facebook , as well as images captured during video chat on services like Skype or MSN , Yahoo and AOL instant messengers .
During his presentation , Nguyen demonstrated how he could produce an image capable of defeating face - recognition technologies by capturing a user 's picture from a Skype video chat .
The researcher also successfully demonstrated failures in the notebooks ' security using both high - and low - quality images , at various sizes and in both grayscale and full color .
With the Lenovo notebook , Nguyen demonstrated that he had to move the photo around in front of the Webcam to mimic a real human 's movements .
The Toshiba required similar motion , while the Asus laptop did not require any motion .
That 's in spite of the fact that at least one of the vendor 's approaches to facial recognition is designed to avoid being fooled by images .
" The technology looks for eye movement to distinguish between a still photograph and a real person , " Kristy Fair , a spokesperson with Lenovo , told InternetNews.com in an e-mail .

The Discovery of Machu Picchu
Source : here
The discovery of Machu Picchu was actually the unintentional consequence of the search for Vilcabamba – a town established by the rebellious Inca Manco Capac II after Peru was invaded by the Spanish .
From this town , the remaining Incas would attack the Spanish settlers in Cusco for the following 36 years .
But in 1572 , the Spanish invaded the troublesome settlement , and executed Manco Capac ’s successor ending the Incan dynasty .
The location of this legendary settlement was forgotten – living on only in a few vague maps and clues left by future generations .
In 1909 , 337 years after the last of the Incas was killed , Doctor Hiram Bingham from Yale University visited Peru and became fascinated by the legendary settlement and vowed to return in search of it .
In 1911 , he returned with seven others sponsored by Yale University and the National Geographic Society .
In July , Bingham and his team set off on their explorative Inca trail trek and very quickly stumbled upon a settlement that they christened Patallacta ( and sometimes called Llactapata ) .
A week into the expedition , Bingham and his team camped at Mandorpampa ( now Aguas Calientes ) and spoke to the owner of a local hacienda , Melchor Artega .
He told the group of some fine ruins up in the mountains , and agreed to accompany Bingham the next day .
When Artega and Bingham reached the top of the mountain ( the others passed on the trip due to heavy rain ! ) , they were amazed to be met by two locals evading the police and taxes , Toribio Richarte and Anacleto Alvarez , who led them to the ancient site .
The discovery of Machu Picchu left Bingham “ truly breathless ” according to his book , but he wrongly inferred that the site was the legendary settlement of Vilcabamba that he had previously set off in search of !
The following year , Bingham returned to the site to begin clearing the ruins of overgrowth and vegetation , and three years later the site stood as it does today .
A railway link was constructed in 1928 and roads to the ruins were finised in 1948 .
It eventually reached World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983 .
Years before this , in 1964 , Bingham ’s mistake had been discovered – this was not the ruins of Vilcabamba which were discovered some 5 kilometres further along by Gene Savoy .
Ironically , Bingham had actually passed through the site in his original 1909 visit but considered the ruins unimportant !
What Was Machu Picchu and Why Was It Abandoned ?
There are several theories about what Machu Picchu symbolised , now that most people agree it is n’t Vilcabamba as Bingham theorised .
These all centre around the archeological belief that Machu Picchu was abandoned before the Spanish arrived ( how else would it have avoided being destroyed by them ? )
– It was the ceremonial centre of a large region and possibly the ‘ royal estate ’ for the Inca Pachacutec and his family clan .
Its sacred position ( in Incan terms ) between mountains and rivers lends credence to this .
This would mean that for many a trip along the Inca trail to Machu Picchu would have been a religious pilgrimage !
– It was a look out point guarding the road to Cusco from the Amazon Basin
– It was used to protect the source of coca used in every part of Incan religion
– It was the last refuge of Cusco ’s Virgins of the Sun ( Incan nuns )
– It was the location where the first Incan , Manco Capac , emerged from a sacred cave .
Obviously it can’t have been all of these , but it ’s interesting that it causes such debate to this day .
And why was it abandoned ?
Some say the death of Pachacutec will have caused a new royal estate to be built for the next leader ; others say that the water supply simply dried up .
Whatever you believe , an Inca trail trek remains an unbeatable cultural experience and one that should be on every traveller ’s checklist .
If you have n’t followed the Inca trail to Machu Picchu yet , you should consider visiting and discovering the secrets of the Incas for yourself .

Ladies and gentlemen , So Good is pleased to announce the premiere of “ So Good Presents : Meat Madness . ”
In this tournament style , 32 meat face - off , So Good readers will vote on what is the greatest meat over the next 25 days .
Â Â The bracket of all 32 contenders appears below . Â
We have 4 regions .
The “ Red ” Meat Region , the Poultry Region , the Pork Region and the Seafood Region .
( Click on bracket to see a larger , easier to read version )
There are no rules and no criteria other than to answer the question : “ What is the # 1 meat ? ”
You can base your vote on taste , cost , convenience , prestige , flavor …anything you want .
Â
Just like the NCAA tournament , when a team from the East coast will randomly get sent into the Western bracket , there are a couple minor exceptions with our regions .
Â
For example , Rabbit has been placed in the Poultry Region and the “ Red ” Meat Region contains a few reddish meats that technically are n’t actually red meat ( Lamb , Veal , Venison ) .
Obviously March is the time of year when people do brackets for everything – and So Good is no exception .
I do n’t know if something like Meat Madness has been done before , but this is certainly the debut offering of such a tournament on So Good .
Â
There are similar brackets going on right now , such as Washingtonian ’s Burger Bracket to determine the best burger in DC .
On Wednesday we will begin voting on our first round match - ups .
Two first round match - ups a day for 8 days , then we move on to the second round .
Â
Finally , thanks must be given to one of my readers , Jenelle , who suggested this idea to me 4 - 5 months ago .
Â
I ’ve patiently been sitting on the idea until the NCAA tournament arrived ( which was really tough because I LOVE the idea ofÂ a Meat Madness bracket ! ) .
Click “ Read More ” to see each Region up close and read a little analysis of some of the early match - ups we have to look forward to .
We have four regions , “ Red ” Meat Region , Poultry Region , Pork Region and Seafood Region .
Let ’s take a look at each one .
First up , the “ Red ” Meat region .
Â Steak ( 1 ) , Lamb ( 2 ) , Ground Beef ( 3 ) and Veal ( 4 ) are the top 4 seeds in this bracket , and I think there is no doubt that Steak and Ground Beef are forces to be reckoned with .
Â Will Lamb be able to protect its # 2 seed ?
Or will Corned Beef present a threat in the midst of Lent ?
Â Veal and Buffalo could be an interesting first round match - up as well .
The Poultry region presents us with a wide - range of tasty birds – plus Rabbit .
Â
The top four seeds are Chicken ( 1 ) , Turkey ( 2 ) , Duck ( 3 ) and Rabbit ( 4 ) . Â
Will the more widely used and readily available Chicken and Turkey prove impossible to stop ?
Or will advocates emerge for more tasty alternatives ?
The Pork Region sees a bevy of 8 different meats all coming from the same animal .
Â
The top 4 seeds are Bacon ( 1 ) , Sausage ( 2 ) , Prosciutto ( 3 ) and Ham ( 4 ) . Â
Yes , I am aware that Prosciutto IS Ham , but we are going by the English definition here .
Â According to Wikipedia , “ in English the word is almost always used for an aged , dry- cured , spiced Italian ham that is usually sliced thin and served uncooked .
” Â Bacon has proven to be the darling of the food blogosphere in the past year , but this bracket is stacked from top to bottom .
Potential upsets abound with extremely strong lower seeds in Pulled Pork ( 5 ) , Pepperoni ( 6 ) and Ribs ( 7 ) .
The Seafood Region is just that – seafood .
Â
The top 4 seeds are Lobster ( 1 ) , Scallops ( 2 ) , Salmon ( 3 ) and Tuna ( 4 ) . Â
Like the Pork Region , this region has depth – Crab ( 6 ) and Shrimp ( 5 ) look like potential first round sleepers , and Clams ( 8 ) and Mussels ( 7 ) both certainly have their supporters .
Voting on first round match - ups will begin on Wednesday .
Â
Use the comments on this post to predict potential first round upsets , your pick to win the title , or any debates over seeding .

Let the Meat Madness begin !
System : Atari Lynx
Title : Qix

Intro
Let me start with a confession .
Qix is one of my all time favorite games .
You might be asking , what 's the deal with that game anyway , it 's all about drawing some lines and making shapes .
Yet the simplicity of it , and at the same time the challenge it offers , is what has always drawn me to it .
This is the review of the Atari Lynx port , one of the earlier ports to a handheld platform .
And so , it is with much pleasure that I bring you this review .
Story
I read the manual that came with the game , and could not find a story .
The back of the box reveals that there 's Qix and its mutant offspring Sparx and you have to claim their territory before they frag you .
Gameplay
If you are not familiar with this game , think of Etch a Sketch .
That 's right , Etch a Sketch .
All you have to do in QIX is basically draw shapes on the screen .
But , there are those who wish to deny you the right to drawing these shapes .
Those who seek to trap and electrocute you .
Let 's meet the cast of Qix , an interesting group of fellas .
First , we have YOU .
You do n't have a name , you 're just this small , diamond shaped icon .
Next , we have the notorious QIX .
Qix is a spinning helix , moving erratically around the game field .
Next , we have some SPARX who wander about the play area .
And last but not least , we have the FUSE that follows you if you decide to take a break while drawing a shape .
When the game starts , you have an empty field consisting of a rectangular area .
Your goal is to draw boxes in the play area , thus claiming your territory and trapping the Qix .
The Qix moves about erratically from one place to another .
When you draw a box , the side in which the Qix is not in gets colored , which means you have claimed it .
However , if , while drawing the box , the Qix touches the line you are drawing ( Called the Stix ) , your icon is destroyed and you lose a life .
But that 's not all .
Sparx wander about the play area , along the edges and later also follow you along the Stix you have drawn .
If any of the Sparx touch you , then you 're also destroyed .
And , if that 's not enough , there is the Fuse .
When you are drawing your Stix , do not stop to hesitate , not even for a moment .
For if you do , the Fuse will ignite and close on you , following the line you have drawn .
And if it catches you , then , guess what ?
As you survive all these traps and claim most of the territory , you advance to more difficult levels , which require a larger percentage of territory to conquer and have more intelligent Sparx , deadlier Fuses , and even a second Qix !
Game is very fun , very addictive .
Each time you play it , it is different .
According to the manual , there are over 1 billion patterns to be made !
Multiplayer
There 's a 2 player mode , but it just consists of taking turns playing the game .
Controls
Controls are straightforward .
The directional keys move your marker around .
Pressing the A or B button allows you to start drawing a Stix .
If you release the button after starting to draw , you will draw the Stix faster .
If , on the other hand , you keep on holding the button , you will draw more slowly , but receive more points .
Still , the Atari Lynx buttons make this game harder to control compared to the console or arcade counterparts , requiring keypresses to be a lot more precise .
This sometimes made it harder for me to go to where I actually wanted to go , or even jam on the occasion , and this helped the Qix , Sparx and / or Fuse catch up on me .
Graphics
This is a faithful adaptation of the Qix from the big console .
The graphics use all the advance graphic capabilities of the Atari Lynx .
Sound Effects & Music
Music and sound effects are very cool .
Authentic old school music and sound effects .
The noise from the Sparx , Qix and Fuse all make the atmosphere very electric .
Obscurity
It 's a classic game .
Asking around though , I was surprised that not that many have heard of it .
This has got to change .
I handed over the Lynx to my friend who has never heard of this game before , and he immediately got hooked .
After a few hours I had to pry my Lynx back out of his fingers .
So go pick up this game and play it !
Summary / Author ’s Take
Game is very fun , challenging and addictive .
Has a high playability value .
Each game you play will be different .
It 's hard to describe the feeling of suspense as you start drawing your Stix .
Will the Qix behave and stay in a predictable pattern , or will it , in a blink of an eye , storm over from all the way across the playing field and hit your line ?
And it is even harder to put to words the feeling of satisfaction when you manage to trap the Qix in a tiny box , thus filling up and claiming all the rest of the playing field in one go !
The Atari Lynx port of Qix is a faithful adaptation including with all the features from the console and arcade versions .
Controls are not that smooth compared to its console and arcade brothers , but you can accept that as part of the challenge .
The handheld version makes it great to play whenever you are on the go .
Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated 40 years ago this month at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles .
Sirhan B. Sirhan , a 24 year old immigrant , is the alleged lone gunman and is presently serving a life sentence .
In a new book , An Open and Shut Case , Dr. Robert Joling and Philip Van Praag have joined a growing list of people who dont believe that Sirhan acted alone .
Joling and Van Praag , both forensic scientists , claim that after analyzing audio recordings of the assassination they have concluded that at least 13 shots were fired .
The handgun Sirhan used only had the capacity to fire eight shots .
They believe that there were two guns and that the fatal shot came from behind Robert Kennedy , while witnesses claim that Sirhan was in front of Kennedy .
According to a March 27 , 2008 ABC report by Pierre Thomas , Joling claims ,  It can be established conclusively that Sirhan did not shoot Senator Kennedy .
And in fact not only did he not do it , he could not have done it . 
Los Angeles Coroner Thomas Noguchi conducted the official autopsy on the body of Robert Francis Kennedy on the morning of June 6 , 1968 .
Noguchi stated that the shot that killed RFK had entered through the mastoid bone , an inch behind the right ear and had traveled upward to sever the branches of the superior cerebral artery . 

Hundreds of thousands of years ago , giant versions of Australia 's unique wildlife stalked the continent .
There were kangaroos up to 3 m tall and enormous wallabies , wombats and echidnas .
There were also koalas : larger and weightier than the creatures sometimes seen today in eucalyptus trees .
Giant koalas died out about 50,000 years ago , along with most of Australia 's " megafauna " .
For a long time , modern koalas were assumed to be dwarf descendants of those prehistoric animals .
But now an Australian palaeontologist has established that the two koalas lived side by side – a finding that may throw new light on why the megafauna disappeared .
Gilbert Price , of the University of Queensland , used improved dating techniques to analyse fossils of both types of koala , and found that the two species co-existed in Australian trees for hundreds of thousands of years .
He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation : " The big question is why one koala species survived past 50,000 years ago and the other did n't make it . "

The causes of the Australian megafauna 's extinction have been hotly debated by scientists for decades .
Some attribute it to climate - induced changes in habitat and food supply , while others blame the hunting by humans of larger animals .
The " dwarfing " hypothesis , based on similarities between extinct megafauna and smaller , modern animals , has been used to support both arguments .
But Dr Price 's conclusions , published in the Quaternary Science Reviews journal , cast doubt on the hypothesis .
As well as reigniting debate , his research may help conservationists to save the modern koala .
While not officially endangered , koalas are at risk through loss of habitat , while increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are reducing nutrients in eucalyptus leaves , their sole food source .
Dr Price , from the university 's Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis , said : " It 's fascinating that up until fairly recently , in geological terms , we did have two types of koala kicking around .
The fossil records do suggest that they lived in the same place at the same time .
Perhaps there is something about their sizes that allowed them to fill a slightly different ecological niche . "
While modern koalas weigh about 10kg , the giant species – the largest tree - dwelling marsupial that ever lived – was two to three times heavier .
According to Dr Price , there were clear differences in their appearances .
He said his study left questions unanswered about the koala 's evolution .
" The results raise the question : where on earth did the modern koala come from ? " he said , adding that a lack of well - dated fossil records make it difficult to establish its true ancestor .
As to why one species survived and the other did not , Dr Price said : " It 's absolutely critical that we can find the answers to such questions , and that we find them soon , as it will go a long way in the planning of management strategies to conserve the modern koala well into the future . "
In a stinging attack , she warned it was using the spectre of terrorism to frighten Britons into accepting greater state powers .
And she said policy - makers were doing exactly what terrorists wanted by clamping down on individual freedoms .
Dame Stella became the first woman director general of MI5 in 1992 , holding the post until her retirement in 1996 , and the first whose appointment was made public .
She said : “ Since I have retired I feel more at liberty to be against certain decisions of the Government , especially the attempt to pass laws which interfere with people ’s privacy .
“ It would be better that the Government recognised that there are risks , rather than frightening people in order to be able to pass laws which restrict civil liberties , precisely one of the objects of terrorism : that we live in fear and under a police state . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Shattered victims of Bernard Madoff said that watching the criminal financier go to prison in handcuffs on Thursday brought only a fleeting sense of satisfaction that scarcely changed their feelings of bitterness and betrayal .
Madoff , who pleaded guilty to fraud and other criminal charges in Manhattan federal court , left thousands of victims robbed of their life savings .
Worried about their future and wondering how Madoff managed to pull off the largest financial fraud in Wall Street history , several victims emerged from the U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Manhattan voicing their fears and frustrations .
“ It ’s a Pyrrhic , bittersweet victory , ” said Miriam Siegman , 65 , of New York City , who raised a clenched fist as Madoff ’s court appearance ended .
A retired consultant , she said she had lost her life savings to Madoff ’s fraudulent investments and now receives food stamps .
“ I have no one to help me .
That he ’s in jail does n’t change that , ” she said .
“ I still have the rest of my life to live , or try to live , in incredible stress and in total poverty .
He took everything . ”
Outside the courthouse , Madoff ’s victims were met by reporters and photographers from around the world , anxious to hear what they felt when they saw Madoff , some for the first time since his arrest in December , others for the first time ever .
Many who invested with Madoff had never met him .
“ I wanted him to see some of the faces of those whose lives he destroyed , not that it would have made any difference , ” said Cynthia Friedman , 59 , of Jericho , New York .
She and her husband said they lost $ 3 million to Madoff .
Burt Ross , 65 , of Englewood , New Jersey , said he considers himself a survivor and not a victim of Madoff ’s scheme after losing $ 5 million .
Trying to describe how he still wakes up each morning to see his wife beside him , Ross ’ voice broke and he paused for several seconds to blink back tears and regain his composure .
“ The things that matter , I have , and he ca n’t take them away , ” Ross said .
Brad Friedman , an attorney representing about a hundred of Madoff ’s victims , said his clients were seeking to recover at least some of their money from members of Madoff ’s family .
“ We ’re going to go after them .
This is not over by a long shot , ” he said .

Advertisement Authorities have been increasing their efforts to crack down on pirate radio stations in the UK .
Regulator Ofcom says the broadcasts can put lives at risk by interfering with emergency service frequencies , and can also block legitimate stations .
Police officers raided an address in north London which , they say , housed an illegal radio station .
Five people were arrested and officers seized thousands of pounds worth of broadcasting and musical equipment .
Ofcom says there are more than 150 pirate radio stations operating across the UK , half of which operate in London and the South East of England .
Last year , officers raided 43 studios used by illegal stations and shut down 838 illegal transmitters .
Pirates ' point of view Ofcom 's head of investigations , Paul Mercer , told BBC News that pirate radio was not a victimless crime .
" Ofcom receive complaints from the emergency services .
The two services that are most affected are the National Air Traffic services and the London Fire Brigade .
" In both instances , because of the proximity of the frequencies used by those services and the illegal broadcasters , they can suffer some difficulties when trying to use their radio systems to communicate . "
However , one pirate radio DJ told the BBC that while pirate stations may have interfered with the emergency services in the past , it was now a rare occurrence .
Steve , who manages the pirate radio station Ice Cold FM , said : " Problems can occur if people use a badly built link box that connects the studio to the transmitter .
" These systems , called Band 1 , can put out multiples of their frequency , so a link on 50 Mhz could spill out onto 100 Mhz and other high band frequencies .
" I would say 90 % of pirates do n't use Band 1 links any more .
We all use microwave links that are completely interference free , " he said .
He added : " I 'm not saying there are n't exceptions , but we check all our stuff to make sure it 's clean and on the band . "
Ofcom says that there are other avenues open for legal broadcasting , such as setting up a community radio station .

Advertisement The Department for Culture , Media and Sport has provided money for the Community Radio Fund , managed by Ofcom , which so far has awarded £ 215,900 to 15 applicants .
But Steve from Ice Cold FM said that it was difficult to win a community radio station licence .
" I wanted to go legal .
We tried to get a community based licence and even went off air for a while .
" But once we looked into it , they wanted us to show that we had £ 25,000 in sponsorship to prove that we could establish the business for a length of time , which is far more than we would actually need .
" Even to apply costs money and Ofcom can still say no , so it 's just not worth the effort . "

Obama order seeks to undo Bush signing statements Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday March 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Gibbs : White House will not disallow laws ' by executive fiat '
President Obama has directed federal agencies to initiate reviews for all of former President George W. Bush 's signing statements .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , in a sideways jab at Bush , said that President Obama will not attempt to invalidate laws with signing statements as President Bush did .
Instead , Obama will use signing statements as they were used prior to President Bush .
The President will " not ask that laws be disallowed simply by executive fiat , " he said during a Monday press conference .
" When signing legislation , Bush often would use such statements to direct officials to ignore parts of the law he thought were incorrect or restricted the administration 's constitutional powers , " said the Associated Press .
President Bush 's application of signing statements doubled all the statements of all the prior American presidents , combined .
He was roundly criticized for effectively ignoring congressional statutes , coming under fire from at least one former president , federal agencies , watchdog groups , members of his own party , political pundits and the American Bar Association , which called the practice as used by Bush , " contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers . "
" But Mr. Obama also signaled that he intends to use signing statements himself if Congress sends him legislation that has provisions he decides are unconstitutional , " reported the New York Times .
" He pledged to use a modest approach when doing so , but said there was a role for the practice if used appropriately . "
 In exercising my responsibility to determine whether a provision of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional , I will act with caution and restraint , based only on interpretations of the Constitution that are well - founded ,  wrote Obama in a memo obtained by the Times .
" Obviously , signing statements had been in existence for two centuries in order for presidents to make known constitutional problems with ideas that are in legislation , without necessarily dealing a veto to the entire piece of legislation , " said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs .
President Obama 's full memo was published on the Internet ( PDF link ) shortly after Gibbs ' press conference .

Have you heard the story about LaVena Johnson ?
LaVena Johnson , a high school honor student , decided to enlist in the Army to pay for college .
On July 19 , 2005 , after serving eight weeks in Iraq , she was killed , eight days short of her 20th birthday .
Pvt. Johnson -- she was posthumously promoted to private first class -- was found dead on a military base in Balad , Iraq , in a tent belonging to military contractor KBR , a spinoff and former subsidiary of Halliburton , Dick Cheney 's company .
She was the first woman from Missouri to be killed in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The U.S. Army officially ruled her death a suicide , saying she shot herself in the head , case closed .
But this is where the story begins .
Johnson 's family knew something was wrong .
They had talked to her on the phone a few days earlier , and she was in a great mood as usual , and was planning to come home for the holidays , earlier than expected .
Questions were raised when Johnson 's family viewed her body .
There were suspicious bruises , and while the military claimed that this right - handed soldier had shot herself in the head with an M - 16 rifle , the gunshot wound was on the left side of her head .
But the truth began to make itself known when the family received the autopsy report and photos they had requested under the Freedom of Information Act :
The 5 - foot tall , 100 - pound woman had been struck in the face with a blunt instrument , probably a weapon .
Her nose had been broken , and her teeth knocked back .
There were bruises , teeth marks and scratches on the upper part of her body .
Her back and right hand had been doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire .
Her genital area was bruised and lacerated , and lye had been poured into her vagina .
The debris found on her suggested her body had been dragged .
And despite all this mutilation , she was fully clothed when her body was found in the tent , with a blood trail leading to the tent .
Despite the overwhelming evidence , the Army has refused to investigate .
Through an online petition , ColorofChange.org demanded an investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ..
Johnson 's story is really several stories in one , and is about more than an individual Black woman who was raped and killed by her fellow soldiers .
African Americans have fought in every war since the Revolutionary War , and often their country has been a far more formidable foe to them than the so - called enemy they were told to fight .
Often , youth of color , lacking opportunities at home and in need of money , look to the military as a career option and a way to pay for school .
But in light of all the death and destruction of the unjust and immoral war in Iraq , fewer of them took the bait this time , and opposition to the war among Black youth has posed a challenge for Army recruiters .
Perhaps these young people were channeling war resisters of a prior generation , such as Muhammad Ali , who once said , " I ai n't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong . ...
They never called me n-word . "
That war was devastating to poor communities of all races , and the black community in particular , as their young men came home in the thousands in body bags , or maimed , traumatized , as dope fiends or completely insane .

( CNN ) --
The world is facing an increasing risk of " irreversible " climate shifts because worst - case scenarios warned of two years ago are being realized , an international panel of scientists has warned .
Drought , flooding , storms and mass extinction in the future will have a heavy social cost as well .
Temperatures , sea levels , acid levels in oceans and ice sheets were already moving " beyond the patterns of natural variability within which our society and economy have developed and thrived , " scientists said in a report released Thursday .
The findings came at the end of a three - day conference in Copenhagen , Denmark , where nearly 2,000 researchers gathered to discuss climate change .
The group called on policy - makers to use all tools available to reduce dangerous emissions of greenhouse gases .
The current climate situation on the planet may be as severe as the worst - case scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which issued warnings in 2007 of a future beset by flooding , drought , storms and mass extinction of species .
In its report , the researchers also warned of potential social costs across the planet because of climate change .
Temperature rises above 2 degrees Celsius would lead to climate disruption for the rest of the century and disproportionately affect poor nations , the researchers warned .
" Recent observations show that societies are highly vulnerable to even modest levels of climate change , with poor nations and communities particularly at risk , " the report said .
The conclusions of the conference will be presented to politicians when they meet in Copenhagen in December .
It is then that leaders will discuss a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emission levels to replace the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
The Servants of the Paraclete complex in Jemez Springs , N.M. , in 1993 ( Jeffrey D. Scott )
As early as the mid-1950s , decades before the clergy sexual - abuse crisis broke publicly across the U.S. Catholic landscape , the founder of a religious order that dealt regularly with priest sex abusers was so convinced of their inability to change that he searched for an island to purchase with the intent of using it as a place to isolate such offenders , according to documents recently obtained by NCR .
Fr. Gerald Fitzgerald , founder of the Servants of the Paracletes , an order established in 1947 to deal with problem priests , wrote regularly to bishops in the United States and to Vatican officials , including the pope , of his opinion that many sexual abusers in the priesthood should be laicized immediately .
Fitzgerald was a prolific correspondent who wrote regularly of his frustration with and disdain for priests " who have seduced or attempted to seduce little boys or girls . "
His views are contained in letters and other correspondence that had previously been under court seal and were made available to NCR by a California law firm in February .
Read copies of letters Fitzgerald exchanged with U.S. bishops and one pope .
Listen to Tom Roberts discuss this story on the April 1 edition of " Here & Now , " a National Public Radio news program from WBUR in Boston .
( Scroll down the page to just before the photo of the waxy monkey frogs . )
Fitzgerald 's convictions appear to significantly contradict the claims of contemporary bishops that the hierarchy was unaware until recent years of the danger in shuffling priests from one parish to another and in concealing the priests ' problems from those they served .
It is clear , too , in letters between Fitzgerald and a range of bishops , among bishops themselves , and between Fitzgerald and the Vatican , that the hierarchy was aware of the problem and its implications well before the problem surfaced as a national story in the mid-1980s .
Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Los Angeles archdiocese , reacting in February to a federal investigation into his handling of the crisis , said : " We have said repeatedly that ... our understanding of this problem and the way it 's dealt with today evolved , and that in those years ago , decades ago , people did n't realize how serious this was , and so , rather than pulling people out of ministry directly and fully , they were moved . "
Indeed , some psychology experts seemed to hold the position that priest offenders could be returned to ministry .
Even the Paracletes , as the order developed and grew , employed experts who said that certain men could be returned to ministry under stringent conditions and with strict supervision .
The order itself ultimately was so inundated with lawsuits regarding priests who molested children while or after being treated at its facility in Jemez Springs , N.M. , that it closed the facility in 1995 .
Whatever discussion occurred during the 1970s and 1980s over proper treatment , however , for nearly two decades Fitzgerald spoke a rather consistent conviction about the dim prospects for returning sex abusers to ministry .
Fitzgerald seemed to know almost from the start the danger such priests posed .
He was adamant in his conviction that priests who sexually abused children ( often the language of that era was more circumspect in naming the problem ) should not be returned to ministry .

In a 1957 letter to an unnamed archbishop , Fitzgerald said , " These men , Your Excellency , are devils and the wrath of God is upon them and if I were a bishop I would tremble when I failed to report them to Rome for involuntary layization [ sic ] . "
The letter , addressed to " Most dear Cofounder , " was apparently to Archbishop Edwin V. Byrne of Santa Fe , N.M. , who was considered a cofounder of the Paraclete facility at Jemez Springs and a good friend of Fitzgerald .
Later in the same letter , in language that revealed deep passion , he wrote : " It is for this class of rattlesnake I have always wished the island retreat -- but even an island is too good for these vipers of whom the Gentle Master said it were better they had not been born -- this is an indirect way of saying damned , is it not ? "
The documents were sealed at the request of the church in an earlier civil case involving Fr. Rudolph Kos of Dallas .
Eleven plaintiffs won awards in the case in which Kos was accused of molesting minors over a 12 - year period .
He had been treated at the Paraclete facility in New Mexico .
The documents were unsealed in 2007 by a court order obtained by the Beverly Hills law firm of Kiesel , Boucher & Larson , according to Anthony DeMarco , an attorney with the firm that has handled hundreds of cases for alleged victims of sexual abuse in the Los Angeles archdiocese and elsewhere .
According to Helen Zukin , another member of the firm , the documents have been used in some cases to dispute the church claim that it knew nothing about the behavior of sex abusers or the warning signs of abuse prior to the 1980s .
In a September 1952 letter to the then - bishop of Reno , Nev. , Fitzgerald wrote : " I myself would be inclined to favor laicization for any priest , upon objective evidence , for tampering with the virtue of the young , my argument being , from this point onward the charity to the Mystical Body should take precedence over charity to the individual and when a man has so far fallen away from the purpose of the priesthood the very best that should be offered him is his Mass in the seclusion of a monastery .
Moreover , in practice , real conversions will be found to be extremely rare .
...
Hence , leaving them on duty or wandering from diocese to diocese is contributing to scandal or at least to the approximate danger of scandal . "
The advice was ignored and the priest was allowed to continue in ministry , and was ultimately accused of abusing numerous children , for which the church paid out huge sums in court awards .
While Fitzgerald told anyone who would listen of the futility of returning sexually abusive priests to ministry , that conviction became less absolute as the order , today headquartered in St. Louis , grew and the scope of its work became more complex .
Fitzgerald , by most accounts , was deeply motivated by a sense of obligation to care for priests who were in trouble .
Originally a priest of the Boston archdiocese for 12 years , he became a member of the Congregation of the Holy Cross in 1934 , and started the Servants of the Paraclete in 1947 .
His concern at the time was primarily for priests struggling with alcoholism .
As his new order matured and its ministry became known , bishops began referring priests with other maladies , particularly those who had been sexually abusive of children .
The order for years was the primary source for care of priests in the United States with alcohol and sexual problems .
At times , Fitzgerald appears to have resisted taking in priests who had sexually abused youngsters .
In his 1957 letter he requested concurrence from the cofounder archbishop " of what I consider a very vital decision on our part -- that for the sake of preventing scandal that might endanger the good name of Via Coeli [ the name of the New Mexico facility ] we will not offer hospitality to men who have seduced or attempted to seduce " children .
" Experience has taught us these men are too dangerous to the children of the parish and neighborhood for us to be justified in receiving them here . "
In September 1957 the bishop of Manchester , N.H. , Matthew F. Brady , sought Fitzgerald 's advice regarding " a problem priest , " John T. Sullivan , who seemed sincerely repentant and whose difficulty " is not drink but a series of scandal - causing escapades with young girls .
There is no section of the diocese in which he is not known and no pastor seems willing to accept him , " Brady wrote .
The " escapades " involved molestation of young girls .
In at least one instance , he procured an abortion for a teenager he had impregnated .
In another case , he fathered a child and provided support to the mother until she later married .
The charges of molesting girls would follow him the rest of his life .
" The solution of his problem seems to be a fresh start in some diocese where he is not known .
It occurred to me that you might know of some bishop who would be willing to give him that opportunity , " Brady wrote in his original letter .
Fitzgerald responded that in his judgment the " repentance and amendment " in such cases " is superficial and , if not formally at least subconsciously , is motivated by a desire to be again in a position where they can continue their wonted activity .
A new diocese means only green pastures . "
Fitzgerald added that the Paracletes had " adopted a definite policy not to recommend to bishops men of this character , even presuming the sincerity of their conversion .
We feel that the protection of our glorious priesthood will demand , in time , the establishment of a uniform code of discipline and of penalties . "
He acknowledged the degree of deference with which Catholic clergy were treated even by civil authorities .
" We are amazed to find how often a man who would be behind bars if he were not a priest is entrusted with the cura animarum [ the care of souls ] , " he wrote .
Sullivan apparently had already been pulled from active ministry .
In October 1957 , less than a month after contacting Fitzgerald , Brady wrote a response to the bishop of Burlington , Vt. , among the first of more than a dozen bishops approached by Sullivan for the next five years , warning against accepting him .
Brady then wrote a letter that he sent out time after time to bishops inquiring about Sullivan after he had requested acceptance for ministry .
" My conscience will not allow me to recommend him to any bishop and I feel that every inquiring bishop should know some of the circumstances that range from parenthood , through violation of the Mann Act , attempted suicide , and abortion .
" Father Fitzgerald of Via Coeli would accept him only as a permanent guest to help save his soul but with no hope of recommending him to a bishop . "
According to a 2003 Washington
Post story , Sullivan , who had bounced around from diocese to diocese for nearly 30 years , " was stripped of his faculties to serve as a priest after he kissed a 13 - year - old girl in Laconia , N.H. , in 1983 , when he was 66 .
He died in 1999 , never having faced a criminal charge . "
After his death the church paid out more than a half - million dollars in awards to Sullivan 's victims , including three in Grand Rapids , Mich . , and one in Amarillo , Texas , two dioceses that did not heed the warnings of the bishops in New Hampshire .
The victims said they were abused when they were between 7 and 12 years old .
In April 1962 , Fitzgerald wrote a five - page response to a query from the Vatican 's Congregation of the Holy Office about " the tremendous problem presented by the priest who through lack of priestly self - discipline has become a problem to Mother Church . "
One of his recommendations was for " a more distinct teaching in the last years of the seminary of the heavy penalty involved in tampering with the innocence ( or even non-innocence ) of little ones . "
Regarding priests who have " fallen into repeated sins ... and most especially the abuse of children , we feel strongly that such unfortunate priests should be given the alternative of a retired life within the protection of monastery walls or complete laicization . "
In August of the following year , he met with newly elected Pope Paul VI to inform him about his work and problems he perceived in the priesthood .
His follow - up letter contained this assessment : " Personally I am not sanguine of the return of priests to active duty who have been addicted to abnormal practices , especially sins with the young .
However , the needs of the church must be taken into consideration and an activation of priests who have seemingly recovered in this field may be considered but is only recommended where careful guidance and supervision is possible .
Where there is indication of incorrigibility , because of the tremendous scandal given , I would most earnestly recommend total laicization . "
But by 1963 , Fitzgerald 's powerful hold on the direction of the order was weakening .
According to a 1993 affidavit by Fr. Joseph McNamara , who succeeded Fitzgerald as Servant General , the appointment of a new archbishop , James Davis , began a new era of the relationship between the order , which was a " congregation of diocesan right , " and the archdiocese .
Davis and Fitzgerald apparently clashed over a number of issues .
Davis was far more concerned than his predecessor about the business aspects of the Santa Fe facility and demanded greater accountability .
He also demanded greater involvement of medical and psychological professionals , while " Fr. Gerald [ Fitzgerald ] distrusted lay programs , psychologists and psychiatrists , " favoring a more spiritual approach , according to McNamara .
McNamara said Fitzgerald was eventually forced from leadership by a combination of factors , not least of which was a growing disagreement with the bishop and other members of the order over the direction of the Paracletes .
After 1965 , said McNamara , Fitzgerald " never again resided at Via Coeli Monastery , nor did he ever regain the power he had once had . "
Nor did he get his island .
In 1965 Fitzgerald had put a $ 5,000 deposit on an island in Barbados , near Carriacou , in the Caribbean that had a total purchase price of $ 50,000 .
But the new bishop apparently wanted nothing to do with owning an island , and Fitzgerald , who died in 1969 , was forced to sell his long - sought means for isolating priest sex offenders .
When asked for comment , a spokesman for the Paraceltes referred NCR to historic accounts previoulsy written about the order .

A 1993 affidavit by Fr. Joseph McNamara , who succeeded Fitzgerald as Servant General .
Barron ’s asks a famous Nobel Prize — winning economist :
" What ’s the stupidest thing you ’ve heard said about the current economic crisis and how to solve it ?
What ’s the smartest ? "
He answers
" … whichever mind - numbingly stupid thing I ’ve just heard , like [ U.S. House of Representatives ] Minority Leader [ John ]
Boehner ’s statement that we should n’t u2018reward ’ Fannie and Freddie by increasing their resources ( he apparently does n’t understand the meaning of u2018 government owned ’)
But I guess the statements from many players that the Obama plan is a spending bill , not a stimulus bill — when spending is the whole point — top the list . "
This person is not part of a conspiracy to create business cycles so as to enrich certain players , including himself .
He is not making recommendations that might prolong the depression on purpose in order to create a totalitarian state .
His statements are the product of error , ignorance , and bias .
He erroneously thinks that Fannie and Freddie are not to blame for the housing fiasco ( with numerous Congresses behind them ) .
But they are .
I quote Robert Prechter :
" The ultimate source of all the bad credit in the U.S. financial system is Congress .
Congress created the Federal Reserve System and many privileged lending corporations : Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Ginnie Mae , Sallie Mae , the Federal Housing Administration and the Federal Home Loan Banks , to name a few .
The August issue [ of The Elliott Wave Theorist ] cited our estimate that the mortgage - encouraging entities that Congress created account for 75 percent of all U.S. debt creation with respect to housing .
For investors in mortgage ( in ) securities , the ratio is even greater .
Recent reports show that these agencies , which have been stealing people blind by taking interest for nothing , account for a stunning 82 percent of all securitized mortgage debt .
Roughly speaking , the government directly encouraged the indebtedness of four out of five home - related borrowers .
As noted in the August issue , it indirectly encouraged the rest through the Fed ’s lending to banks and the FDIC ’s guarantee of bank deposits .
These policies allowed borrowers to drive up house prices to absurd levels , making them unaffordable to people who wanted to buy them with actual money .
Proof that these mortgages are artificial and the product of something other than a free market is the fact that while Germany , for example , has issued mortgage - backed securities with a value equal to 0.2 percent of its annual GDP , the U.S. has issued them so ferociously that their value has reached 49.6 percent of annual GDP , a multiple of 250 times Germany ’s rate , and that is not in total value but only in value relative to the U.S. ’s much larger GDP .
( Statistics courtesy of the British Treasury . ) "
This famous economist says that spending is the same as stimulus or that government spending produces stimulus .
This is a fallacy .
If each federal building were painted and re-painted 10 times , most of the work would be pure waste .
It is uneconomic to spend resources now without getting a payback in due time .
Capital has a cost .
This economist , a self - described [ non-classical ] liberal , is biased toward believing that government can and will select spending projects that have a large enough payback to create wealth .
He ignores the facts of history that range from housing projects to veterans ’ hospitals or to the 70 - year trials in the USSR .
He is ignorant of these facts , does not accept them for what they are , and maintains his position out of pure bias .
He knows no better than to believe in fallacies .
There is no conspiracy here , only a combination of error , ignorance , and bias .
Barron ’s asks
" You ’ve written that the gap between the economy ’s potential shortfall in production over the next three years — $ 2.9 trillion — and the $ 800 billion in economic stimulus is a big problem .
Why does this gap between production and bailout matter so much ? "
The economist answers
" My big concern here is that the economy digs itself into a deflationary hole , which is what can all too easily happen if you have a large , sustained output gap .
Once prices start falling , and people start to expect continuing deflation , the balance sheet problems will become much worse than they already are , and much harder to resolve . "
Mr. Krugman believes what he is saying .
By his own account , he reads and re-reads Keynes , who emphasizes animal spirits and the state of long - run expectations .
It takes a theory to beat a theory .
A conspiracy theory beats nothing .
It is an acknowledgment of no theory .
It is a self - defeating non-theory that poses as a real theory that explains real phenomena .
It is a fact that prices of wholesale commodities have fallen sharply .
Last July , imports and exports both began to plunge dramatically .
It was as if a large tariff barrier had sprung up among nations .
What is the result ?
Prices plunged .
If a large tariff barrier had existed and were removed , those prices would rise .
I quote a question and answer put to Jesse Livermore in 1932 when high tariffs were a factor impeding recovery .
Livermore was a top - notch speculator in commodities :
" If you woke up tomorrow and found the tariffs down so that Europe , including Germany , could send us manufactured goods , and you wanted to make some money out of that , what would you do ? "
Livermore ’s answer
" Well , I might buy some German bonds .
No .
I ’d buy commodities .
I ’d buy the ones they have to have [ for manufacturing and export ] and the ones they would be buying in that situation .
I ’d buy copper .
I ’d buy lard .
I ’d buy cotton .
I ’d buy wheat . "
Even without tariffs as a cause , in 2008 , copper fell from $ 4.00 a pound to $ 1.27 a pound in 5 months .
This reflects the depression and trade interruption .
This is not a price deflation due to Keynesian animal spirits .
It is not so much due to a change in expectations as it is to a drop in demand .
That drop in demand is not due to a sudden burst of thrift .
We did not suddenly get plunged into depression because people stopped buying .
The reverse is more nearly the case .
The boom economy produced goods that people did not want to buy at prices that cover costs .
The depression economy is the inevitable result , because businesses will not continue to produce goods that ca n’t be sold at prices high enough to cover costs .
Imagine that nearly everyone is put to work for a month by businesses that build high - priced houses induced by government stimulus .
While that is happening , fewer people are employed baking bread .
At the end of the month , people try to buy bread and find that there is not enough .
Meanwhile , they do not want to buy the high - priced houses .
There are too many of those .
Home prices fall .
Bread prices rise .
( Consumer goods prices rose 0.3 percent in January . )
The workers in homebuilding are laid off .
Home prices decline .
Lenders find their home loans going bad .
The economy goes into an adjustment that is a recession in order to correct the imbalance .
The economy needs more bread factories and bread makers .
Left to its own devices , the adjustment will occur .
The possibility of making profits by making bread will see to that .
The losses in homebuilding will see to it that fewer homes are built .
But suppose that the government steps in with a stimulus bill and hires labor to pave roads .
The adjustment toward bread making is delayed .
At first overall production seems to improve , counting the money spent on roads .
But eventually there is a surplus of paved roads and not enough bread .
The bread makers try to hire labor .
They compete with the road pavers .
Wages rise .
The economy sees price inflation .
It still does not have the bread it wants .
There is much more to it , of course .
But this is the idea .
Deflation in prices is not a problem .
It is part of the solution .
There is no conspiracy to bring totalitarianism to America .
It may be happening , but not because of a conspiracy directed by certain cunning individuals united in a cabal .
Economists are not put through a secret training school where they learn fallacies like the above .
They are not given diplomas when the schoolmasters determine that they have their propaganda stories down pat .
The processes of life are more subtle than conspiracies directing all bad outcomes .
And if one succumbs to the conspiratorial kind of thought , one will end up sitting on one ’s hands , blindly waiting for one ’s fate , and not trying to understand and then interrupt and alter the processes that are leading to totalitarianism .

With the absence of major new user interface features in Snow Leopard , we 're left discussing some rather minor ( though frequently requested ) tweaks found in the latest developer builds of Mac OS X 10.6 .
Put Back - Under Mac OS 9 , users had the option to restore any " Trash " ed files ( before the Trash is emptied ) back to their original locations with a simple " Put Away " command .
For some reason , this capability was lost in the transition to Mac OS X .
In the latest Snow Leopard builds , it 's back ( as " Put Back " ) .
So any accidental disposals can now easily be restored with a simple click .
Again , this only works for files that have been moved to the Trash but not yet " emptied " ( deleted ) .
Stacks Folder Navigation -
The introduction of the " Stacks " metaphor in Mac OS 10.5 was met with mixed reactions .
One issue with Stacks has been the inability to " drill down " into additional folders .
In Leopard , clicking on a folder in Stacks simply opened that folder in the Finder .
Photoshopped Mockup
According to those familiar with the latest developer build , clicking on a folder in Stacks smoothly opens the new folder in Stacks while shrinking the parent window as a small icon on the top left .
This allows you to quickly navigate in and out of folders in Stacks .
Snow Leopard is Apple 's next major revision to Mac OS X .
It is officially due sometime in 2009 and is said to be focusing on stability and performance enhancements .
We never , ever thought it'd take this long , but we 've finally received a sign that the Wii supply and demand might be nearing some equilibrium , almost two and a half years later .
According to GameStop SVP Bob McKenzie , the retailer now has a couple weeks ' worth of supply , which seems to be fairly unprecedented given the numerous shortage stories we 've heard over the console 's 852 - day lifespan .
That 's not to say the console 's popularity is waning -- it 's still topping US sales charts , and according to NPD , pushed over 750,000 units last month .
So now that one shortage might be nearing its end , how about Nintendo find a way to keep Wii Fit in stock ? [ Via Joystiq Read - McKenzie on Wii supply Read - February NPD figures
6 reasons why is good to drink beer
Beer is one of the world ’s oldest and most consumed alcoholic beverages , and third third most popular drink overall ( just tea and water are above ) .
It was first brewed nearly 7 000 years ago .
It ’s been featured in religious ceremonies , praised in literature , and prized for its medicinal properties .
What the ancients suspected about the health benefits of beer , modern - day science continues to prove .
Ironically , heavy drinking can damage the same organs that moderate consumption ( about two drinks a day for men and one for women ) can benefit .
So it ’s important to always drink in moderation - and avoid alcohol altogether if you have a history of substance abuse .
Here are six ways that a pint a day can keep the doctor away :
1. Cuts cancer risk .
A 2001 study from the University of Prague reported that hop flavonoids found in beer share a structure similar to estrogen and can therefore mimic it , which may lower the risk of hormone - related cancers such as breast and prostate cancer .
They have also shown promise in relieving symptoms of menopause .
2. Promotes strong bones .
According to researchers at Tufts University , beer contains high levels of silicon , which help speed the delivery of calcium and other minerals to bone tissue , especially in men and young women .
3. Increases mental capacity .
A study from Harvard University published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that moderate beer consumption contributed to increased mental capacity in older women .
In addition , a 2003 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that individuals 65 and older who drank one to six drinks a week were less likely to suffer from dementia .
4 . Helps the heart .
Researchers at Rockefeller University concluded that alcohol increases levels of high - density lipoproteins , the good cholesterol that transports excess cholesterol to the liver for disposal and bestows the circulatory system with anti-inflammatory and anti-clogging capabilities .
In addition , a 2006 study conducted by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the Harvard School of Public Health found that healthy men who drank moderately saw a 40 to 60 percent decrease in heart attack risk .
5. Maintains healthy cell function .
Researchers in the Netherlands found that beer drinkers had higher levels of vitamin B6 , which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of red blood cells and the synthesis of neurotransmitters vital for normal brain function .
6. Keeps stones away .
Perhaps because of its high magnesium content , beer has been shown to reduce the incidence of gall stones and kidney stones ; according to researchers in Finland , the consumption of one beer a day helped cut the risk of kidney stones by 40 percent .
John Koller has just announced via PS
Blog that the now 9 - year - old PlayStation 2 will have a new price point as of April 1st , aka April Fool ’s Day .
You will be able to pick up a PS2 for under $ 100 ( the exact MSRP is $ 99.99 ) .
The PlayStation 2 has a pretty strong year ahead of it for such an old platform .
By year ’s end , there will be 1,900 + titles available at retail .
I have to say that those are two awesome milestones for Sony .
Chances are this is the big PlayStation announcement that was scheduled for today .
Now if only we could hear about FW 2.70 or the mythological beast that is the PS3 price drop …

Growing up poor is n't merely hard on kids .
It might also be bad for their brains .
A long - term study of cognitive development in lower - and middle - class students found strong links between childhood poverty , physiological stress and adult memory .
The findings support a neurobiological hypothesis for why impoverished children consistently fare worse than their middle - class counterparts in school , and eventually in life .
" Chronically elevated physiological stress is a plausible model for how poverty could get into the brain and eventually interfere with achievement , " wrote Cornell University child - development researchers Gary Evans and Michelle Schamberg in a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
For decades , education researchers have documented the disproportionately low academic performance of poor children and teenagers living in poverty .
Called the achievement gap , its proposed sociological explanations are many .
Compared to well - off kids , poor children tend to go to ill - equipped and ill - taught schools , have fewer educational resources at home , eat low - nutrition food , and have less access to health care .
At the same time , scientists have studied the cognitive abilities of poor children , and the neurobiological effects of stress on laboratory animals .
They 've found that , on average , socioeconomic status predicts a battery of key mental abilities , with deficits showing up in kindergarten and continuing through middle school .
Scientists also found that hormones produced in response to stress literally wear down the brains of animals .
Evans and Schamberg 's findings pull the pieces of the puzzle together , and the implications are disturbing .
Sociological explanations for the achievement gap are likely correct , but they may be incomplete .
In addition to poverty 's many social obstacles , it may pose a biological obstacle , too .
" A plausible contributor to the income - achievement gap is working - memory impairment in lower - income adults caused by stress - related damage to the brain during childhood , " they wrote .
To test their hypothesis , Evans and Schamberg analyzed the results of their earlier , long - term study of stress in 195 poor and middle - class Caucasian students , half male and half female .
In that study , which found a direct link between poverty and stress , students ' blood pressure and stress hormones were measured at 9 and 13 years old .
At 17 , their memory was tested .
Given a sequence of items to remember‚ teenagers who grew up in poverty remembered an average of 8.5 items .
Those who were well - off during childhood remembered an average of 9.44 items .
So - called working memory is considered a reliable indicator of reading , language and problem - solving ability — capacities critical for adult success .
When Evans and Schamberg controlled for birth weight , maternal education , parental marital status and parenting styles , the effect remained .
When they mathematically adjusted for youthful stress levels , the difference disappeared .
In lab animals , stress hormones and high blood pressure are associated with reduced cell connectivity and smaller volumes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus .
It 's in these brain regions that working memory is centered .
Evans and Schamberg did n't scan their human subjects ' brains , but the test results suggest that the same basic mechanisms operate in kids .
" Brain structures change with stress and are affected by early - life stress in animal models , " said Rockefeller University neuroendocrinologist Bruce McEwen .
" Now there are beginnings of work on our own species .
The Evans paper is an important step in that direction . "
McEwen also noted that , at least in animals , the effects of stress produce changes in genes that are then passed from parent to child .
Poverty 's effects could be hereditary .
The findings , though compelling , still need to be replicated and refined .
" They 're not really saying which causal events were stressful .
They 're just measuring biological markers of stress , " said Kim Noble , a Columbia University psychobiologist who studies the relationship between child poverty and cognition .
Other mental consequences of poverty also need to be measured .
" I think that different cognitive outcomes have different causes , " said Noble .
" Something like working memory might be more associated with stress , whereas language might be associated with hours spent reading to your children . "
But Noble still said the study " was very well - done .
They have an impressive data set . "
And though some details remain incomplete , she said , evidence of connections between poverty and neurobiology are strong enough to justify real - world testing .
" Policy changes that affect environments that might affect cognitive development and brain change — that 's the ultimate future of the field , " she said .

Researchers using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are reporting a gamma-ray explosion that blows away anything they ’ve seen before .
The blast , recorded last fall in the constellation Carina , released the energy of 9,000 supernovae .
The collapse of very massive stars can produce violent explosions , accompanied by strong bursts of gamma-ray light , which are some of the brightest events in the universe .
Typical gamma-ray bursts emit photons with energies between 10 kiloelectron volts and about 1 megaelectron volt .
Photons with energies above megaelectron volts have been seen in some very rare occasions but the distances to their sources were not known .
An international research consortium is reporting in this week ’s issue of the journal Science Express that the Fermi Gamma - Ray Space Telescope has detected photons with energies between 8 kiloelectron volts and 13 gigaelectron volts arriving from the gamma-ray burst 080916C .
The explosion , designated GRB 080916C , occurred just after midnight GMT on September 16 ( 7:13 p.m. on the 15th in the eastern US ) .
Two of Fermi ’s science instruments — the Large Area Telescope and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor — simultaneously recorded the event .
Together , the two instruments provide a view of the blast ’s gamma-ray emission from energies ranging from 3,000 to more than 5 billion times that of visible light .
A team led by Jochen Greiner at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching , Germany , established that the blast occurred 12.2 billion light - years away using the Gamma - Ray Burst Optical / Near - Infrared Detector ( GROND ) on the 2.2 - meter ( 7.2 - foot ) telescope at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla , Chile .
“ Already , this was an exciting burst , ” says Julie McEnery , a Fermi deputy project scientist at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .
“ But with the GROND team ’s distance , it went from exciting to extraordinary . ”
Astronomers believe most gamma-ray explosions occur when exotic massive stars run out of nuclear fuel .
As a star ’s core collapses into a black hole , jets of material — powered by processes not yet fully understood — blast outward at nearly the speed of light .
The jets bore all the way through the collapsing star and continue into space , where they interact with gas previously shed by the star .
This generates bright afterglows that fade with time .
The burst is not only spectacular but also enigmatic : a curious time delay separates its highest - energy emissions from its lowest .
Such a time lag has been seen clearly in only one earlier burst , and researchers have several explanations for why it may exist .
It is possible that the delays could be explained by the structure of this environment , with the low - and high - energy gamma rays “ coming from different parts of the jet or created through a different mechanism , ” said Large Area Telescope Principal Investigator Peter Michelson , a Stanford University physics professor affiliated with the Department of Energy .
Another , far more speculative theory suggests that perhaps time lags result not from anything in the environment around the black hole , but from the gamma rays ’ long journey from the black hole to our telescopes .
If the theorized idea of quantum gravity is correct , then at its smallest scale space is not a smooth medium but a tumultuous , boiling froth of “ quantum foam . ”
Lower - energy ( and thus lighter ) gamma rays would travel faster through this foam than higher - energy ( and thus heavier ) gamma rays .
Over the course of 12.2 billion light years , this very small effect could add up to a significant delay .
The Fermi results provide the strongest test to date of the speed of light ’s consistency at these extreme energies .
As Fermi observes more gamma-ray bursts , researchers can look for time lags that vary with respect to the bursts .
If the quantum gravity effect is present , time lags should vary in relation to the distance .
If the environment around the burst origin is the cause , the lag should stay relatively constant no matter how far away the burst occurred .
“ This one burst raises all sorts of questions , ” Michelson says .
“ In a few years , we ’ll have a fairly good sample of bursts , and may have some answers . ”

( CNN ) --
What could be bigger than the appointment of the first female minister in Saudi Arabia ?
Saudi King Abdullah made more than one noteable appointment to his council of ministers .
Possibly the appointment of a new minister of justice who may actually help her get equal rights with her male counterpart .
Right now , Norah al - Faiz , the new deputy minister for women 's education , is bound by the same laws as every other woman in the land .
She can do only what her closest male relative permits .
For many women of her status and education , that law is interpreted liberally , but for the vast majority , it is not .
Over the weekend , at a single stroke , King Abdullah set Saudi Arabia on what appears to be an irreversible new course , one of modernization .
He replaced the conservative ministers of justice and the head of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice with people closer to his way of thinking .
The king also appointed a new head of the central bank , SAMA -- widely seen by financial experts as a wise move -- and brought in young blood and fresh ideas to the Majlis al Shura , the closest thing the country has to a parliament .
That these changes happened should not be a surprise .
Since he took over as king in August 2005 , when his ailing half - brother Fahd died , King Abdullah has been working quietly to bring about change .
Indeed , al - Faiz used to lead the king 's Center for National Dialogue , a sort of talking shop that allowed issues such as women 's rights to be debated .
The hope was that as discussions about change bubbled up in national and regional arenas , they would also filter out to newspapers and onto television .
It 's exactly what 's been happening .
The king is well into his 80s and inherited many ministers and other top officials almost as old as him .
Many had been in their posts for decades , and many , unlike the king , held their conservative upbringings more than half a century ago to be models for the country 's future .
So when a judge recently upheld the marriage of a 47 - year - old man to an 8 - year old - girl , there was a public backlash .
Why ?
Because debate about this issue had percolated into the public arena .
And suddenly the judge looked out of step with society .
It 's not what made the king decide to replace the minister of justice ; it just highlights how his steady behind - the - scenes work has helped him outflank the sizeable conservative segment of Saudi society .
What the king and many of his fellow royals have realized for a long time is that no country is an island , least of all one as rich and prosperous as Saudi Arabia .
The kingdom's large and rapidly growing young population watches satellite TV , surfs the Internet and chats on Blackberries with friends in Europe , and it expects a different future than the one currently on offer .
The sweeping changes remove some of the ministers most likely to hold back the next generation .
The old Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice commission head , who runs the religious police , is an example .
He has been replaced with someone closer to the king 's thinking , according to a deputy minister I talked with .
The religious police patrol shopping malls and streets , enforcing religious laws such as ones requiring women to keep their heads covered and refrain from talking to men who are n't their relatives .
They rile the youngsters who strain for more freedom .
But no one is expecting revolutionary change overnight .
Saudi Arabia is not about to become a " permissive society . "
Religious law , long - held customs and deep religious principles are not up for negotiation .
After all , the Saudi king derives respect and authority from his role as " guardian " of Islam 's two holiest sites , Mecca and Medina .
To be less than thoroughly religious would not wash , even with Saudi 's moderates .
King Abdullah is calculating that he is making change at a pace people can cope with .
On a recent visit to a shopping mall where religious police had taken a back seat for the past year , it seemed to me the octogenarian king is just about keeping up .
The religious police were in the background , and among young girls in particular , headscarves were gone and lipstick was in bright abundance .

The seven - year ordeal of a British resident who claims he was brutally tortured before being sent to Guantanamo Bay was brought to an end last night during an emotional reunion with his family .
Binyam Mohamed ’s sister , Zuhra Mohamed , said she was “ overcome with joy ” as she watched her brother shuffle down the steps of the RAF transport plane which had carried him from the notorious US detention camp in Cuba to Northolt airfield , west London .
She said : “ When I saw him he looked like he is OK , but he will plainly not be the man I remember all those years ago . ”
Almost as soon as Mr Mohamed had taken his first steps on British soil , the former computer and engineering student made it clear that he had unfinished business with both the US and UK governments .
In a carefully worded statement he said he intended to hold to account those he blamed for his alleged rendition , torture and unlawful imprisonment : “ I am not asking for vengeance ; only that the truth should be made known so that nobody in the future should have to endure what I have endured . ”
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Last night Mr Mohamed ’s release from US custody reignited calls for the British Government to publish secret documents that would shine further light on the involvement of MI5 agents in his interrogation and alleged torture .
William Hague , the shadow Foreign Secretary , and the Liberal Democrats ’ foreign affairs spokesman , Ed Davey , joined with human rights groups in calling for the Government to come clean about British complicity in Mr Mohamed ’s alleged torture .
Mr Mohamed , wearing a cream pullover , navy - blue trousers , white trainers and a white cap pulled over the top of his head , was accompanied by Metropolitan Police officers as he shuffled down the steps of the military aircraft steps .
Unaided , he was taken to an airport interview room and detained under Port and Border Controls , part of the Terrorism Act 2000 .
After further questioning by UK Border Agency officials , who will now consider renewing his British residency status which expired in 2004 , he was released without charge .
Family and friends were then granted access to Mr Mohamed , who will spend some time away from the media glare .
The 30 - year - old Ethiopian national , who came to Britain in 1994 , was held in Karachi in 2002 by American and Pakistani secret agents before being allegedly sent to Morocco , where he says he was tortured .
He is the first of 250 Guantanamo detainees to be transferred under a review ordered by President Barack Obama .
Ms Mohamed , 38 , who had flown from America to be reunited with her brother after more than 10 years apart , described last night the family ’s own ordeal in trying to find out what had happened to him .
Ms Mohamed said in an interview with The Independent that she had been repeatedly told by the US and Pakistani governments that they had no information relating to her brother – whom she had spent three years living with in Ethiopia and then two more years in America .
After he disappeared in 2002 , Ms Mohamed and her other brother , Benhur , went to the FBI to ask for help to find him .
She remembers : “ They first said , ‘ It looks like he was in the wrong place at the wrong time . ’
But then they later denied knowing anything about him at all and suggested we contact the Pakistani government .
When I spoke to the Pakistani embassy , they said they did n’t know where he was either .
It was only when the Red Cross contacted us in 2004 that we were aware that Binyam had been taken to Guantanamo Bay .
It is now clear that all the time they [ the US government ] were involved in his interrogation . ”
Ms Mohamed described both countries ’ attitudes as “ shameful ” .
Behur Mohamed , who came to west London in search of his brother after his disappearance , said yesterday : “ It was very disheartening to know that the British had something to do with his suffering . ”
Mr Hague said it was “ high time the UK Government asked the new US administration for permission ” to release information relating to Mr Mohamed ’s case which was withheld by the High Court earlier this month .
Medical treatment : Matters of the mind
* Binyam Mohamed is expected to be referred to the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture , in London , which has helped other Guantanamo detainees deal with the psychological effects of their experiences .
Alex Sklan , a clinician who has worked with torture survivors at the foundation for more than 10 years , says it is essential that Mr Mohamed is assessed as soon as possible .
“ Once out of the media spotlight , Mr Mohamed will need help in addressing the serious long - term consequences of his ordeal , ” says Mr Sklan .
“ Long after they are released , survivors of torture can suffer with nightmares related to their ordeal , intrusive thoughts about their torture , outbursts of anger and intense feelings of hopelessness . ”
CNBC ’s Dennis Kneale is a hack
I may have spoken too soon several weeks ago when I called Melissa Francis the “ dumbest person on CNBC . ”
Dennis Kneale has thrown his hat in the ring .
Dennis Kneale rarely provides any real analysis , and that ’s the biggest problem on CNBC .
Too many of the CNBC hosts use each piece of news to regurgitate their political views , and Kneale is one of the worst offenders .
Today he was outraged that the Obama administration would ask Rick Wagoner to step down .
He talked about it on the air , and he even managed to write a column about it .
He starts with a rational statement , but he quickly lets his anger get the best of him .
Yes , it ’s about time .
Wagoner had been in denial about the auto industry ’s woes for far too long .
He just was n’t scared enough .
But if this IS the right move , um , then why did n’t the REAL shareholders of GM — the big pension funds and mutual funds in particular — demand it long ago ?
Maybe because they felt Wagoner was doing as good a job as anyone could under impossible difficulties .
So , he starts by admitting this might be a good move , but he ’s concerned that the “ shareholders ” did n’t ask Wagoner to leave .
Of course , the stockholders really do n’t have that power ( GM is a Delaware corporation , so it ’s “ stockholders , ” not “ shareholders ” ) .
The board of directors has the power to fire the CEO , not the stockholders .
The stockholders can elect a new board , but elections usually happen once per year .
The stockholders of course HAVE weighed in by hammering the stock from about $ 40 to under $ 5 in just six months .
Do you think they ’re happy with Wagoner ?
He also does n’t mention that the Obama administration also wiped out most of the Board of Directors as well .
Also , at this point , who gives a damn what the stockholders think ?
This company would be bankrupt without the help of the federal government and the stockholders would lose everything .
As the most senior lender , and as the ONLY entity or person on the planet capable of saving this mess of a company , the government has every right , AND the obligation , to put in place a management team of its choosing .
In the next paragraph , we see his real agenda – using this incident to take cheap shots at the Obama administration .
The bigger worry is this summary execution betrays a deep antipathy toward Big Business on the part of the Obama Administration .
Lamentably , the president ’s henchmen may have imposed this coup mainly for reasons of image and example - setting .
No wonder stocks are down big today .
Here we go again .
Anyone who uses the phrase “ the president ’s henchmen ” in this context shows he ’s not serious about analyzing the issue .
Ca n’t he just explain why he disagrees with the decision ?
Does he have to use this kind of language ?
Is someone at CNBC asking him to act like an asshole so he gets more page views for his articles ?
We ’re in the middle of a huge financial crisis that has produced real anger among the American people , and reasonable people will disagree about how we should address these political problems , so is it really necessary for CNBC hacks to ratchet up rhetoric in this case ?
Then he goes on to slam Fritz Henderson .
Otherwise , how is it that GM . . . is any better off run by Wagoner ’s doppelganger — Frederick “ Fritz ” Henderson , like Wagoner a GM lifer who helped preside over the automaker ’s years - long decline ?
Naturally , he does n’t answer his own question .
That might require some actual reporting that would compromise the pissy tone he has worked so hard to establish .
He probably spent at least five minutes coming up with the “ doppelganger ” crack .
If he had done a little digging , he might find that some people actually think Henderson could do a good job .
Then again , Henderson is no Wagoner .
Where the boss is measured and aloof , Henderson is fast - talking and direct .
He attacks problems with gusto , which is why GM sent him to trouble spots on three continents .
“ Fritz has a real sense of urgency , ” says Joseph Phillippi , principal of firm Auto Trends Consulting .
“ His intensity would be a big plus . ”
Earlier this decade , Henderson shored up GM ’s flailing European operations .
He needed to cut jobs and came out swinging — announcing 12,000 layoffs even before inking a deal with union bosses .
The move sparked a wildcat strike in Germany , but Henderson got his way .
He also helped introduce the Chevrolet brand to Eastern Europe .
After years of losses , GM Europe made $ 357 million in 2006 and a small profit last year .
( Those gains have deteriorated along with the global economy . )
During a two - year stint in Asia , Henderson simplified GM ’s brand strategy .
The company used to sell Saturn , Chevrolet , and cars from former partners Isuzu , Suzuki , and Subaru in Japan .
Henderson focused solely on Chevy .
He ca n’t take all the credit , but Chevy is now GM ’s global brand .
Since returning to Detroit nearly three years ago , Henderson has spent much of his time negotiating with the United Auto Workers .
The deal he cut with the union will save GM billions a year .
“ If it were n’t for Fritz and his team , ” said UAW President Ron Gettelfinger at the time , “ this deal would never have come about . ”
Now , we do n’t know if Henderson is the right choice .
One could argue he was too easy on the UAW in the last round of negotiations .
But we certainly did n’t learn anything about this important move from Kneale .
The future of one of the most iconic companies in American history hangs in the balance , and all of his comments on the subject were simplistic and useless .
He was more concerned with insults and politics as opposed to analysis .
What a joke .
It was n't a long time ago when Crunchyroll was just the target of public ire .
But now they 're also one of the premium and legit outlet of popular TV anime on the web .
Their paid - to - stream service , complementing their pay - to - download and free - to - stream services , makes a fairly attractive package .
That is , if you want to get your Naruto Shippuden and Shugo Chara on ...
Crunchyroll made news when it got rid of its infringing stuff and made deals with Japanese companies , promising 1 - hour delayed " simulcasts " and hi-def feeds for some of the top shows .
It 's just that you have to pay to get it .
That 's fine , but is the Crunchyroll paid - for membership really worth your money ?
It turns out some of what you fear about Crunchyroll is probably true , but it's also surprisingly earnest in trying to deliver what it promised .
Let 's find out what happened for the Anime Membership users on Crunchyroll the past three weeks .
Yep , a hands - on review from the trenches , in the pants of a paying customer .
This review can be somewhat technical , because face it , you kind of need a decent computer to stream high definition videos over the internet .
Just an average PC will probably do , but it has to be better than your Grandmother 's Pentium 3 from 2001 .
Also , to enjoy high - def , you need a fast internet connection .
Crunchyroll lists the system requirements as these :
Adobe Flash Player 9.0.115 ; Version 10 or higher is strongly recommended
Broadband internet connection ( e.g. , cable , DSL , etc. )
Intel Pentium 4 2GHz or equivalent
256MB of system memory
The Anime Membership , CR 's paid - to - stream service , launched on Jan. 8th .
It coincided with the Naruto Shippuden episode 91 broadcast in Japan .
Currently , the cost of membership is $ 6.95 a month , $ 19.95 for three , or $ 59.95 for 12 .
In other words , you could be paying $ 6.95 a month , $ 6.65 a month or $ 5 a month if you go the distance .
Putting aside the turbulent launch week in which people had all kinds of difficulties and some can't even watch some of the stuff because it was lagging so bad , one thing that was impressive was that CR got really hands - on .
They would be tweaking the site on a daily basis and it made a first - impression review difficult .
I could write it and it 'll be obsolete the next day .
Nonetheless , it was rough .
The lag and the web - based video player gave me all kinds of problems .
After a few days of that , though , the site was mostly tolerable aside from the occasional player disconnect or playback reset .
I was able to enjoy shows like the second season of Tower of Druaga and Natsume Yuujincho with just some small inconveniences .
Moving on from the service difficulties , there were two other problems CR had to deal with .
One was that they communicated poorly with the Anime Members who were the early - adopters , buying into the service before launch .
People did n't know about the system requirements or the changes to the video player they made for their service launch .
While that was hammered out days after launch , it just seemed a little amateurish to me .
The second one was much more serious -- the 480 and 720 feeds looked , well , pretty terrible .
Actually they looked worse than the H264 feeds sometimes as the video looked a little over - compressed and the colors were off .
This problem persisted for two weeks and they were just fixed this week .
( Thanks , Matthew ! )
I tried out the cleaned - up 720 feed of Naruto Shippuden episode 93 this week , and it looked actually pretty good for streaming media .
My PC ( a low - end Intel Core 2 Duo ) handled it mostly smoothly , and besides one time that the connection to the video seemed to just died , I have no major complaints .
Well , there were other blunders , such as a gap of subtitles missing at the end omake bit , but it does n't kill the deal .
While I did n't sample every show and every episode that are exclusively available to Anime Membership users , the general quality of translation was passable .
The subtitling jobs are simple and sufficient , but do n't expect any fancy fansub shenanigans and karaoke lyrics .
In fact , the OP / EDs are usually not subtitled at all .
For many of the shows and streams now on CR , the subtitles are soft subs , meaning you can toggle them on or off .
It 's a great way to make some screen caps !
In fact , you can check out the screen caps from this week 's Shippuden here , here and here .
There 's an example of how the subtitles look like , and also the appearing - disappearing watermarking .
If Naruto or Shugo Chara is not your cup of tea , Anime Membership users also get to see the 480 feed for many of their other " simulcast " titles .
Generally they do look notably better than the H264 stream .
Beyond just watching anime , the Anime Membership also gives you bonuses like skipping ads ( not a big deal ) and Crunchyroll points which lets you doodle around using their Gaia - online - like social networking system .
I did n't really care for that ; I 'm just here to do business !
So , in the end , there are still a lot of problem surrounding Crunchyroll 's switchover .
That 's not to mention the legal black hole they are still trying to climb out of .
However , they now do provide a real service , with proceeds going back to the industry , and it is priced reasonably for the fans who want the latest .
If you are curious and on the verge of springing for it , conventional wisdom will probably recommend you to wait until they straighten out all the wrinkles , as there are a ways to go .
The bright side is that they are visibly reducing the number of wrinkles .
For that matter , if CR would give all of us early adopters a bonus month of subscription for putting up with their sub - par launch experience , that would really win them kudos ...

MEXICO CITY , March 23 ( UPI ) --
Mexico is offering about $ 2 million for information that leads to the capture of some of its most notorious drug cartel leaders .
The reward -- about 30 million pesos -- will be paid for each wanted figure , officials said .
There are 24 people on Mexico 's most - wanted list , El Universal newspaper reported online Monday .

The reward will go to the person who provides accurate information that leads to the capture of an individual on the list .
Among those on the list is Joaquin " Shorty " Guzman , who was recently included on a Forbes magazine list of billionaires .
Thousands of people have been killed in recent years in Mexico 's violent drug wars along its shared border with the United States .
Former First Cat Socks , one of the world s most famous felines , died Friday at the age of 20 after battling throat cancer since November .
A stray cat rescued by the Clinton ’s daughter , Chelsea , Socks lived in the governor s mansion in Arkansas and later moved with the family to the White House .
“ Socks brought much happiness to Chelsea and us over the years , and enjoyment to kids and cat lovers everywhere , ” the Clintons said in a statement , released first to PEOPLE .
COM .
“ We ’re grateful for those memories , and we especially want to thank our good friend , Betty Currie , for taking such loving care of Socks for so many years . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Currie , the president ’s personal secretary , and her husband , Bob , took over care of Socks after the Clintons left the White House .
It was near their home in Maryland that Socks was put to sleep Friday morning .
“ He could no longer stand and wasn t eating , ” according to family friend and presidential historian Barry Landau .
His Pal Buddy the Lab
Though much was made of the fact that Buddy , the family s beloved brown Labrador retriever – who died after being hit by a car in 2002 – remained with the Clintons while Socks did not , Landau says , “ The truth be known , Betty asked if Socks could come live with her .
The Clintons didn t abandon Socks .
They were totally conflicted .
It broke their hearts , but they knew it would be the right thing for Socks welfare .
“ Betty had lost a close family member and a dog and they wanted to do something nice for her , ” continues Landau , noting that Hillary Clinton had just been elected to the U.S. Senate .
During the family ’s days in the White House , Socks had become attached to Betty , with whom he spent many hours every day .
“ Socks was always curled up on a blue striped silk chair , next to Betty , ” in her office outside the Oval Office , Landau says .
“ Socks didn t act like a cat .
Socks was very dog- like , and Buddy and Socks got along well .
Landau adds that even visiting heads of state asked to have pictures taken with the cat .
A Taste for Chicken
In the years since he left the White House , Landau says , “ Socks had an incredible life .
Betty cooked for Socks , ” he said , noting the cat loved chicken .
He was also the subject ( along with the family dog ) of a book by Hillary Clinton titled Dear Socks , Dear Buddy : Kids Letters to the First Pets .
Looking to hook your laptop up to your Kindle 2 and do a bit of free - riding on its built - in 3G modem ?
Then this is not the hack for you .
If , on the other hand , you 've been pining to browse the web on your Kindle and eschew the convenience of wireless connectivity , then you 're in luck !
Apparently , the Kindle 2 has a few surprises in its debug mode that the original Kindle did n't have , one of which is a USB networking facility that will let you bypass the usual 3G option and instead take advantage of the internet connection on a connected computer .
Not the most practical option , to be sure , but it also probably wo n't cause Amazon to start breathing down your neck ( as the other , as yet not possible option , likely would ) .

A new study in the journal Social Science Quarterly reveals that music participation , defined as music lessons taken in or out of school and parents attending concerts with their children , has a positive effect on reading and mathematic achievement in early childhood and adolescence .
Additionally , socioeconomic status and ethnicity affect music participation .
Darby E. Southgate , MA , and Vincent Roscigno , Ph.D. , of The Ohio State University reviewed two nationally representative data sources to analyze patterns of music involvement and possible effects on math and reading performance for both elementary and high school students .
Music is positively associated with academic achievement , especially during the high school years .
However , not all adolescents participate in music equally , and certain groups are disadvantaged in access to music education .
Families with high socioeconomic status participate more in music than do families with lower socioeconomic status .
In addition to social class as a predictor of music participation , ethnicity is also a factor .
Asians and Whites are more likely to participate in music than are Hispanics .
While young Black children attended concerts with their parents , they were less likely to take music lessons .
“ This topic becomes an issue of equity at both the family and school levels , ” the authors conclude .
“ This has major policy implications for federal , state , and local agencies , as well as knowledge that can help families allocate resources that are most beneficial to children . ”

The ongoing feud between CNBC host Jim Cramer and Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart will culminate with a personal face - off .
After fielding jabs from Stewart about the calls he 's made about Wall Street , the " Mad Money " host has agreed to make an appearance Thursday on " The Daily Show , " according to Comedy Central .
Before then , though , Stewart plans to take another swipe at Cramer and CNBC 's coverage of the financial crisis on tonight 's program .

super
[ super someMethod ]
is resolved at compile time .
This becomes a problem if you use a class to store methods that you add at runtime to other classes : will then fail or work by coincidence .
In JSCocoa , each ObjC class written in Javascript can hold arbitrary Javascript data .
An NSButton - based class can hold random data without having to declare instance variables , storing variables within a Javascript hash held by the class .
To clean that hash , JSCocoa overloads dealloc by calling class_addMethod with the address of deallocAndCleanupJS , the JSCocoa cleanup method .
deallocAndCleanupJS is stored in an NSObject - based class .
And super is resolved at compile time .
You can see where this goes : in an NSButton - based class , [ super dealloc ] calls dealloc from NSObject rather than from NSButton .
Which is bad .
// Source class for helper methods , derived from NSObject @implementation JSCocoaMethodHolder - ( void) deallocAndCleanupJS
{ //
Do Javascript cleanup here ... //
Call parent dealloc ->
Here this will ALWAYS call NSObject 's dealloc [ super dealloc ] } @end // Define a new NSObject - based Class in JSCocoa defineClass ( ' ApplicationController < NSObject ' , ... ) // NSObject → ApplicationController //
ApplicationController 's dealloc will call NSObject dealloc — that 's what we want but it 's a coincidence ! :) //
Define a new NSButton - based Class in JSCocoa defineClass (' MyButton < NSButton ' , ... ) // NSObject → NSButton → MyButton // MyButton 's dealloc will call NSObject dealloc instead of NSButton dealloc — that 's a bug !
To call the correct method , we need to switch from a compile time super call to a runtime super call :
// Compile time super call - INCORRECT [ super dealloc ] ; // Runtime super call - CORRECT !
struct objc_super s = { self , [ self superclass ] } ; objc_msgSendSuper(&s , @selector ( dealloc ) ) ;
MyButton
NSButton
super
objc_msgSendSuper
super
will then correctly call the thedealloc method .
Asis not runtime , usefor a runtimecall .
College enrollment has been booming .
Schools have not only been adding new seats to existing programs but also adding new programs .
And , unlike the free - market process where the supply of a good is expanding dramatically , the price of these seats has been increasing dramatically – much faster than the CPI .
The increased attendance at increased prices is only possible through the dramatic expansion of loans to students .
The U.S. government and the banking sector are promiscuously loaning money to prospective students , and are fueling a bubble .
Students are taking on huge loans , expecting to be able to pay them back thanks to the great job that lies in their future , thanks to their degree .
However , as the number college graduates entering the market dramatically grows , the market clearing wage they can charge drops .
An increasing number of graduates will find themselves trapped in the horrible circumstance of trying to repay huge loans from their low take - home pay .
This phenomenon will lead to huge unrest ; at any given time 8 million U.S. citizens are attending college .
Something like 90 % of them have loans .
We can expect that as their situation deteriorates , graduates will demand political action that will provide them with debt relief .
And the politicians are almost guaranteed to react poorly .
The solution to this problem is for the government to stop providing subsidized loans .
Better yet , the government might try to dismantle the disaster called public education , which has gone from spending $ 275 per student to $ 7,000 per student ( figures in 2000 dollars ) to achieve worse results .
A free market educational regime would consist less of warehousing and more of useful education that prepares young people for professions that best suit their natures .

Italy : Interior Ministry directive on demonstrations in urban centres
Italy : Interior Ministry directive on demonstrations in urban centres
On 26 January 2009 , the Italian interior affairs minister Roberto Maroni issued a " general directive for public demonstrations " concerning urban centres and " sensitive " areas .
The directive invites prefetti ( government representatives in charge of security in a city ) to exclude certain areas from the reach of demonstrations , envisage guarantees for possible damage that may occur , and set further specifications required for carrying out given demonstrations , in accordance with the mayor and after consulting the provincial committee for public order and security .
The justification mooted for this measure is the " daily succession of public initiatives and demonstrations in cities involving marches " to express " dissent and protests " or to " draw the public opinion 's and institutions ' attention to problems and proposals " .
Noting that there is a constitutional right " to gather and demonstrate freely in public space " and that this right must be safeguarded and preserved as a " fundamental expression of democratic life " , its exercise must take place while respecting other " constitutionally guaranteed rights and the norms that discipline the orderly functioning of civil coexistence " .
In large and complex urban centres , the " frequency of demonstrations " often gives rise to critical situations in terms of the orderly running of the city 's life so as to limit and affect citizens ' rights , such as the right to education , work and mobility .
Hence , there is a need to intervene on existing regulations , all the more so as the initiatives take place successively and are concentrated in the main cities in order to seek greater visibility and as they are places where the institutions and political authorities are represented .
Safeguarding public order and security must " always " be compatible with the right of assembly and free expression of thought , the directive 's premise establishes .
With regards to urban centres , suitable routes and other indications aimed at " regulating " demonstrations must be identified in order to avoid wasting resources and to prevent measures to guarantee mobility from being rendered ineffective .
Where regulations and agreements have established " guaranteed time bands " for public transport , a demonstration taking place in those hours may entail the blocking of a city 's traffic ( even involuntarily ) , thus undermining the right to free movement .
Adopting new criteria to regulate the routes of demonstrations may be a way to address the competing rights in a balanced way , by excluding key areas for mobility or places with artistic importance ( such as those recognised by UNESCO as heritage of mankind ) or areas that are " specifically protected " from noise pollution , such as hospitals , would be a possible approach , Maroni argues in the directive .
A further element to be considered is the urban estate , both public and private , for whose safeguard guarantees involving the responsibility of promoters and organisers may be envisaged .
As for " sensitive areas " , the directive notes that article 17 of the Constitution recognises the right of peaceful assembly in the absence of weapons , although the public authorities must be notified in advance and can only forbid them in case of proven security or public safety reasons .
The unified text of laws on public security ( Testo Unico delle Leggi di Pubblica Sicurezza , TULPS ) establishes that the questore ( police chief ) must be given three days ' notice and may forbid the assembly or prohibit it at given times or in given places , if the prescribed notice is not given or there are reasons of " public order , morality or public health " .
The same norms apply to religious functions , ceremonies , practices , and to ecclesiastical or civil processions , and the questore may also prescribe that specified modalities be respected for public order or public health reasons , informing organisers at least 24 hours earlier .
Article 30 of TULPS also establishes that written authorisation from the competent authority may be required to pass through specified public areas , with the questore entrusted to use his discretion as to whether a demonstration complies with public order and public security requirements , on the basis of factual elements , time and location .
Such an assessment will be applied as regards areas where there are critical targets , for which limitations of access will have to be set .
In defining criteria to direct the decisions to be adopted by competent prefetti and questori , " the need to limit the access to certain particularly sensitive areas , especially when the demonstrations involve a high number of participants " is highlighted in the directive .
These " sensitive areas " will be defined on the basis of their symbolic character for " social , cultural or religious reasons ( for example , cathedrals , basilicae or other important places of worship ) " , or those that experience a considerable influx of people ( even in normal circumstances ) or in which critical targets are found .
The limits will be especially applicable when there have been demonstrations in the past with the same subjects and organisation that have disrupted public order and security .
The measures were deemed necessary as a result of the many student , workers and political demonstrations that have been taking place , particularly in Rome , in response to reforms , collective contractual negotiations , dismissals from employment ( with the case of former Alitalia airline employees particularly relevant , as some undertakings agreed during the transition for the company to be taken over by a consortium and be re-named CAI - Compagnia Aerea Italiana - have not been respected , leaving them without payments that they had been guaranteed ; they responded by blocking the motorway access to Fiumicino airport on 12 February ) and other issues , often blocking or disrupting traffic in parts of the city centre .
A further development was during a demonstrations in Milan on 3 January 2009 against the Israeli attacks in Gaza when , apart from the now usual controversy over the burning of Israeli flags by protesters , many Muslims on the march stopped to pray in the square in front of the Duomo cathedral , the city 's religious and symbolic centre ( as also happened in front of the San Petronio basilica in Bologna ) .
Although similar open air prayers occurred in many European cities in response to the scale of the killings without particular reactions , members of the Italian government now view such conduct as a " provocation " to the host country 's population ( especially outside of a Catholic cathedral ) , in accordance with opposition by some of its components ( particularly Maroni's own Lega Nord party ) to the building of new mosques and their calls for increasingly strict conditions to be imposed on religious ( generally Muslim ) bodies and organisations to operate in Italy .
Days later , in response to the outrage , the presidents of two Milan - based Muslim associations ( the Casa della Cultura Islamica and the Istituto Culturale Islamico ) met representatives of the Milan diocese to deny that the initiative had any provocative intent and to express regret if anyone 's sensitivity had been hurt .
It is also noteworthy that mention of sites of worship and of cultural / artistic importance is included in the directive , which , if interpreted expansively , would give prefetti and questori a very wide discretion to prohibit demonstrations in the capital and other historic cities - for instance , there several hundred churches in Rome , and Italy is the country that has the largest number of UNESCO sites identified as part of the cultural heritage of mankind ( 43 ) , sometimes encompassing areas as large as " the historic centre of Rome " , as is also the case for Florence , Naples , Siena , San Gimignano , Urbino and Pienza , parts of Genoa , and the cities of Venice , Mantua , Syracuse , Assisi , Ragusa , Ferrara , Vicenza , among others .
Also , if so - called " sensitive sites " are to include embassies , stations and airports , for example [ listed as potential targets when the deployment of soldiers was decreed in July 2008 ] , it is unlikely that demonstrations will be able to take place anywhere where they can have any impact at all .
Cinzia Gubbini of
Il manifesto newspaper has reported some of the first effects of the directive : demonstrations along their historic routes in the historic centre of Bologna have been forbidden from 2 p.m. on Saturdays and the whole of Sundays until September 2009 ; in Verona , permission will be granted on a case - by - case basis , with the option of requesting a deposit from organisers examined , after the sale of eggs and flour was forbidden in supermarkets on the day of the carnival parade ( when children traditionally throw them at each other , inevitably " soiling " the UNESCO - protected city centre ) ; and in Palermo , a CGIL trade union official was notified that he is under investigation for standing on the sidewalk in front of the prefettura ( office of the prefetto ) , something that had always happened during protests , but has now been forbidden .

Beware , if you visit WebGreeter.com a disturbing thing will happen .
You will be immediately accosted by what appears to be a chatbot , but is apparently a human doing a creepy impression of a chatbot .
This cyborg thing will ask you for your contact information .
If you give it to them , they may use it right away to call you on the phone .
Based on their website , and the high pressure salesman who called me without an invitation , they believe in an aggressive approach to sales .
The salesman even used the word “ aggressive ” several times in his pitch .
The first time I encountered this technology was on a website for expert witnesses .
I had trouble using the site and clicked on the “ Live Operator ” icon .
A chat window opened , but everything that they said to me appeared to have come from a script , while seeming to ignore the gist of my questions .
I was kind of offended , since this cyborg thing insisted it was a live operator ( each time using exactly the same perfectly worded sentence to convey that ) while continuing to answer a different question than the one that I asked .
At one point I challenged it to type something instead of pasting a canned response , to which I got an obviously canned response that it was not allowed to engage in personal conversation .
( What ?
Is n’t that the point of a live operator ?
The ability to engage on a personal level , human - to - human , empathically ?
Do they think I want a live operator so that I can be ignored in person ? )
I concluded that it was not human .
But when I went to the WebGreeter website to learn about this weird chatbot technology , I found out it really HAD been a human .
That human failed the Turing Test , by successfully declining to use human communication skills with me .
Folks , this is what I ’m complaining about with scripting , scripted testing , scripted behavior of any kind .
My situation required an appropriately trained and reasonably motivated human to listen to my questions and help me solve my problem .
Instead , I meet someone ’s idea of an efficient technology that creepily removed what ’s good about humanity while being able , technically , to claim humanity .
The human in that equation could hide behind rules , pretending to help me while rendering no assistance at all .
I do n’t mind that they have scripts .
I mind when they are followed instead of applied .
This distinction is crucial .
In applying , the human remains in charge .
In following , the human actually lobotomizes himself in an effort to become animated furniture .
When we deal with people , we ought to be able to trust in certain fundamental human qualities .
But just as this crazy WebGreeter company has thrown those out the window , so too have many “ process ” people torn them out of software projects .
Or tried to .
Instead they want us to perform rituals .
Nice repeatable rituals .
Het 2e deel van onze Killzone 2 Special .
Deze keer gaan we dieper in op de techniek , de engine en het design proces .
We spreken daarover met : Arjan Brussee en Hermen Hulst .
Enjoy !
Dinsdag deel 3 .
Using Nmap to scan for the famous Conficker worm .
< Update >
Nmap 4.85 beta5 has all the scripts included , download it at http://nmap.org/download.html.
You 'll still need to run a scan :
nmap --script=smb-check-vulns --script-args=safe=1 - p445 -d < target >
</ Update >
< Update 2 >
If you 're having an OpenSSL problem , read this !
OpenSSL is n't included by default in the Nmap RPMs , and I was n't properly checking for that in my scripts .
Fyodor will have a beta5 RPM up tonight , which will fix that issue .
Until then , you have two options :
1 . Use a source RPM
2. Compile straight from source , from the svn
</ Update 2 >
< Update 3 >
If you 're still having OpenSSL issues , try installing openssl - dev package , and install Nmap from source .
Or , download the latest rpm ( beta5 ) or svn version -- they have fixed the issue altogether ( OpenSSL is no longer required ! )
Further , if you 're having an issue with error messages , this great post by Trevor2 might help :
NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND
can be returned if the browser service is disabled .
There are at least two ways that can happen :
1 ) The service itself is disabled in the services list .
2 ) The registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet \Services \Browser\Parameters\MaintainServerList is set to Off / False / No rather than Auto or yes .
On these systems , if you reenable the browser service , then the test will complete .
There are probably many other reasons why NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND can be returned ( e.g. not a windows OS , possibly infected ) but I have not confirmed these .
Furthermore , this error will occur against on Windows NT .
</ Update 3 >
Hot on the coattails of the Simple Conficker Scanner , I 've added detection for Conficker to Nmap .
Currently , there are two ways of doing this -- you can check out the SVN version of Nmap and compile from source , or you can update the three necessary files .
Update from SVN
If you 're on a Unix - like system , this is probably the easiest way .
You can install it either system - wide or in a folder .
Here is the system - wide command :
$ svn co --username=guest -- password= ' '
svn://svn.insecure.org/nmap $ cd nmap $ ./ configure && make $ sudo make install $ nmap --script=smb-check-vulns --script-args=safe=1 - p445 -d < target >
If you prefer to run it from a local folder , use the following commands :
$ svn co --username=guest -- password= ' '
svn://svn.insecure.org/nmap $ cd nmap $ ./ configure && make $ export NMAPDIR = . $ ./nmap --script=smb-check-vulns --script-args=safe=1 - p445 -d < target >
Update just the files
If you 're on Windows , or do n't want to compile from source , you can install the three datafiles .
First , make sure you 're running Nmap 4.85 bet a4 .
That 's the latest beta version .
Then , download this file :
And place it in the " scripts " folder ( see below ) .
Then , download these files :
http://www.skullsecurity.org/blogdata/msrpc.lua
http://www.skullsecurity.org/blogdata/smb.lua
And place them in the " nselib " folder ( see below ) .
Where are the folders ?
On Linux , try /usr / share / nmap / or /usr / local / share / nmap or even / opt / share / nmap .
On Windows , try c:\program files
map
If all else fails , the scripts folder will contain a bunch of .nse files and the nselib folder will contain a bunch of lua files .
Try searching your drive for smb-check - vulns.nse and msrpc.lua , and replace those .
Conclusion
Hopefully that helps !
If you have any problems or questions , do n't hesitate to contact me !
