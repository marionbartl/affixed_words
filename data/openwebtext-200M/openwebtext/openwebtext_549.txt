And believe me , that is a welcome relief after living in Los Angeles for 13 years .
Granted , I will be the first to admit that when I was in my early to mid-twenties , I definitely cared about what everyone else thought of my clothes and my cars .
I think most people do care up until a certain age , and I was no different .
I bought nice clothes , expensive cars , went out to eat way too much , and just charged myself into credit card debt – all to try to impress other people .
I fell for that lifestyle hook , line and sinker – and found myself staring at a lifestyle I could not afford and tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt … for nothing !
What did I have to show for it ?
Not much !
In the last 5 years of living in Los Angeles I got over myself and stopped caring so much , worked to pay off the debt , bought cheaper cars , and overall revamped my lifestyle so that it was affordable … after all , I did n’t really care anymore what Los Angelenos thought of my belongings .
But I had no idea that there were places where people did not care at all , not one iota – until we moved here .
And it seems to me that most people are happier because of it .
We are not in a competition here to see whose rims are shinier , whose stereo is louder , whose house is bigger or who has the coolest new clothes .
No one here it into talking about where their second home is , where they vacation , or where they sent their kids last summer .
People here are just living … and it is something that we are settling into quite nicely .
Everywhere we go , people wave and say hello , even if you just happen to both stop at a stop sign at the same time .
I do n’t know any of these people yet ; I just moved here 2 months ago .
But yet the majority of people treat everyone as a friend or family member , like “ we are all in this together ” , and it is quite refreshing .
In L.A. , if you took an extra 2 seconds at a green light to start moving , you got blaring horns and 3 middle fingers .
Here ?
Nothing … people are patient and not in a hurry to blast their way down the street .
It is so different from where we came from and I have already felt my blood pressure drop !
The state car seems to be a Subaru , as that is what most people drive .
Not exactly a status - symbol , huh ?
And not a single one of them is clean and shiny like in Los Angeles , as they are all covered in mud , the tires are brown and filled with stones , and many windshields are cracked .
I used to get our cars washed every week or so in Los Angeles , where the only dirt they got on them was from the pollution .
Here ?
I hosed off the car once in the past 60 days …it ’s just how it is around here .
I guess my point is that it just should n’t matter to anyone else what you drive , what clothes you wear , what restaurants you eat at , or where you go on vacation – and we have found a place where nobody cares about any of that stuff and it is an amazing feeling to be free of those feelings .
As much as we tried to live that way in L.A. , we still came in contact with people who looked down on you because you drove a Subaru rather than a BMW , or you worked as a teacher rather than as a TV producer .
It was quite unhealthy but we did n’t realize just how bad it was until we moved away .
I like nice things as much as the next guy , but when and if I were to buy them they would be for me , and not because I thought anyone else would be impressed .
If you spend your life trying to impress and keep up with everyone else , you are not living your own life but rather living theirs .
Living on your own terms saves money , saves your sanity , and saves your dignity !
Ever wondered what auto mechanics were truly thinking when explaining to you the work they did on your car ?

Fire - fighters found the girl still lucid after her fall A 12 - year - old girl who fell 14 floors down a chimney in her apartment block in New York was saved by a pile of soot at the bottom .
Grace Bergere suffered only an injured hip after she landed in 2ft ( 60 cm ) of soot in the basement furnace of the building in the West Village area .
She had taken a visiting cousin up to the rooftop to admire the view of the Hudson River .
Her father described her survival as an " absolute miracle " .
The building 's janitor said he was glad he had not had the chimney swept .
Sooty hand Grace and her cousin went up to the rooftop viewing platform on Thursday night , fire officials said .
To reach the highest point , Grace climbed up a 25 ft ( 7.6 m ) ladder alongside the large brick chimney .
But when she reached the top , she fell into the chimney and plunged down the narrow flue .
Her cousin alerted emergency services and janitor Angelo Guagenti found himself being woken up by fire - fighters frantically trying to get access to the boiler room .
She was covered in soot .
She was black all over
Angelo Guagenti
Janitor " I think she probably went down head first and landed on her back , " fire Lt Simon Ressner said .
Fire - fighters opened a metal door at the bottom of the chimney , expecting to find her dead .
Instead , they saw Grace 's hand poking out of the soot .
" I just jumped back , " Lt Ressner told reporters .
" I was n't expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft , so I was shocked . "
" She was covered in soot .
She was black all over , " Mr Guagenti told the New York Daily News .
The girl 's father , Steve Berger , comforted her as she was taken to hospital , where she is being treated for a suspected dislocated hip .

What are these ?
The project attracted huge attention on atheist message boards and was even featured on the website of scientist and promiment atheist Richard Dawkins , but it appears that too few non-believers actually put their hands in their pockets .
Halfway through an exchange of emails with the science fiction writer Charles Stross - a virtual meeting in cyberspace which might have had something of the exotic as little as five years ago - it strikes me that our text - based communication feels almost archaic now .
It 's a realisation that might have come straight from the pages of one of Stross 's novels .
These days , email tennis feels almost boringly routine , and the rapid normalisation of the technologies which are changing people 's lives is a recurrent theme in his fiction .
Despite their hard - edged technological focus , Stross 's worlds are often as quotidian as they are fantastic .
But for all the consistency of his intelligence , he has always made a point of working in as many of science fiction 's diverse sub - genres as possible , resisting the pressures of a commercial genre to repeat a formula .
" I decided a long time ago that I wanted to write full - time , " he explains .
" But because I get bored easily , I kicked back pretty hard against the demand that I do more of the same . "
Alongside space operas like Singularity Sky , he has published a series merging Lovecraftian horror with British cold war thrillers , and what he describes as a " fantasy series that is n't " with echoes of Roger Zelazny and H Beam Piper .
Stross 's most acclaimed works to date have been his pure science fiction novels , Accelerando and Glasshouse , but he 's still not comfortable being labelled purely as a " science fiction writer " .
" Many science fiction writers are literary autodidacts who focus on the genre primarily as a literature of ideas , rather than as a pure art form or a tool for the introspective examination of the human condition , " he says .
" I 'm not entirely at ease with that self - description . "
But with a background in biomedical and computer science rather than literature , his fiction always returns to science .
" I just can't help myself , " he explains .
" I have a compulsive urge to use that background to build baroque laboratory mazes for my protagonists to explore , rather than being content to examine them in their native habitat . "
But is n't the written word a decidedly old - fashioned media to explore such cutting edge ideas ?
Why not screenplays , or video games ?
What makes the novel so compelling ?
Aside from having been a compulsive reader from early childhood , Stross has two words - creative control .
" Novels are one of the few remaining areas of narrative storytelling where one person does almost all of the creative heavy lifting . "
That autonomy allows written SF to explore sophisticated ideas often absent from films and games .
That sophistication is evident in his latest novel , the Hugo - nominated Halting State , a story set in a future so close that most of it is already on the drawing board , if not in the marketing brochure .
Halting State features a real bank robbery conducted by orcs and a dragon inside a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game ( MMORPG ) .
According to Stross virtual reality became a cliché soon after William Gibson coined the term cyberspace in his novel Neuromancer , but we 're now seeing the first great flowering of virtual realities in the non-fictional world , and they 're taking the form of MMORPG 's such as World of Warcraft .
" It turns out that the killer application for virtual reality is other human beings , " he says .
" Build a world that people want to inhabit , and the inhabitants will come . "
Stross 's best effort has gone into predicting the 10 - year outcome of MMORPGs and other tech depicted in Halting State , but he is sure there are things he 's missed in his predictions .
All he 'll say is that " the future is always a lot stranger than we expect - probably it 's stranger than we can expect " .
Perhaps the strangest future predicted by science fiction writers is the Singularity - an idea that is already " old hat " for Stross .
This concept was more or less invented by scientist and author Vernor Vinge , and started with a simple insight :
If an artificial intelligence can be created on computers , it can in turn design more powerful computers to create more powerful artificial intelligence and so on at an ever accelerating rate until we arrive at the Singularity - a point where technological change happens so quickly that it irrevocably alters human existence .
A powerful idea , but as Stross is the first to point out , not one that science fiction has always treated with the scientific rigour it deserves .
" A whole bunch of extra cruft accreted rapidly around Vinge 's idea , which was misappropriated and misunderstood by many writers , " he explains .
" Along with the idea of nanotechnology , the singularity became a substitute for magic pixie dust that could do anything , and a placeholder for what author Ken McLeod dubbed ' the rapture of the nerds ' . "
But as Stross makes clear , these ideas are already shaping our world .
Nanotechnology today is a billion - dollar industry .
Artificial intelligence may still be remote , but augmented intelligence - of the kind any user of Google can tap into at will - is already facilitating ways of working and living that would have been unimaginable a decade ago .
These changes have yet to make an impact on the way he writes .
" The novels I write are still works of fiction in a tradition that goes back a couple of hundred years , " he says .
" Their structure would n't pose too many challenges to a Victorian reader . "
According to Stross , the revolutionary changes in technology are more likely to affect masintream fiction .
" I think that if there 's one key insight science can bring to fiction , " he says , " it 's that fiction - the study of the human condition - needs to broaden its definition of the human condition .
Because the human condition is n't immutable and doomed to remain uniform forever .
If it was , we 'd still be living in caves rather than worrying about global climate change .
To the extent that writers of mainstream literary fiction focus on the interior landscape exclusively , they 're wilfully ignoring processes and events that have a major impact on our lives .
And I think that 's an unforgivably short - sighted position to take . "
Many will object vehemently to his diagnosis of the problem with mainstream fiction .
But as his readership grows , Stross is reaching not just a hard core of science fiction fans , but also people who find themselves living in the online , socially - networked and virtual worlds his stories explore .

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama gave what could best be described as a middle of the road reaction to today ’s Supreme Court ruling in the D.C. gun ban case .
“ I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms , but I also identify with the need for crime - ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common - sense , effective safety measures , ” Obama said .
He described the ruling as reflective of his point of view , “ The Supreme Court has now endorsed that view , and while it ruled that the D.C. gun ban went too far , Justice Scalia himself acknowledged that this right is not absolute and subject to reasonable regulations enacted by local communities to keep their streets safe .
Today ’s ruling , the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years , will provide much - needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country . ”
Obama also made an appeal to the gun owner vote , “ As President , I will uphold the constitutional rights of law - abiding gun-owners , hunters , and sportsmen .
I know that what works in Chicago may not work in Cheyenne .
We can work together to enact common - sense laws , like closing the gun show loophole and improving our background check system , so that guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists or criminals . ”

His statement in favor of the ruling is a reversal from what he said last year in this story .
I do n’t understand why Democrats have to make the gun issue so complicated .
In this case , there is no evidence that handgun bans reduce the amount of crime committed with a handgun .
I do not agree with the Court ’s expanding of the ruling to cover trigger locks .
Everyone agrees that trigger locks save lives , but if Democrats want to take the gun issue off the table , all they have to do is support Second Amendment rights , and I think the decision today made it much easier for them to do that .
My state of Pennsylvania is a pro-gun state .
Both Democrats and Republicans in the state are pro-gun , and the world has not come to an end , but national Democrats do n’t like to talk about Second Amendment issues , and Obama is no different in that respect .
Obama ’s statement
So long , and thanks for all the fish

The government officials said that the more drastic alternative that has been considered  placing one or both companies under the control of a government - appointed conservator  would be done only as a last - ditch measure if the intermediate steps failed to restore confidence .
The failure of just one of the companies could be catastrophic for economies around the world .
Image Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. announced a plan Sunday to help shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Credit ...
Joshua Roberts / Reuters
The officials said they were prompted to act because , despite repeated assurances by top officials that the companies had adequate cash to weather the current financial storm , Fannie and Freddie suffered a withering blow of confidence last week when their stocks plummeted on the New York Stock Exchange .
As a result , Freddie faced an uncertain debt offering on Monday .
The companies , known as government - sponsored enterprises , or G.S.E. ’s , touch nearly half of the nation ’s mortgages by either owning or guaranteeing them , and the debt securities they issue to finance their operations are widely owned by foreign governments , pension funds , mutual funds , big companies and other large institutional investors .
“ G.S.E. debt is held by financial institutions around the world , ” Mr. Paulson said in his statement .
“ Its continued strength is important to maintaining confidence and stability in our financial system and our financial markets .
Therefore we must take steps to address the current situation as we move to a stronger regulatory structure . ”
The proposal would give the Treasury secretary authority to determine when to invest in the companies or extend loans to them .
Those purchases would be made with the agreement of the companies .
Officials said the proposed investment and lending elements of the plan were to last two years .
While the Treasury did not specify the size of the packages , officials briefed on the plan said they were told by administration officials that , to be meaningful , Congress should consider extending the line of credit to the two institutions to $ 300 billion .
Each company now has a $ 2.25 billion credit line , set nearly 40 years ago by Congress .
At the time , Fannie had only about $ 15 billion in outstanding debt .
It now has total debt of about $ 800 billion , while Freddie has about $ 740 billion .
Today the two companies also hold or guarantee loans valued at more than $ 5 trillion , about half the nation ’s mortgages .

The Bush administration announced a $ 1 billion aid package to Georgia .
This makes the former Soviet republic one of the highest per capita recipients of U.S. economic assistance .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is chipping in a handsome $ 750 million .
Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice said :
… the aid would be used to rebuild houses and infrastructure – but not for military purposes .
( snip )
Announcing the aid package , Ms Rice said the US was “ responding to what we consider to be urgent needs ” .
“ With our full support and the support of the entire free world , a democratic Georgia will survive , will rebuild and will thrive . ”
The Philadelphia inquirer adds :
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who introduced the plan , drew a direct line between what she called Russia ’s irresponsible behavior in sending troops into Georgia last month and the need for “ the free world ” to “ help Georgia sustain itself during these difficult times . ”
Vice President Dick Cheney said :
… the United States had a “ deep and abiding interest ” in the region ’s stability .
Neither Rice nor Cheney will be visiting Russia on their current overseas excursions to discuss the crisis which enmeshed the United States with the state of Georgia or to discuss or prevent further disasters from occurring .
From the BBC article :
Russia ’s President Dmitry Medvedev has also accused the US of helping Tbilisi build its war machine and called on America to review its relations with the Georgian authorities .
( snip ) Russia ’s Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who stepped down as president earlier this year , praised the European Union ’s “ common sense ” .
But he warned that Moscow would respond to the growing presence of Nato warships in the Black Sea , where Russia ’s navy has a huge presence .
While the US provides one billion dollars in aid to a foreign country , the roads and bridges in America continue to crumble .
Worse still , funding for these projects is short and shorter .
The New York Times reports that :
An important account in the federal Highway Trust Fund will run out of money this month , a situation that could hamper completion of road and bridge construction projects across the country , Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters said on Friday .
Because the trust fund ’s highway account is draining away , the Transportation Department will have to delay payments for projects , Ms. Peters said at a news conference .
Since money from Washington typically pays 80 to 90 percent of the cost of federally aided road work , states with shaky finances may have to consider curtailing projects .
( snip ) State transportation officials expressed alarm .
The money shortage will have “ grave repercussions for the states , for hundreds of thousands of workers in the construction industry and the driving public , ” said John Horsley , executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials .
Contractors were also worried .
“ Each week that it goes on , it gets more serious , ” said Brian P. Deery , senior director of the Associated General Contractors of America ’s highway and transportation division .
At some point , he said , some states may have to tell road contractors that they cannot pay them and that “ we ’d like you to continue working , but we understand if you have to stop working . ”
Roads and Bridges says , Nearly every state faces funding shortages , ” it says , preventing them from doing work to “ keep their bridges sound indefinitely . ”
If you Google State Road Funding Shortages , you will find that almost every state and country , from Tennessee , Minnesota , to Louisiana , has articles about how their state was impacted .
And each article mentions that this is across every state in our union .
The Bush administration can give $ 1 billion in aid to yet another foreign country to repair or build their infrastructure , but cannot manage to come up with funding for American infrastructure .

Welcome to the People ’s Republic of Alaska , where every resident this year will get a $ 3,200 payout , thanks in no small measure to the efforts of Sarah Palin , the state ’s Republican governor .
That ’s $ 22,400 for a family of seven , like Palin’s .
Since 1982 , the Alaska Permanent Fund , which invests oil revenues from state lands , has paid out a dividend on invested oil loot to everyone who has been in the state for a year .
But Palin upped the ante by joining with Democrats and some recalcitrant Republican state legislators to share in oil company windfall profits , further fattening state tax revenue and permitting an additional payout in tax funds to residents .
No wonder she is popular with voters in a state whose residents pay no income or sales taxes but are blessed with state coffers rolling in cash at a time when all other states are suffering .
Indeed , when the oil companies pay more taxes to the state of Alaska , they get to write that off against their federal tax obligation , leaving the rest of us to make up the shortfall .
The state of Alaska owns most of the oil - producing land and was getting upward of 85 percent of its budget from the oil companies that lease the fields , even before Palin helped increase the state ’s cut .
While other states fire schoolteachers because of the economic downturn , Alaska has , as Palin indicated in accepting John McCain ’s offer to join him on the GOP ticket , more money than it knows what to do with .
In a display of plucky arrogance at her coming - out press conference , Palin boasted deceptively that if Alaskans wanted that infamous bridge to nowhere , “ we ’d build it ourselves . ”
She originally had supported having U.S. taxpayers finance that boondoggle , before McCain and others in Congress blasted it .
Not that I blame Palin for wrangling for her state a bigger cut of oil company windfall profits ; it ’s just not an option that will work wonders for states without oil .
Of course we can remedy that by having a federal windfall profits tax of the sort that Barack Obama dared propose , and which McCain and his fellow congressional Republicans have managed to quash .
Their argument , rejected quite pointedly by Palin for Alaska , is that it would discourage oil companies from investing in boosting oil field yields .
McCain derided Obama ’s call for the windfall profits tax , saying it would “ increase our dependence on foreign oil and hinder exactly the same kind of domestic exploration and production we need . ”
I am far more interested in how McCain handles the contradiction between his and Palin ’s position on windfall oil profits than whether he properly vetted her on her family - values commitment to the abstinence - only teenage sex education program .
Why is it a good thing for the folks up in Alaska to get a cut of exorbitant oil company profits , but not the rest of us , if we are all part of one nation ?
Did n’t taxpayers from across the U.S. buy the place from the Russians ?
Is n’t it our federally collected tax dollars that have been subsidizing Alaska more lavishly than any other state , both before and after the bonanza of oil ?
Just witness the success of Palin , who , as mayor of the hamlet of Wasilla , hired a big - time lobbying firm intimately connected with the state ’s now - indicted Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens and thus obtained $ 27 million in federal earmarks during her tenure .
As The Washington Post calculated in a devastating report on Mayor Palin ’s assault on the federal treasury , her home town of Wasilla ( with about 6,000 inhabitants in 2002 when she was mayor ) received $ 6.1 million , or $ 1,000 per resident in earmarks , almost as much as Boise , Idaho , got this year with a population that is 30 times larger .
It obviously helped to have Alaska ’s now - indicted senator as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee .
And despite McCain ’s claims that Palin distinguished herself by breaking with Alaska ’s discredited Republican establishment in February , the governor sent Stevens a request for $ 200 million to support various state projects .
With representatives like that , it ’s no wonder that Alaska , despite its oil boom , is still at the top of states subsidized by federal dollars , receiving $ 1.84 back from Washington for every $ 1 that Alaskans pay in federal taxes .
( California receives 78 cents for every $ 1 . )
Unfortunately , looking to Palin for advice on helping the rest of us during the oil crunch , as McCain has promised , is a bit like asking a Saudi oil minister or Russia ’s Vladimir Putin to provide a model for our nation ’s economic woes .
They hardly feel our pain at the pump .

Check Up on Your ISP with Switzerland
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 01 , 2008

The FCC voted this morning to tell Comcast that they 'd been bad boys for blocking some traffic on their network .
Unfortunately , as our parent blog GigaOM covered , they chose not to make any sweeping rules about the matter .
So how do you know if your ISP is playing fast and loose with your packets ?
That 's where Switzerland , a new tool from the EFF , comes in .
The idea of Switzerland ( released in alpha under GPL 3.0 ) is simple .
You install the client on two computers , and set up a Switzerland server on a third .
The EFF is providing a public Switzerland server to get people started .
Then you send traffic back and forth between the two client machines .
Each of them sends a hashed summary of the traffic it sees to the server .
If the server notices a difference , that 's pretty good evidence that someone between point A and point B is tampering with the traffic .
Of course , you need to have some reasonable Internet chops to know where to pin the blame .
Though Switzerland knows about and allows for NAT , it 's entirely possible for your router to make other arbitrary changes to the packets that it sees in the name of efficiency .
For a good test , you really need to be using two clients plugged directly into the Net .
The other problem is finding someone to swap traffic with .
The EFF has set up a wiki page to collect information on public Switzerland clients that can be used for testing , but right now it 's pretty bare .
If you 're looking for an offbeat way to contribute to open source without writing code , running a Switzerland public client could be the answer .
Switzerland is designed to run on all sorts of machines - Linux , OS X , Windows .
It requires reasonably recent Python and libpcap to do its job .
America 's Financial Apocalypse Heralds Decade Long Depression
Despite attempts made by Greenspan and Bernanke , there is no way to avert the payback period that has been building for over two decades .
Over this stretch , America has consumed much more than it has produced .
As a result , both consumer and federal debt have ballooned to record levels .
And now , the payback period is upon us .
The bailout buffet wo n't end with Fannie and Freddie .
There 's a lot more where that came from because the “ Fed 's food court ” remains open , as does that of the U.S. Treasury .
In fact , the autos are in the process of being bailed out with $ 50 billion in “ loans . ”
I expect the airlines to also receive some form of a bailout as well .
Washington 's Three Stooges
But Greenspan and Bernanke have not been alone in what will surely be remembered as America 's Financial Apocalypse - the eventful period ushering in a decade - long depression , as predicted in my 2006 book by the same title .
Certainly , President Bush did not create these trends .
But his financial irresponsibility has accelerated their magnitude .
In less than eight years , he has managed to increase the national debt by 90 % .
As the data shows , not only has he led the worst recovery since the post - WWII era , he has also positioned his successor with budget shortfalls for many years to come due to Part D Medicare , the Iraq War , and his tax cuts for the wealthy .
Combined with the staggering deficits for Medicare and Social Security , America 's economy will be in the gutter for many years to come even after the banking and real estate troubles cool down .
No one else is talking about these issues because they 're wrapped up in the daily drama .
But save this article and others I 've written because I 've been mentioning the longer - term problems ever since writing my book .
In a few years , more people will begin to address these issues once they are transformed into daily drama .
President Bush 's attempts at a recovery have been so horrendous they 've actually led to the current recession , which will turn out to be the worst in decades .
I would venture to guess he is desperately pleading with officials to come up with even more gimmicks to hide the full realities of the economy so the worst will be reported only after he leaves office .
But I will guarantee you if Washington and the Fed continue this reckless game of applying band aids instead of letting things play out , we will see a much bigger crisis down the road , similar to what happened after Greenspan tried to mitigate the dotcom collapse .
You can bet this is going to happen because Washington does not understand the meaning of preemption .
Altogether , we have had eight years of no gains in real median wages , flat stock market returns , and minimal net new jobs .
Despite what you have heard , after adjusting for debt spending , population growth and realistic adjustments to the GDP deflator , there have only been 3 or 4 quarters of GDP growth since 2005 .
If you adjust for military , government and minimum wage positions – i.e. jobs funded by tax payers and jobs that do n't pay anything - there have been absolutely no net new jobs .
Bush 's largest gains have been with inflation , oil and food prices , debt , trade deficits , bankruptcies , foreclosures , and healthcare costs .
If an assembly of the world 's leading economic strategists were to design the most destructive economic disaster possible , they could not match the results of Bush 's tenure .
Even the most loyal Bush supporters will admit he has been an absolute disaster – that is if they 're being honest .
America is now more dependent on foreign nations than ever – not only for oil , but also credit and manufactured goods .
America 's “ Resilient ” Economy
Many of the pundits flood the propaganda networks with repeated denials of the problems , boasting how resilient the U.S. economy is .
You know who they are .
I 'm not quite sure what they 've been smoking .
But it appears to be some sort of hallucinogen because they seem to expect Superman to bend the economy back into shape .
Ladies and Gentlemen , in case mommy never told you , there is no Santa Claus and there is no Superman .
And if you think Bernanke 's printing presses have an endless supply of ink and paper , just wait until the real crisis appears .
So you had better get ready because it 's coming .
It is virtually inescapable .
And it 's going to cause devastation around the globe .
Of course I 'm taking about the likely implosion of the CDS market .
Let 's take a look at America 's “ resilient economy . ”
Let 's see … the entire financial system is in the process of blowing up .
Already there have been over $ 500 billion in bank losses , with over $ 1 trillion more to come .
Over one dozen banks have failed , with hundreds on deck .
A handful of large hedge funds have blown up , with hundreds more on the way .
Already , over $ 1 trillion has been transferred from the Fed to the banking cartel .
But I estimate another $ 1.5 trillion will be needed to maintain liquidity as banks de-leverage over the next few years .
Unemployment is now over 6 % and inflation is over 5 % , even with Washington 's manipulation of the data .
Virtually every metric in the housing market is at multi- decade lows , except for foreclosures which are hitting new highs .
Taxpayers are now on the hook for billions of dollars of potentially worthless debt held by Fannie and Freddie .
It 's now official .
America 's free market economy is really a socialist system for corporations .
One could argue this to be a form of Fascism .
My best estimate for losses due to the Fannie and Freddie taxpayer bailout are between $ 200 to $ 500 billion .
The worst case scenario would be $ 800 billion .
If this economy is resilient , I can't wait to see how it magically bounces back .
When Superman fails to show up , Washington might consider giving David Copperfield a call .
But this would be one illusion he wo n't be able to pull off .
Get the popcorn ready .
The Economy Under a Microscope
Let 's take a closer look at the economy .
America imports oil , credit , and manufactured goods , while exporting jobs , junk bonds and inflation ( via the dollar - oil link – see http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article5414.html for an explanation ) .
That does n't sound like the type of trade policy that would support claims of a superpower , unless you 're only counting the number of nukes .
Surely Washington is beginning to wonder how much longer Asia and Europe will continue fueling America 's credit bubble .
They 've already faced massive losses from sub - prime securities with much more carnage to come .
China holds about $ 1.4 trillion in U.S. Treasuries , but only due to their its surplus with the U.S.
It can't dump Treasuries yet because the Yuan remains greatly undervalued .
China pegged it to the dollar back in 2001 , knowing the dollar would plummet so they 'd lure dollars from U.S. consumers looking for bargains .
What most people do n't realize is that China 's support for U.S. Treasuries helps finance Bush 's irresponsible spending sprees .
By financing up to 90 % of each annual deficit , China helps keep interest rates low in the U.S. , which facilitates credit expansion for consumers to buy more imports - mainly from China ( due to the low cost items created by China 's currency peg ) .
Hidden Imports
Keep in mind when you buy that Dell computer or Fossil watch , you 're really buying imports .
Dell and Fossil actually resemble distributors more than manufacturers because virtually all of their products originate overseas .
The same is true for most U.S. companies that sell branded goods .
In many cases , the same is also true for the service segment of the economy .
Many American IT and software development firms outsource projects to India , Canada , and other nations so they can escape the costly retirement and healthcare benefits Americans expect .
By no means does it end there .
For several years , U.S. banks , tax providers , telecommunications and several other industries have outsourced to Asia - so much for the “ strength ” of America 's service economy .
If this service economy is so “ strong ” someone explain to me how Asia has been able to increase its living standard by leaps and bounds in such a short period .
Before you answer , keep in mind that income and wealth are finite over short periods since they are limited by human and natural resources .
Make sense ?
If not , let me know and I 'll do a write - up explaining it next time .
Corporate America 's new trend is to outsource even lower on the food chain to nations like Argentina , as a way to find more desperate workers to enslave at a lower cost .
While these jobs seem like a Godsend , foreign workers will soon see the longer - term effects of corporate globalization .
Already , many U.S. corporations have finessed themselves into the hip - pocket of foreign politicians and other officials to discourage unions , ensuring wages remain low and benefits never materialize .
?? ( See Ya' Later ) Yankee
As the economy continues its downward spiral , it remains to be seen how much longer China keeps its currency undervalued once it realizes U.S. consumers have no more money to buy their goods .
Once the verdict is out , China could begin to focus on internal growth as the recession spreads globally .
The global effects are already surfacing , with inflation soaring , real estate plummeting and foreign banks scrambling as they wait for the next Bear Stearns .
The Chinese government could encourage its consumers to spend domestically .
This would prove as a great strategy to buoy its economy since Chinese have amble savings ( they save 25 % of household income ) .
Thus , once China is convinced U.S. consumers are finished , there is a good chance it will begin a gradual sell - off of U.S. Treasury securities .
And this is going to be a huge problem .
The Middle East also has a huge trade surplus with the U.S.
But unlike China , it has no incentive to hold U.S. Treasuries .
Instead , Middle Eastern investors use their petrodollars to buy hard assets – commercial real estate like the Chrysler building , businesses and other critical U.S. assets .
Yet , they still can't seem to find enough things to buy , so many Middle Eastern cities are being gutted and turned into modern architectural wonders .
In the recent past when U.S. banks have begged for mercy , Dubai , Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have handed over billions from their sovereign “ oil extortion ” funds .
But they 've learned their lesson , so I would n't expect anymore bailout money anytime soon .
Never fear !
The Fed and the U.S. Treasury are here !
The Federal Reserve Disaster
The Fed needs to let a real recession run its course to clear out the trash so the economy can begin a real recovery and expansion .
They 've been playing this boom - bust game for several years now .
And all we have seen are illusions of growth followed by the realities of mismanagement and excess consumption .
Running the printing presses in overdrive wo n't get America out of this mess .
It has n't helped in the past and it 's not going to now .
In fact , using the money supply to hold off a recession and prevent bank failures ensures there will an even more devastating crisis down the road .
Greenspan tried the same move in response to the Internet meltdown .
And as we all know , this led to the current real estate bubble and banking crisis .
But even shutting down the Fed 's printing presses is insufficient for a lasting and real recovery .
Washington absolutely must restructure free trade so that the playing field is level for all participant nations .
This implies that America structure a universal healthcare system .
And America 's badly broken free market system must be repaired , because as it stands today , it represents socialism for the wealthy .
As a result of the combined actions of Washington 's Three Stooges , the harsh effects of this corrective period will send America into its worst recession in several decades .
Thereafter , a silent depression will persist for many years as Americans struggle to keep pace with inflation , job quality continues to decline and opportunities for the working class vanish into thin air .
While U.S. living standards have been in decline for over two decades , the silent depression will accelerate and make these declines more permanent .
It 's highly unlikely the rest of the world will be able to escape the pain caused by Washington 's Three Stooges because the dollar - oil link is used to hold every nation financial hostage .
China will feel the effects as will India ; and yes , even Brazil .
Unlike America 's fate , these developing nations will mount a full recovery .
And the lessons learned could strengthen the pressure to dethrone the dollar as the universal currency .
But do n't expect Washington to take this lying down .
In fact , it might eventually lead to a major war .
Perhaps the only region that will have some insulation from the meltdown will be select oil - rich nations in the Middle East .
But they are n't likely to walk out of this completely unscathed due to contained oil demand .
But let 's not forget that OPEC has control over pricing .
The payback period is going to affect virtually everyone .
And for those who think they will avert the payback – namely those most responsible for this mess - like Washington 's Three Stooges and bank CEOs - their payback will last eternity because their role in America 's Financial Apocalypse will be recorded in history books .

Must be fun to have a job where you back - seat quarterback everything .
Actually you do n't pontificate because your recommendations are too skim to have any real meaning .
Anything to offer other than hindsight to the common investor ?

Paddy , I suggest you check out who I am before you make foolish statements .
I predicted this apocalypse in 2006 in my book " America 's Financial Apocalypse . "
There is no hindsight by me .
I am saying the same thing I said in 2006 when no one would listen to me .
If you do n't know about me or my book , you can blame America 's media for black - listing me in order to hide the truth and protect their political and financial agendas .
Now , as far as having a job " quarterbacking everything , " these postings are done for free .
I donate my time ( and a lot of it ) trying to help people like you .
I work professionally as an investment strategist .
Postings such as yours only encourage me to stop trying to help people .
Maybe if I was trying to sell you gold or get you to invest with me like everyone else who writes , you would feel better .
Maybe you should redirect your frustatrations to CNBC - the guys who denied everything and censored me .
Finally , anyone who actually thinks they can or should get investment recommendations from public postings are naive .
You should use my postings and anyone elses as general insight .
Things change on a daily basis .
If you are not aware of that , I would suggest you stay clear of the capital markets for now .
Come back in a decaed when the next bull market might come around .

SYDNEY , Australia ( AP ) --
A lost humpback whale calf that bonded with a yacht it seems to think is its mother will likely die within days if it does n't find another mother to adopt it , a wildlife official said Tuesday .
The 1 - to 2 - month - old calf was first sighted Sunday in waters off north Sydney , and on Monday tried to suckle from a yacht , which it would not leave .
Rescuers towed the yacht out to sea , and the calf finally detached from the boat , but the creature returned to an inlet near Sydney Tuesday morning , New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service spokesman John Dengate said .
The calf can't survive without mother 's milk for long , Dengate told Australia 's Fairfax Radio Network .
" It 's probably a question of days rather than weeks , " he said .
" It 's a very grim prognosis . "
Artificial feeding would be impossible , so the calf 's only chance is to find another female whale to accept it , he said .
" If a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it , but ... it 's a very slim chance , " Dengate said .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
Faced with desertions by his political supporters and the unsettling neutrality of the Pakistani military , President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan is expected to resign in the next few days rather than face impeachment , Pakistani politicians and Western diplomats said Thursday .
His departure from office seems likely to unleash new instability in the country as the two main parties in the civilian government jockey for his share of power .
It would also remove from the political stage the man who has served as the Bush administration ’s main ally here for the last eight years .
The details of how Mr. Musharraf would exit , and whether he would be able to stay in Pakistan or would seek residency abroad , are now under discussion between representatives of Mr. Musharraf and the governing coalition , the politicians said .
Mr. Musharraf would probably leave in the “ next 72 hours , ” Sheik Mansoor Ahmed , a senior official of the Pakistan Peoples Party , the major party in the coalition , said Thursday .
Using the drug darapladib , researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and colleagues have inhibited a cholesterol - and immune system - associated protein , thereby reducing the development of heart - disease plaques that may cause death , heart attacks , and strokes in a pig model of atherosclerosis and diabetes .
The study recently appeared online in Nature Medicine .
“ We ’ve used a model that closely mimics clinical disease , ” says first author Robert L. Wilensky , MD , Director of Experimental Interventional Cardiology and Professor of Medicine at the Penn Cardiovascular Institute .
“ The study shows that darapladib is useful in reducing atherosclerosis but more importantly those blockages that are thought to cause death and heart attacks . ”
Atherosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries , is the most common cause of heart attack , stroke , and death from cardiovascular disease , and has long been thought of as a type of chronic inflammation .
An early first step in the build - up of the plaques associated with atherosclerosis is the accumulation of low - density lipoproteins ( LDLs ) , the “ bad ” cholesterol , on artery walls .
When LDLs are oxidized by the body , they attract immune cells and lipids to the site of the build - up .
Problems arise when the plaques grow to form a lesion characterized by a thin fibrous cap and a lipid - filled core of dying cells .
These unstable plaques are prone to rupture , which can then lead to heart attack , stroke , and death .
A molecule called lipoprotein - associated phospholipase A 2 ( Lp - PLA 2 ) is connected with LDLs circulating in the blood .
Elevated levels of Lp - PLA 2 in the blood predict an increased risk of heart disease events and are related to the development of the necrotic core of plaques .
Darapladib specifically inhibits Lp - PLA 2 .
“ The results are exciting , ” says Wilensky .
“ First , darapladib reduced the overall amount and size of plaques that block the coronary arteries of animals in the study .
More importantly , it reduced the number and size of the type of advanced plaques that cause heart attacks and strokes . “
These advanced plaques have a thin cap and large core filled with cellular debris from inflammatory - immune cells that engorge themselves on cholesterol .
If unstable plaques come into contact with blood , blood clots that develop from this contact constrict flow , which can lead to stroke and heart attack .
Darapladib stabilizes these dangerous plaques by decreasing the size of the core and reducing the number of inflammatory - immune cells present within the plaque .
Darapladib also decreased the expression of genes involved in enlisting immune cells involved in the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis .
“ The aha moment came when we saw the profound difference in plaque composition in animals given medication versus those not given darapladib , although the high cholesterol levels in the pig model remained the same in both groups , ” says Wilensky .
“ This study took cholesterol out of the equation and let us evaluate the effects of inflammation on the development of atherosclerosis . ”
Recently , darapladib has been tested in a human clinical trial in Europe , which showed similar findings .
GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Inc. , who provided the darapladib for the study , is planning a Phase 1 safety and efficacy trial with darapladib in humans in the near future .
Penn will be one site in this proposed multi-center clinical trial .
This study was supported , in part , by funding from GlaxoSmithKline , over the last two years totaling about $ 1.5 million , through an industry - academic alliance called the Alternative Drug Discovery Initiative at the Penn School of Medicine .
Co-author Emile Mohler , III , has a position on a steering committee as a National Coordinator for the Phase III GSK trial for darapladib .
In addition to other Penn co-authors Damir Hamamdzic , Daniel J. Pelchovitz , and Jisheng Yang , colleagues from Thomas Jefferson University , GlaxSmithKline , Southhampton General Hospital ( UK ) , and the University of Washington were also co-authors .
Wilensky has a consulting agreement ( $ 2000 over the past year ) with GSK for another compound .
But I 'm chastened now .
I 'm sorry to say but this administration has done it to me .
I simply cannot pretend that what we 've learned about them these past few years - and what I 've learned about the Middle East and wider dimensions of the struggle against Jihadism - has n't deeply affected my views .
Just imagine if the press were to discover a major jail in Gori , occupied by the Russians , where hundreds of Georgians had been dragged in off the streets and tortured and abused ?
What if we discovered that the orders for this emanated from the Kremlin itself ?
And what if we had documentary evidence of the ghastliest forms of racist , dehumanizing , abusive practices against the vulnerable as the standard operating procedure of the Russian army - because the prisoners were suspected of resisting the occupying power ?
Pete Wehner belonged to the administration that did this .
It seems to me that , in these circumstances , the question of moral equivalence becomes a live one .
When an American president has violated two centuries of civilized norms , how could it not be , for any serious person with a conscience ?
The torture regime is the biggest reason I have had to reassess my view of the actions of the United States these past few years .
But the case for war is the second .
Pete hauls out my own passionate defenses of the case for war as if it 's proof I 'm off my rocker .
But of course the passion of my advocacy in 2002 - fueled by my continuing hatred of Jihadism in all its forms - is precisely why my anger is now so great .
I was deceived and feel terrible responsibility for my naivete .
I think there was plenty of good faith in the run-up to the war , among many in the administration and out of it , but I now find it highly probable that there was also a clear and resilient element of bad faith in the office of the vice - president ( and he , we now know , has been effectively running the country since 2001 ) .
I have come to see , by force of the evidence , that some , if not all , in the Bush administration knew that the WMD case was paper - thin , but pursued the removal of Saddam as a power - play in the Middle East because they wanted the US to become an even greater global power , wanted to secure oil fields , and wanted to do to the Arabs what Putin is now doing to his neighbors : teach them a lesson about raw power .
Jonah Goldberg expressed the impulse before the war , in what he called " The Ledeen Doctrine " :
Every ten years or so , the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall , just to show the world we mean business . "
Viewd in retrospect , if you try and make sense of all the strange decisions the Cheney - Bush administration made , this seems by far the most plausible rationale .
When you add to this the deployment of torture and abuse of countless innocent Iraqis as a weapon , the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqis , the displacement of millions more , the ethnic cleansing the US presided over for years , it does become harder and harder to see the unquestionable moral superiority of the US .
Certainly , it seems much more questionable than ever before in my lifetime .

The Clinton administration has turned the Community Reinvestment Act , a once - obscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law , into one of the most powerful mandates shaping American cities — and , as Senate Banking Committee chairman Phil Gramm memorably put it , a vast extortion scheme against the nation 's banks .
Under its provisions , U.S. banks have committed nearly $ 1 trillion for inner-city and low - income mortgages and real estate development projects , most of it funneled through a nationwide network of left - wing community groups , intent , in some cases , on teaching their low - income clients that the financial system is their enemy and , implicitly , that government , rather than their own striving , is the key to their well - being .
The CRA 's premise sounds unassailable : helping the poor buy and keep homes will stabilize and rebuild city neighborhoods .
As enforced today , though , the law portends just the opposite , threatening to undermine the efforts of the upwardly mobile poor by saddling them with neighbors more than usually likely to depress property values by not maintaining their homes adequately or by losing them to foreclosure .
The CRA 's logic also helps to ensure that inner-city neighborhoods stay poor by discouraging the kinds of investment that might make them better off .
The Act , which Jimmy Carter signed in 1977 , grew out of the complaint that urban banks were " redlining " inner-city neighborhoods , refusing to lend to their residents while using their deposits to finance suburban expansion .
CRA decreed that banks have " an affirmative obligation " to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they are chartered , and that federal banking regulators should assess how well they do that when considering their requests to merge or to open branches .
Implicit in the bill 's rationale was a belief that CRA was needed to counter racial discrimination in lending , an assumption that later seemed to gain support from a widely publicized 1990 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston finding that blacks and Hispanics suffered higher mortgage - denial rates than whites , even at similar income levels .
In addition , the Act 's backers claimed , CRA would be profitable for banks .
They just needed a push from the law to learn how to identify profitable inner-city lending opportunities .
Going one step further , the Treasury Department recently asserted that banks that do figure out ways to reach inner-city borrowers might not be able to stop competitors from using similar methods — and therefore would not undertake such marketing in the first place without a push from Washington .
None of these justifications holds up , however , because of the changes that reshaped America 's banking industry in the 1990s .
Banking in the 1970s , when CRA was passed , was a highly regulated industry in which small , local savings banks , rather than commercial banks , provided most home mortgages .
Regulation prohibited savings banks from branching across state lines and sometimes even limited branching within states , inhibiting competition , the most powerful defense against discrimination .
With such regulatory protection , savings banks could make a comfortable profit without doing the hard work of finding out which inner-city neighborhoods and borrowers were good risks and which were not .
Savings banks also had reason to worry that if they charged inner-city borrowers a higher rate of interest to balance the additional risk of such lending , they might jeopardize the protection from competition they enjoyed .
Thanks to these artificially created conditions , some redlining of creditworthy borrowers doubtless occurred .
The insular world of the savings banks collapsed in the early nineties , however , the moment it was exposed to competition .
Banking today is a far more wide - open industry , with banks offering mortgages through the Internet , where they compete hotly with aggressive online mortgage companies .
Standardized , computer - based scoring systems now rate the creditworthiness of applicants , and the giant , government - chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have helped create huge pools of credit by purchasing mortgage loans and packaging large numbers of them together into securities for sale to bond buyers .
With such intense competition for profits and so much money available to lend , it 's hard to imagine that banks could n't instantly figure out how to market to minorities or would resist such efforts for fear of inspiring imitators .
Nor has the race discrimination argument for CRA held up .
A September 1999 study by Freddie Mac , for instance , confirmed what previous Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation studies had found : that African - Americans have disproportionate levels of credit problems , which explains why they have a harder time qualifying for mortgage money .
As Freddie Mac found , blacks with incomes of $ 65,000 to $ 75,000 a year have on average worse credit records than whites making under $ 25,000 .
The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had it right when it said — in a paper pointedly entitled " Red Lining or Red Herring ? " — " the CRA may not be needed in today 's financial environment to ensure all segments of our economy enjoy access to credit . "
True , some households — those with a history of credit problems , for instance , or those buying homes in neighborhoods where re-selling them might be difficult — may not qualify for loans at all , and some may have to pay higher interest rates , in reflection of higher risk .
But higher rates in such situations are balanced by lower house prices .
This is not a conspiracy against the poor ; it 's how markets measure risk and work to make credit available .
Nevertheless , until recently , the CRA did n't matter all that much .
During the seventies and eighties , CRA enforcement was perfunctory .
Regulators asked banks to demonstrate that they were trying to reach their entire " assessment area " by advertising in minority - oriented newspapers or by sending their executives to serve on the boards of local community groups .
The Clinton administration changed this state of affairs dramatically .
Ignoring the sweeping transformation of the banking industry since the CRA was passed , the Clinton Treasury Department 's 1995 regulations made getting a satisfactory CRA rating much harder .
The new regulations de-emphasized subjective assessment measures in favor of strictly numerical ones .
Bank examiners would use federal home - loan data , broken down by neighborhood , income group , and race , to rate banks on performance .
There would be no more A's for effort .
Only results — specific loans , specific levels of service — would count .
Where and to whom have home loans been made ?
Have banks invested in all neighborhoods within their assessment area ?
Do they operate branches in those neighborhoods ?
Crucially , the new CRA regulations also instructed bank examiners to take into account how well banks responded to complaints .
The old CRA evaluation process had allowed advocacy groups a chance to express their views on individual banks , and publicly available data on the lending patterns of individual banks allowed activist groups to target institutions considered vulnerable to protest .
But for advocacy groups that were in the complaint business , the Clinton administration regulations offered a formal invitation .
The National Community Reinvestment Coalition — a foundation - funded umbrella group for community activist groups that profit from the CRA — issued a clarion call to its members in a leaflet entitled " The New CRA Regulations : How Community Groups Can Get Involved . "
" Timely comments , " the NCRC observed with a certain understatement , " can have a strong influence on a bank 's CRA rating . "
The Clinton administration 's get - tough regulatory regime mattered so crucially because bank deregulation had set off a wave of mega-mergers , including the acquisition of the Bank of America by NationsBank , BankBoston by Fleet Financial , and Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank .
Regulatory approval of such mergers depended , in part , on positive CRA ratings .
" To avoid the possibility of a denied or delayed application , " advises the NCRC in its deadpan tone , " lending institutions have an incentive to make formal agreements with community organizations . "
By intervening — even just threatening to intervene — in the CRA review process , left - wing nonprofit groups have been able to gain control over eye - popping pools of bank capital , which they in turn parcel out to individual low - income mortgage seekers .
A radical group called ACORN Housing has a $ 760 million commitment from the Bank of New York ; the Boston - based Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America has a $ 3 - billion agreement with the Bank of America ; a coalition of groups headed by New Jersey Citizen Action has a five - year , $ 13 - billion agreement with First Union Corporation .
Similar deals operate in almost every major U.S. city .
Observes Tom Callahan , executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance , which has $ 220 million in bank mortgage money to parcel out , " CRA is the backbone of everything we do . "
In addition to providing the nonprofits with mortgage money to disburse , CRA allows those organizations to collect a fee from the banks for their services in marketing the loans .
The Senate Banking Committee has estimated that , as a result of CRA , $ 9.5 billion so far has gone to pay for services and salaries of the nonprofit groups involved .
To deal with such groups and to produce CRA compliance data for regulators , banks routinely establish separate CRA departments .
A CRA consultant industry has sprung up to assist them .
New financial - services firms offer to help banks that think they have a CRA problem make quick " investments " in packaged portfolios of CRA loans to get into compliance .
The result of all this activity , argues the CEO of one midsize bank , is that " banks are promising to make loans they would have made anyway , with some extra aggressiveness on risky mortgages thrown in . "
Many bankers — and even some CRA advocates — share his view .
As one Fed economist puts it , the assertion that CRA was needed to force banks to see profitable lending opportunities is " like saying you need the rooster to tell the sun to come up .
It was going to happen anyway . "
And indeed , a survey of the lending policies of Chicago - area mortgage companies by a CRA - connected community group , the Woodstock Institute , found " a tendency to lend in a wide variety of neighborhoods " — even though the CRA does n't apply to such lenders .
If loans that win banks good CRA ratings were going to be made anyway , and if most of those loans are profitable , should CRA , even if redundant , bother anyone ?
Yes : because the CRA funnels billions of investment dollars through groups that understand protest and political advocacy but not marketing or finance .
This amateur delivery system for investment capital already shows signs that it may be going about its business unwisely .
And a quiet change in CRA 's mission — so that it no longer directs credit only to specific places , as Congress mandated , but also to low - and moderate - income home buyers , wherever they buy their property — greatly extends the area where these groups can cause damage .
There is no more important player in the CRA - inspired mortgage industry than the Boston - based Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America .
Chief executive Bruce Marks has set out to become the Wal - Mart of home mortgages for lower - income households .
Using churches and radio advertising to reach borrowers , he has made NACA a brand name nationwide , with offices in 21 states , and he plans to double that number within a year .
With " delegated underwriting authority " from the banks , NACA itself — not the banks — determines whether a mortgage applicant is qualified , and it closes sales right in its own offices .
It expects to close 5,000 mortgages next year , earning a $ 2,000 origination fee on each .
Its annual budget exceeds $ 10 million .
Marks , a Scarsdale native , NYU MBA , and former Federal Reserve employee , unabashedly calls himself a " bank terrorist " — his public relations spokesman laughingly refers to him as " the shark , the predator , " and the NACA newspaper is named the Avenger .
They 're not kidding : bankers so fear the tactically brilliant Marks for his ability to disrupt annual meetings and even target bank executives ' homes that they often call him to make deals before they announce any plans that will put them in CRA 's crosshairs .
A $ 3 billion loan commitment by Nationsbank , for instance , well in advance of its announced merger with Bank of America , " was a preventive strike , " says one NACA spokesman .
Marks is unhesitatingly candid about his intent to use NACA to promote an activist , left - wing political agenda .
NACA loan applicants must attend a workshop that celebrates — to the accompaniment of gospel music — the protests that have helped the group win its bank lending agreements .
If applicants do buy a home through NACA , they must pledge to assist the organization in five " actions " annually — anything from making phone calls to full - scale " mobilizations " against target banks , " mau - mauing " them , as sixties ' radicals used to call it .
" NACA believes in aggressive grassroots advocacy , " says its Homebuyer 's Workbook .
The NACA policy agenda embraces the whole universe of financial institutions .
It advocates tough federal usury laws , restrictions on the information that banks can provide to credit - rating services , financial sanctions against banks with poor CRA ratings even if they 're not about to merge or branch , and the extension of CRA requirements to insurance companies and other financial institutions .
But Marks 's political agenda reaches far beyond finance .
He wants , he says , to do whatever he can to ensure that " working people have good jobs at good wages . "
The home mortgage business is his tool for political organizing : the Homebuyer 's Workbook contains a voter registration application and states that " NACA 's mission of neighborhood stabilization is based on participation in the political process .
To participate you must register to vote . "
Marks plans to install a high - capacity phone system that can forward hundreds of calls to congressional offices — " or Phil Gramm 's house " — to buttress NACA campaigns .
The combination of an army of " volunteers " and a voter registration drive portends ( though there is no evidence of this so far ) that someday CRA - related funds and Marks 's troop of CRA borrowers might end up fueling a host of Democratic candidacies .
During the Reagan years , the Right used to talk of cutting off the flow of federal funds to left - liberal groups , a goal called " defunding the Left " ; through the CRA , the Clinton administration has found a highly effective way of doing exactly the opposite , funneling millions to NACA or to outfits like ACORN , which advocates a nationalized health - care system , " people before profits at the utilities , " and a tax code based " solely on the ability to pay . "
Whatever his long - term political goals , Marks may well reshape urban and suburban neighborhoods because of the terms on which NACA qualifies prospective home buyers .
While most CRA - supported borrowers would doubtless find loans in today 's competitive mortgage industry , a small percentage would not , and NACA welcomes such buyers with open arms .
" Our job , " says Marks , " is to push the envelope . "
Accordingly , he gladly lends to people with less than $ 3,000 in savings , or with checkered credit histories or significant debt .
Many of his borrowers are single - parent heads of household .
Such borrowers are , Marks believes , fundamentally oppressed and at permanent disadvantage , and therefore society must adjust its rules for them .
Hence , NACA 's most crucial policy decision : it requires no down payments whatsoever from its borrowers .
A down - payment requirement , based on concern as to whether a borrower can make payments , is — when applied to low - income minority buyers — " patronizing and almost racist , " Marks says .
This policy — " America 's best mortgage program for working people , " NACA calls it — is an experiment with extraordinarily high risks .
There is no surer way to destabilize a neighborhood than for its new generation of home buyers to lack the means to pay their mortgages — which is likely to be the case for a significant percentage of those granted a no - down - payment mortgage based on their low - income classification rather than their good credit history .
Even if such buyers do not lose their homes , they are a group more likely to defer maintenance on their properties , creating the problems that lead to streets going bad and neighborhoods going downhill .
Stable or increasing property values grow out of the efforts of many ; one unpainted house , one sagging porch , one abandoned property is a threat to the work of dozens , because such signs of neglect discourage prospective buyers .
A no -down - payment policy reflects a belief that poor families should qualify for home ownership because they are poor , in contrast to the reality that some poor families are prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to own property , and some are not .
Keeping their distance from those unable to save money is a crucial means by which upwardly mobile , self - sacrificing people establish and maintain the value of the homes they buy .
If we empower those with bad habits , or those who have made bad decisions , to follow those with good habits to better neighborhoods — thanks to CRA 's new emphasis on lending to low - income borrowers no matter where they buy their homes — those neighborhoods will not remain better for long .
Because many of the activists ' big - money deals with the banks are so new , no one knows for sure exactly which neighborhoods the community groups are flooding with CRA - related mortgages and what effect they are having on those neighborhoods .
But some suggestive early returns are available from Massachusetts , where CRA - related advocacy has flourished for more than a decade .
A study for a consortium of banks and community groups found that during the 1990s home purchases financed by nonprofit lenders have overwhelmingly not been in the inner-city areas where redlining had been suspected .
Instead , 41 percent of all the loans went to the lower - middle - class neighborhoods of Hyde Park , Roslindale , and Dorchester Center / Codman Square — Boston 's equivalent of New York 's borough of Queens — and additional loans went to borrowers moving to the suburbs .
In other words , CRA lending appears to be helping borrowers move out of inner-city neighborhoods into better - off areas .
Similarly , not - yet - published data from the state - funded Massachusetts Housing Partnership show that many new Dorchester Center , Roslindale , and Hyde Park home buyers came from much poorer parts of the city , such as the Roxbury ghetto .
Florence Higgins , a home - ownership counsellor for the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance , confirms the trend , noting that many buyers she counsels lived in subsidized rental apartments prior to buying their homes .
This CRA - facilitated migration makes the mortgage terms of groups like NACA particularly troubling .
In a September 1999 story , the Wall Street Journal reported , based on a review of court documents by Boston real estate analyst John Anderson , that the Fleet Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against 4 percent of loans made for Fleet by NACA in 1994 and 1995 — a rate four times the industry average .
Overextended buyers do n't always get much help from their nonprofit intermediaries , either : Boston radio station WBUR reported in July that home buyers in danger of losing their homes had trouble getting their phone calls returned by the ACORN Housing group .
NACA frankly admits that it is willing to run these risks .
It emphasizes the virtues of the counselling programs it offers ( like all CRA groups ) to prepare its typical buyer — " a hotel worker with an income of $ 25 K and probably some past credit problems , " says a NACA spokesman — and it operates what it calls a " neighborhood stabilization fund " on which buyers who fall behind on payments can draw .
But Bruce Marks says that he would consider a low foreclosure rate to be a problem .
" If we had a foreclosure rate of 1 percent , that would just prove we were skimming , " he says .
Accordingly , in mid-1999 , 8.2 percent of the mortgages NACA had arranged with the Fleet Bank were delinquent , compared with the national average of 1.9 percent .
" Considering our clientele , " Marks asserts , " nine out of ten would have to be considered a success . "
The no -down - payment policy has sparked so sharp a division within the CRA industry that the National Community Reinvestment Coalition has expelled Bruce Marks and NACA from its ranks over it .
The precipitating incident : when James Johnson , then CEO of Fannie Mae , made a speech to NCRC members on the importance of down payments to keep mortgage - backed securities easily salable , NACA troops , in keeping with the group 's style of personalizing disputes , distributed pictures of Johnson , captioned : " I make $ 6 million a year , and I can afford a down payment .
Why can't you ? "
Says Josh Silver , research director of NCRC : " There is no quicker way to undermine CRA than through bad loans . "
NCRC represents hundreds of smallish community groups , many of which do insist on down payments — and many of which make loans in the same neighborhoods as NACA and understand the risk its philosophy poses .
Still , whenever NACA opens a new branch office , it will be difficult for the nonprofits already operating in that area to avoid matching its come - one , come - all terms .
Even without a no - down - payment policy , the pressure on banks to make CRA - related loans may be leading to foreclosures .
Though bankers generally cheerlead for CRA out of fear of being branded racists if they do not , the CEO of one midsize bank grumbles that 20 percent of his institution 's CRA - related mortgages , which required only $ 500 down payments , were delinquent in their very first year , and probably 7 percent will end in foreclosure .
" The problem with CRA , " says an executive with a major national financial - services firm , " is that banks will simply throw money at things because they want that CRA rating . "
From the banks ' point of view , CRA lending is simply a price of doing business — even if some of the mortgages must be written off .
The growth in very large banks — ones most likely to sign major CRA agreements — also means that those advancing the funds for CRA loans are less likely to have to worry about the effects of those loans going bad : such loans will be a small portion of their lending portfolios .
Looking into the future gives further cause for concern : " The bulk of these loans , " notes a Federal Reserve economist , " have been made during a period in which we have not experienced an economic downturn . "
The Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America 's own success stories make you wonder how much CRA - related carnage will result when the economy cools .
The group likes to promote , for instance , the story of Renea Swain - Price , grateful for NACA 's negotiating on her behalf with Fleet Bank to prevent foreclosure when she fell behind on a $ 1,400 monthly mortgage payment on her three - family house in Dorchester .
Yet NACA had no qualms about arranging the $ 137,500 mortgage in the first place , notwithstanding the fact that Swain - Price 's husband was in prison , that she 'd had previous credit problems , and that the monthly mortgage payment constituted more than half her monthly salary .
The fact that NACA has arranged an agreement to forestall foreclosure does not inspire confidence that she will have the resources required to maintain her aging frame house : her new monthly payment , in recognition of previously missed payments , is $ 1,879 .
Even if all the CRA - related loans marketed by nonprofits were to turn out fine , the CRA system is still troubling .
Like affirmative action , it robs the creditworthy of the certain knowledge that they have qualified by dint of their own effort for a first home mortgage , a milestone in any family 's life .
At the same time , it sends the message that this most important milestone has been provided through the beneficence of government , devaluing individual accomplishment .
Perhaps the Clinton White House sees this as a costless way to use the banking system to create a new crop of passionate Democratic loyalists , convinced that CRA has delivered them from an uncaring Mammon — when , in all likelihood , banks would have been eager to have most of them as customers , regulation or no .
CRA also serves to enforce misguided views about how cities should develop , or redevelop .
Consider the " investment " criterion — the loans to commercial borrowers rather than individual home buyers — that constitutes 25 percent of the record on which banks are judged in their compliance review .
The Comptroller of the Currency 's office makes clear that it is not interested in just any sort of investment in so - called underserved neighborhoods .
Investment in a new apartment building or shopping center might not count , if it would help change a poor neighborhood into a more prosperous one , or if it is not directly aimed at serving those of low income .
Regulators want banks to invest in housing developments built through nonprofit community development corporations .
Banks not only receive CRA credit for such " investment " — which they can make anywhere in the country , not just in their backyard — but they also receive corporate tax credits for it , through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit .
Banks have little incentive to make sure such projects are well managed , since they get their tax credits and CRA credits up front .
This investment policy misunderstands what is good for cities and for the poor .
Cities that are alive are cities in flux , with neighborhoods rising and falling , as tastes and economies change .
This ceaseless flux is a process , as Jane Jacobs brilliantly described it in The Economy of Cities , that fuels investment , creates jobs , and sparks innovative adaptation of older buildings to new purposes .
Those of modest means benefit both from the new jobs and from being able to rent or purchase homes in once - expensive neighborhoods that take on new roles .
The idea that it is necessary to flash - freeze certain neighborhoods and set them aside for the poor threatens to disrupt urban vitality and the renewal that comes from the individual plans and efforts of a city 's people .
But keeping these neighborhoods forever poor is the CRA vision .
CRA will help virtually any lower - income family that can come close to affording a mortgage payment to purchase a home , often in a non-poor neighborhood .
Thanks to CRA - driven bank investment , poor neighborhoods would then fill up with subsidized rental complexes , presumably for those poor families who can't earn enough even to get a subsidized , easy credit mortgage .
The effects of all this could be to undermine lower - middle - class neighborhoods by introducing families not prepared for home ownership into them and to leave behind poor neighborhoods in which low - income apartments , filled with the worst - off and least competent , stand alone — hardly a recipe for renewal .
It will take a Republican president to change or abolish CRA , so firmly wedded to it is the Clinton administration and so powerfully does it serve Democratic Party interests .
When Senator Gramm attacked the CRA for its role in funding advocacy groups and for the burden it imposes on banks , the Clinton administration fought back furiously , willing to let the crucial Financial Services Modernization Act , to which Gramm had attached his CRA changes , die , unless Gramm dropped demands that , for instance , CRA reviews become less frequent .
In the end , Gramm , despite his key position as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs ( even the committee 's name reflects a CRA consciousness ) and his willingness to hold repeal of the Glass - Steagal Act hostage to CRA reform , could only manage to require community groups to make public their agreements with banks , disclosing the size of their loan commitments and fees .
A new president should push for outright abolition of the CRA .
Failing that , he could simply instruct the Treasury to roll back the compliance criteria to their more relaxed , pre-Clintonian level .
But to make the case for repeal — and ensure that some future Democratic president could n't simply reimpose Clinton 's rules — he might test the basic premise of the Community Reinvestment Act : that the banking industry serves the rich , not the poor .
He could carry out a controlled experiment requiring no CRA lending in six Federal Reserve districts , while CRA remains in force in six others .
A comparison of lending records would show whether there is any real case for CRA .
In addition , CRA regulators should require nonprofit groups with large CRA - related loan commitments to track and report foreclosure and delinquency rates .
For it is these that will reflect the true threat that CRA poses , a threat to the health of cities .
It 's a modern day Sleepy Hollow story , except instead of revenge , a masked criminal appears to be settling a score over parking .
With thousands of dollars in slashed tires , a defamation lawsuit underway and now a dozen criminal charges laid against the head of the community neighbourhood watch , suspicion and paranoia has pitted neighbour against neighbour in this secluded , well - to - do Toronto hamlet called Wychwood Park .
" It was a traumatizing situation for us .
Very frightening for us , " said Laura Shuttleworth .
Since the fall of 2006 , the Shuttleworths have awakened more than a dozen times to discover that the tires of their white SUV had been slashed .
Threatening notes – " do n't park on the street " – were occasionally left on the vehicle .
Sometimes it happened twice in a week .
Then there 'd be nothing for months .
While the majority of homes in the area have lot parking , the Shuttleworths do n't .
An old garage in the backyard is inaccessible , so they park out front .
Visitors , families with multiple cars and hilltop homeowners also park on the street .
Others vehicles through the years , mostly in the south end of the park were vandalized , but the Shuttleworths remained the main target .
On May 22 , long - time Wychwood resident and neighbourhood watch head Albert Fulton , a retired math teacher and the unofficial archivist of the Toronto Islands , was arrested and charged in connection with the attacks .
The 70 - year - old has been charged with criminal harassment , 10 counts of mischief , and one charge of wearing a disguise with intent in connection to incidents from November 2006 to May 2008 , said Const .
Wendy Drummond .
Wychwood Park trustee Jennifer Lofft was also in shock when she heard the news .
Video surveillance in the area captured the image of a man in a dark balaclava , Lofft said .
Fulton could not be reached for comment .
Speculation as to who could be behind the attacks swirled throughout the community , which was founded in the late 19th century by a group of artists .
The Shuttleworths ' next - door neighbours , the Worsoffs , filed a defamation lawsuit against the Shuttleworths three weeks ago .
Allegations in the claim have not been proven in court .
It alleges that people within and outside Wychwood were told the Worsoffs were to blame .
Lofft called the allegations " groundless . "
Worsoff 's husband , Mitchell , is a criminal lawyer .
" People were told it was us , " he said .
" This is embarrassing . "
" We heard the rumour last .
You know when a wife cheats on her husband , the husband is the last to know , " said Maya Worsoff .
" We 're not involved whatsoever with the community .
Just imagine not being involved and then hearing from people outside the park ( about the rumours ) . "
In May , the saga took another twist , with Fulton 's arrest .
Gwen Rapoport , 87 , formed the neighbourhood watch program with Fulton and another man in the late 1970s .
Rapoport resigned more than a decade ago after she went blind .
" I had heard about the tires from ( Fulton ) , " she said .
" I can't believe it . "
" For one thing , it 's an arrest not a conviction and Mr. Fulton is considered innocent until proven guilty .
( But his arrest ) really felt like a punch in the gut to people in the community , " said Lofft .
Wychwood , a designated heritage site , is a neighbourhood unlike any other in the country .

It 's located in the leafy hills southwest of St. Clair Ave. W. and Bathurst St. , but the roads and lighting are owned by the community , which is run by a small group of trustees .
A fence and large trees obscure the entrance .
It 's easy to miss .
Once inside , modest million dollar homes , verdant yards and even a pond make it hard to believe you 're in Toronto .
" They envisioned it as sort of a utopian artistic community where artists could live together in a co-operative environment , " Lofft said .
The close - knit roots of the neighbourhood have made the last two years even more difficult .
" It was urban terrorism , " Lofft said .
" That 's the only thing to call it . "
Fulton will appear in court in August .

The following is a statement from one of our Juneteenth Directors in Alaska :
By Gwendolyn Alexander , President
“ As for Governor Sarah Palin ’s involvement in the African American community , the Governor ’s office has n’t participated in any of our Alaska Juneteenth Events .
All previous Alaskan Governor ’s have traditionally attended and participated in our annual Juneteenth Celebration .
Gov. Palin was the first governor not to send out a congratulatory letter or assist us in any way with our Juneteenth activities .
I did n’t have the courtesy of receiving a reply when I asked for a representative from the Governor ’s office to come and speak at our Juneteenth Celebration if Governor Palin was unable to attend .
I never even heard of Gov. Palin until she was elected Mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , in Mat - Su Valley .
Governor Palin is a very energetic and spontaneous woman .
With some of the things being said and going around this state right now , I ’m surprised none of the national media have bothered to come here and get the words directly from the mouths of the people who have lived with her all of these years instead of ‘ surfing the net ! ’
My other opinion is why would an individual who , to my knowledge , has not hired any African - Americans on her gubernatorial staff , insist so passionately on being on a television show owned and operated by an African American , Oprah Winfrey ?
While meeting with black leaders concerning the absence of any African - Americans on her staff , Gov. Palin responded that she does n’t have to hire any blacks and was not intending to hire any .
What kind of attitude is this toward African - American for who may be the first Vice - President of the United States ?
I understand Oprah did have Senator Obama on her show a few times and was the main person raising funds for him “ before ” the presidency race was in full swing .
However , the key point here is that it is Oprah ’s prerogative not be used as a pawn to tilt the vote one way or another .
Oprah has stated repeatedly that she was n’t going to have one side or the other on her show by choice .
I thought that was what the Civil Rights Movement was all about , a persons right to make their own choices .
I guess this is n’t a Democracy at all anymore . ”

The consumption of soft drinks is generally considered to be a contributing factor in childhood obesity .
Because children spend a substantial amount of time at school , the school food environment plays a central part in shaping eating behaviors .
While the availability of soft drinks in middle and high schools has been investigated previously , a study published in the September 2008 issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association systematically assesses how the availability of soft drinks in elementary schools across the United States relates to school - based and overall consumption .
A broader question raised by this investigation is how limiting soft drink availability at an early age may alter eating behaviors over time .
While the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs are federally regulated , no similar standards exist for " competitive foods , " that is foods and beverages sold through a la carte lines , vending machines , school stores and school fund raisers .
Guidelines and legislation to fill this gap have been developing in private schools as well as at the school district - and state - level .
Voluntary sales restrictions are another new development , such as the agreement reached between the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association ; Cadbury Schweppes ; Coca - Cola and PepsiCo in May 2006 .
As a result , some school districts and even the states of California and Connecticut have already banned soft drink sales in public elementary schools .
Meenakshi M Fernandes , Pardee RAND Graduate School , Santa Monica , CA , analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study from close to 11,000 fifth graders in 2,303 schools in 40 states .
The study investigated socio- demographic differences in how availability of soft drinks at elementary schools relates to consumption of soft drinks at school and overall .
Fernandes found that limiting availability of soft drinks at school is associated with a 4 % decrease in the rate of any consumption overall .
However , the author further reports that when soft drinks are available at school , about one out of four children consume at least one soft drink over the course of a week .
For these children , school - based consumption represents about one - half their total consumption .
Black non-Hispanic and low - income children tend to consume more .
Furthermore , those consuming a high level of soft drinks at school , typically low - income children and children attending rural schools , are more likely to consume a higher level of soft drinks overall .
While these findings suggest that soft drink availability at school may have limited impact on overall consumption for elementary school children , a previous study found that an additional serving of a non -diet soft drink per day can increase body mass index among adolescents .
Therefore , even a modest increase in daily soft drink consumption could contribute to the development of obesity over the course of adolescence , especially among vulnerable subgroups .
Children in elementary school often have less free time , less pocket money and more teacher oversight regarding when and where they can go during school hours .
Older children are more likely to be affected by competitive foods at school .
Writing in the article , Fernandes states , " While competitive food sales restrictions at school are an important step in decreasing the consumption of unhealthy foods , attention should also be granted to other approaches for limiting availability or attenuating the relationship between availability and consumption .
Greater reductions in children 's consumption of soft drinks will require policy changes that go beyond food availability at school if we aim to significantly reduce children 's consumption of soft drinks . "
Findings based on this analysis can serve as a benchmark for future evaluations of the effects of school food environment changes on eating behaviors .
The author stresses that further research into predictors of consumption , how children respond to reduced availability , as well as food environments at home and at school , may identify next steps towards improving the diet of children .
Camera makers are jumping into the 3 - D photo market more than 20 years after the format was laughed out of town and ended up as Michael Jackson 's sidekick in Captain Eo .
Recently , Fujifilm announced a two - lensed camera that takes images and movies in 3 - D and captures wide - angle photos of single scenes simultaneously .
As a result , we 've heard some rumbling in the wires about other camera manufacturers coming out with their own version in the next year or so .
Since the lenses are 6 - 7 cm from each other ( or about the same length between most people ’s eyes ) , the Real 3 - D's camera processes the images in real time to produce the stereoscopic ' trick ' effect that makes them look as if they 're floating in air .
This is where the processing update of Fujitsu's ' Real Photo Processor 3 - D ' chip comes in .
The chip blends the dual images and all the important metrics ( focus , zoom range and exposure ) at once and pushes them out to the LCD , which is also on a 3 - D display .
By the time this camera is released next year , the company is promising to be able to shoot HD video on it as well .
Of course , there are several 3 - D custom rigs out there that are producing 3 - D images , but they 're usually very expensive .
Some have even made 3 - D rigs out of two mainstream digital cameras .
In the case of the 3 - D Advantage , Casio , a company has attached a tri-delta beam splitter to a single point - and - shoot camera that creates a 3 - D image with a single shutter .
But a pro-ready camera ready to shoot 3 - D images is better than a custom rig , for obvious user - friendly reasons .
So while the majority of the renewed excitement about 3 - D imaging has come from the display side and recent focus from the movie industry , do n't expect Fujifilm to be the only one coming out with a consumer 3 - D cam .
A few years ago , Olympus created a 3 - D camera system for the da Vinci Surgical robot system that works in real time and is dependable enough to used during open surgery .
They only have figure out how to transfer the tech to a more affordable , consumer friendly chassis and they 'll be in the 3 - D game .
Do n't be surprised if they 've already figured out how to do that .

April 1 , 2009 Strategy Briefing , White House , Washington DC Recently elected President John McCain , ( soon to be ex-president McCain ) , sits unmoving , paralyzed .
His impairment the result of a recent aneurism , he waits quietly alone , his gray head tilted awkwardly to the right .
As he attempts to move , his mototized wheelchair hums , then whispers .
He is alone in a remote corner of the oversized office .
He is drooling profusely .
The defualt surrogate , Sarah Palin , the only sentient elected official , now acting - President pending a forthcoming public announcement regarding McCain 's recent incapacity -- known , intimately , as Sally to an affectionate few power brokers -- has settled comfortably into an overstuffed ' presidential ' chair , a leftover from the previous administration .
Richard Cheney , recently promoted Chairman of the Boards of Haliburton , Exxon , AIG , Bank of America , News Corp , ( and , oh , lest we forget , the former U.S. Vice President ) , shifts to and fro from one leg , to the other , in the center of the room .
A large , dimly illuminated portrait of former president George W. Bush hangs on the wall behind Cheney , ( someone has unsuccessfully tried to peel the canvas off the backing ... there are finger nail - like scratches across the face of the painting , and a heavy cluster of claw - marks partially reveal a solid black under - color in one corner of the painting ) .
Various cabinet officers and few , probably CIA operatives , whatever , in sunglasses and fedoras , ( strange clone - like personages , oddly , Jack Abramoff look - alikes ) , stand around the room occasionally talking into their lapels .
Karl Rove , ( a non-compensated advisor ) , is facing the recently divorced , about to be anointed new U.S. President , Sarah Palin .
She is sitting directly across from Rove at a massive heavily stained marble , Corinthian style , conference table , ( also a remnant from the former occupant 's furniture collection ) .
Rove : " Sally ...oh , forgive me , I meant to say Madame President .
First of all let me congratulate you on your recent appointment to ... "
Palin , ( interrupting ) : " Thank you , thank you , thank you .
I have worked so hard to honestly represent the values of America , our fatherland , well , maybe only the lower forty - eight . "
Rove : " Ahhh , yes , well , you 're welcome .
I have called this meeting in anticipation of your upcoming announcement to the people of America - - many of whom spoke in one voice -- who elected us all ; umm ... I mean you and President McCain , of course , to serve our homeland indefinitely , as public servants . "
Palin : " Yup . Yup .
Thanks . "
Rove ( glancing furtively around the room ) : " In this meeting you will be briefed on the single most important , highly code - name classified , top secret type of thing , policy , okay , affecting your presidency . "
Palin : " Yup. I 'm ready . " ( she does n't blink an eye ) .
" I 'm really , really ready . "
Cheney ( walks over , stands behind Rove ) : " Good .
Listen carefully Sarah , this is important ... you must tell no one .
NO ONE AT ALL ! "
( Cheney raises his voice , the quasi scream sounds eerily like escaping steam hissing from an over pressurized boiler )
Rove : " Got that ?
It 's important , to the faithful citizens of our beloved country you MUST offer a loving lie , and keep it secret , eternally ... do you understand ? "
Palin : " Yup. Yup " ( she blinks rapid fire ) Rove ( turning to Cheney ) : " Dick , I think it 's time . "
Cheney : " Yes , of course .
You must know , Ms. Palin ... others see this differently . "
( Cheney turns , faces away from the group and removes a black velvet cape and hood that has been covering his head , his face , shoulders with generous loose folds of opaque fabric draping all the way down his back , effectively covering his buttocks . )
Rove : " This may be startling , please take a deep breath , Madame President .
But , in advance of this revelation you should know this government has not been headed by those who have been elected , but by shadows of humans of extreme power like Vice President Cheney . "
Palin : " Gasp !
But , but ... I'm a Christian . "
Cheney ( whips around , his face now revealed in the bright light of the conference room 's harsh fluorescent lighting .
He shields his eyes from the glare ) : " Christian , yeah , right , so am I . But Ms. Palin WE are not pathetic humans at all .
WE , the true controllers , are REPTILES !
WE are above religion , above morality , above ethics ... above the law . "
Cheney 's voice lowers becoming almost inaudible .
Raspy sounds slither through his trademark crooked smile .
The vestige of a red forked tongue flicks over thin , yet protruding , ruby - red lips smearing rouge into a hideous pig - like caricature of his former self .
Illusionistically , his face appears covered with greenish yellow scales .
Though extremely thick , his epidermis is not skin at all .
Yellow eyed , instead of the non-lethal baby blue contacts he wore in public , his vertical slotted irises expand to sinister empty voids .
Cheney stares directly at Palin .
She is barely able to conceal an overwhelming orgasmic - like anesthesia washing over her trembling body .
Cheney : " So? Being Christian does n't count .
DO ... YOU ... UNDERSTAND ! " Palin : " YAAAAAAAUUUUU - PPPPPPPPPP ! ( she screams ) ( To Be Continued ) G H DIEL Copyright EXOPTICA MEDEA PUBLISHING - All Rights Reserved
Actor Murray starred in Ghostbusters , released in 1984 , and its sequel
Two writers from the US version of The Office have been recruited to write a third instalment of Ghostbusters , according to trade newspaper Variety .
Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky 's hiring is seen as a sure sign the long - mooted comedy will finally be made .
Ghostbusters and its 1989 sequel saw Bill Murray , Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis as bumbling scientists who rid New York of paranormal threats .
It is hoped the new film will reunite the original cast .
Columbia Pictures has declined to comment on whether a third Ghostbusters was in development , Variety reported .
Computer game
But director John Landis , who worked with Aykroyd on The Blues Brothers and Trading Places , has said the film would definitely be made .
" I 'm not involved but I know it 's happening , " he told the BBC News website at the Venice Film Festival .
Eisenberg and Stupnitsky recently collaborated with Ramis on the script for his new film Year One .
Last year the original Ghostbusters cast signed up to lend their faces and voices to a computer game based on the hit film series .
The game 's storyline was being written by stars Aykroyd ( Ray Stantz ) and Harold Ramis ( Egon Spengler ) , who also scripted the first two films .
But the game 's future was thrown into doubt when publisher Activision announced it would not be releasing the finished product .
Developers Vivendi insisted the game had not been cancelled , and that it would be published by another company .

Well this is interesting .
Chuck Todd dropped a little bombshell this afternoon .
CHUCK TODD : Well Ron ,
We ’ve been able to see that there are a few folks who are saying [ Palin is ] actually going to hole up in Alaska for a little , she ’s got to see her son off who ’s going to be deployed to Iraq , so we may not see her on the campaign trail for a little while .
RON ALLEN : Yes she has n’t been home for a long time , and she ’s obviously got some business to deal with there .
Hole up in Alaska ?
I was thinking to myself after her polished but snarky performance at the Republican National Convention , “ I wonder who will get the first interview ? ”
Because obviously , questions need to happen .
Nobody even knows who she is .
She read one prepared statement twice in a row , and then gave a speech written by Bush ’s speechwriter .
Unless you ’re on the internet searching compulsively for YouTube videos of obscure Palin moments in churches and assembly meetings , or diving head first in to the blogosphere , you have n’t got a clue .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I understand the desire to see your child off as he heads to Iraq .
So do thousands of other parents who are shipping children off to Iraq .
I mean , I hate to be rude , but do n’t you have anything else you need to be doing ??
You will potentially be one heartbeat away from being commander in chief of the armed forces .
Should n’t you be out there telling people why you think you can do that job , and earning the trust of the nation that is turning over their own sons and daughters to fight this war ?
Ca n’t the hug good - bye happen now ??
There are 60 days left before the election .
Track ships out on September 11th .
That ’s one week from now .
That ’s more than 10 % of the available time left , that she ’ll be on hiatus “ holed up ” in Alaska , dealing with “ things ” .
So what ’s the real story ?
First , and most obviously , fleeing from the media probably sounds pretty good right about now .
Second , remember when Palin told the Alaska State Legislature through her new attorney Thomas Van Flein that she would n’t be around to testify because she ’d be too busy ?
And remember when Van Flein said that she should n’t even be investigated by the Legislature at all , but rather by a 3 - person panel which she herself appointed ?
And remember when she filed ethics charges against herself to force this plan to happen ?
Well …TPM Muckraker talked to former Alaska Attorney General John Havelock ( I know him !
Good guy . ) who said basically that the Legislature can investigate whatever it likes .
Van Flein knows this , undoubtedly , but is trying to stall things so the ruling comes after the election on November 4 , instead of on the planned date of October 31st .
In addition , Frank Bailey ( the guy in Palin ’s administration who was tape recorded by the Troopers applying pressure to axe the governor ’s ex brother - in - law , Mike Wooten ) has now refused to testify .
So , he will have to be subpoenaed .
And now that the governor is back in this neck of the woods , does that mean she will testify ?
Or will she refuse too , and need to be subpoenaed ?
In addition , there are new developments just breaking that the Police Officers Union of Alaska has filed an ethics complaint on behalf of …you guessed it …Trooper Mike Wooten .
NBC
News says :
The complaint alleges that the governor or her staff may have have improperly disclosed information from Wooten ’s personnel records .
The complaint alleges “ criminal penalties may apply . ”
This all has to do with the aforementioned phone call .
Bailey , while being recorded talking to Trooper Rodney Dial , dished all kinds of personal information about Wooten – shooting the moose , driving under the influence , etc .
Wooten says the only way he could have known this is by accessing his personnel file improperly .
Palin…er … The McCain Palin campaign says that there was nothing illegal here because Wooten had signed a waiver allowing a divorce attorney to look through his records .
So the info went down the line from file , to divorce attorney , to Molly McCann ( Palin ’s sister ) , to Todd Palin , to Frank Bailey , to Trooper Dial , and then back to Mike Wooten … . who is now filing a complaint .
And Bailey does say that Todd Palin was the source of the damaging information on Wooten that he passed along .
And Sarah Palin knew NOTHING about this .
That ’s her story and she ’s stickin’ with it .
Hmph .
So , there you have it .
Is it legal ?
We ’ll find out .
Criminal penalties may apply .
( And McCain knew all about this , right ? )
Now that you ’ve slogged through all that , sit back and enjoy this excellent summary of Troopergate ( minus the new developments ) from ABC News .
Hat tip to Gryphen at The Immoral Minority , one of my favorite local blogs , for finding the clip .
UPDATE : Palin and McCain were at a rally in Cedarburg , WI today .
No sign of her here yet .
I ’ll update when I know more .
FRESHMEN AWASH IN PORK FRESHMEN AWASH IN PORK WASHINGTON -- Earmarks are all about power .
Lawmakers who have it , get them .
Those who do n't , get less .
Then there are the freshmen lawmakers or members in competitive districts who get them because they need a boost .
Their party leaders tend to shower them with earmarks in hopes the money for local projects could help them keep their seats .
Two freshmen Democrats from Arizona are benefiting from that largess .
Rep. Harry Mitchell , of Tempe , took credit for about $ 34.7 million worth of earmarks last year .
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , of Tucson , claimed she helped secure about $ 25 million in earmarks .
The practice , is " as old as the desert , " said David Wasserman , a House analyst for the Cook Political Report .
" More senior members of party leadership understand that throwing a bone to vulnerable members ultimately shelters the party from election damage , " he said .
Overall , Democratic freshmen in the House were among the biggest recipients of pork - barrel spending , often securing more money than more senior lawmakers , according to the fiscal watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense .
Mitchell , for example , helped secure more money than any other House member from Arizona except for Rep.
Ed Pastor , a nine - term lawmaker who serves on the powerful House Appropriations Committee , which largely controls federal spending .
Pastor , D - Phoenix , took credit for $ 57.7 million in earmarks last year .
The average House member got about $ 22.8 million .
That excludes members who serve on the appropriations committee , who often steer money to pet projects in their states .
The 72 members on the committee gained the most an average of $ 58.9 million .
Mitchell , a freshman who defeated incumbent Republican J.D. Hayworth , is considered a target for House Republicans who are hoping to reclaim some of the seats they lost in 2006 .
Republicans are also hoping to unseat Giffords , who won the House seat vacated by Republican Jim Kolbe when he retired in 2006 .
" I do n't know if I got special treatment or not , " said Mitchell , noting that Arizona gets fewer earmarks than any other state .
" All I did was put in my requests . "
Earmarks can play a vital role in poor , rural communities that need help from the federal government , said Giffords .
" I take the government 's budgeting process very seriously , but my constituents work hard and pay their taxes , " she said .
" They should see their dollars come back to their communities . "
Giffords helped secure funding for 19 projects last year , including about $ 390,000 for the Chiricahua Community Health Center in Cochise County , which operates three clinics and two mobile units near the border with Mexico .
Officials there plan to use the money to move a dental practice now being run out of a dilapidated single - wide trailer into an Elfrida clinic .
They also plan to create a separate waiting room at a Douglas clinic for pediatrics patients , who now wait to be seen by doctors in an overcrowded adult waiting room .
" We spend our money taking care of the poor and disenfranchised , " said Jennifer Ginger Ryan , the centers ' chief executive officer .
" We are grateful for every dollar we get . " -- Gannett News Service WASHINGTON
 Arizona has some powerful lawmakers in Washington , including Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain .
But when it comes to pork - barrel spending , otherwise known as earmarks , the state ranks last .
That 's mostly because three of the state 's 10 lawmakers in Washington — McCain and House Republicans Jeff Flake and John Shadegg — refuse to ask for any federal money for local projects .
Another Arizona Republican , Sen. Jon Kyl , strictly limits his earmark requests .
They all say the earmark process wastes taxpayer money and desperately needs reform .
But other Arizona lawmakers counter that their colleagues ' stance hurts the state .
Arizona , the second fastest growing state in the nation , will receive just $ 18.70 per capita in federal earmarks this fiscal year .
By comparison , Alaska — with roughly a tenth of Arizona 's population — is set to receive $ 506.34 per capita , the highest in the nation , according to Taxpayers for Common Sense , a watchdog group which tracks earmarks .
The state of Alaska receives about three times as much as Arizona receives in actual dollars , $ 346 million to $ 119 million .
" When you have reformers and purists , you end up not getting a reasonable share of money coming out , which hurts the state , " said James Thurber , director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University .
" When you 're holier than thou , you do n't get much of the money . "
Much of the work done by lawmakers in Washington centers on how to spend about $ 3 trillion in taxpayer money each year .
For many members of Congress , securing funding for projects back home can often be the most tangible product of the complicated budget process .
But earmarks have gotten a bad name after public corruption scandals involving former high - profile lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham , R - Calif. , who went to jail for accepting millions in bribes from defense contractors to steer government money their way .
They have also been mocked after the 2005 disclosure of funding for a $ 223 million " bridge to nowhere " that would have linked a small Alaska town to a tiny island with a population of 50 .
Despite the controversy , lawmakers secured about $ 18.3 billion for nearly 13,000 projects last year .
Only 18 lawmakers declined to seek any earmarks .
Lawmakers often work together on earmarks that can benefit multiple states or districts .
But the bulk of their funding request are for projects in their home districts or states .
The earmark process for next fiscal year is just getting started , with lawmakers submitting their requests for local project funding to appropriations committees in the House and Senate .
Efforts to place a one - year moratorium on earmarks have failed in both chambers , but a growing number of House Republicans have signed a pledge to abstain from seeking them .
Rep. Trent Franks , a Republican from the Glendale , Ariz .
region , helped secure about $ 29.2 million worth of earmarks last year but has vowed not to ask for any special project funding this year .
Franks ' recent pledge would mean that only half of the state 's congressional delegation plan to actively seek earmarks .
" We have members of our delegation who feel their job is not to bring equitable resources back to the state , " said Rep. Raul Grijalva , a Tuscon - area Democrat .
" The fact remains we are shortchanging our taxpayers by not bringing more resources into the state . "
EARMARKS : Taxpayers for Common Sense database
There 's another reason Arizona gets so much less money than Alaska — political power .
Alaska is home to Sen .
Ted Stevens , a senior Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee , which largely controls how money is doled out in Washington .
Arizona has just one appropriator in the House , Rep. Ed Pastor , where rank and file members have less clout than in the Senate .
" It 's one of the illustrations of what 's wrong with the system , " said Ryan Alexander , president of the taxpayer group .
" Earmark dollars are not distributed based on need or merit or anything else as far as we can tell other than by power . "
Rep. John Shadegg , a Republican from the Phoenix area , agrees .
" I would argue that if all of us sought earmarks , Arizona would still get shortchanged , " he said .
That does n't mean they 're shortchanged in the overall federal budget .
The state receives more federal funding than state taxpayers put in , according to the Northeast - Midwest Institute , which found that Arizona got $ 1.19 for every dollar taxpayers spent in 2005 .
Shadegg contends that earmarks corrupt the political process by often putting lawmakers in the position of asking for funding for groups that give them campaign donations .
At the same time , lawmakers use earmarks to brag to constituents about what they 're accomplishing in Washington , he said .
" People in my district do n't want me to use their taxpayer dollars to get me re-elected , " he said .
Others say that earmarks increase government spending at a time when the national debt continues to climb .
" We simply can't afford it in the country , " said Flake , of Mesa .
" I just ca n't in good conscience just play the game . "
Kyl , who helped secure about $ 92.7 million in earmarks last year , does not think lawmakers should eliminate them altogether but argues the system should be more transparent and that funding be distributed based on the merits of projects .
One of the complaints about the process is that earmarks often are inserted into spending bills without debate over merits of the funding requests .
Recent reforms in the House and Senate have forced lawmakers to disclose the earmarks they secure but do n't make them identify all the ones they request .
So far , only three Arizona lawmakers — Kyl and freshmen Democrats Reps .
Harry Mitchell and Gabrielle Giffords — have vowed to disclose all their requests .
" I 'm willing to defend what I ask for , because I ask for so little , " Kyl said .
Pastor , a Phoenix - area Democrat , wo n't release all of his requests because he says it would violate the privacy of groups asking for funding .
But he defends all the projects he supports and notes that earmarks make up one percent of the federal budget .
If it does n't get spent on Arizona projects , the funding would be spent elsewhere , he said .
" All the money Arizona does n't take goes to Alaska , " said Pastor , who secured more earmark funding than any other member of the state 's delegation : $ 57.7 million .
Pastor also teamed up with Rep. Harry Mitchell , D - Tempe , to get nearly $ 700,000 for a river restoration project for the Salt River , which sometimes floods , washing out roads .
The project is a big priority for the city of Mesa , which is represented by Mitchell and Flake .
Scott Butler , the city 's government relations director , says city officials respect Flake 's position but appreciate the help they receive from other members .
" As long as earmarks do occur , " he said , " we feel our projects are just as worthy . "

Frdric Bastiat famously observed that the State costs us in ways we can see and ways we can not see .
Economists tend to focus on the second type because they elude public perceptions .
What inventions are we denied because of regulations ?
What might have been done with the resources that are diverted in taxes or higher prices due to protectionism ?
The answers demonstrate that , because of intervention , we are worse off than we know .
Sometimes , however , we should also look at the potentially seen costs of the State , if only because the State does n’t want us to see those either .
These are the direct destructions caused by some State activity , most especially war .
Seeing war in photographs changes things .
It causes us to observe the State ’s war and what it is doing to people : us and them .
This is why the State does n’t want pictures of US wounded or dead circulating in public .
The media mostly obey .
Did you ever notice that ?
You are being shown only what the government wants you to see .
The State does not want you to see dead soldiers or suffering families of those shot and killed .
Instead the State wants you to believe that the Iraq War is about patriotism , 9/11 , national pride , the campaign to make you safer , the administering of justice , manhood and courage , and all the rest of the cover-ups for what war really is : murder and destruction paid for by you and me and made legal solely because it is the State and not someone else doing it .
Take a picture of dead soldier , or the child of a killed Iraqi family , broadcast it on your blog , and what happens ?
Photo journalist Zoriah Miller has found out .
He was kicked out of his " embed , " which is the name for the pack of journalists permitted to travel with a group of soldiers and report what those in command want reported .
Afterwards , he was prohibited from traveling in any Marine - patrolled area of Iraq .
The military command worked to get him kicked out of the country altogether .
Yes , it all seems very pre-modern and primitive , and contrary to all our pieties about the free flow of information , the first amendment and all that .
But from the government ’s point of view , it is running the war , and it should control what people know about it to the same extent it controls everything else about the war .
As a result , after 4,000 dead soldiers , countless hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead , millions of wounded on all sides , there are only a handful of bloody pictures to be found anywhere .
Amazing is n’t it , just how effective the State can actually be when it cares intensely about something ?
And why does it care so much ?
One reason , they say , is that photos provide the enemy with information about the effectiveness of their attack and the response .
In effect , that ’s like claiming that anything but approved propaganda amounts to subversion and treason .
In any case , we can be pretty darn sure that when the enemy makes a hit , the enemy knows about it .
Another claim — and actually they have said the same thing from World War I until the present day — their main interest is in protecting the families of the dead from shock , privacy violation , and humiliation .
Maybe that sounds plausible , but another way to look at it is that the State is most especially interested in continuing to foster the myth that these kids are dying for their country , and there are no more important people to convince of that than the parents of the dead .
But actually , only the most naïve could possibly believe that this is what the rules are wholly about .
They want to protect the rest of us from reality .
The Vietnam war lost massive support at home when the military loosened up on photojournalism .
The handful of pictures we have from World War II all date from a period after FDR too bowed to public pressure .
At one level , it is pathetic that we need pictures to underscore what war is all about .
But since the ancient world , the masses at large have proven susceptible to believing every myth about the grandeur and glory of war .
We imagine that we as a people are going abroad to bring justice , truth , and liberty to some unenlightened and threatening foreign tribe .
This has been the constant theme since the ancient world .
Then we see the pictures .
It turns out that the unenlightened tribe is a collection of individuals pretty much like us .
They are made of flesh and blood , have families , worship God , and struggle with pretty much the same issues that all people everywhere have always struggled with .
There is no great glory in killing them , nor in being killed by them .
But the State says that sometimes war is necessary .
If our masters really believe that , why hide its costs ?
Let us see precisely what we are getting into here .
If it is justified , let us see why and how , and let us observe what we are giving up in exchange for the just war .
The truth is that the State must hide not only its wars but all of its activities .
It hides its inflation .
It hides the effects of its taxation and its protectionism .
It fears anyone who draws the cause - and - effect connection between its activities and their deleterious consequences for the rest of us .
It is the most destructive force in our world .
Because that truth is so momentous , the State does everything possible to hide the smallest drop of blood .
The State wants us to all go on with our lives , believing it , loving it , and seeing only the pictures it wants us to see .

Here is the Top 100 greatest quotes culled from fundamentalist Christian chat rooms , as compiled by FSTDT ( Fundies Say the Darndest Things ! ) forum .
Like this gem , for example :
One of the most basic laws in the universe is the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
This states that as time goes by , entropy in an environment will increase .
Evolution argues differently against a law that is accepted EVERYWHERE BY EVERYONE .
Evolution says that we started out simple , and over time became more complex .
That just is n't possible : UNLESS there is a giant outside source of energy supplying the Earth with huge amounts of energy .
If there were such a source , scientists would certainly know about it .

ATLANTA , Sept 30 ( Reuters ) -
The failure of a massive Wall Street bailout bill and a steep fall in the stock market was a price worth paying to stand up for principle , some conservatives said on talk radio shows on Tuesday .
Conservatives strongly oppose the rescue plan proposed last week by U.S. President George W. Bush , arguing that it amounts to government intervention in the free market and would misspend taxpayer money to help big banks .
They also say that Congress will live to regret passing the $ 700 billion bill so hastily and more time needs should be spent on a search for a solution that adheres to conservative ideals .
“ I ’m not particularly distressed that the bailout bill did not pass .
I want to see this thing ( the bill ) flesh itself out a little over a period of days , ” said talk show host Neal Boortz , who describes himself as a libertarian .
U.S. lawmakers in the House of Representatives rejected the package after a majority of House Democrats supported it but the majority of House Republicans opposed it .
The vote came as a shock to many and prompted one of the biggest plunges in stock prices in Wall Street history with all sides blaming each other for a failure to reach consensus .
While conservatives said they recognized the seriousness of the market ’s fall , they would hold fast to their principles that on the economy include low taxes , small government and fiscal responsibility .
“ I should n’t say this , but I ’m going to say it anyway .
Screw the market ! ....
OK , I ’ll take that back , not screw the market but let me tell you something , ” said conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh as part of his analysis of Monday ’s events .
“ When the government fails to pass a socialism bill and the market goes south , let it go south .
I do n’t want to pass a socialism bill just to protect the stock market , ” said Limbaugh , the most popular of the talk show hosts .
WANING POPULARITY
In an attempt to put further pressure on Congress when it reconvenes later in the week , Bush said on Tuesday the U.S. economy was depending on decisive action from the government or the economic damage could be “ painful and lasting . ”
But part of the problem for some conservatives was a lack of confidence in the president they once saw as a champion of their cause for his commitment to tax cuts and his firm response to the 9/11 attacks .
“ I do n’t trust you ( Bush ) and when you start screaming now of dire consequences if we do n’t get a bailout bill , I do n’t trust you .
I need convincing and apparently there are a lot of members of Congress who feel the same way , ” said Boortz in a view echoed by several of his listeners .
Callers also said they did not appreciate what they saw as scare tactics used by Bush and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson .
“ It almost sounds like they are demagoguing and preaching that the sky is falling , which makes me skeptical , ” said one caller .
Tens of millions of conservatives tune in to AM talk radio and trust its nationally syndicated hosts over media outlets they say have a liberal bias .
Several of the hosts say they are engaged in a long struggle to persuade the Republican Party and the country to return to its conservative roots and they see the bailout bill as an important trial of strength .

Dear Unnamed_Music_Service :
I visited your site after seeing the ad in The Nation magazine .
After I read your terms of service and your rate scale , I decided not to sign up ( and , not incidentally , NOT to steal your 25 free songs by canceling at once ) .
I thought you might like to know why .
Your subscriptions charge monthly fees ( or yearly fees ) and force users to lose their unused downloads at the end of each month .
You have transformed a straightforward financial arrangement into a gambling routine .
Were it not for that stipulation , I 'd gladly use your service .
But the prospect of paying for music I do n't download because I happen to be too busy in a particular month to visit your site and force myself to buy stuff does not appeal to me .
I have been teaching strategic applications of information technology since the 1980s and have been a programmer since 1965 ; I think your business model illustrates a poor grasp of how to use technology to your advantage .
It 's not as if our not buying the stipulated number of songs in a month costs you anything : on the contrary , you get free use of our money without having to give anything up .
Why not reconsider your terms ?
Why not let your accounting system simply keep increasing the total number of downloads if someone pays but does n't use the service for a while ?
Why have any cutoff at all – what have you got to lose ?
Your computer programs can easily be set to handle such accounting , and you would n't lose anything at all .
The business model that forces customers not to pile up huge numbers of unused credits for subscription products is rooted in real - world , physical inventory .
Allowing someone to build up an enormous supply of credit that they can cash in at any time could exhaust supplies of the products they buy , leaving a store unable to supply other customers .
But that issue simply does not apply to electronic intellectual property .
You do n't run out of copies of songs because someone buys 3,600 songs all at once after a year of accumulating credits .
Yes , you would have to pay royalties on the huge purchases , but if you set aside a portion of the unused credits to cover the necessary future expenditures , that money would earn interest while it waits .
You could draw on your reserves to pay for the sudden bursts of purchasing if that ’s what happens .
But how often do you think someone would pay indefinitely without downloading anything ?
Who would want to wait three years while paying monthly fees and never downloading a thing ?
In any case , your model of setting monthly and annual download targets with discounts based on volume is also rooted in the physical world .
Discounts in traditional bricks - and - mortar stores are based on lower overhead associated with bulk purchases ; it takes less work and costs less money to sell 1,000 items at once than to sell one item in 1,000 sales .
But again , in your world of electronic sales , you do n’t ( or should n’t ) care .
The costs charged by the credit - card companies are calculated on expense ; whether you bill $ 30 or $ 300 at a time , you still pay the same percentage .
And your computer time is a nearly fixed cost too : it ’s irrelevant whether your computers are storing one transaction record for 1,000 purchases or 1,000 records for individual purchases ( OK , there may technically be infinitesimal incremental costs for more orders – but not on the order of your discounts ) .
So the upshot of your business decisions is that you are force users into restrictions that you – and they – do n’t need .
I ’ve belonged to BMG Music Service , DVD Empire and Science Fiction Book Club for years and given them thousands of dollars of business – but none uses your extortionate terms .
And so right now , as I am writing this message , I am spending $ 30 to download three albums by Nightwish from iTunes - I 'd rather pay them more than be locked into a gambling routine by signing up with you .
You lose .
Best wishes ,

Voters and pundits hungry for the details of Barack Obama 's vision for America 's future got them on Thursday when Obama formally accepted his party 's presidential nomination , in an nearly 50 - minute address to a packed Denver stadium .
Obama hammered Republican rival John McCain and at the same time offered his policy prescriptions in matters of national security , taxation and energy , among other things .
With some notable exceptions , the early reaction from bloggers Thursday night was overwhelmingly positive .
" It was a deeply substantive speech , full of policy detail , full of people other than the candidate , centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety , " notes The Atlantic 's Andrew Sullivan , a disillusioned Republican and outspoken Obama admirer .
" What he did n't do was give an airy , abstract , dreamy confection of rhetoric , " Sullivan writes on his blog The Daily Dish .
" If the Rove Republicans thought they were playing with a patsy , they just got a reality check . "
Traffic on the micro- blogging service Twitter immediately surged in the wake of Obama 's speech , in which he officially became the first African American to win the nomination of the Democratic party .
More than 6,500 tweets poured through the service in just 20 minutes Thursday night – most of them brief , two - line assessments of Obama 's performance on a historic night , the 45th anniversary of civil rights leader Martin Luther King 's " I Have A Dream " speech .
( Obama is the most popular person on Twitter , according to the tracking service Twitterholics . )
" Obama nailed it tonight for me , " writes swhitley .
" I may not agree with all of his policies , but I think his message of hope for our country means more . "
" I want to have Barack Obama 's babies , " writes fluxrad .
And Brian Lerner tweeted , " It 's hard to imagine there are people in this country that can not at least feel inspired by Obama even if they do not plan to vote for him . "
Obama covered many of his key themes Thursday night , but there was an unusual fierceness to his oratory , which aimed at McCain 's record on specific issues like a guided cruise missile .
For example , among many other points , he asserted that McCain has sided with President Bush more than 90 percent of the time .
In addition , he addressed many of the criticisms of the Republicans , saying that he would cut taxes for middle - class families instead of raising them .
He also pledged to spend $ 150 billion over the next 10 years in renewable sources of energy , including wind and solar power as well as biofuels .
He predicted that that investment will lead to five million jobs that " pay well and can't ever be outsourced . "
Obama hit back at the Republicans on all of the major fronts on which they 've been attacking him , * The Atlantic '*s Sullivan notes : national security , his personal patriotism and his ability to relate to the average middle - class family .
" I 've said it before – months and months ago .
I should say it again tonight .
This is a remarkable man at a vital moment .
America would be crazy to throw this opportunity away .
America must not throw this opportunity away , " Sullivan concludes .
An Atlantic colleague of Sullivan 's was n't so generous .
Megan McArdle , who blogs on economics , blasted Obama 's promise to end America 's dependence on Middle East oil , dismissing as empty political rhetoric .
" It does n't matter what we do : drill , research alternative energy , raise
CAFE standards ... in 2018 , we 'll still be using oil , " writes McArdle on her blog Asymmetrical Information .
" Even if we discovered a magic source of clean renewable energy tomorrow , we 'd still be using a lot of oil , because transitions of that magnitude take time . "
Others , though , appreciated Obama 's unapologetic case for an active federal government – an unusual tact , they note , after decades of Democrats trying to campaign and win over what was an increasingly Republican - leaning electorate .
" From a Democratic perspective , he made the argument for government , something we have n't heard in a while , " writes Robert Arena , a web - marketing strategist who writes for the left - leaning AMERICAblog .
Obama " moved into ample detail on what he wants to do with the economy and made the case for a failed Bush / McCain foreign policy , " Arena wrote , voicing a common sentiment among Democratic bloggers .
" I 've been looking for the details for a while , and while not a wonky speech , there was enough there there to hang your hat on . "
" And , perhaps most importantly , he defended himself and put the screws to the Republican Party for the failure of the last eight years .
On the question of being ready to be commander in chief , Obama answered the question with a clarity and passion I have n't seen from him yet .
" All in all , a very Presidential speech . "

L’uomo ha da sempre inventato nuovi strumenti per misurare il tempo : dalla meridiana alla clessidra , dall ’ orologio ad acqua al pendolo dall ’ orologio al quarzo al cronometro fino all ’orologio atomico .
Solo recentemente qualcuno si è spinto a creare nuovi metodi di rappresentazione del tempo con l’Internet Time della Swatch o il più recente orologio con i numeri in binario ( come l’affascinante Binary Time della The One ) .
Ma questa volta un inventore , John Taylor ( supportato dall ’ autorevole presenza di Stephen Hawking ) , ha superato tutte le più assurde idee inventando un orologio che , secondo me , è stato reso complesso solo per il gusto di sfidare se stessi .
Se fosse un software a ragione lo avrebbero battezzato come “ inutility ” ma loro lo hanno chiamato , invece , “ Cronofago ” con un singolare richiamo etologico alla cavalletta che tutto distrugge , o “ Corpus Clock ” in onore dell ’Università a cui è stato donato .
Dal diametro di quasi 1,5 metri , l’orologio d’oro a 24 carati sul quale si muove la mega - cavalletta “ mangiatrice del tempo ” è stato realizzato in cinque anni grazie a sei diverse tecnologie brevettate , un affare che ha richiesto un milione di sterline , e che John Taylor ha donato al celebre ateneo britannico del Corpus Christi College e destinato ad essere piazzato all ’esterno della biblioteca del college .
Lo scopo di Taylor è stato quello cercare un modo per continuare a rendere interessante “ il tenere traccia del tempo ” in quanto “ gli orologi con le lancette sono noiosi ” , rendendo anche tributo a John Harrison , grande orologiaio del XVIII secolo che rivoluzionò la navigazione marittima dell ’epoca .
Caratteristiche
Il Cronofago si muove come un pendolo , al ritmo del movimento dell ’ insetto che vi poggia sopra ( invece del troppo classico cucù ) , mentre un complesso sistema di luci , o meglio di tagli luminosi , indica secondi , minuti ed ore che implacabili si susseguono .
Ecco un video che forse renderà bene l’idea di come funziona :
Insomma luci al posto delle lancette e ora esatta segnata solo ogni cinque minuti !
E’ facile , quindi , comprendere per quale motivo è stato definito come l’orologio più strano del mondo , sfidando tutti i preconcetti e le consuetudini riguardo alla misurazione del tempo .
Non ha lancette né numeri digitali e l’ora viene visualizzata attraverso una serie di luci che rappresentano ore , minuti e secondi .
Inoltre , il meccanismo è stato progettato specificamente per correre in maniera imprevedibile , rallentando e accelerando di tanto in tanto .
Molto interessante invece la sua autonomia , visto che il suo funzionamento è garantito da un motore elettrico che dovrebbe durare almeno 250 anni e che consuma l’equivalente di tre lampadine da 60 watt .
Curiosità sul ruolo di Hawking
Curioso invece come la notizia sia stata diffusa , su numerose testate giornalistiche , come l’orologio di Stephen Hawking : in realtà lui lo ha solo presentato ai giornalisti , mentre l’inventore e colui che lo ha pagato e donato , viene solamente citato tra le righe dell ’articolo .
E’ probabile che , se non ci fosse stata la sua presenza , forse questo orologio sarebbe stato classificato come una delle tante stramberie del genere umano , e comparendo nelle ultime pagine dei giornali , sarebbe stata presto dimenticata .
Invece , con un mentore di tale portata la notizia ha avuto , forse ingiustamente , risonanza mondiale ed eterna memoria .
Altrettanto curiosa è l’interpretazione che ne da lo stesso
Taylor , nel corso della conferenza stampa di presentazione della sua nuova invenzione , riguardo la cavalletta che sormonta l’orologio .
Oslo Mikrobryggeri
Bitter , at the brewpub
I did another post on this subject back in May 2006 , but since then I have done lots more ratings of Norwegian beer , and a number of new breweries have appeared , and so it seems about high time to revisit the subject .
The basis of this overview is 320 ratings of Norwegian beers , starting in September 2005 and ending yesterday .
The table was produced by downloading my ratings in a CSV from RateBeer , and then using a Python script to compute the averages .
My RateBeer ratings include ciders and perries ( pear ciders ) , but I 've filtered those out , since we 're really interested in beer here , and not other kinds of products .
So , without further ado , here is the table .
The " New " column has the number of new ratings from the brewery since the previous posting .
If empty , the brewery is new this time around .
The " Change " column has the change to the average since the previous posting .
Brewery Average Ratings New Change Nøgne Ø 3.73 22 +13 - 0.16 Haandbryggeriet 3.61 17 +10 - 0.08 Ølve på Egge 3.6 3 Valdres Gardsbryggeri 3.45 2 Lillehammer Bryggeri 3.45 4 Møllebyen Mikrobryggeri 3.27 14 Ægir Bryggeri 3.21 6 Oslo Mikrobryggeri 3.19 13 +9 - 0.10 Trondhjem Mikrobryggeri 3.12 7 Dalane Brygghus 3.1 4 Kalfaret Brygghus 2.95 4 Aass 2.94 33 +21 - 0.05 Berentsens Brygghus 2.92 9 +7 - 0.77 Mack 2.77 27 +19 - 0.12 Inderøy Gårdsbryggeri 2.71 6 Lervig Aktiebryggeri 2.68 5 Små Vesen Bryggeri 2.68 5 Hansa Borg 2.56 40 +19 - 0.13 Ringnes 2.49 58 +22 - 0.00 Grans 2.04 20 +12 - 0.15 Trio 1.93 3
The first thing to note is the number of new breweries .
Two years ago I had 10 breweries in the list , while this time around there are 21 .
( Two brewers , Atna and Baatbryggeriet , have gone out of business in the meantime , and are not in the table . )
Of the 12 new breweries , 5 are genuinely new , and 7 existed in 2006 without me having been able to find any of their beers .
Industrial beer en masse , Drammen , Norway
Another thing to note is that all the brewers ( except Ringnes ) have seen their average decline since 2006 .
This is probably because my ratings are now stricter than they were back then .
The declines are pretty small , however , so I do n't consider this a real problem .
( Berentsen is an exception , but this is because in 2006 I 'd only rated 2 of their best beers , and have since added 7 more , of which most are boring pilseners . )
As in 2006 the table divides almost completely into craft breweries at the top , and industrials at the bottom .
Aass is the first industrial ( as in 2006 ) , and below it are all industrials , except for Inderøy and Små Vesen , which are craft breweries .
Craft brewers
Nøgne Ø and Haandbryggeriet take the first two spots , just as they did in 2006 , and in my opinion ( which I think is generally shared ) this is entirely right .
The gap between them has closed a little , which is also fair , given that Haandbryggeriet has both improved their beers and started brewing more adventurous beers .
Having Ølve på Egge and Valdres Gardsbryggeri in third and fourth place respectively may not be entirely right , I have to confess , but note that they only have 3 and 2 beers each .
Both are older Norwegian micros , each with its own very distinctive style .
Ølve makes beers that are rather like the traditional Norwegian farm ales which predate the introduction of lager beers , while Valdres Gardsbryggeri make mild versions of the best - known English beer styles .
Both are very hard to find .
Lillehammer Bryggeri is a brewpub that started last year .
They have only shop strength beers , which for the moment are only sold in the brewpub .
We visited them earlier this year .
They are certainly every bit as good as Valdres , and probably better .
Møllebyen Mikrobryggeri is a brewpub in Moss I wrote about in 2006 and again in 2007 .
The brewery got a new brewer in late 2006 , and since then the beers have improved considerably .
Their beers are good , but generally very mild to cater to the local audience , and this has probably depressed their ranking somewhat .
Ægir Bryggeri is another brewpub that was started last year in Flåm , in the heart of the fjord country , by American Evan Lewis .
The six shop strength beers that have been distributed so far have been very competent US - style beers , and I 'm really looking forward to trying some stronger beers from this brewery .
The pub itself is also quite spectacular , as is its location , so another trip there ( it 's just my luck to have been in Flåm twice right before they opened ) would also be nice .
Oslo Mikrobryggeri and Trondheim Mikrobryggeri are two brewpubs owned by the same company , which make quite similar beers , mostly English beer styles .
Their beers are not bad , but could certainly be better , and I feel they belong here , near the bottom of the craft part of the table .
Dalane Brygghus is a new micro brewery from southwestern Norway , and so far I 've only tried find four of their beers ( procured through beer friends ) .
Two of these were near the mean in the table , one was well above , and one was well below .
So it 's a bit early to say definitively whether they are in the right spot in the table or not .
I look forward to trying more of their beers .
Industrial brewers
Norwegian beer
Above I implicitly said that Kalfaret Brygghus was a craft brewery , but this is disputable .
Kalfaret is a brewpub opened in the old Hansa brewery by Hansa ( see below ) , and while their beers are mostly English - style ales they are certainly brewed in an industrial interpretation of these styles .
So I would probably on balance consider them industrial , and I 'm reasonably happy with their position in the table .
Aass is one of the big five remaining traditional industrial brewers , but one that has stuck to its principles as a maker of relatively high - quality traditional industrial lagers .
They have a number of uninteresting products , as well as a few quite good ones .
Unlike in 2006
I 'm now pretty sure I consider them the best of the industrials , and I think they belong where they are in the table .
Berentsens Brygghus is a small family - run brewery in southwestern Norway that is actually over a century old .
As with Aass , their portfolio consists of both less interesting beers and some really good ones .
I particularly liked the Christmas beer they introduced last year .
Like Aass , they are a quality industrial producer , and I think they belong about where they are .
Mack is another of the big five remaining traditional industrial brewers , and has an additional claim to fame through being the northernmost brewery in the world .
They are also a quality industrial , although in my opinion not quite as good as Aass .
Inderøy Gårdsbryggeri is a new micro craft brewer , producing only shop - strength beers , and their ratings have suffered a bit for that .
So far their ratings have been mostly middling , but as they start hitting their stride I 'd expect them to creep up the list a bit .
Lervig Aktiebryggeri is a small industrial brewer from the Stavanger area , started in 2003 in protest against the acquisition of the local industrial brewer .
Unfortunately , it was decided to replace a worthless industrial brewer with a slightly more worthy industrial brewer , and so for people who care more about the taste than where the beer is made this was not much of a step forward at all .
Små Vesen is another new micro craft brewer .
The name literally means " Little Creatures " , and hints at the old folk belief that little fairy creatures were responsible for the fermentation of beer .
Their head brewer actually has a degree in wine production , and perhaps because of this their brews are much drier and more acidic than what is usual , which does not agree with everyone .
In addition they have — ironically , given the name — had problems with infections , which has hurt their ratings even more .
This is another craft brewer I expect will do better once they have settled in properly .
Hansa Borg is the second biggest national brewer .
Their products might perhaps be marginally better than those of the next entrant , Ringnes , which is the biggest national brewer .
Ringnes does have a few quite good products , but most products from both breweries are better passed over in silence .
Grans is another of the big industrial brewers , but was started in opposition to the market dominance of the traditional brewers .
Grans 's selling point is the price of their products , which is low .
Unfortunately , the ratings are likewise low ( notice the distance up to Ringnes ) .
I find that most of their products have a recognizable rubbery grainy character to them , and prefer to pay a bit more for my beers .
Trio is a small regional industrial , now owned by Mack , which has managed to achieve the rather dubious distinction of scoring even lower than Grans .
I think I shall be kind to them and not say any more .
Pilsener is water
Missing brewers
There are actually some Norwegian breweries missing from the above list , but now we are getting into the seriously obscure breweries , where you basically need a car and a couple of days off to be able to get hold of any of their products .
The missing ones are :
Det Lille Bryggeri , craft , 2 beers
Mo Laksegard , brewpub , 3 beers
Nordkapp Mikrobryggeri , brewpub , 1 beer
There exist a couple of even smaller breweries , in tourist cabins in the high mountains and so on , but I 'll pass over those for now .
Conclusion
In summing up , I think it 's fair to say that Norwegian brewing has made great strides forward in the two years since my last overview .
We have five new craft breweries , and have lost only two .
The distribution of the beers from the craft breweries has improved substantially , so that it 's now possible to get hold of beers from most of the craft breweries in Oslo .
The main thing that remains now is for the Norwegian public to wake up to the fact there exists beer other than poor industrial pale lager , but this process is likely to take several years still .

Every proposed equal custody or shared parenting bill I 've read has had a section on neglectful , abusive and uninterested parents .
No one in the family rights movement wants kids with abusers , of either gender .
And we would never force a child on an uninterested parent .
I am for equal parental rights , with equal physical and legal custody .

I understand these women have been wronged , as have their children .
But I stand by my belief that we should not have laws that hurt 95 % of the population , just to help 5 % .
We can still help these women without taking rights away from all fathers .
And that is exactly what we 've done with the Violence Against Women Act ( VAWA . )

" The Violence Against Women
Act is unconstitutional and full of misandry .
The organizations that profit from it openly discriminate against men .
They even have a network of feminist attorneys ready to fight any lawsuit brought by men to gain services .
And now we have The National Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network Act -- H.R. 6088 and S. 1515 -- recently introduced in Congress .
This bill would authorize $ 55 million for volunteer lawyers to help victims of domestic violence .
Let 's be very clear .
This would be for women .
And many would use it to take children away from good fathers .

Both ABC News and the Associated Press are reporting that if Sen .
Ted Kennedy ’s health allows it , he is going to Denver to make an appearance at the Democratic convention on Monday night .
The plan according to Rick Klein of ABC News is for Kennedy to take the stage after a tribute video to him directed by documentary filmmakers Ken Burns and Mark Herzog .
I would not expect Kennedy who is recovering from surgery related to a malignant brain tumor to give a speech .
The Senator is still gravely ill , and facing an uphill prognosis .
Kennedy ’s son Patrick told the AP that any appearance by the senator is subject to approval from his doctors , “ If anything , it ’d be an 11th - hour call .
If he ’s up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors , he might be able to pull it off . ”

It is impossible to understate the impact of a Ted Kennedy appearance at the convention .
Kennedy is the most beloved figure in the Democratic Party , and his presence at the convention , even for a brief time , would likely be the most emotional moment of the week .
Many pundits credit the endorsement of Kennedy for helping Barack Obama transform from an outsider candidate to Democratic presidential nominee .
The good news is that Kennedy will be back in the Senate in September , but it would be even better news if he could be at Denver to watch the man who he helped to become the 2008 Democratic nominee make history .

David Foster Wallace , the novelist , essayist and humorist best known for his 1996 novel “ Infinite Jest , ” was found dead Friday night at his home in Claremont , according to the Claremont Police Department .
He was 46 .
Jackie Morales , a records clerk at the department , said Wallace ’s wife called police at 9:30 p.m.
Friday saying she had returned home to find that her husband had hanged himself .
Wallace , who had taught creative writing at Pomona College since 2002 , was on leave this semester .
Times book editor David Ulin was in New York City for a National Book Critics Circle Board meeting Saturday .
“ What was a party is now a wake , ” Ulin said as the news of Wallace ’s death circulated .
“ People were speechless and just blown away .
“ He was one of the most influential and innovative writers of the last 20 years , ” Ulin said .
“ He is one of the main writers who brought ambition , a sense of play , a joy in storytelling and an exuberant experimentalism of form back to the novel in the late ‘ 80s and early 1990s , ” Ulin said .
“ And he really restored the notion of the novel as a kind of canvas on which a writer can do anything . ”
Wallace won a cult following for his dark humor and ironic wit , which was on display in “ The Broom of the System , ” his 1987 debut novel ; “ Girl With Curious Hair , ” a 1989 collection of short stories , and “ A Supposedly Fun Thing I ’ll Never Do Again : Essays and Arguments ” ( 1997 ) .
In 1997 , he also received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation .
A year earlier he shot to the top of the literary world with “ Infinite Jest , ” a sprawling , ambitious novel with a nonlinear plot that ran 1,079 pages and had nearly as many footnotes .
Critics marveled at the prodigious talent evident in his imaginative take on a future world , comparing him to Thomas Pynchon and John Irving .
In a 1996 profile in the New York Times Magazine , Frank Bruni wrote , “ Wallace is to literature what Robin Williams or perhaps Jim Carrey is to live comedy : a creator so maniacally energetic and amused with himself that he often follows his riffs out into the stratosphere , where he orbits all alone . ”
Other collections of fiction and nonfiction followed , including “ Brief Interviews With Hideous Men ” ( 1999 ) , “ Everything and More : A Compact History of Infinity ” ( 2003 ) and “ Oblivion ” ( 2004 ) .
In June , to coincide with this fall ’s presidential election , he reworked a 2000 essay about Republican candidate John McCain for a paperback published as “ McCain ’s Promise : Aboard the Straight Talk Express With John McCain and a Whole Bunch of Actual Reporters , Thinking About Hope . ”
Wallace was born Feb. 21 , 1962 , in Ithaca , N.Y. , and raised in Illinois , where his father taught philosophy at the University of Illinois and his mother taught English at a community college .
A talented tennis player as a youngster , Wallace attended Amherst College and majored in philosophy before switching his focus to writing fiction .
He graduated with a bachelor ’s degree in 1985 and turned his senior thesis into the basis for “ The Broom of the System . ”
After earning a master ’s degree in fine arts from the University of Arizona , Wallace began teaching writing at Illinois State University in Normal in 1993 .
In 2002 he was named the first Roy E. Disney professor of creative writing at Pomona College .
Gary Kates , the college ’s dean , called Wallace ’s death “ an incredible loss . ”
“ He was a fabulous teacher , ” Kates said Saturday .
“ He was hands - on with his students .
He cared deeply about them .
. . .
He was a jewel on the faculty , and we deeply appreciated everything he gave to the college . ”
In addition to his wife , Karen Green , and his parents , Wallace is survived by a sister .
A memorial service is planned at Pomona College .

Although ranked as only a level - one incident on a scale from zero to seven , Mr Borloo said he wanted government nuclear safety inspectors to look into the environmental conditions at all sites , in particular the state of the surrounding ground water .
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) --
Chinese officials said Saturday that 432 babies now have kidney stones after being fed with contaminated baby milk powder , the official Xinhua news agency reported .
One baby in Gansu province has died as a result of kidney stones related to the milk powder , the news agency said .
" It is a severe food safety accident , " senior Chinese health ministry official Gao Qiang told a news conference , in a statement reported by Xinhua .
The manufacturer has already recalled more than 8,200 tons of the tainted formula following reports of babies developing kidney stones , Xinhua said .
Sanlu Group , one of China 's leading dairy producers , has also sealed off more than 2,100 tons of contaminated product and another 700 tons still need to be recalled , the news agency said .
Chinese police have questioned 78 people -- including dairy farmers and milk dealers -- about the contamination , a Chinese official told Xinhua earlier Saturday .
Sanlu would not say whether its own employees are being investigated , Xinhua said .
Testing by Sanlu found tripolycyanamide , also known as melamine , in 700 tons of its product , the news agency reported .
Zhao told the news agency that the suspects added water to the milk they sold to Sanlu to make more money , then added the chemical so the diluted milk could still meet standards .
Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones , urinary tract ulcers , and eye and skin irritation .
The chemical is commonly used in coatings and laminates , wood adhesives , fabric coatings , ceiling tiles and flame retardants .
Hundreds of Wal - Mart and Carrefour stores in China are pulling the Sanlu milk powder from their shelves , Xinhua said .

As Washington attempts to crack down on speculation in food , fuel and metals , Wall Street is rolling out new ways to bring in money .
In May , Credit Suisse Group and Deutsche Bank AG began offering investments in iron ore , a key component of steel .
Iron ore is mined copiously -- about one billion tons a year -- but is n't traded on a futures exchange .
So it has been virtually impossible for speculators to bet on price movements .

The Lite - Brite is one of my fondest childhood toy memories .
Maybe it was the fact that it was THE original way to make pixel art .
Or maybe it was the “ living on the edge ” thrill that any minute I could choke on one of the of hundreds of tiny candy - like pegs .
Delicious .
Of course , the biggest problem with the original was the fact that you could n’t do particularly detailed drawings , and its clear that the guys at Japan ’s Bandai channeled their frustration into the design of their new Luminodot .
The Luminodot has an insanely dense grid of capable of holding about 3500 light pegs ( more than twice as many as the original Lite - Brite ) .
Thanks to its grid of 70 x 50 individually addressable locations , you can create much more detailed scenes than you could ever with the original .
The Luminodot features a bright LED backlight , which not only offers full - on illumination , it can be set to sequence through one of 25 animated light patterns too .
In addition to a handful of included designs ( and additional image packs you can buy ) , the best part is that you can create your own custom pixel pictures thanks to an online PDF template generator .
Bandai ships 1600 pins ( in 12 colors ) with each Luminodot , so if you want to fill in the entire board with color , you ’ll have to buy some spare pegs too .
While the Luminodot is n’t officially available outside of Japan , I did manage to find one for sale over on eBay for $ 128 USD .
On the other hand , if you happen to live in the area , you can order one from Amazon Japan on sale for ¥ 10,035 ( appx $ 96 USD ) .
Assuming you can read Japanese , you can find out more over at Bandai ’s Luminodot website .
America ’s chickenhawks are ready to turn Georgia into a nation of missing - relative - seeking refugees .
I ’d hate to be Georgia right now .
So many American pundits have plans for the Georgians , brilliant schemes designed to get Georgia into a big war with the Russians .
“ Here ’s what you oughta do … . ”
It ’s like listening in on bar talk — some drunk trying to talk a 98 - pound weakling into a rematch with the hulking thug who just put him on the floor .
Funny thing , they never want to prove their theory themselves .
The backseat generals started early .
On August 16 , a week after the fighting between Russian and Georgian troops started , the neocon magazine Weekly Standard featured a chirpy , upbeat article listing all the hardware we could ship to the Georgians to help them fight a nice , long , bloody guerrilla war .
It was classic Tom Clancy stuff , all based on the idea you make war with stuff , not people .
These guys just wo n’t face the fact that for the guerrilla , the key weapon , the only weapon that matters , is people — and starting a guerrilla war means sentencing most of the people in your address book to a very nasty death .
Now we ’ve got Sarah Palin , everybody ’s favorite sniper - mom , volunteering to go to war with Russia over South Ossetia .
As far as I know , Palin is n’t volunteering to go there herself .
She sticks to targets that do n’t shoot back , like moose .
But then that ’s what all these eager volunteers have in common : none of them are actually going to go over and fight the Russians themselves , and as far as I know none of them even thought about asking the poor Georgians whether they ’re up for the sheer Hell of a guerrilla war .
All the Georgians wanted was to join NATO , make a little money and maybe get a used car .
They ’re like a guy who joins the Army for a college scholarship and finds himself on the front lines — except they ’re not even in NATO yet .
We ’re volunteering them to make the ultimate sacrifice and we have n’t even let them in the club yet .
The absolute craziest cheerleading came out of an article in DoD buzz by Greg Grant , quoting an anonymous Department of Defense source who wants Georgia to become the new Hezbollah .
Greg ’s anonymous warmonger got a big , way - too - enthusiastic boost from Noah Schachtman who writes for this lame - named war site , “ The Danger Room , ” in Wired magazine .
His article , “ Should Georgia Become A Black Sea Hezbollah ? ” seems to come up with a gung - ho answer , basically , “ Sure ! Do it ! ”
Wrong question , and definitely wrong answer .
I ’m pretty sure if you asked any Georgians , they ’d screech , “ Agh ! No !
We do n’t want to live like Hezbollah , cowering in our huts under constant bombardment , raising kids with no prospects but martyrdom ! ”
But then the neocons have n’t asked anybody in Georgia .
Safe in their living rooms , they think it ’d be a great idea for Georgia , a very unwarlike little middle - class country , to try to imitate the Lebanese Shia who make up Hezbollah ’s suicide squads .
The strangest thing about these articles is that they just drip admiration for Hezbollah .
It ’s weird to find American defense pundits praising Hezbollah all of a sudden .
I ’ve been talking up Hezbollah ’s military wing for years , and all I got was a lot of abuse .
Back when Israel and Hezbollah fought in 2006 , every mainstream military pundit was assuring America that Israel would soon drive Hezbollah out of South Lebanon .
I said no chance , and eventually , without admitting they were wrong and I was right , the pundits have changed their minds .
Now they just love Hezbollah and want our poor Georgian allies to imitate Hezbollah .
But these armchair Rambos just do n’t get it .
You ca n’t take a peace - loving , middle - class Georgian and make him into a Hezbollah guerrilla .
You have to start with the right kind of people , because guerrilla war — I keep having to repeat this — is about people .
It ’s not gadgets , it ’s not clever strategies , it ’s not a McGyver episodes .
It ’s being willing to accept a level of misery and death the average American can’t imagine .
Wo n’t imagine .
That ’s what it takes .
That ’s why I knew Hezbollah would win the 2006 war with Israel : because they have been through decades of misery , cluster bombs raining down on their miserable villages , raids by the proxy - force South Lebanon Army — and through it all , Hezbollah has been doing the slow , boring work of organizing the dirt - poor Shia , providing basic services , suffering with them and preparing them for the big fight .
That ’s what makes a good guerrilla army : misery channeled into paramilitary organization .
That ’s what made it possible for the Shia to force the Israelis out of Lebanon , and then fight them to a stalemate when they tried to come back in 2006 : because they ’d been living rough , poor and hopeless for a long time , then had that misery turned into a coldblooded willingness to die .
That ’s the un-cool , no - fun side of guerrilla warfare : the guerrillas lose way , way more people than the armies fighting them .
And it ’s not just the terrible deaths , it ’s the sheer misery , years of it , that leads up to those deaths .
Maybe these gung - ho guys who want the Georgians to start a guerrilla war could just stop a second and imagine what it ’s actually like to live through that kind of Hell .
We ’ll start with the relatively light stuff .
If you ’re a family from an insurgent area , the first thing you notice is that you no longer have electric light or running water .
It ’s standard counterinsurgency practice to bomb insurgent communities ’ water and power sources .
We generally just flick past that part of the news stories to more “ serious ” things , like casualty figures .
But it ’s not so trivial if you ’ve ever tried to live without water and power , especially when you ’re trying to take care of kids .
They do n’t bomb the power plant by accident , or because they ’re bad people .
It ’s standard counterinsurgency pratice to make life unbearable for the civilians who back the guerrillas .
The enemy escalates your misery , day after day , from cutting off your medical supplies , power and water to random artillery strikes and air attacks on anybody who goes outside to get a loaf of bread .
Then come the kidnappings , the reprisal killings , the massacres .
Again : not accidental “ atrocities ” but standard military practice .
There ’s a standard figure for guerrilla warfare that for every soldier the guerrillas kill , they can expect to lose ten people from their own community .
But that ’s a very conservative figure .
It can go much , much higher .
It ’s a lot easier to kill the civilians who support the guerrillas than to catch the guerrillas themselves .
That ’s how the British brought the Boers to the negotiating table : could n’t catch the Boer guerrillas so they put the whole Boer civilian population in concentration camps to die of every African plague they had going .
Worked real well : 25 % of the whole Boer population died and the Boer guerrillas out in the veldt went insane with grief , gave up the war — which they were winning , militarily .
Think of all the people you know , everybody in your family , and randomly cross out a quarter of their pictures from your little family album .
That ’s the price Georgia would pay if they were foolish enough to listen to Wired magazine .
If neocons have their way , Georgian civilians will wind up like Chechens on justsickshit.com
It comes down to pure , grim arithmetic : the size of the civilian population backing the guerrillas , their birth rate , and the size and birth rate of the enemy army .
And from that perspective things look very bad for Georgia .
There are more than 140 million people in Russia and Moscow has had no problem recruiting mercenaries , “ kontraktniki , ” to serve in Chechnya .
They ’ve done it so well in Chechnya that they ’ve just about killed off all the Chechen males of military age .
You can do that with small populations .
It ’s what we did by proxy in El Salvador , a nice small country , and it ’s what the Russians would do in Georgia if the Georgians really were stupid enough to play Red Dawn with them .
Here ’s what these American Hezbollah fans ’ daydream would mean if you ’re a Georgian civilian during an anti-Russian insurgency : the door gets kicked in at 3 am and a squad of mercenaries comes in firing from the hip .
If your family does n’t die in their beds it ’s because the contraktniki have a use for some or all of you .
The uses can be gang - rape if you ’re a woman or girl , ransom if they think you or your relatives have money , or interrogation if you were unlucky enough to grow up with some of the local insurgents .
It does n’t matter to them if you ’re a pacifist , if you ’ve spent your life avoiding the local hotheads who run the insurgency .
They ’re going to torture you anyway , and whether you talk or not they ’re going to kill you when they ’re done , most likely in some way involving power drills or gasoline because that ’s also standard counterinsurgency practice .
And even when you ’re dead they ’re not through with you .
They ’re going to drive an army truck up to your family ’s shattered house next morning and dump your body in the mud outside so your mother and sister can see exactly what they did to you .
Hezbollah was able to endure the misery of guerrilla war for a lot of reasons — none of which apply to Georgia at all .
Hezbollah ’s backers are impoverished Shia Muslims , who are in love with martyrdom , have no possessions to speak of , and have a very high birth rate .
It may sound brutal , but high birthrates are basic to guerrilla war , for the simple reason that a lot of people are going to be massacred — dozens of your people for every enemy soldier the guerrillas kill .
The Georgian bithrate is very low , 10.87 per thousand .
That ’s barely better than Germany ( 9.35 ) and about half of Lebanon ’s — and the Shia population has a much higher rate than the overall Lebanese rate .
The Chechens are another people with a very high birth rate , the highest by far of any former Soviet people .
But the total size of the population matters too .
the Chechen population is small enough that the Russians have simply killed most of the young men willing to fight them , because there are ( or were ) only about 1.5 million Chechens .
Georgia is also a very small country , with a total population of 4.6 million .
The Georgians just are n’t the kind of desperate , poor community that can handle a guerrilla war .
Georgians always have had a rep for smart businessmen .
All they wanted was to join NATO and have decent lives ; they did n’t sign up to go through what the Shia or the Chechens have suffered .
They ’re not desperate or young or crazy enough for a guerrilla war , luckily for them .
I ’ve been wondering why so - called “ experts ” just do n’t understand the sheer Hell involved in starting a guerrilla war .
I think one reason is that we take the American Revolution as the classic example of guerrilla fighting .
Well , it was n’t typical .
It was the cleanest - fought semi- guerrilla war in history .
Except for “ Bloody ” Tarleton in the Carolinas , the Brits fought relatively cleanly against us , for the simple reason that the rebels were white English - speaking Protestants the redcoats had been going to dances with a few months earlier .
That ’s not how most counterinsurgency armies fight , and it sure is n’t typical of British counterinsurgency .
Ask the Kikuyu , or the Boers , even the Scots , about that .
In the English Civil War , both sides fought pretty clean while it was English - on - English , but when Cromwell ’s army headed north to crush the Scots ’ rebellion , they took mighty few prisoners .
And when they crossed over to Ireland — ugh , you do n’t wanna know .
The Russians , the opponent these armchair guerrillas are setting little Georgia up to fight , are n’t even squeamish about massacring their own people , let alone foreign insurgent civilians .
You ’d think people would know that , after what ’s happened in Chechnya over the last 14 years of war .
The Chechens say they lost at least 100,000 dead in the First Chechen War alone .
Nobody ’s sure how many have died in the Second Chechen War , but we know they died in really horrible ways , because this was a war between death squads , Russian and Chechen death squads looking for anybody who they thought supported the other side .
Those people were snatched , died in sheer agony , and either did n’t get found or were dumped where their families could find them , just for the horror of it .
And those who survived had sufferings of their own .
Rape is basic strategy in this kind of war , and so is burning houses and driving civilian populations from their homes .
At least one third of the total Chechen population had to flee their homes at least once .
After years of fighting the Russians , there are so few men of military age left in Chechnya that the insurgents have to drop their Islamic rules and let Chechen war widows volunteer for suicide missions , like the group that occupied a Moscow musical theater in 2002 .
By the time a “ war widow ” is ready to take over a Moscow theatre and plant bombs around the exits , she ’s seen a lot more than her husband ’s death .
She ’s lived through something that we ca n’t even imagine .
In fact , guys like these so - called experts at Wired seem to be trying real hard not to imagine what would happen to the Georgians if they took this insane advice .
It ’s way more fun , I guess , if you do n’t think too hard about what you ’re asking these people to do .

About the author
( NewsTarget )
The FDA is supposed to protect our pet 's food .
Congress took note of the deadly pet food recall last year and mandated the FDA to clean up its act .
Human food and pet food regulations are supposed to be updated and in working order by September 2009 according to the Amendments Act .
I have my doubts .
The list below doescome directly from the FDA in exact words , yet it is a fair interpretation of how the FDA acts in caring for the safety of our pet 's food and treats .
1. All U.S. pet foods are safe - and will continue to be safe .
We have everything under control .
2 .
The pet food recall last year wasour fault - China did it .
We do not think it 's necessary to restrict Chinese imports or label pet foods with information that some ingredients might come from China .
China has taken measures to prevent this from ever happening again .
We trust Chinese imports .
Besides , around 1 % of all imported products are inspected by the FDA .
We have everything under control .
3 . U.S. pet owners should not be concerned that sick , diseased cattle and other animals are processed into pet food .
Even though the FDA currently considers sick , diseased cattle to be Specified Risk Materials to spread mad cow disease and we are aware that cats around the world have contracted the feline version of this disease , we do not believe they are a risk for use in pet foods .
The FDA has been told by pet food industry stakeholder groups that Specified Risk Materials - animal materials at risk to spread mad cow disease - are too costly to destroy .
We trust the advice of these stakeholder groups and agree that the cost to destroy these risk materials is too high .
Sorry , but pet food is the only place to discard specified risk materials .
We consider Specified Risk Materials safe for your pet to consume .
We have everything under control .
4 . Pentobarbital - the drug used to euthanize animals including pets - is safe for pets to consume .
Yes , we are aware that our neighbor government agency , the Fish and Wildlife Agency , reports that over 100 Bald and Golden Eagles have died recently from eating a euthanized animal .
The FDA did a lengthy and complete 8 week study and we determined there is no risk to pets consuming this lethal drug over a lifetime .
We have everything under control .
5 .
The FDA has no idea how the euthanizing drug pentobarbital gets into pet food .
We are aware that there is some significant evidence that euthanized pets are rendered ( cooked ) and put back into pet food .
We have spent a great deal of tax payer money developing testing procedures to determine the species source of the drug .
Our test results found nothing ... well , to be more specific , we spent a great deal of our limited budget trying to quiet the rumors that euthanized dogs and cats are processed into pet food ... but , we failed .
We cannot say for certain where or how pentobarbital gets into many popular brands of pet foods .
However , we firmly believe the information that pet food industry stakeholder groups tell us - pentobarbital in pet food is not from rendered euthanized dogs and cats .
Pet owners should not be concerned how pentobarbital gets into pet food nor which pet foods contain euthanized animals .
We have everything under control .
6 .
The FDA finds it completely acceptable for a pet food to make the claim ' Premium ' or ' Choice ' on the label even if the food contains chicken feet and cow intestines .
Our pets in the U.S. are so fortunate ; we understand that chicken feet and cow intestines are considered a delicacy in some countries .
The FDA provides a confusing explanation on pet food labels on our website , but we feel the following sums it up : " The pet food label contains a wealth of information , if one knows how to read it .
Do not be swayed by the many marketing gimmicks or eye - catching claims . "
We have everything under control .
7 .
Should any pet owner feel the FDA is not completely looking out for the best interest of U.S. pets , please note that the FDA leaves most decisions regarding the rules and regulations of pet food to AAFCO ( American Association of Feed Control Officials ) .
Since the pet food industry stakeholder groups provide AAFCO with the same valuable advice they provide us , in fact members of these stakeholder groups sit on the Advisory Boards to AAFCO - the FDA feels confident that AAFCO has everything under control .
Should you still feel the FDA is not doing enough to protect your pet , we provide you with the same response we give whenever we are questioned about our ability to protect human and pet food : " We do n't have the funding or the manpower " .
If it was n't so sad , the real life condition of pet food seems almost like it 's been taken straight out of the pages of some script from a twisted humor television show .
My guess would be that the FDA does consider they have ' everything under control ' and that all U.S. pet foods are safe .
Many doubt that .
It 's not rocket science to understand that a quality piece of meat is far more nutritious for your pet than chicken feet and / or cow intestines .
And even more so , it does n't take a rocket scientist to understand that sick , diseased animals or euthanized animals ( especially the possibility of euthanized pets ) should never be processed into pet food .
The good news ( honestly ) is that there are some high quality pet foods out there that do not use these types of inferior ingredients .
It takes a small amount of effort to find them , but the rewards are obvious .
Wishing you and your pet the best , Susan ThixtonSusan Thixton has an international pet people following providing dog and cat lovers a trusted source for pet food and pet food ingredient information .

I am not advising anyone to renounce their citizenship and I suggest that you think about it carefully before renouncing .
Get professional legal advice .
However , more and more Americans are voting with their feet , because they feel , as I do , that the USA is no longer the same country , into which they were born .
Fortunately for me , I have been offered and have accepted Swiss citizenship .
Fortunately for you , if you have European ancestors , you have the possibility of obtaining a European citizenship , quite easily .
For instance , proof that a grandparent was born in Germany will gain you German citizenship , from any German conulate or embassy , at the cost of $ 35 and 25 minutes of your time .
If you have a great - grandfather , who was born in Italy , you may become a citizen of Italy .
If you have any Irish grandparent , Ireland will register you as a foriegn birth and you are Irish , by birth .
If that Irish ancestor lived in Ireland , while the Brittish were occupying , as mine were , you also qualify for Brittish citizenship .
But , why would you opt for the surveillance society ?
I have not renounced my US citizenship , yet .
I try to be prepared and keep my options open .
Lately , as a result of the Bush policies , I find myself ashamed to admit my US origins .
If Snow White and the Dwarf win the next presidential election , I 'll be filing my renunciation on 5 November .
UPDATE : I have renounced my US citizenship after realizing that Obama was a Trojan horse .
Read about Getting Out .
The documents you need to renounce US citizenship are :
New development : Descendants of Spaniards who left the country for fear of political persecution or economic hardship between 1936 and 1955 will now be able to apply for nationality before 2011 .
Spain 's government has said those who accept any offer of citizenship would not be required to give up their current passports .
Any questions ??
In the lifetime of anyone younger than about fifty , the Canadian flag has always been its current simple , yet bold and distinctive , red - and - white maple leaf design .
And those who were n’t around for the Canadian flag debate of the mid-1960s may find it difficult to believe how controversial the adoption of this seemingly innocuous flag truly was ; how contentious and divisive a move it was for Prime Minister Lester Pearson to stand before a Royal Canadian Legion convention in May 1964 and say : “ I believe most sincerely that it is now time for Canadians to unfurl a flag that is truly distinctive and truly national in character ; as Canadian as the maple leaf which should be its dominant design , a flag easily identifiable as Canada ’s ; a flag which cannot be mistaken for the emblem of any other country ; a flag of the future which honours also the past ; Canada ’s own and only Canada’s . ”
At the time of Confederation in 1867 , Canada ’s official flag was the Royal Union flag , commonly known as the Union Jack .
Over the course of the next century , the Red Ensign — a red flag with a Union Jack in the canton and the Canadian coat of arms in the fly — became the de facto ( if unofficial ) Canadian flag :
( Not until 1924 did an order - in - council sanction the flying of the Red Ensign from Canadian government buildings abroad , and another twenty years elapsed before a second order - in - council authorized its use on federal government buildings within Canada . )
As the issue of a new national flag for Canada was raised anew in 1964 , all the usual difficulties involved in choosing a suitable design resurfaced .
What kind of flag could both honor Canada ’s historical past , look forward to its future , and appeal to a majority of modern Canadians ?
What elements would satisfy Canadians of both English heritage and French heritage , as well as those who were neither ?
Given how starkly Canadians were divided along demographic and ethnic lines , the chances of reaching a consensus on a new national flag often seemed hopeless .
Many English Canadians , particularly those born before World War II , wanted to retain the Red Ensign to preserve both tradition and a visible symbol of Canada ’s British heritage , while many French Canadians were opposed to ( exclusively ) retaining colonial symbols such as the Union Jack .
The roughly one - third of Canadians who were neither of French nor British lineage tended to prefer a flag that was uniquely Canadian , and younger Canadians ( those born after World War II ) were likely to opt for something new and different that completely broke with the past .
After weeks of parliamentary debate , the flag question was finally referred to a fifteen - member , all - party committee in September 1964 — a risky move , given that twice before ( in 1925 and again in 1945 - 46 ) committees tasked with choosing a new Canadian flag had been derailed by political squabbling .
Over the next several weeks , the Flag Committee sifted through about 2,000 designs that were submitted to them directly , as well as another 3,900 or so that reached them through other means ( including designs considered by a previous parliamentary flag committee in 1946 ) .
As author Rick Archbold noted :
Many of these flags bore Union Jacks and fleur - de-lys .
Quite a few featured a beaver , including one wearing a Mountie hat ; another one showed an adult beaver encircled by ten smaller ones ( Canada and its provinces ) .
Other wild creatures included Canada geese , grizzly bears , moose , salmon , bison , caribou .
The North Star was a popular emblem , as was the cross .
Several designs included aboriginal symbols .
And one , submitted by the self - proclaimed “ Society for the Suppression of Blue Lines ” of Toronto , consisted of “ crossed red hockey sticks rampant ” and a single hockey puck .
A major hurdle was settling on a central representative symbol for Canada that would meet with the approval of most Canadians .
A beaver was a popular choice , but it proved unsatisfactory for reasons described by Archbold :
The beaver was in many ways lacking as a potential national symbol .
Graphically it makes an awkward image .
Apart from being regularly skinned for profit , it is most noted for its engineering prowess .
But the beaver is also a destructive creature , seen as a pest by those trying to clear and settle the land .
It creates swamps where they are not wanted and consumes useful hardwood .
Besides , why would a self - respecting country adopt a rodent with buck teeth and an outlandish tail — a cartoon animal that , some allege , consumes its own testicles when threatened and occasionally forgets to get out of the way of a tree it has felled — as the image it projects to the world ?
Sir Sandford
Fleming put it even more caustically back in 1893 , when he observed that “ There are other members of the same natural order ( Rodentia ) , such as rats and mice , not less active and industrious than the beaver , and for this quality alone no one would dream of selecting one of these vermin for our national emblem . ”
The sugar maple leaf was an obvious choice as a symbol that had long been used to represent Canada , but even that option had its detractors .
Former prime minister John Diefenbaker protested that with a maple leaf flag motif incorporated the flag would convey “ no recognition of history ; no indication of the existence of French and English Canada [ or ] the partnership of the races ; no acknowledgement of history . ”
Other critics complained that the maple leaf was not a truly national symbol because the sugar maple tree did not grow west of the Ontario / Manitoba border , and that “ the maple leaf flag is neither [ unmistakably Canadian nor a unifying force ] .
Its only advantage is that it is innocuous ; that it produces tepid approval , mild disapproval , or indifference ; that it can therefore be adopted without any display of strong feeling whatever . ”
But , as Rick Archbold observed , the innocuous nature of the maple leaf also made it a highly appealing and powerful symbol for a new Canadian national flag :
When you think about the sugar maple leaf , you begin to understand how it won almost by default .
Among our native trees , it and the oak carry perhaps the most ubiquitous and distinctive leaves , shapes instantly recognizable and easy to remember .
But the maple leaf is more symmetrical than the oak and turns bright red , not dingy brown , each fall .
The real plus for the maple leaf was its very lack of an established personality and its innocence of mythic or commercial associations .
At a time when fierce tribal and religious loyalties repeatedly threatened the survival of the young dominion , anyone could look at the maple leaf and see an unassuming , neutral symbol that posed no threat to his or her identity or interests .
Maybe the maple leaf emerged at the top of the symbolic heap because it was the perfect , perhaps the prototypical , Canadian compromise .
After several weeks and thirty - five sessions , the Flag Committee finally narrowed its choices to fifteen designs , which were grouped into three categories : designs incorporating a three - maple - leaves - on - a - stem motif , designs featuring a single maple leaf , and designs incorporating “ symbols of other countries ” ( the Union Jack and the fleur - de - lys ) .
Via a “ mind - numbing series of secret ballots , ” the committee then selected a single design from each category to put to a final , sudden - death secret ballot :
The so - called “ Pearson Pennant ” ( a three - leaf design favored by Prime Minister Lester Pearson ) , a flag with a single stylized maple leaf , and a similar single maple leaf design which also incorporated the Union Jack and the fleur - de-lys :
The Pearson Pennant looked too much like a Liberal Party flag to be acceptable to a majority of the committee members , and the third finalist was regarded as an ungainly compromise that pleased only the Tories , so the single stylized maple leaf motif won the day .
After a month ’s cooling - off period , the House of Commons took up the final stage of the flag debate at the end of November 1964 .
Despite a fourteen - day filibuster by disgruntled Tories , the flag issue was finally put to a vote on 15 December 1964 , and the Flag Committee ’s recommendation was accepted by a vote of 163 to 78 .
Two months later , on the morning of 15 February 1965 , the Red Ensign was officially lowered for the last time from a special flagstaff erected in front of the Peace Tower on Ottawa ’s Parliament Hill , and then , on the stroke of noon , the red - white - red rectangle with a maple leaf was raised in its place .
Finally , Canada had a new flag .
The urge to find additional , hidden meanings in national symbols is a powerful one , and in the years since the adoption of the new Canadian flag , claims have been advanced that the number of points ( 11 ) on the stylized maple leaf it features has a special significance :
It represents the Canadian provinces and territories ( one point for each of the ten provinces , with an extra point for the territories ) , or it represents ten provinces and one country ; or it represents Canada ’s eleven governments ( ten provincial and one federal ) :
There ’s been some speculation that the eleven points on the maple leaf on the flag of Canada , nine above and two below , stood in some way for the number of provinces and territories in Canada .
Others have speculated the 11 points represent 10 provinces and one country , but again , this is only rumour .
These claims are all a bit contrived ( Canada had two territories when the maple leaf flag was adopted , and the territories themselves have governments as well ) , and they are easily dismissed .
The design shown above that was selected as the Flag Committee ’s recommendation is n’t quite the design that was ultimately adopted , for it bears a maple leaf with thirteen points .
That the final version featured an eleven - point leaf was coincidental rather than intentional , the result of a slight modification undertaken during the cooling - off period between the committee ’s final decision and the beginning of parliamentary debate :
She really is that big an idiot :
Sarah Palin told a customer at a Philadelphia restaurant on Saturday that the United States should “ absolutely ” launch cross - border attacks from Afghanistan into Pakistan in the event that it becomes necessary to “ stop the terrorists from coming any further in , ” a comment similar to the one John McCain condemned Barack Obama for making during last night ’s presidential debate .
During Friday ’s debate , Obama criticized the Bush administration for sending billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan without ridding the border region of terrorists .
“ If the United States has al Qaeda , bin Laden , top - level lieutenants in our sights , and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act , then we should take them out , ” Obama added .
McCain fired back hard , arguing that newly elected Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari has had his “ hands full ” and suggesting that Obama ’s tough talk was naïve .
“ You do n’t say that out loud , ” McCain said .
“ If you have to do things , you have to do things , and you work with the Pakistani government . ”
Palin ’s apparent disagreement with McCain ’s position on Pakistan came as the Alaska governor was picking up a couple of cheesesteaks at Tony Luke ’s in South Philadelphia .
She was approached by a man wearing a Temple University t- shirt , who later identified himself as Michael Rovito .
The family have seen police video footage of the final moments leading up to his death and claim that he posed no " imminent risk " , having not fired his weapon for 20 minutes when he was shot dead .
Although most of the stuff on this site is funny , this video is not meant to be funny in any way .
It was taken from Bahrain TV and features a cleric explaining the guidelines / rules for beating your wife .
Quickly , here are the main points :
No blood .
No bruises .
Ca n’t hit the face .
Ca n’t break any bones .
Not in front of the kids .

Two major global energy companies are supporting and promoting Iran by sponsoring a conference being held in Tehran .
The goal of the conference is to promote “ gas export opportunities and potentials of the Islamic Republic of Iran “ .
The conference is being held under the backing of The National Iranian Gas Export Company and is scheduled for October 4th through 5th .
Multi-National company Shell Oil , and Austrian based OMV , are sponsoring the event .
Stop the Bomb , an Austrian non-partisan activist coalition and the U.S. Anti-Defamation League are gaining international coverage for their strong stance against these major energy companies participating in this event .
There has been a world wide effort to “ isolate Iran ” due to their being the “ leading state - sponsor of terrorism and human rights violations ” .
The EU and UN have both planned to cut back business ties with Iran .
The Austrian government owns 31.5 percent of the OMV company and Stop the Bomb is furious about OMV ’s involvment in this Iranian event .
As an EU member state and a UN member nation , Austria is undermining the effort of the EU and UN in regards to Iran .
Both OMV and Shell have corporate human rights pledges ( OMV , Shell ) .
Neither company will comment when asked if supporting Iran through this event violates their prospective human rights pledges .
Haaretz reports the OMV deal was signed in April 2007 , and was met with criticism from Austria .
But Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer , asked by the Austrian daily Die Presse how the deal squares with his Social Democratic Party ’s tradition of “ human rights before business , ” responded : “ The tradition never held true . ”
The Iranian company that is holding the event is state owned making this event and participation in it direct support of the the state of Iran , not merely an economic or energy event .
A Far News Agency report states that China , Italy , France and Spain are all involved with Iran and the exploration for oil and gas .
Shell and OMV are currently in the spotlight however there are many other countries and companies making plans to work with Iran regarding oil and gas exploration .
How far will this go ?
Empowering Iran for the purposes of obtaining oil .
As we prepare to elect a new president here in the U.S. , an important issue is our own dependence on foreign oil and our pursuit for energy independence .
As we watch countries and companies defy their own agreements regarding human rights and pursue relationship with Iran , we can turn our thoughts to our own situation .
Will we remain at a stand still arguing over oil or will we embrace a balanced approach to pursue our own resources in combination with alternative energy options ?
I believe we have the ingenuity and competence as a country to responsibly pursue energy independence .

The BBC video here was aired two days before Russia intervened to stop Georgia ’s ethnic cleansing operation in South Ossetia .
It needs to be viewed by Bush , Condi , Robert Kagan , Charles Krauthammer , little Billy Kristol and all the neocons and their associated slavering bloggers and newspaper columnists calling for war against Russia , a nation bristling with thermonuclear weapons and an increasing desire to use the tactical variety of nukes against the United States , or rather its servile little clients such as Poland that are installing U.S. missile “ defense systems ” on Russia ’s borders .
Forget neocon platitudes about the poor Georgians and their supposedly besieged “ democracy ” ( i.e. , their NED and CIA installed tinhorn dictatorship ) .
As the video here demonstrates , the neocons support ethnic cleansers , butchers , snipers , child killers , and assorted psychopaths .
It really is quite amazing the BBC ran this report as it later put in extra duty to turn the entire event on its head and blame the Russians .
So obvious are the outright lies and twisting of facts , the neocon propaganda outfit Sky News — owned by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation , sort of a UK version of Faux News — “ used the footage of Tskhinvali , which was literally ruined as a result of Georgia ’s attacks , to make reports about the situation in the town of Gori , which the Russian aviation supposedly bombed , ” according to Pravda .
“ The footage aired by the British TV channel was preceded with a picture of a road sign displaying the name of the town – Gori – written in Georgian and English languages .
The report also said that a Sky News correspondent was reporting from the Georgian town . ”
Disgusting , although we can of course expect no less , as the point is to demonize Russia no matter the cost or the affront to reality .
Time Magazine , an integral part of the CIA ’s Operation Mockingbird , attempted to portray the Serbs as Nazi monsters .
As it turns out , the man pictured with protruding ribs , Bosnian Fikret Alic , was “ disturbed about the use of his image ” to sell the U.S. and NATO mass murder campaign against Serbia .
All of this brings to mind the Trnopolje concentration camp hoax used to demonize the Serbs and pave the way to later bomb them with depleted uranium and laser guided munitions .
Recall this hoax consisted of a photograph shot by Penny Marshall of ITN of a Bosnian Muslim “ prisoner ” interned behind barbed wire .
As it turns out , the so - called prisoner was outside the supposed internment camp .
“ What became the picture that Mike Jeremy of ITN pegged ‘ one of the key images of the war in the former Yugoslavia , ’ ( qtd. in Deichmann , p. 170 ) was , in fact , presented as to the Western world as something it was not , a concentration camp .
The focus was on Fikret Alic , who ’s protruding rib cage behind a fence conjured up images of Nazi death camps .
This ‘ death camp ’ was a crude , sick lie and Fikret Alic , who survived the war , was disturbed about the use of his image ” ( see the Balkan Repository Project , The Criminal Race : The Demonization , Dehumanization and Criminalization of the Serbian People , Erin S. LaPorte , December 22 , 1999 ) .
The corporate media tried to perpetuated a Trnopolje trick in regard to South Ossetia and Gori , but this crude effort has fallen flat on its face , thanks to the Russian media , far more sophisticated then its Serb equivalent ( not that the Serbs had a chance — NATO sent a cruise missile into Belgrade ’s main TV station on 23 April 1999 , killing 16 civilians and shutting down any possibility of media coverage able to counter the corporate propaganda onslaught ) .
It would seem a large number of people , at least Russians on the internet , no longer accept unquestioningly the corporate media ’s spin and increasingly transparent fabrications .
In regard to a poll posted on CNN ’s website , the Media Channel writes :
Surprisingly , 92 % of readers thought that the Russians were justified .
Taking into account CNN ’s boneheaded and overwhelmingly pro-Georgian coverage , the poll did n’t make any sense .
Were sheepish CNN viewers actually using their brain ?
It did n’t seem likely .
Well , the poll no longer appears on the site .
It was taken down after charges of manipulation started surfacing .
Apparently , Russian bloggers circulated the poll and called on Russians to let their voice be heard .
And if there ’s one thing CNN does n’t like doing , it ’s hearing what those damn Russkies have to say .
CNN had no idea that this seemingly innocuous poll would demonstrate the huge rift in opinion between the West and Russia and underline the importance that information warfare has played in this conflict , not to mention show whom CNN was really rooting for .
Thanks to alternative news websites and bloggers , the corporate media no longer enjoys a monopoly in the information war .
It is particularly sweet that the BBC ’s own video may be posted on the internet , revealing that indeed the ethnic cleansers and thugs of the brutal little CIA created client state are responsible for the current situation , not Russia as the corporate media insists contrary to the facts .

Scroll for updates … Wired News confirms … McCain camp responds : “ This is a shocking invasion of the Governor ’s privacy and a violation of law .
The matter has been turned over to the appropriate authorities and we hope that anyone in possession of these emails will destroy them .
We will have no further comment ” … the feds are investigating …
Sometime early this morning , between approximately 3:00 am – 4:00 am , members of an infamous group of hackers broke into Gov. Sarah Palin ’s private Yahoo e-mail account .
The incriminating discussion threads included screenshots of Palin ’s e-mail and private e-mail addresses of her contacts .
The threads have since been deleted .
( More details here . )
Hacking e-mail is a federal crime .
A TV anchor who broke into his colleague ’s e-mail account recently pleaded guilty and faces a maximum five years in prison .
The law will catch up to the hackers , but what about the lowlifes who are now gleefully splashing the alleged contents of Palin ’s private e-mail account all over the Internet ?
The Gawker smear machine — see here for all the background you need — has posted private family photos of Palin ’s children that were apparently stolen from the e-mail account .
They have used Bristol Palin ’s illegally obtained private cell phone number from her mom ’s private account , recorded her voicemail message , and posted it on their website .
They have reprinted her husband Todd ’s private e-mail address and son Track ’s private e-mail address .
You think this is just a harmless prank ?
Those of you who have had to deal with break - ins and identity theft know exactly what a burdensome process it is to recover from crimes like this .
Gawker knowingly and deliberately published illegally obtained photos of the Palin children .
Where are the privacy absolutists now ?
You think Palin Derangement Syndrome is bad now ?
These by - any - means - necessary lunatics are just warming up .
Let me repeat what I said about Nick Denton and his slime businesses in 2006 .
It ’s every bit as relevant now .
And I expect the same cowards who said nothing then to remain silent about the violations of the Palin family ’s privacy now :
There is a time to be tolerant and there is a time to draw lines .
If you do n’t draw those lines , bullies will be emboldened .
The smug Gawker smear machine is all about pushing those boundaries with the expectation that no one will push back .
They project their own cynicism , recklessness with facts , intellectual laziness , and bad faith on everyone else .
But outside of Manhattan and Los Angeles , not all of us think blogging is a for - profit enterprise founded solely to tear people down with gossip , rumor - mongering , and damaging lies disguised as “ satire . ”
Funny how some of the loudest voices decrying the lack of civility in the blogosphere are the biggest promoters of the bottom - feeders and debasers at Gawker Media .
Bastards .
Bastards all .

Update : Wired News confirms one of the messages …
Vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin ’s private Yahoo e-mail account was hacked , and some of its contents posted on the internet Wednesday .
The internet griefers known as Anonymous took credit for the intrusion , and screenshots of e-mail messages and photos belonging to the Alaska governor have been published by WikiLeaks .
Threat Level has confirmed the authenticity of at least one of the e-mails .
The cache of stolen data contains five screenshots from Palin ’s account , including the text of an e-mail exchange with Alaska Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell about his campaign for Congress .
Another screenshot shows Palin ’s inbox and a third shows the text of an e-mail from Amy McCorkell , whom Palin appointed to the Governor ’s Advisory Board on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse in 2007 .
The e-mail , a message of support to Palin , tells her not to let negative press get to her and asks Palin to pray for McCorkell , who writes that “ I need strength to 1 . keep employment , 2 . not have to choose . ”
The Republican Party has n’t responded to a call for comment , but McCorkell , reached at her office , confirmed that she did send the e-mail to Palin .

Update :
The feds are investigating …
John McCain ’s campaign said Wednesday it has contacted “ appropriate authorities ” over a report that Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin ’s personal e-mail had been hacked .
“ This is a shocking invasion of the Governor ’s privacy and a violation of law , ” campaign manager Rick Davis said in a statement .
“ The matter has been turned over to the appropriate authorities and we hope that anyone in possession of these emails will destroy them .
We will have no further comment . ”
ORDER IT NOW
The statement came hours after a user on the Web site WikiLeaks said he had gained access to Palin ’s Yahoo e-mail account and gained access .
Screenshots of the e-mail messages and photos of the Alaska governor ’s family were published on that Web site and later on gossip Web site gawker.com .
FBI Spokesman Eric Gonzalez in Anchorage , Alaska confirms to CNN an investigation is underway .
FYI : Alaska has very strong privacy laws .

Network Advertising Initiative
A recent U.K. study by AOL finds that most online users are concerned about their online privacy and about providing personal details to Websites .
No surprise there .
In fact , the study found that 84 percent of respondents said that " they would not give away income details online . "
What to make then of the fact that 89 percent of those same respondents actually provided the very same income details that they claimed they would n't give ?
Oops .
Apparently the perception of users does not always match the reality of the situation .
Another example of this perceptual disconnect is that the study also found that 34 percent of respondents expected to experience credit card fraud as a result of their activities , but only 11 percent of respondents had actually experienced such problems .
( Actually , we do n't even like those odds : we have a one in 10 chance of being a victim of credit card fraud ?
No wonder we 're paranoid ! )
The respondents were also asked if they typically read sites ' privacy policies .
Only 38 percent said that they did .
Of those that read the policies , half the respondents said that the information was not easy to understand .
As to why people do n't read the privacy policies , the two most popular answers were that it " takes too long , " and there is " too much ' leagalese ' or jargon .
" This study comes on the heels of AOL's U.K. privacy education campaign ( the U.S. version can be found here ) , which ironically is only loosely related to the study results .
AOL 's campaign is designed to educate online consumers of the how cookies can be used for targeted advertising and how users can opt - out out the targeted ad network of members of the Network Advertising Initiative ( NAI ) .
So while AOL 's study focused on the conscious behavior of online users , the campaign is actually focused on educating users on how information about sites they have visited can be used by other sites , and how to opt out of this mechanism if they choose to .
Of course , opting out of the NAI ad network partners only removes you from receiving targeted ads on sites with NAI ad network partners .
Any non-NAI network ad partners are free to still examine your cookies .
As many users do , you could disable cookies in your browser ( or selectively enable them for only the sites you choose ) ; but since the NAI opt - out program depends on setting a specific NAI ad network opt - out cookie for your browser , disabling cookies would disable the NAI ad network opt out mechanism .
While the means might be inexact , AOL 's intentions are in the right place : " Personalising content and delivering relevant advertising online will only succeed for consumers and for advertisers if it is done in a trustworthy and transparent manner .
In addition , business and government will need to offer approaches that recognise that at certain times personalisation and data use will be welcomed , and in other cases , users will demand limits on the use of their data . "
-- Jules Polonetsky , AOL's Chief Privacy Officer .
The AOL privacy campaign includes relevant links to AboutCookies.org , a site that provides a " guide to deleting and controlling cookies " ; a link to Polonetsky ' own Privacy Gourmet Website , devoted to promoting online advertising transparency practices ; and links to the privacy policies of related sites , including the one for AOL U.K. ( AOL's U.S. privacy policy is here ) .
It 's refreshing to see a large online presence take a transparent stance on online privacy .
Let 's hope that other sites and companies follow AOL 's lead and take similar approaches to treating your online privacy as a more transparent endeavor .
Yesterday ’s Lunch 2.0 at SplashCast was nice and cozy .
Maybe it was my warning that space was small , the closed guestlist , the slightly incorrect address on the Upcoming event ( sorry ) .
Or maybe people just had other things to do , like work .
Whatever it was , in contrast to the last few Lunches 2.0 , only about 70 people filtered in and out of SplashCast ’s semi-new offices in the old Merchant Hotel in Old Town .
This worked really well for networking , since you could navigate the entire room , bouncing between conversations , and not worry about missing anyone .
As has been typical with Portland Lunch 2.0 , Kim Ramage , our host , made a brief introduction to SplashCast and welcomed everyone .
Then the networking and nomming began .
Unfortunately , Mike Berkley , SplashCast ’s CEO and the Lunch 2.0 instigator was n’t able to attend .
Again , there ’s that pesky work thing getting in the way .
Aaron has n’t posted his photos yet , but I ’m sure they will rock , as usual .
Check his Lunch 2.0 collection on Flickr if you ’re interested .
Mark Colman tweeted several pictures he took , including this one of AJ and Doug in the midst of what looks like an interesting conversation about the finer points of the iPhone ’s keypad .
Thanks to Kim , Mike and the whole SplashCast team for opening their digs to us .
Yearning for more ?
No worries about space in the next few venues , the Art Institute of Portland ( October 15 ) and the Eclipse Foundation ( November 5 ) .
In fact , they ’re both large , so bring your friends and colleagues .
Better yet , if you can find uninitiated Lunch 2.0 people , bring them along to spread the goodness .

A warm congratulations to Senator Joe Biden on his VP candidate position on the Democratic ticket !
Sen .
Biden called me to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Iraq in April 2004 , when there was heavy fighting between the Mahdi Army and the US military .
He did so on the basis of a journal article I had written on the Sadr Movement in the Middle East Journal , which he had read .
That knocked my socks off .
People in Washington do n’t often read journal articles .
It struck me as the sort of thing that should happen in our democracy every day– you write something in your specialty , and your elected representative calls you to talk about it .
No lobbies , think tanks , etc. involved .
So it was a positive impression !
And in the hearing he was informed and articulate .
I want to say something about the tag line in the mainstream press about Sen.
Biden ’s alleged tendency to commit gaffes .
We have had a president for nearly 8 years who has committed almost nothing but gaffes , every day , all day .
The corporate media typically forgive Bush for this and do n’t even often bring it up .
Why is it that it is an issue for Biden but not for Bush ?
Could it be that corporate media is owned by . . .
Republicans ?
When Biden ascends to these heights of malaproprism , then we can talk about it :
The hills were alive with the sound of munching .
In fact , the only things that seemed missing Monday when a herd of goats climbed up a weed - choked lot in the Bunker Hill high - rise district were Julie Andrews and the Von Trapp family singers .
Leaders of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency hired 100 goats to nibble away thick weeds on a steep slope at the corner of 4th and Hill streets , next to the Angels Flight funicular .
Agency officials said the goats were cheaper and more environmentally friendly than two - legged brush - clearers armed with gasoline - powered weed - whackers .

And they are much more fun to watch , downtown office workers and other passersby quickly decided , as the animals fanned out over the 45 - degree slope and chowed down .
Commuters emerging from the Red Line subway who came face - to - face with the goats reached for their cellphones and snapped pictures .
“ My friends wo n’t believe this unless they see it , ” said Vicky Bravo , a student who lives south of downtown .
Sam Vera , an auto repairman , pulled a digital camera from his backpack to photograph the grazing goats with the glass - walled California Plaza high - rise gleaming above them .
Advertisement
“ This is absolutely beautiful .
It ’s a wonderful contrast to the big buildings around here , ” he said .
Some wondered whether the goats were part of a movie scene or some kind of performance art , while others made jokes about the approaching lunch hour and goat barbecue .
On the hillside above , goat - keeper George Gonzales dismissed such talk .
“ These just came from Monrovia and Duarte , and they have poison oak all over them .
You do n’t want to touch them , ” he said of the goats .
Advertisement
He said his crew would work long hours over the next week to 10 days and “ wo n’t collect a pension or charge for working overtime and wo n’t call in sick . ”
If any of them lose their appetite , his wife , veterinarian Liz Gonzales , will tend to them , he said .
An electrified fence helps corral the goats and keeps them from falling over a retaining wall at the base of the slope .
Security guards will be on duty when he is not there to watch over the herd , said Gonzales , 71 , of Chino .
Most of the South African Boer goats are female , Gonzales said .
To keep them focused on their eating , males in the herd have been castrated , he said .
Redevelopment agency head Cecilia Estolano said the goats were being rented for $ 3,000 .
The cost of hiring workmen to clear the 2 1/2 - acre hillside would have totaled as much as $ 7,500 .
Advertisement
The brush - covered hillside lot , called Angels Knoll , is topped by a grassy park that is maintained by the city .
Eventually , the lot is slated to become the site of a third mixed - use California Plaza tower .
At lunchtime , a steady stream of California Plaza office workers came to the small park to get a close - up peek at the goats , some of which were leaping into the air to snag a taste of tree leaves hanging over the lot .
On the corner below the hill , a street musician belted out a bluesy jazz tune on his saxophone .
Advertisement
“ Instead of jazz , they should be playing Rodgers & Hammerstein , ” suggested one of the office workers , Michael Alexander .
The Mount Washington resident is in charge of the California Plaza arts program .
“ You know which one I ’m talking about : the ‘ Lonely Goatherd ’ song from ‘ Sound of Music . ’ ”
Alexander whistled a few notes from the tune , which most remember as the yodeling song .
Busily lunching on their weed buffet , Bunker Hill ’s goats did n’t even look up .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Support for more U.S. oil drilling is on the rise , despite the opinions of many analysts who say the potential supply is too small to significantly lower the price .
Government estimates assume that drilling off the eastern and western coasts offers just over 1 million barrels a day .
Even John McCain - who has made offshore drilling a cornerstone of his energy platform - does n't dispute that figure , which is dwarfed by worldwide production .
Currently world production stands at about 73 million barrels of oil each day .
Drilling in Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could kick in another million barrels , though many drilling advocates - including McCain - do n't support lifting the ban there .
Republicans were first to make the case for drilling , saying that more domestic supply would significantly bring down global prices despite government experts who say it would only shave 2 or 3 cents off the price of a gallon of gas .
Now Democrats , including Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , are grudgingly getting on board - as a part of a compromise to push through a comprehensive energy policy in Congress .
Polls show that Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of expanded drilling too .
The current debate over drilling is holding up other energy fixes in Congress .
They include tax breaks that are essential for further investments in renewable energy and other measures to help Americans use less oil .
Given the seeming futility of expanded drilling to lower prices , how do drilling 's boosters support their argument ?
Hoping for more oil
For starters , they think there could be more oil than the government says .
" We think the estimates are extremely conservative , " said Brian Kennedy , a spokesman for the Institute for Energy Research , a Washington , D.C. - based think tank that supports more drilling .
Kennedy said the government thought Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay field originally held 6 billion barrels of oil .
Since the field began producing in 1977 , Kennedy said it has provided about 14 billion barrels of oil .
Other reports have shown the discrepancy between estimated production and actual production in Prudhoe Bay to be smaller , but still it ended up producing more oil than initial projections .
" They have a bit of a weatherman 's track record when it comes to forecasting , " Kennedy said .
Boosting spare capacity is important
Kennedy also said more drilling would increase the world 's spare production capacity - the difference between what the world currently produces and what it could produce if all the spigots were turned on .
Spare production capacity is currently about 1.5 million barrels a day , most of which is held by Saudi Arabia .
But just a few years ago , spare production capacity was 4 or 5 million barrels a day .
That tight margin today is one reason why oil prices are so high - there is less surplus crude available to cover a disruption in supplies .
But while Kennedy believes additional drilling may double spare production capacity , the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) says the Saudis would simply invest less in new fields if the United States increased its own investment , leaving spare production capacity little changed .
A safer supply source
Kennedy said another reason to drill is that a million barrels of oil a day - or whatever the final number is - means a million barrels we do n't have to buy from a foreign country .
That , he said , would help our trade deficit and create jobs at home .
" It would protect the U.S. from supply shocks elsewhere , and it 's probably the best stimulus we could come up with , " said Kennedy .
We need all the oil we can get
Taylor Griffin , a spokesman for the McCain campaign , said that any extra oil is needed in a tight market .
" You 're talking about a million barrels a day coming online , the additional supply is a big deal . "
' It 's part of a comprehensive solution , you can't do just one thing , " Griffin said , noting that McCain is calling for more drilling offshore but not in Alaska 's wildlife refuge , and is championing other energy initiatives , including a suspension of the federal gas tax and a big push in nuclear power .
That sentiment is echoed by the oil industry , which has consistently told Congress that among the many things lawmakers could do to lower gas prices is to open up more areas of the country for drilling .
" Let 's do everything , " said Rayola Dougher , senior economic advisor for the American Petroleum Institute , noting that the discussion does n't have to be either drilling or renewables , but can be both .
" No one knows what impact it 's going to have 10 years down the road , but we 're still going to need more oil and gas . "
If everyone agrees that we should do everything , why is it that we 're spending so much time talking about drilling , and less time on other measures like conservation and alternatives ?
Griffen said because drilling is one area in energy policy where Obama and McCain disagree .
" We 're not talking about alternatives because we both support alternatives , " he said .
People against more drilling cite the estimates from the government - the EIA says opening Alaska 's wildlife refuge would cause gasoline prices to fall by 2 or 3 cents a gallon by 2020 - and say Republicans are keeping the issue alive simply to use against the Democrats in the November election .
" The Republicans think they 've identified an issue they can win on , " said Karen Wayland , legislative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council .
" This is just about making it a wedge issue . "
Wayland , channeling similar sentiments from many Democrats and citing numbers showing the oil industry already has access to nearly 80 % of the oil reserves in North America , called the whole debate about expanding offshore drilling " a distraction from the real solutions . "

In a possible breakthrough on energy , a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a compromise Friday that would preserve the oil - drilling ban off the West Coast while easing restrictions on exploration off the East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico .
The proposal also would provide billions to greatly expand the availability of vehicles powered by alternative fuels .
In unveiling the ambitious plan , the senators -- five Democrats and five Republicans who call themselves the Gang of 10 -- hope to break a partisan standoff that sent lawmakers home on their monthlong summer recess Friday without action on major legislation to address high gasoline prices .
But the proposal ’s pros pects appear remote this election year , with time running out on the congressional session and the parties highlighting their differences on energy .

And a number of the proposals remain controversial -- expanding drilling off Florida , reviving the nuclear industry , boosting efforts to convert coal into fuel for motor vehicles .
At home , lawmakers are likely to hear from voters about canceled vacations and tighter family budgets because of high gas prices .
When Congress returns to Washington in September , “ we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done , and done before Congress finishes its business this year , ” said Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) , a leader of the bipartisan group that forged the plan .
The proposal is the first sign of progress on an issue that has stirred anxiety and animosity on Capitol Hill .
Advertisement
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said he was hopeful the compromise “ can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the Senate floor . ”
The proposal would offer concessions to Republicans who have called for increased domestic production :
An area of the Gulf of Mexico , 50 miles off Florida ’s coast , would be open to drilling ; and Virginia , the Carolinas and Georgia could decide whether to allow drilling 50 miles off their shorelines .
The senators excluded efforts to lift the long - standing ban on new drilling off the California coast or to open Alaska ’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration as too contentious and likely to complicate passage of the plan .
In a significant shift , the group ’s Republicans agreed to repeal a key oil industry tax break and force oil companies to pay billions in royalties to the U.S. Treasury for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
Advertisement
Democrats have tried to repeal industry tax breaks in the past but have been thwarted by a GOP - led Senate filibuster .
But a number of Republicans are finding it hard to defend the tax breaks while oil companies record high profits .
An estimated $ 30 billion that would be paid by the oil companies over 10 years would help fund initiatives such as $ 7.5 billion to help U.S. automakers expand the production of alternative - fuel vehicles .
Funding also would be provided for tax credits to encourage consumers to buy more fuel - efficient cars and for extending tax credits to promote energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources , such as sun and wind power .
In a statement , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , the likely Democratic presidential nominee , welcomed the proposal , saying it included measures he had advocated such as repealing oil industry tax breaks .
But he said he remained skeptical that new offshore drilling “ would bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term . ”
Advertisement
And in an interview with the Palm Beach Post in Florida , Obama said he might support limited additional offshore drilling as part of a comprehensive policy to promote fuel - efficient autos and alternate sources of energy .
Sen . John McCain of Arizona , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , has called for lifting the offshore drilling ban .
In a statement , his campaign said the country needs an “ ‘ all of the above ’ approach ” and chided Obama for opposing expansion of offshore drilling .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said the Bush administration would consider the legislation .
“ We would need to see a bill that would increase the supply here in our own country , across the board , in a comprehensive way , ” Perino said , adding that “ alternatives and renewable energies ” are needed too .
Advertisement
Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R - Ga. ) initiated the bipartisan talks several weeks ago , approaching Conrad after another day of partisan warfare in the Senate over energy policy .
Chambliss acknowledged that the bipartisan talks irked party leaders .
“ The fact that they ’re uncomfortable means we ’re doing the right thing , ” he said .
But though the proposed compromise enjoys bipartisan support , the five Democrats who endorsed it hail from states that voted for Bush in 2004 .
Other senators putting forth the plan are Democrats Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana , Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska ; and Republicans Johnny Isakson of Georgia , Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Thune of South Dakota .

US Kind of a World Leader in Wind Power Generation
August 11th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
According to the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) , the capacity the US has for generating wind power is expected to increase 45 % in 2008 .
America ’s currently installed capacity stands at 19,549MW , up a total of 2,726MW from the end of 2007 .
Thanks to this number , AWEA is announcing that America is now the US world leader in wind electricity generation .
However this is an announcement based on stats that AWEA is hoping the rest of the world wo n’t look at too hard .
According to AWEA ’s second quarter 2008 market report , they bill the US as the new world leader in the generation of wind power electricity .
Looking at Germany ’s capacity , for example , sees them with a total of 23,000 MW , but never using that full capacity .
Apparently the winds in America are stronger , and thus max out the US capacity .
But one important little factoid has been left out of this announcement , allowing the AWEA to make a perfectly legitimate statement , but based in marketing reality .
The US may have a capacity of 19,549MW , expected to grow another 4774MW by the end of this year , but it also has a population of 304.8 million people living on a total area of 9.8 million square kilometers of land .
Germany , on the other hand , has only a population of 82 million and a total area of 357,000 square kilometers .
Needless to say , I ’m going to say that Germany , and many of the European nations , are doing a lot better in terms of their actual rollout of wind power across their entire country .
And things get worse for the US in light of Congress ’s failure to re-extend the production tax credit ( PTC ) .
This credit , which once provided a 1.9 - cent per kilowatt - hour benefit for the first ten years of a renewable energy facility ’s operation , provided not only a benefit but an incentive to install such stations .
According to AWEA executive director Randall Swisher , many projects currently in production are being rushed to completion , so that they can complete prior to the expiration of the PTC at the end of this year .
In addition , investments in new projects following the expiration have stalled .
“ If there is a great deal of uncertainty in the market and in policies in the market , that investment capacity will be deployed elsewhere ” , he said .
“ It ’s just ludicrous that the Congress is letting this opportunity slip away . ”
So , there you have kind of - good news and bad news for the production of renewable energy in the US ; pretty much a sign of the times , really .

BARBARA WALTERS : " She [ Governor Sarah Palin ] also took some earmarks ... "
JOHN MCCAIN : " No , not as governor she did n't .
She vetoed - Look , well , the fact is she 's a reform governor . "
-- ABC " The View , " Sept. 12 , 2008 .
John McCain is trying to claim that black is white when he argues that his running mate , Sarah Palin , has not accepted earmarks as Governor of Alaska .
While it is true that she has sought fewer earmarks than her predecessor , Governor Frank Murkowski , Alaska still leads the nation in terms of per capita spending on earmarks , according to Citizens Against Government Waste .
The Facts
According to the Anchorage Daily News , Palin sought $ 256 million in earmarks during her first year in office .
This year , her office has sought the assistance of the Alaska Congressional delegation in landing $ 197 million in federal earmarks .
A comprehensive list of the governor 's latest earmark requests is available at the website of Alaska senator Ted Stevens with a covering letter from Palin 's office .
The requests range from $ 71 million for the " Rural Alaska Sanitation Initiative " to $ 3.2 million for " Sea Lion Biological Research to $ 7.4 million for " Rural Airport Lighting . "
While we are talking about Palin , here is a quick run-down of factual errors in her first media interview as vice - presidential nominee , with Charles Gibson of ABC News :
" Show me where I have ever said that there 's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any affect , or no affect , on climate change . "
Palin may not have said that human activities have had no impact whatsoever on climate change , but she has certainly depicted that impact as minimal in the past .
Here is what she said in an interview with the Fairbanks Daily News - Miner on December 4 , 2007 : " I 'm not an Al Gore , doom - and - gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity . "
Her claim that " many vice - presidents " had never met a foreign head of state before becoming president ( after conceding to Gibson that she has never met a foreign head of state . )
I would appreciate some help from readers on this one .
The last seven vice - presidents ( Dick Cheney , Al Gore , Dan Quayle , George H.W. Bush , Walter Mondale , Nelson Rockefeller , and Gerald Ford ) had all met foreign heads of state prior to taking office .
The 39th vice - president , Spiro Agnew , had been governor of Maryland for just two years when Richard Nixon picked him to be his running mate in 1968 .
Does anybody know whether Agnew had met a foreign head of state prior to assuming office as vice - president ?
Agnew 's immediate predecessors , Hubert Humphrey , Lyndon Johnson , and Nixon , were all well - known figures prior to becoming vice president .
Her claim that Russia invaded a " smaller , democratic country [ Georgia ] unprovoked . "
The Russian invasion of Georgia , beginning on August 7 , may have been " disproportionate , " as the Bush administration has argued , but it was hardly " unprovoked . "
Reports from Georgia and South Ossetia suggest that the Russians were responding to a Georgian attack on Tskhinvali , capital of the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia , which has been under Russian protection since 1991 .
Some readers have complained that I have been soft on the Democrats over the last week , while awarding a string of Pinocchios to the McCain campaign .
I would like to think that this simply reflects the current state of the campaign : the McCainites have been on the offensive over the last week , tearing into Obama with a series of questionable TV ads .
If you think it reflects bias on my part , there is a simple remedy : send in specific examples of Pinocchio - esque statements by Obama and the Dems , and I will check them out .
The Pinocchio Test
I will give Governor Palin a pass this week , to mark her inaugural media outing .
Four Pinocchios for McCain for his clumsy attempt to rewrite history .

The " social scourge " of excessive boardroom pay has prompted widespread debate in the European Union as workers see their purchasing power eroded by ­rising prices and low wage increases .
European political leaders have demanded a legal and fiscal clampdown .
Shareholders , especially retail investors , are pressing for greater corporate disclosure of remuneration policy , inc­lu­ding links to performance , and individual directors ' pay packages as well as votes on the issue at annual meetings .
The pay debate has been exacerbated by the credit crunch , which has exposed undue risk - taking in the search for higher bonuses by highly paid investment bankers and high - profile severance packages for failed executives , deepening the sense of outrage in mainland Europe , which is culturally more egalitarian than the US or Britain .
Even before Pat Russo , chief executive of serially loss - making IT firm Alcatel - Lucent , quit in late July with a contractual pay - off of up to € 6 m ( £ 4.8 m ) , French president Nicolas Sarkozy had produced draft laws to curb such " golden parachutes " .
The Dutch government has introduced legislation for a 30 % tax on bonuses of more than € 500,000 and a 15 % increase in employer 's fiscal contributions to executive pensions , partly influenced by the multimillion pay - off for ABN Amro chief Rijkman Groenink .
In Germany , where workers ' pay rose only 4.3 % between 2003 and 2007 as firms laid off hundreds of thousands of employees , Social Democrats are demanding a € 1 m ceiling on tax - deductible boardroom remuneration .
It is the widening gap between boardroom and shopfloor remuneration in a deteriorating economic environment that is fuelling the furore .
The growing evidence is that mainland European companies are following the lead of their British counterparts by setting executive remuneration packages , including stock options , at a level commensurate with global — not national — peers in an effort to retain and incentivise directors .
Executive pay in the EU averages € 5 m a year .
French chief executives are said to be the highest paid with packages worth € 6 m after a reported 58 % leap in 2007 .
A recent survey by the German DSW investor lobby found that German executive pay had risen 7.75 % in 2007 to just below € 3 m , with Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank the top earner with € 14 m , though Wendelin Wiedeking of unlisted Porsche earned more than four times that .
It is this degree of corporate generosity that prompted Jean - Claude Juncker , chairman of the EU 's euro group , to label it a " social scourge " .
Disclosure practices vary widely across the European Union despite a four - year - old non-binding European commission recommendation to increase corporate remuneration transparency on individual executive pay and remuneration policies as a whole .
A European commission report last year found greater transparency had ensued but responses had been patchy , with only a third of member states enabling even an advisory shareholder vote on executive remuneration .
In Germany , where only 40 % of the top 30 firms in the Dax have remuneration committees and most annual reports detail just the package of the highest earner , even that stipulation causes anger among directors .
Califica el panista de ' estridente ' el ultimátum fijado por el ombudsman para que el 1 de diciembre renuncien los funcionarios que no cumplan con el acuerdo contra la delincuencia ; pide PRI ocuparse en ver compromisos a futuro
Para el PAN en el Senado , la declaración del ombudsman nacional , José Luis Soberanes , en el sentido de que si no se cumple en materia de seguridad los funcionarios deben irse , fue un " poquito estridente " , mientras que el PRI pidió a todos ver hacia el futuro y dejar de criticarse unos a otros .
La declaración del presidente de la Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos ( CNDH ) generó diversas reacciones en el Senado .
El coordinador del PRI , Manlio Fabio Beltrones , pidió ocuparse más en ver a futuro los compromisos de cada instancia , " que estar criticándonos unos a otros " .
Dijo que el Senado ya sabe la medida de su responsabilidad y está interesado en cumplirle a la sociedad en su conjunto .
Beltrones indicó que queda claro que Soberanes también tiene una clara idea de la indignación ciudadana " y trata de interpretarla " .
A su vez , el coordinador del PAN , y presidente de la mesa directiva del Senado , Gustavo Enrique Madero , afirmó que " todos tienen fecha " incluido el titular de la Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos ( CNDH ) .
Dijo que tiene derecho a expresarse , pero consideró que se ha alardeado mucho con la expresión de " el que no pueda que se vaya " , y opinó que más bien se debe ser muy crítico y autocrítico para dar los mejores resultados .
Madero consideró que se trató de una declaración llamativa , " tal vez un poquito estridente " , que tiene que ver más con la personalidad del funcionario .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) - When Apple Inc rolled out its iPhone in the United States , some fans paid big money to be among the first to get their hands on the device .
In Poland , people are getting paid to line up .
“ We have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iPhone , ” a spokesman said .
As part of a marketing campaign ahead of the iPhone ’s Friday launch in Poland , the country ’s largest mobile operator Orange is paying dozens of actors to stand in queues .
Apple sold about one million of the new iPhone models in the United States around the July launch weekend , but buyers in Poland may be reluctant to pay hefty monthly charges .
There were no queues at T - Mobile ’s Era stores , which will also due to launch the iPhone on Friday .
The researchers compared directions in the sky where they found superclusters ( red circles ) and supervoids ( blue circles ) with the strength of the Cosmic Microwave Background .
Superclusters are more likely to coincide with directions where microwaves are unusually strong ( red or orange coloring ) and supervoids with directions where the microwaves are unusually weak ( blue coloring ) .
Scientists have found more intriguing evidence for darkenergy ?
one of nature 's most befuddling phenomena .
Dark energy is thought to make up about 74 percent of theuniverse , while dark matter ?
a mysterious form of matter that scientists canonly detect by noting its gravitational pull on things ?
makes up about 22 percent .
That leaves only 4 percent of the universe composed of things we can see andtouch : the normal protons , electrons and neutrons called baryonic matter .
Scientists don?t know what darkenergy is , but they observe its tugging effect , which causes the expansionof the universe to accelerate .
Now they have seen this mysterious force in someof the largest known features of the cosmos , called superclusters andsupervoids .
The former are particularly crowded areas of space , each witha lot of galaxies huddled in a region half a billion light - years across , whilethe latter are the opposite , rather barren expanses notably lacking galaxies .
Astronomers led by Istv?n Szapudi of the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy observed dark energy stretching out these areasby detecting changes in rays of microwave light before and after they passedthrough the regions .
?
" When a microwave enters a supercluster , it gains some gravitational energy , and therefore vibrates slightlyfaster , " Szapudi said .
" Later , as it leaves the supercluster , itshould lose exactly the same amount of energy .
But if dark energy causes theuniverse to stretchout at a faster rate , the supercluster flattens out in the half - billionyears it takes the microwave to cross it .
Thus , the wave gets to keep some ofthe energy it gained as it entered the supercluster . "
Szapudi , with University of Hawaii postdoctoral researcherMark Neyrinck and graduate student Benjamin Granett , analyzed a map of thevarying strength of the microwave radiation left over from the Big Bang , calledthe cosmic microwave background radiation ( CMB ) , across the universe .
Theymatched this data to a map of the universe with the 50 largest supervoids and the 50 largest superclusters plotted , based on information from the SloanDigital Sky Survey , a project that mapped the distribution of galaxies over aquarter of the sky .
As the researchers predicted , the microwaves were a bitstronger if they had passed through a supercluster , and a bit weaker if they hadpassed through a supervoid .
? With this method , for the first time we can actually seewhat supervoids and superclusters do to microwaves passing through them , ?
Granett said .
The team will detail their findings in the AstrophysicalJournal Letters in August or September .
The More You Know !
An Informative Guide on How Bluetooth Works
If you have connected devices , odds are they work with Bluetooth .
You can connect your phone to your car , your headset to your computer , and a keyboard to a tablet .
You can do just about anything you can imagine with your devices , even take your favorite music into the backyard without having to connect a bunch of wires .
It ’s not through magic .
It ’s through a radio protocol that we know as Bluetooth .
Would you like to know more about Bluetooth ?
Read on to discover how Bluetooth works and what it is .
What is Bluetooth ?
The technology we know as Bluetooth was first created in 1994 .
It was invented by a researcher at Swedish telecom giant Ericsson .
It was named Bluetooth after the Viking king from the 10th century .
In 1998 , other leading tech companies saw the value of the technology and formed the Bluetooth Special Interest Group ( SIG ) to standardize it .
IBM , Toshiba , Nokia , Intel , and Ericsson were the main players at first .
Lenovo , Microsoft , and Apple joined the group over the years .
That special interest group is responsible for licensing and promoting the technology .
It ’s largely the reason why you can connect different devices from different brands to each other .
Now , everything from headphones to phones and home devices uses Bluetooth to connect and communicate with each other .
That means you can leave the wired world behind .
More devices are hitting the market every day .
One company even raised more than $ 6 million on IndieGoGo for a set of Bluetooth headphones .
How Bluetooth Works
Bluetooth uses short - range radio waves using an RF transceiver at 2.4 GHz .
That frequency may seem familiar to you because it ’s the same frequency that WiFi and cordless phones use to operate .
The way it works is that there is one device that is considered the primary or master device .
You can connect up to seven secondary or slave devices at the same time .
That ’s why you can have a Bluetooth headset , mouse , keyboard , phone , and printer connected to your computer at the same time .
Even if you wanted to use marine Bluetooth radio in the middle of the ocean , you can do that .
The way the technology works is pretty seamless .
The only time you have to interact with it is when you set it up or pair devices with each other .
The master device will send an inquiry signal to devices in the area and when you set the slave device to scan as well , their signals cross and recognize each other .
At that point , you may need to enter a code or hit OK to confirm the pairing .
Once the devices are paired , they ’ll recognize each other when they ’re in close proximity and powered on .
Bluetooth Vs. WiFi
It ’s easy to confuse the different technical terms or think that they do the same thing .
That ’s a common thing that occurs when people are thinking about WiFi and Bluetooth .
They tend to confuse them or think that they ’re one and the same .
The fact is , they ’re very different from each other .
Bluetooth is a way to connect devices to each other when they ’re in close proximity to each other .
That allows them to communicate with each other .
You can exchange files or use a device like a keyboard that appears on your tablet screen as you type .
Bluetooth is widely used because it does n’t use a lot of power and it can transfer small bits of data quickly .
If you ever tried to transfer files between your phone and your computer via Bluetooth , you may have discovered that it takes a long time .
WiFi , on the other hand , is used to download or upload large files across the internet .
You can connect to a website across the world and download files from there in seconds .
WiFi is an over the air technology , but the purpose is completely different .
How Secure is Bluetooth ?
Like any device that ’s connected to another device or to the Internet , you need to know about security risks .
Hackers have successfully infiltrated government networks and even home security devices .
There ’s always going to be a security risk when you use Bluetooth or any other wireless protocol .
Generally speaking , the Bluetooth protocol is secure because it uses a high level of encryption .
There are other things you can do to increase the level of security of your devices .
You want to make sure that your devices are set to restrict the devices it connects with .
You can also use service - level security , which dictates the types of actions a device can take when connected .
This is a good idea to prevent hackers from taking over your Bluetooth device through bluebugging .
There are other threats , such as bluejacking and bluesnarfing that can compromise your devices and your most sensitive data .
The Future of Bluetooth
Bluetooth has evolved over the last 20 years .
It will continue to evolve as more connected devices come out and the needs of the technology changes .
For example , a new Bluetooth protocol will be released to improve audio quality between devices .
You can expect improvements as more devices start to be connected throughout the home and worn .
You can be sure that Bluetooth wo n’t become obsolete anytime soon .
How Does Bluetooth Work ?
It seems like every device is a connected device .
The way that many of these connect to each other is through a 25 year old technology named after a Viking .
Bluetooth is one of the leading technologies used to connect various devices .
How Bluetooth works is that it uses low power to send small amounts of data between devices wirelessly .
It also helps to have been backed by the major tech companies , making it easier for devices from other brands to connect to each other .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) -
The husband of Gov. Sarah Palin will ignore a subpoena from Alaska lawmakers investigating whether the Republican vice presidential nominee ’s firing of a state commissioner constituted an abuse of power , officials from her campaign said on Thursday .
Todd Palin was among 13 people , including several Palin administration staffers , subpoenaed by a legislative committee to testify in private or at a hearing scheduled for Friday .
The governor ’s husband , however , refuses to answer questions to a panel that he believes is politically motivated , according to campaign officials for Republican presidential candidate John McCain and Palin .
“ The objections boil down to the fact that the legislative council investigation is no longer a legitimate investigation because it has been subjected to complete partisanship , ” campaign spokesman Ed O’Callaghan said .
Todd Palin could be found in contempt of the legislature for failing to comply , but the whole body would have to be in session to do so , and it is not scheduled to reconvene until January .
O’Callaghan , a former federal prosecutor who has traveled to Alaska to advise the Palins and others implicated in the probe , argue that supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama are controlling the investigation .
The abuse - of - power investigation is seeking to determine whether Gov. Palin dismissed former Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan because he declined to fire a state trooper involved in a contentious divorce from the governor ’s sister .
“ Nobody is above the law , ” said State Sen. Bill Wielechowski , an Anchorage Democrat .
“ Just because you ’re the husband of someone who is running for vice president does n’t mean you can flout the law . ”
The inquiry was authorized by a unanimous vote of Alaska ’s bipartisan Legislative Council .
At the time , the governor pledged full cooperation with the probe .
Some Republicans in the legislature have called for a delay of the investigation until after the November 4 presidential election .
Five Republican lawmakers this week filed a lawsuit in state court seeking to stop the probe .
By now , everyone knows the basic mistakes to avoid at work : no flip - flops , no swearing , no offensive downloads , and no irate E -mails .
But there are plenty of other faux pas that can do harm to an employee 's or manager 's reputation in the office or with clients .
Sometimes , these lesser - known errors are tough to learn to avoid .
Luckily , the careers bloggers who contribute to U.S. News 's On Careers : Outside Voices have come to the rescue .
Here are eight mistakes they 've spotted that you might not have known you were making :
Talking about politics : Political opinions uttered around the water cooler can hurt office relations — especially if you 're the boss , says G.L. Hoffman , chairman of JobDig and author of What Would Dad Say .
Bosses who openly favor a particular candidate will appear to be taking sides with employees who favor the same one , Hoffman says .
Even for nonmanagers , politics is a quick way to damage relationships with clients or vendors .
Quietly absorbing the increased price of gas :
You 're paying through the nose to get to the office every morning , so why not take advantage of it ?
Blogger Andrew G.R. of Jobacle says this is a great time to ask for a raise .
You might not get it , but you will have laid the groundwork for future negotiations , he says .
Also , if you get turned down , you can take the opportunity to lobby for a telecommuting day each week .
Writing modest self - appraisals :
There is plenty of reason to show humility at the office — most of the time .
When it comes to writing your self - appraisal , however , modesty is ill - placed , says Suzanne Lucas of Evil HR Lady .
Your boss is almost certainly too busy to keep tabs on all your accomplishments throughout the year .
The self - appraisal is an ideal time to show off all the terrific projects you 've helmed and clients you 've brought on .
Just be honest , Lucas says .
Spending too little time listening :
It 's easy to think that your job is to be a big thinker and a great achiever .
But much of the time , the people around you just need to be heard .
A good listener can stand out in an office of big shots .
Michael Wade , author of Execupundit , writes that he once knew an executive " whose career success was widely attributed to his extraordinary ability to listen .
When he was with you , he was with you . "
Downplaying your mistakes :
Sure , you 're nervous in the face of your error , but acting like it 's nothing wo n't make it nothing .
Your boss might very well end up more concerned with your blasé attitude than with the mistake itself , says Alison Green of Ask A Manager .
Not using your vacation time :
You think you 're too busy and you think it 's too expensive , but take a vacation anyway .
" Vacation is given for a reason — you 're not impressing people by failing to take it , " writes Grant Harmon , who blogs at Newly Corporate .
" In fact , you 're proving that you 're not able to balance work / life . "
Use the time to restore your energy .
Then head back to the office looking refreshed and ready for work .
Talking yourself out of dreaming :
Sure , dreaming can lead to wildly ridiculous ideas and outrageous goals , but outrageous goals get achieved all the time .
Still , most people shut their dreams down pretty quickly .
Curt Rosengren of The M.A.P.
Maker suggests , instead , that you assume " the only possible outcome is success , and then challenge yourself to prove how that can happen . "
You 're talking away the critic and forcing yourself to get creative .
New ( ish ) Method for Storing Wind Energy Explored
August 26th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Recently , MIT discovered a revolutionary method for solar energy storage .
And now , less than a month later , a method for wind power storage is being explored .
Earlier today , Public Service Enterprise Group Global announced that it is joining with Michael Nakhamkin to create a company called Energy Storage and Power that will develop new ways to trap wind power in underground reservoirs .
Compressed air storage technology is n’t new , but it has been ignored for many years .
Now it ’s being rediscovered thanks to the prolific growth of wind turbines and high oil and natural gas prices .
The technology works by pulling excess energy form the power grid at off - peak times ( during the night ) to run compressors that pump air into natural underground caverns .
When energy demand is high , the underground air is released and heated to run turbines .
The heating process uses 200 MW of power from compressed air and 100 MW from natural gas .
According to Roy Daniel , a chief executive of Energy Storage and Power Chief , an underground reservoir the size of Giants Stadium could potentially hold enough power for three 300 MW plants .
While compressed air technology does use some natural gas , it still uses far less fuel than traditional turbine systems .
And it makes wind turbines a much more reliable source of energy in an industry that has been hindered by a lack of reliability .

Taken to Task : The All - Important Alt - Tab Test
Game of the year ?
Who cares .
During the course of any PC game , there is only one grading category that really matters -- a single moment that will determine whether we 'll be coming back .
Tasking out .
Alt - tabbing .
Minimizing .
Whatever you want to call it , it is the ultimate litmus test -- when great games rise to the top , and other great games show their truly annoying colors .
Take Half - Life 2 and the Source engine , sworn enemy of multitaskers everywhere .
The Source engine is like the kind of ancient Macintosh computer you 'd find in an elementary school : sticky to the touch , and always thirty seconds behind your last task - out command .
Playing a Source game is like sitting in a movie theater after drinking a 48 ounce soda .
You try to hold it in , try to put off leaving , but you can't help it -- and then the line in the bathroom is long , and you miss the next TF2 round .
The whole experience is an exercise in minimizing your impatience .
What causes this kind of command delay ?
Is it a problem with the game itself , or some inherent issue with DirectX ?
Who do we blame for this obnoxious defect ?
Of course , pure delay is not the only sign of an alt - tab offender .
Desktop resizing and icon manipulation are also serious symptoms of poor alt - tab support .
Take Diablo II , old game exhibit A .
Playing the dungeon crawler these days , one has to admire a decade - old game that works so well on modern hardware .
That is , until you task out -- and are frequently treated to a decapitated desktop , icons shoved into an 800x600 corner as if hit by an AoE knockback spell .
Some games excel in their alt - tab support .
For example , Blizzard 's own World of Warcraft provides a zippy task - out , with a maximized window mode that allows for instantaneous task cycling .
But for every game that does alt - tabbing right , another does it wrong -- or simply does n't support it at all .
It may seem a trivial complaint , but the strength of the PC platform is found in its versatility -- and the only way to fully exploit that versatility is by pausing Valve 's latest masterpiece to check your eBay auctions .
BioWare 's next game might be the best turn - based online skateboarding sim in years , but if I can't quickly quit out of an elaborately designed cutscene for an update on the status of my friend 's pregnant cat , count me out .
While it is nice that Microsoft requires PC developers to support alt - tab under the Games for Windows program , there should be an extra line in the contract that guarantees a level of performance .
Something like : " The user 's desktop must load before the user has time to call technical support and / or buy the Xbox 360 version of the game . "
Something .
Anything .
Just let us out of your games , PC developers .
We 'll come back .
We promise .
A Simpler Solution By Arnold Kling
On many occasions , including my Cato paper , I have suggested that we can solve the problem by reducing capital requirements for banks on an interim basis .
Nobody seems to be listening to this idea , or even discussing it .
It has flaws .
But those flaws seem much more manageable than the Paulson plan .
The Paulson plan is based on the clogged plumbing theory .
The mortgage assets are stopping up the plumbing of the financial system , so the government has to buy up those assets to unclog the system .
Why worry about the clog in the first place ?
Because banks have some of these securities , they are marking these securities to market value , which means marking them way down .
As a result , their balance sheets show a shortage of capital .
To come back into compliance with regulations , they either have to sell new shares of stock ( good luck with that ) or curb lending .
As they curb lending , the economy suffers .
That is why some people say that the solution is to get rid of mark - to - market accounting .
Let the banks estimate the “ intrinsic ” values of their mortgage securities .
These values are higher than market values , so that using this alternative accounting the banks ’ balance sheets wo n’t looks so bad .
That way , they can keep lending .
My problem with that is that phony accounting has a history of keeping failed institutions in business , raising the cost of the subsequent cleanup .
My alternative is to encourage new lending by lowering capital requirements at the margin .
Tell banks that loans issued after September 1 , 2008 , require half the capital of similar loans issued before September 1 .
Some banks are in such bad shape that even with those lower capital standards they will not be able to make new loans .
Fine .
You do n’t want those banks to grow .
But other banks have room to grow , and you want them to grow more than they would under the existing regulations .
As with changing accounting rules , lowering capital requirements ultimately exposes the government funds that insure banks to more risk .
That is the flaw in the idea .
However , there has to be some risk exposure to tax payers for any policy that encourages bank lending .
The risk exposures in the Paulson plan are many and complex .
I worry about adverse selection –the institutions selling the securities to the government know more about what they are worth than the government does .
The government is almost sure to get ripped off relative to what it thinks it is buying .
I worry that it will cost the government more to deal with bad mortgage securities than it would cost the private sector .
Government is going to have all sorts of political constraints in dealing with this , including pressures to be generous to home borrowers ( people who put so little money down that they effectively borrowed their homes ) .
I worry about the sheer glee that the Left is experiencing as they chorus , “ The market failed !
The market failed !
We need government to take over everything .
Dictate executive compensation !
Take equity stakes in private firms !
Increase regulation by orders of magnitude ! ”
When your plan is to put up $ 700 billion to buy assets from private firms , how can this not send a message to the American people that we need socialism ?
The Democrats who oppose the plan want more socialism , and they probably will get their wish when the legislation is enacted .
And Paulson , by emphasizing the drastic need for the bailout , has thrown away any negotiating leverage .
They ca n’t veto a bill that is supposed to save the world .
I do n’t think we need socialism .
And I do n’t think we need the Paulson plan .
We need some creative policies with regard to bank capital requirements .
" Free space optical communications is a line - of - sight ( LOS ) technology that transmits a modulated beam of visible or infrared light through the atmosphere for broadband communications .
In a manner similar to fiber optical communications , free space optics uses a light emitting diode ( LED ) or laser ( light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ) point source for data transmission .
However , in free space optics , an energy beam is collimated and transmitted through space rather than being guided through an optical cable .
These beams of light , operating in the TeraHertz portion of the spectrum , are focused on a receiving lens connected to a high sensitivity receiver through an optical fiber . "
The Pisa researchers .
( Credit : Corriere Della Sera.it )
Scientists in Pisa , Italy claim to have set a new world record for the fastest wireless data transmission .
They report that during an uninterrupted 12 - hour experiment , they were able to achieve throughput speeds above 1.2 Terabits per second ; which they say beats the previous wireless data transmission speed record of 160 Gigabits per second by Korean scientists .
The researchers claim that speeds of this magnitude can typically only be achieved using fiber optics .
The technology that the Pisa scientists utilized to achieve such high bandwidth , actually shares a significant similarity with fiber optics : Both technologies use optical communications .
Unlike Wi-Fi or microwave communications , which use radio - based transmissions , the Pisa scientists used a Technology called free - space optical communications , which transmits data using light .
The Harvard Broadband Communication Laboratory provides this explanation of Free - Space Optical Communications : Free space optical communications has often been considered as means for " inter - satellite communications " of spacecraft , as " it is possible to transmit tens of megabits per second or more over many thousands of kilometers , using moderate laser average powers of the order of a few watts " in the vacuum of space .
On Earth , however , there are a number of challenges that currently limit the range of free space optical communications to only a few kilometers .
The Harvard Broadband Communication Laboratory states , " although relatively unaffected by rain and snow , free space optical communication systems can be severely affected by fog and atmospheric turbulence . "
Fog is a problem because the size of water droplets in fog " can modify light characteristics or completely hinder the passage of light through a combination of absorption , scattering , and reflection . "
One atmospheric problem is " scintillation , " which is essentially air pockets with different densities that act as lenses that impact the " temporal and spatial variation in light intensity . "
Another atmospheric issue is " beam wander , " which is " when turbulent wind current ( eddies ) larger than the diameter of the transmitted optical beam cause a slow , but significant , displacement of the transmitted beam .
" One of the biggest challenges that free space optical communications faces -- whether in space or on Earth - - is that communications are limited to line - of - site .
Unlike some radio communications , free space optical communications requires that no obstacles interfere with the beam , and it cannot bend around objects .
The Pisa team is made up of scientists from the Sant 'Anna School of Advanced Studies of Pisa , Waseda University in Tokyo , and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology in Tokyo .
The team is led by Ernesto Ciaramella , who is an Associate Professor in Telecommunication at Sant 'Anna .
Ciaramella proposes that one way to get around a number of these limitations would be to develop a communications technology that uses a combination of " photonics and radio . "
While Ciaramella did not elaborate on how such a scenario would be implemented , it is possible to envision a system where free space optical communications is used for back - end communications , and radio - based communications ( such as Wi-Fi or WiMAX ) are used for the last hundred feet or " last mile .

My current leisure - time project is porting the examples from Peter Seibel 's excellent Practical Common Lisp ( PCL ) to Clojure .
I think Clojure is interesting for three reasons :
Clojure is Lisp , but minus historical baggage .
Clojure gives full access to the JVM and Java libraries .
Clojure groks concurrency and state .
My ground rules are simple :
I am not going to port everything , just the code samples that interest me as I re-read Practical Common Lisp .
Where Peter introduced Common Lisp features in a planned progression , I plan to use whatever Clojure feature come to mind .
So I may jump straight into more " advanced " topics , even in the intro chapters .
Please do not assume that this port is a good introduction to Common Lisp !
I am cherry - picking examples that are interesting to me from a Clojure perspective .
If you want to learn Common Lisp , read PCL .
In fact , you should probably read the relevant chapters in PCL first , no matter what .

Prehistoric animals like the marsupial lion died out after humans arrived
The extinction of many ancient species may be due to humans rather than climate change , experts say .
Large prehistoric animals in Tasmania may have been wiped out by human hunting and not temperature changes , a team of international scientists argue .
This pattern may have been repeated around the globe on islands such as Great Britain , the scientists say .
The findings were published in the US scientific journal - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Giant kangaroos
For many years , scientists have been arguing about the causes of widespread extinctions of vast numbers of species at the end of the last Ice Age .
What has caused the most debate has been the fate of megafauna - large bodied creatures in Australia that included three - metre tall giant kangaroos and marsupial lions .
It is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species - and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
Professor Chris Turney ,
University of Exeter Humans arrived in Tasmania about 43,000 years ago , when the island became temporarily connected by a land bridge to mainland Australia .
It had been thought that many megafauna were already extinct by this stage .
But using the latest radiocarbon and luminescence dating techniques , the British and Australian scientists say they were able to determine the age of the fossilised remains of the megafauna more accurately than ever before .
They discovered that some of the giant animals survived for 2,000 years after humans arrived , and at a time when the climate was not changing dramatically .
The researchers concluded that these species were driven to extinction by hunting .
Human blame ?
Professor Chris Turney , from the University of Exeter , the lead author on the research paper , said that 150 years after the publication of Charles Darwin 's seminal work The Origin of Species , the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction had been seriously undermined .
The research could provide answers about prehistoric wildlife in Britain " It is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species - and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today , " he said .
Given Tasmania 's history as an island , the research findings should help to disentangle the role of humans and climate change in other island environments , such as Britain , the scientists said .
Previous research had found that on mainland Australia some 90 % of megafauna disappeared about 46,000 years ago - soon after humans first settled on the continent .

Taliban using Skype phones to dodge MI6
Taliban fighters targeting British troops in Afghanistan are using the latest ‘ internet phones ’ to evade detection by MI6 , security sources said last night .
Skype , a popular piece of consumer software that allows free calls to be made over the web , has been adopted by insurgents to communicate with cells strung out across the country .
Unlike traditional mobile calls , which can be monitored by RAF Nimrod spy planes , Skype calls – the commercial application of a technology called Voice Over Internet Protocol ( VOIP ) – are heavily encrypted .
Web of deceit : Taliban internet calls are hard to monitor
Voice calls are broken into millions of pieces of data before being sent down the line and reassembled by the other caller ’s computer .
The British and American governments are investing considerable resources to crack the codes , and in the UK the Government is introducing legislation to force internet service providers to log all web activity by subscribers , which could then be turned over to the security services on demand .
The disclosure comes as the 8,000 British troops in Afghanistan are facing attacks almost daily from an increasingly well co-ordinated Taliban .
‘ The trouble with this technology is that it is easily available but devilishly hard to crack , ’ the source said .
‘ The technology can now be accessed on mobile internet devices and the country ’s mobile phone network is expanding rapidly . ’
Skype was created in 2003 and three years ago was bought by eBay for £ 1.4 billion .
It has 300 million accounts and at any one time , more than 12 million people are using the service .
Sir David Pepper , the head of GCHQ , the British Government ’s top - secret listening post , has told MPs that internet calls are ‘ seriously undermining ’ his organisation ’s ability to intercept communications .
Skype said last night it did not want to comment .
Some old laws never quite fade away .
In a dark corner of U.S. history , a number of states ran forced - sterilization projects , in which women deemed unfit for motherhood were surgically prevented from having a child .
The country 's most esteemed legal minds blessed the programs .
In 1927 , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Virginia law that authorized sterilization for a woman who , along with her mother and child , was " feeble - minded . "
In upholding the statute , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes concluded : " Three generations of imbeciles ...

Abstract
The XHTML Basic document type includes the minimal set of modules required to be an XHTML host language document type , and in addition it includes images , forms , basic tables , and object support .
It is designed for Web clients that do not support the full set of XHTML features ; for example , Web clients such as mobile phones , PDA s , pagers , and set top boxes .
The document type is rich enough for content authoring .
XHTML Basic is designed as a common base that may be extended .
The goal of XHTML Basic is to serve as a common language supported by various kinds of user agents .
This revision , 1.1 Second Edition , supercedes version 1.1 as defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xhtml-basic-20080729.
In this revision , an XML Schema implementation and the lang attribute have been added .
In the update from version 1.0 to version 1.1 , several new features were incorporated into the language in order to better serve the small - device community that is this language 's major user : XHTML Forms ( defined in [ XHTMLMOD ] ) Intrinsic Events ( defined in [ XHTMLMOD ] )
The value attribute for the li element ( defined in [ XHTMLMOD ] )
The target attribute ( defined in [ XHTMLMOD ] )
The style element ( defined in [ XHTMLMOD ] )
The style attribute ( defined in [ XHTMLMOD ] ) XHTML Presentation module ( defined in [ XHTMLMOD ] )
The inputmode attribute ( defined in Section 5 of this document )
The document type definition is implemented using XHTML modules as defined in " XHTML Modularization " [ XHTMLMOD ] .
Status of this Document
This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication .
Other documents may supersede this document .
A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.
This specification is a Superseded Recommendation .
A newer specification exists that is recommended for new adoption in place of this specification .
This document also supersedes the 29 July 2008 version of the XHTML Basic Recommendation .
It reflects cross-industry agreement on a set of markup language features that allows authors to create rich Web content deliverable to a wide range of devices .
The only changes in this version are to add an XML Schema implementation of the markup language and integrate the lang attribute to increase compatibility with User Agents and Assistive Technologies .
This document has been produced by the W3C XHTML2 Working Group as part of the W3C HTML Activity .
This document has been reviewed by W3C Members , by software developers , and by other W3C groups and interested parties , and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation .
For purposes of the W3C Patent Policy , this Superseded Recommendation has the same status as an active Recommendation ; it retains licensing commitments and remains available as a reference for old -- and possibly still deployed -- implementations , but is not recommended for future implementation .
New implementations should follow the latest version of the HTML specification .
Table of Contents
1. Introduction
1.1. XHTML for Small Information Appliances
HTML 4 is a powerful language for authoring Web content , but its design does not take into consideration issues pertinent to small devices , including the implementation cost ( in power , memory , etc. ) of the full feature set .
Consumer devices with limited resources cannot generally afford to implement the full feature set of HTML 4 .
Requiring a full - fledged computer for access to the World Wide Web excludes a large portion of the population from consumer device access of online information and services .
Because there are many ways to subset HTML , there are many almost identical subsets defined by organizations and companies .
Without a common base set of features , developing applications for a wide range of Web clients is difficult .
The motivation for XHTML Basic is to provide an XHTML document type that can be shared across communities ( e.g. desktop , TV , and mobile phones ) , and that is rich enough to be used for simple content authoring .
New community - wide document types can be defined by extending XHTML Basic in such a way that XHTML Basic documents are in the set of valid documents of the new document type .
Thus an XHTML Basic document can be presented on the maximum number of Web clients .
The document type definition for XHTML Basic is implemented based on the XHTML modules defined in XHTML Modularization [ XHTMLMOD ] .
For information on best practices for mobile content , we refer you to [ MOBILEBP ] .
1.2 . Background and Requirements
Information appliances are targeted for particular uses .
They support the features they need for the functions they are designed to fulfill .
The following are examples of different information appliances :
Mobile phones
Televisions
PDA s
s Vending machines
Pagers
Car navigation systems
Mobile game machines
Digital book readers
Smart watches
Existing subsets and variants of HTML for these clients include Compact HTML [ CHTML ] , the Wireless Markup Language [ WML ] , and the " HTML 4.0 Guidelines for Mobile Access " [ GUIDELINES ] .
The common features found in these document types include :
Basic text ( including headings , paragraphs , and lists )
Hyperlinks and links to related documents
Basic forms
Basic tables
Images
Meta information
This set of HTML features has been the starting point for the design of XHTML Basic .
Since many content developers are familiar with these HTML features , they comprise a useful host language that may be combined with markup modules from other languages according to the methods described in " XHTML Modularization " [ XHTMLMOD ] .
For example , XHTML Basic may be extended with a custom module to support richer markup semantics in specific environments .
It is not the intention of XHTML Basic to limit the functionality of future languages .
But since the features in HTML 4 ( frames , advanced tables , etc. ) were developed for a desktop computer type of client , they have proved to be inappropriate for many non-desktop devices .
XHTML Basic will be extended and built upon .
Extending XHTML from a common and basic set of features , instead of almost identical subsets or the too - large set of functions in HTML 4 , will be good for interoperability on the Web , as well as for scalability .
Compared to the rich functionality of HTML 4 , XHTML Basic may look like one step back , but in fact , it is two steps forward for clients that do not need what is in HTML 4 and for content developers who get one XHTML subset instead of many .
1.3 . Design Rationale
This section explains why certain HTML features are not part of XHTML Basic .
1.3.1 . Presentation
Many simple Web clients cannot display fonts other than monospace .
Bi-directional text , bold faced font , and other text extension elements are not supported .
It is recommended that style sheets be used to create a presentation that is appropriate for the device .
1.3.2 . Tables
Basic XHTML tables ( [ XHTMLMOD ] , section 5.6.1 ) are supported , but tables can be difficult to display on small devices .
It is recommended that content developers follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 for creating accessible tables ( [ WCAG10 ] , Guideline 5 ) .
Note that in the Basic Tables Module , nesting of tables is prohibited .
1.3.3 . Frames
Frames are not supported .
Frames depend on a screen interface and may not be applicable to some small appliances like phones , pagers , and watches .
2. Conformance
This section is normative .
2.1 . Document Conformance
A Conforming XHTML
Basic document is a document that requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this specification .
Such a document must meet all of the following criteria :
The document must conform to the constraints expressed in Appendix B and Appendix C .
The root element of the document must be < html > .
The name of the default namespace on the root element must be the XHTML namespace name , http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml .
The start tag MAY also contain the declaration of the XML Schema Instance Namespace and an XML Schema Instance schemaLocation attribute [ XMLSCHEMA ] .
Such an attribute would associate the XHTML namespace http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml with the XML Schema at the URI http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SCHEMA/xhtml-basic11.xsd .
There must be a DOCTYPE declaration in the document prior to the root element .
If present , the public identifier included in the DOCTYPE declaration must reference the DTD found in Appendix B using its Formal Public Identifier .

The DTD subset must not be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD .
XHTML Basic 1.1 documents SHOULD be labeled with the Internet Media Type " application / xhtml+xml " as defined in [ RFC3236 ] .
For further information on using media types with XHTML , see the informative note [ XHTMLMIME ] .
2.2 . User Agent Conformance
The user agent must conform to the " User Agent Conformance " section of the XHTML 1.0 specification ( [ XHTML1 ] , section 3.2 ) .
3 . The XHTML Basic Document Type
This section is normative .
The XHTML Basic document type is defined as a set of XHTML modules .
All XHTML modules are defined in the " XHTML Modularization " specification [ XHTMLMOD ] .
XHTML Basic consists of the following XHTML modules :
Structure Module * body , head , html , title Text Module * abbr , acronym , address , blockquote , br , cite , code , dfn , div , em , h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 , kbd , p , pre , q , samp , span , strong , var Hypertext Module * a List Module * dl , dt , dd , ol , ul , li Forms Module button , fieldset , form , input , label , legend , select , optgroup , option , textarea Basic Tables Module caption , table , td , th , tr Image Module img Object Module object , param Presentation module b , big , hr , i , small , sub , sup , tt Metainformation Module meta Link Module link Base Module base Intrinsic Events module Events attributes Scripting module script and noscript elements Stylesheet module style element Style Attribute Module Deprecated style attribute Target Module target attribute .
Note :
The target attribute is designed to be a general hook for binding to an external environment ( such as Frames , multiple windows , browser - tabbed windows ) ; when there is no such external environment bound to the user agent , the user agent can ignore the target attribute .
When there is an external environment bound , the conformance requirements for the target attribute are defined in each environment .
The content author needs to be aware that the user agent behavior for the target attribute depends on multiple factors such as the existence of an environment binding , restrictions of available resources , existence of other applications and user preferences ( such as pop- up blockers ) , and implementation - dependent design decisions .
When there is no external environmental conformance , it is recommended that authors do not depend on use of the target attribute .
It should be noted that any implementation - dependent use of the target attribute might impede interoperability .
This specification also adds the lang attribute to the I18N attribute collection as defined in XHTMLMOD .
The lang attribute is defined in HTML4 .
When this attribute and the xml:lang attribute are specified on the same element , the xml:lang attribute takes precedence .
When both lang and xml:lang are specified on the same element , they SHOULD have the same value .
(*) =
This module is a required XHTML Host Language module .
XHTML Basic also uses the XHTML inputmode Attribute Module , as defined in this specification .
This module adds the inputmode attribute to the input and textarea elements of the XHTML Forms Module .
Finally , XHTML Basic adds the value attribute to the li element of the XHTML List Module .
An XML 1.0 DTD is available in Appendix B. An XML Schema implementation is available in Appendix C .
4. How to Use XHTML Basic
Although XHTML Basic can be used as it is - a simple XHTML language with text , links , and images - the intention of its simple design is for use as a host language .
A host language can contain a mix of vocabularies all rolled into one document type .
It is natural that XHTML is the host language , since that is what most Web developers are used to .
When markup from other languages is added to XHTML Basic , the resulting document type will be an extension of XHTML Basic .
Content developers can develop for XHTML Basic or take advantage of the extensions .
The goal of XHTML Basic is to serve as a common language supported by various kinds of user agents .
5. XHTML inputmode Attribute Module
This section is normative .
This section was originally a component of XForms 1.0 , and was written by Martin Duerst .
The inputmode Attribute Module defines the inputmode attribute .
inputmode = CDATA
This attribute specifies style information for the current element .
The following table shows additional attributes for elements defined elsewhere when the inputmode module is selected .
Elements Attributes Notes input& inputmode ( CDATA )
When the Basic Forms or Forms Module is selected .
textarea& inputmode ( CDATA ) When the Basic Forms or Forms Module is selected .
The attribute inputmode provides a hint to the user agent to select an appropriate input mode for the text input expected in an associated form control .
The input mode may be a keyboard configuration , an input method editor ( also called front end processor ) or any other setting affecting input on the device (s ) used .
Using inputmode , the author can give hints to the agent that make form input easier for the user .
Authors should provide inputmode attributes wherever possible , making sure that the values used cover a wide range of devices .
5.1 inputmode Attribute Value Syntax
The value of the inputmode attribute is a white space separated list of tokens .
Tokens are either sequences of alphabetic letters or absolute URIs .
The later can be distinguished from the former by noting that absolute URIs contain a ' :'.
Tokens are case - sensitive .
All the tokens consisting of alphabetic letters only are defined in this specification , in 5.3 List of Tokens ( or a successor of this specification ) .
This specification does not define any URIs for use as tokens , but allows others to define such URIs for extensibility .
This may become necessary for devices with input modes that cannot be covered by the tokens provided here .
The URI should dereference to a human - readable description of the input mode associated with the use of the URI as a token .
This description should describe the input mode indicated by this token , and whether and how this token modifies other tokens or is modified by other tokens .
5.2 User Agent Behavior
Upon entering an empty form control with an inputmode attribute , the user agent should select the input mode indicated by the inputmode attribute value .
User agents should not use the inputmode attribute to set the input mode when entering a form control with text already present .
To set the appropriate input mode when entering a form control that already contains text , user agents should rely on platform - specific conventions .
User agents should make available all the input modes which are supported by the ( operating ) system / device (s ) they run on / have access to , and which are installed for regular use by the user .
This is typically only a small subset of the input modes that can be described with the tokens defined here .
Note : Additional guidelines for user agent implementation are found at [ UAAG 1.0 ] .
The following simple algorithm is used to define how user agents match the values of an inputmode attribute to the input modes they can provide .
This algorithm does not have to be implemented directly ; user agents just have to behave as if they used it .
The algorithm is not designed to produce " obvious " or " desirable " results for every possible combination of tokens , but to produce correct behavior for frequent token combinations and predictable behavior in all cases .
First , each of the input modes available is represented by one or more lists of tokens .
An input mode may correspond to more than one list of tokens ; as an example , on a system set up for a Greek user , both " greek upperCase " and " user upperCase " would correspond to the same input mode .
No two lists will be the same .
Second , the inputmode attribute is scanned from front to back .
For each token t in the inputmode attribute , if in the remaining lists of tokens representing available input modes there is any list of tokens that contains t , then all lists of tokens representing available input modes that do not contain t are removed .
If there is no remaining list of tokens that contains t , then t is ignored .
Third , if one or more lists of tokens are left , and they all correspond to the same input mode , then this input mode is chosen .
If no list is left ( meaning that there was none at the start ) or if the remaining lists correspond to more than one input mode , then no input mode is chosen .
Example : Assume the list of lists of tokens representing the available input modes is : { " cyrillic upperCase " , " cyrillic lowerCase " , " cyrillic " , " latin " , " user upperCase " , " user lowerCase "} , then the following inputmode values select the following input modes : " cyrillic title " selects " cyrillic " , " cyrillic lowerCase " selects " cyrillic lowerCase " , " lowerCase cyrillic " selects " cyrillic lowerCase " , " latin upperCase " selects " latin " , but " upperCase latin " does select " cyrillic upperCase " or " user upperCase " if they correspond to the same input mode , and does not select any input mode if " cyrillic upperCase " and " user upperCase " do not correspond to the same input mode .
5.3 List of Tokens
Tokens defined in this specification are separated into two categories : Script tokens and modifiers .
In inputmode attributes , script tokens should always be listed before modifiers .
5.3.1 Script Tokens
Script tokens provide a general indication the set of characters that is covered by an input mode .
In most cases , script tokens correspond directly to [ Unicode Scripts ] .
Some tokens correspond to the block names in Java class java.lang .Character.UnicodeBlock ( [ Java Unicode Blocks ] ) or Unicode Block names .
However , this neither means that an input mode has to allow input for all the characters in the script or block , nor that an input mode is limited to only characters from that specific script .
As an example , a " latin " keyboard does n't cover all the characters in the Latin script , and includes punctuation which is not assigned to the Latin script .
The version of the Unicode Standard that these script names are taken from is 3.2 .
Input Mode Token Comments arabic Unicode script name armenian Unicode script name bengali Unicode script name bopomofo Unicode script name braille used to input braille patterns ( not to indicate a braille input device ) buhid Unicode script name canadianAboriginal Unicode script name cherokee Unicode script name cyrillic Unicode script name deseret Unicode script name devanagari Unicode script name ethiopic Unicode script name georgian Unicode script name greek Unicode script name gothic Unicode script name gujarati Unicode script name gurmukhi Unicode script name han Unicode script name hangul Unicode script name hanja Subset of ' han ' used in writing Korean hanu noo Unicode script name hebrew Unicode script name hiragana Unicode script name ( may include other Japanese scripts produced by conversion from hiragana ) ipa International Phonetic Alphabet kanji Subset of ' han ' used in writing Japanese kannada Unicode script name katakana Unicode script name ( full - width , not half - width ) khmer Unicode script name lao Unicode script name latin Unicode script name malayalam Unicode script name math mathematical symbols and related characters mongolian Unicode script name myanmar Unicode script name ogham Unicode script name oldItalic Unico de script name oriya Unicode script name runic Unicode script name simplifiedHanzi Subset of ' han ' used in writing Simplified Chinese sinhala Unicode script name syriac Unicode script name tagalog Unicode script name tagbanwa Unicode script name tamil Unicode script name telugu Unicode script name thaana Unicode script name thai Unicode script name tibetan Unicode script name traditionalHanzi Subset of ' han ' used in writing Traditional Chinese user Special value denoting the ' native ' input of the user ( e.g. to input her name or text in her native language ) .
yi Unicode script name
5.3.2 Modifier Tokens
Modifier tokens can be added to the scripts they apply in order to more closely specify the kind of characters expected in the form control .
Traditional PC keyboards do not need most modifier tokens ( indeed , users on such devices would be quite confused if the software decided to change case on its own ; CAPS lock for upperCase may be an exception ) .
However , modifier tokens can be very helpful to set input modes for small devices .
Input Mode Token Comments lowerCase lowercase ( for bicameral scripts ) upperCase uppercase ( for bicameral scripts ) titleCase title case ( for bicameral scripts ) : words start with an upper case letter startUpper start input with one uppercase letter , then continue with lowercase letters digits digits of a particular script ( e.g. inputmode= ' thai digits ' ) symbols symbols , punctuation ( suitable for a particular script ) predictOn text prediction switched on ( e.g. for running text ) predictOff text prediction switched off ( e.g. for passwords ) half
Width half - width compatibility forms ( e.g. Katakana ; deprecated )
5.4 Relationship to XML Schema pattern facets
User agents may use information available in an XML Schema pattern facet to set the input mode .
Note that a pattern facet is a hard restriction on the lexical value of an instance data node , and can specify different restrictions for different parts of the data item .
Attribute inputmode is a soft hint about the kinds of characters that the user may most probably start to input into the form control .
Attribute inputmode is provided in addition to pattern facets for the following reasons :
The set of allowable characters specified in a pattern may be so wide that it is not possible to deduce a reasonable input mode setting .
Nevertheless , there frequently is a kind of characters that will be input by the user with high probability .
In such a case , inputmode allows to set the input mode for the user 's convenience .
In some cases , it would be possible to derive the input mode setting from the pattern because the set of characters allowed in the pattern closely corresponds to a set of characters covered by an inputmode attribute value .
However , such a derivation would require a lot of data and calculations on the user agent .
Small devices may leave the checking of patterns to the server , but will easily be able to switch to those input modes that they support .
Being able to make data entry for the user easier is of particular importance on small devices .
5.5 Examples
This is an example of a form for Japanese address input .
Family name : < input name = " name " inputmode = " kanji " /> ( in kana ) : < input name = " namekana " inputmode = " katakana " />
Given name : < input name = " Given " inputmode = " kanji " /> ( in kana ) : < input name = " Givenkana " inputmode = " katakana " />
Postal code : < input name = " zip " inputmode = " latin digits " />
Address : < input name = " address " inputmode = " kanji " /> ( in kana ) : < input name = " addresskana " inputmode = " katakana " />
Email : < input name = " email " inputmode = " latin lowerCase " />
Telephone : < input name = " tel " inputmode = " latin digits " />
Comments : < textarea name= " comments " inputmode = " user predictOn " /> < input name = " doit " type =" submit " value= " OK " />

B.3. XHTML Basic Customizations
An XHTML Family Document Type ( such as XHTML Basic ) must define the content model that it uses .
This is done through a separate content model module that is instantiated by the XHTML Modular Framework .
The content model module and the XHTML Basic Driver ( above ) work together to customize the module implementations to the document type 's specific requirements .
The content model module for XHTML Basic is defined below :

C. XHTML Basic XML Schema Definition
This appendix is normative .
C.1. XHTML Basic XML Schema Driver
This section contains the driver for the XHTML Basic document type implementation as an XML Schema .
It relies upon XHTML module implementations defined in [ XHTMLMOD ] .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < xs:schema targetNamespace= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:xs= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema " xmlns:xh11d= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/datatypes/ " xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " blockDefault= " #all " > < xs:annotation > < xs:documentation >
This is the XML Schema driver for XHTML Basic 1.1 .
Please use this namespace for XHTML elements : " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml "

C.3. XHTML Basic Customizations
An XHTML Family Document Type ( such as XHTML Basic ) must define the content model that it uses .
This is done through a separate content model module that is instantiated by the XHTML Modular Framework .
The content model module and the XHTML Basic Driver ( above ) work together to customize the module implementations to the document type 's specific requirements .
The content model module for XHTML Basic is defined below :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < xs:schema xmlns:xs= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema " elementFormDefault=" qualified " xmlns:xh11d= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/datatypes/ " >
< xs:import namespace = " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/datatypes/ " schemaLocation = " http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SCHEMA/xhtml-datatypes-1.xsd " /> < xs:annotation > < xs:documentation >
This is the XML Schema module of named XHTML content models for XHTML Basic 10 $ Id : index.html , v 1.3 2018/10/09 13:16:06 denis Exp $ < /xs:documentation > < xs:documentation source= " xhtml-copyright -1.xsd " /> </xs:annotation > < xs:annotation > < xs:documentation > XHTML Basic 1.1 Document Model
This module describes the groupings of elements / attributes that make up common content models for XHTML elements .
XHTML has following basic content models : xhtml.Inline.mix ; character - level elements xhtml.Block.mix ; block - like elements , e.g. , paragraphs and lists xhtml .
Flow.mix ; any block or inline elements xhtml .
HeadOpts.mix ; Head Elements xhtml.InlinePre.mix ; Special class for pre content model xhtml .InlineNoAnchor.mix ; Content model for Anchor
Any groups declared in this module may be used to create element content models , but the above are considered ' global ' ( insofar as that term applies here ) .
XHTML has the following Attribute Groups xhtml.Core.extra.attrib xhtml.I18n.extra.attrib xhtml.Common.extra

Imagine that you hear that your 18 - year - old daughter was kissing another girl at a party last weekend .
What races through your mind ?
" O my gosh , she 's exploring same - sex attractions .
She must be a lesbian . "
Hold up , Mom and Dad .
You 're showing your age .
Chances are , your daughter 's not fixed on the pretty young blonde she 's locking lips with .
There may be something entirely different and unexpected going on .
" Girls making out with each other to turn on guys is the latest craze at high school and college parties , " according to the online magazine Salon.com .
Still do n't believe it ?
Listen to this summer 's monster hit song , " I Kissed a Girl " by Katy Perry .
It 's an international phenomenon -- topping the charts all summer in America , Canada , Australia and Great Britain .
A few weeks ago , Perry was a headliner at the Warped music festival at Canterbury Park in Shakopee , belting out the song 's provocative lyrics : I kissed a girl and I liked it , The taste of her cherry chapstick , I kissed a girl just to try it , I hope my boyfriend do n't mind it .
It felt so wrong , it felt so right .
Perry cagily maintains that her song is about drunken curiosity regarding same - sex attractions .
But her music video , which features gyrating women in lingerie , is clearly designed to give the male libido a jolt .
We baby boomers like to think we invented and defined the sexual revolution .
But our offspring are tossing out the categories we took for granted , including the view that " gay or straight " is preprogrammed .
Young women whom Salon.com interviewed about the girl - on - girl trend said they had initially kissed other females to get a free beer at parties or on a dare from guys .
But they soon saw it as a way to signal to males that they are " sexually open and adventurous . "
" It was like , look , I 'm the center of attention ! " recalled one 16 - year - old .
The 16 - year - old , who first saw girls making out at a party and later tried it herself at male urging , added , " And the kissing itself did n't really bug me .
From then on , it became a normal thing to do . "
" It makes you feel more attractive , " said another girl .
" You 're turning on a guy , and he thinks it 's cool . "
Staged bisexuality is now the norm for what is being called the " post - gay generation . "
Salon reports that " the term for the ' I 'm straight but I 'll kiss girls ' mentality is ' heteroflexible , ' " according to Deborah Tolman of ( where else ? )
San Francisco State University 's Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality .
Salon also has its headquarters in San Francisco .
' The erotic new trend '
Female bisexuality is " the erotic new trend ( everyone 's trying it ) , " announced Marie Claire magazine in 2006 .
A 2005 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention appeared to confirm this .
It found that while 1.3 percent of women identified themselves as homosexual , 11.5 percent of women ages 18 to 44 -- and about 14 percent of women in their late teens and early 20s -- report at least one sexual encounter with another woman .
Only about 4 percent of women , ages 18 to 59 , reported such an encounter in a similar survey in 1992 .
What is fueling this trend ?
One factor is the huge popularity of Girls Gone Wild , a DVD franchise that films alcohol - addled females ' sexual encounters with other women at college drinking revels .
Same - sex kissing has been glamorized by celebrities , including Madonna and Britney Spears .
One of the biggest influences , however , may be Internet pornography , which has dramatically altered young people 's ideas of mainstream sexual behavior .
" Girls are n't kissing other girls because they want to , " Pamela Paul , the author of " Pornified , " told Salon .
" They 're doing it because they want to appeal to boys their age .
And for boys their age who 've developed sexually alongside Internet porn , their sexual cues are affected by the norms and standards of porn .
And that 's girl - on - girl action . "
The result ?
Rampant cultural confusion .

Mice , and most likely humans , have the ability to taste calcium — and most do not like it , according to new research presented today at the American Chemical Society 's semiannual national meeting , held this week in Philadelphia .
Scientists say the findings could explain why , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture , 80 percent of Americans do not get enough calcium when it is so important for our health .
Michael Tordoff , a biologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia , suspected that calcium 's unpleasant flavor — imagine the bitter taste of chalk , which is mostly calcium — makes people avoid calcium - rich foods like spinach , brussel sprouts and collard greens .
He started by trying to figure out whether the tongue could taste calcium .
Tordoff and his colleagues gave 40 different strains of mice a choice :
They could drink water or a calcium - rich liquid .
Most preferred water once they tried both .
There was , however , one exception — a mouse strain called PWK actually preferred the calcium - enriched liquid .
Those mice , it turned out , had a different version of genes that are responsible for taste receptors on the tongue .
( Taste buds , which contain approximately 50 to 100 taste cells , comprise receptors for at least five specific tastes — salty , sour , bitter , sweet and umami , or savory . )
Even more surprising : one of the genes was identical to a portion of the receptor that detects both sweet and savory , or hearty , flavors .
" That was a totally unexpected , out - of - left - field finding , " Tordoff says .
" Nobody in their right mind would have ever thought that the sweet - taste receptor was involved in calcium taste because the taste is so different . "
Although this sweet and savory receptor subunit is involved in calcium taste , it does not seem to trigger the perception of either flavor .
Tordoff has so far studied these genes only in mice , but he speculates that they also play a role in human 's calcium taste perception .
He suggests that we do have a calcium " appetite " that kicks in when our intake is dangerously low -– for example during pregnancy or dialysis , which depletes calcium levels .
People in those states tend to have a strong craving for chalky , calcium - rich cheeses .
Tordoff 's findings could inspire technologies that would make calcium - rich foods more palatable , according to Eugene Delay , a taste biologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington .
Indeed , San Diego–based biotechnology company Senomyx is currently developing " bitter blockers " that prevent bitter taste cells from responding , so it 's not crazy to think the same could be done to block calcium taste , Tordoff says .
The fact that people can taste calcium may also help scientists better understand — and prevent — diseases like osteoporosis .
" It would be interesting to see if individuals that are susceptible to osteoporosis have mutations in these [ calcium receptor genes ] , " says Debi Fadool , a biologist at Florida State University in Tallahassee .
" Maybe they 're supersensitive to calcium , so they just do n't want to consume it . "

CHARLOTTE , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Sunday called the $ 700 billion price tag for a financial market bailout “ staggering ” and said the final product must protect U.S. taxpayers and include a commitment to new regulatory reforms .
At a rally in downtown Charlotte , North Carolina , Obama laid the blame for the Wall Street crisis on Republican economic policies favored by John McCain , his rival in the November 4 presidential election .
“ We ’re now seeing the disastrous consequences of this philosophy all around us -- on Wall Street as well as Main Street , ” Obama told the crowd estimated at about 20,000 .
“ And yet Senator McCain , who candidly admitted not long ago that he does n’t know as much about economics as he should , wants to keep going down the same , disastrous path , ” he said .
Negotiations over the unprecedented $ 700 billion bailout opened on Sunday between Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush .
The sweeping proposal would have the Treasury buy up bad mortgage - related debts from financial institutions , including U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks , to try to stem the worst financial storm since the Great Depression .
“ As of now , the Bush administration has only offered a concept with a staggering price tag , not a plan .
Even if the U.S. Treasury recovers some or most of its investment over time , this initial outlay of up to $ 700 billion is sobering , ” Obama said .
“ And in return for their support , the American people must be assured that the deal reflects the basic principles of transparency , fairness , and reform , ” he said .
TAXPAYERS AND HOMEOWNERS
Obama said any final package must ensure that taxpayers and homeowners were protected .
He said it should include a global response and a commitment to broad regulatory reforms that would prevent another crisis .
Aides to Obama said he had spoken to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday and to congressional leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada , as well as New York Sen. Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton over the weekend .
Obama has delayed his own proposal for reform until the details of the package are agreed .
He criticized McCain ’s approach on Saturday , saying the Arizona senator ’s fondness for deregulation would put at risk retirement funds in Social Security and the health care plans of many Americans .
McCain addressed a convention of the National Guard in Baltimore on Sunday , largely talking about the war in Iraq and mentioning the financial crisis only briefly .

He said he has proposed a “ plan for comprehensive reform of the broken institutions that allowed this crisis to become a grave threat to our economy .
At the center of the plan is the principle that we must keep people in their homes and safe guard the life savings of all Americans by protecting our financial system and capital markets . ”
In Charlotte , Obama attacked McCain again for favoring privatization of Social Security and a more open - market approach on health care .
“ He calls himself ‘ fundamentally a deregulator , ’ when reckless deregulation and lack of oversight is a big part of the problem , ” the Illinois senator said .
“ And here ’s the really scary part .
Now this ‘ Great Deregulator ’ wants to turn his attention to health care . ”

McCain ’s campaign called Obama a “ directionless driver ” on the economy .
“ Two days after he confessed to not having a plan for the banking crisis , Barack Obama called for ‘ decisive action ’ while offering absolutely no new ideas , policies or concrete solutions -- it shows he is just not ready to lead , ” McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said .
The visit to North Carolina is Obama ’s third in the general election campaign .
The state is traditionally a Republican stronghold in presidential elections , but Obama has tried to make it competitive this year .

WASHINGTON , Aug 13 ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon said on Wednesday it did not plan to take control of Georgian airports or ports as part of an aid mission , apparently contradicting a statement by Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili .
“ We are not looking to , nor do we need to , take control of any air or sea ports to conduct this mission , ” Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said .
In a television address , Saakashvili said an announcement by President George W. Bush of U.S. aid for victims of Georgia ’s conflict with Russia meant ports and airports would be taken under the control of the U.S. defense ministry .
“ That is not our understanding of the situation , ” Morrell said .
“ What we are focused on at this point is getting humanitarian relief to the people who need it in Georgia . ”
A C -17 plane with humanitarian supplies has arrived in Georgia , and it will be followed in coming days by more U.S. military aircraft and naval forces delivering humanitarian and medical aid , the White House said after Bush ’s announcement .
“ The role of the U.S. military is strictly to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of this conflict , ” Morrell said .

Age may not be rust after all .
Specific genetic instructions drive aging in worms , report researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine .
Their discovery contradicts the prevailing theory that aging is a buildup of tissue damage akin to rust , and implies science might eventually halt or even reverse the ravages of age .
“ We were really surprised , ” said Stuart Kim , PhD , professor of developmental biology and of genetics , who is the senior author of the research .
Kim ’s lab examined the regulation of aging in C. elegans , a millimeter - long nematode worm whose simple body and small number of genes make it a useful tool for biologists .
The worms age rapidly : their maximum life span is about two weeks .
Comparing young worms to old worms , Kim ’s team discovered age - related shifts in levels of three transcription factors , the molecular switches that turn genes on and off .
These shifts trigger genetic pathways that transform young worms into geezers .
The findings will appear in the July 24 issue of the journal Cell .
The question of what causes aging has spawned competing schools of thought .
One side says inborn genetic programs make organisms grow old .
This theory has had trouble gaining traction because it implies that aging evolved , that natural selection pushed older organisms down a path of deterioration .
However , natural selection works by favoring genes that help organisms produce lots of offspring .
After reproduction ends , genes are beyond natural selection ’s reach , so scientists argued that aging could n’t be genetically programmed .
The alternate theory holds that aging is an inevitable consequence of accumulated wear and tear : Toxins , free - radical molecules , DNA - damaging radiation , disease and stress ravage the body to the point it ca n’t rebound .
So far , this theory has dominated aging research .
But the Stanford team ’s findings told a different story .
“ Our data just did n’t fit the current model of damage accumulation , and so we had to consider the alternative model of developmental drift , ” Kim said .
The scientists used microarrays – silicon chips that detect changes in gene expression – to hunt for genes that were turned on differently in young and old worms .
They found hundreds of age - regulated genes switched on and off by a single transcription factor called elt - 3 , which becomes more abundant with age .
Two other transcription factors that regulate elt - 3 also changed with age .
To see whether these signal molecules were part of a wear - and - tear aging mechanism , the researchers exposed worms to stresses thought to cause aging , such as heat ( a known stressor for nematode worms ) , free - radical oxidation , radiation and disease .
But none of the stressors affected the genes that make the worms get old .
So it looked as though worm aging was n’t a storm of chemical damage .
Instead , Kim said , key regulatory pathways optimized for youth have drifted off track in older animals .
Natural selection ca n’t fix problems that arise late in the animals ’ life spans , so the genetic pathways for aging become entrenched by mistake .
Kim ’s team refers to this slide as “ developmental drift . ”
“ We found a normal developmental program that works in young animals , but becomes unbalanced as the worm gets older , ” he said .
“ It accounts for the lion ’s share of molecular differences between young and old worms . ”
Kim ca n’t say for sure whether the same process of drift happens in humans , but said scientists can begin searching for this new aging mechanism now that it has been discovered in a model organism .
And he said developmental drift makes a lot of sense as a reason why creatures get old .
“ Everyone has assumed we age by rust , ” Kim said .
“ But then how do you explain animals that do n’t age ? ”
Some tortoises lay eggs at the age of 100 , he points out .
There are whales that live to be 200 , and clams that make it past 400 .
Those species use the same building blocks for their DNA , proteins and fats as humans , mice and nematode worms .
The chemistry of the wear - and - tear process , including damage from oxygen free - radicals , should be the same in all cells , which makes it hard to explain why species have dramatically different life spans .
“ A free radical does n’t care if it ’s in a human cell or a worm cell , ” Kim said .
If aging is not a cost of unavoidable chemistry but is instead driven by changes in regulatory genes , the aging process may not be inevitable .
It is at least theoretically possible to slow down or stop developmental drift .
“ The take - home message is that aging can be slowed and managed by manipulating signaling circuits within cells , ” said Marc Tatar , PhD , a professor of biology and medicine at Brown University who was not involved in the research .
“ This is a new and potentially powerful circuit that has just been discovered for doing that . ”
Kim added , “ It ’s a new way to think about how to slow the aging process . ”

CARACAS , Venezuela --
The Venezuelan government , which this week mocked Lehman Brothers Inc.'s woes as a sign of capitalism 's imminent demise , could become a victim of the investment bank 's failure .
The government of Hugo Chávez holds about $ 300 million in debt instruments that Lehman had agreed to cash , according to three analysts who calculated the holdings separately .
With Lehman in trouble , Venezuela will have a hard time selling the debt .
" The government will likely have to assume a steep loss , " said Alejandro Grisanti , a senior economist with Barclay 's Capital .
How much will depend on what Lehman ends up paying out to creditors as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings .
Government officials were n't available to comment .
Finance Minister Ali Rodriguez said Tuesday the government was reviewing any impact that Lehman 's demise could have on Venezuela 's finances .
The holdings are part of a strategy by which the Venezuelan government infuses dollars into its dollar - starved , overheating economy .
The system -- which relies on selling structured notes made up of the sovereign debt of other South American nations -- allows Venezuelan banks and individuals to buy dollars at the official exchange rate of 2.15 bolivars , about half the black - market rate .
With annual inflation at 34.5 % , analysts say the bolivar would be considerably weaker without the structured note sales .
RAW STORY
The lawyers for outed CIA officer Valerie Plame have filed suit in federal court to appeal a decision to quash her lawsuit against those in the Bush administration she says illegally outed her as a CIA operative in 2003 .
Plame says her CIA cover was blown as retribution for her husband ’s criticism of the Iraq war .
She says that violated her constitutional rights .

The big guy with the crew cut and a hand that lost three fingers to a meat grinder looked out at the most powerful men in global capitalism Tuesday , and asked a pointed question :
“ I ’m a dirt farmer , ” said Senator Jon Tester , the Montana Democrat who still lives on his family homestead .
“ Why do we have one week to determine that $ 700 billion has to be appropriated or this country ’s financial system goes down the pipes ? ”
Good question , one that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have yet to adequately answer .
If they seemed flummoxed , perhaps it ’s because they still ca n’t explain what will be accomplished by nearly nationalizing the banking system and giving the treasury secretary more power than a king .
Another question — since we now own a big part of the world ’s largest insurance company , A.I.G. , does that mean I can save a load of money on my car insurance ?
— might be easier to answer .
This bailout , in present form , is toast .
Now , with John McCain offering to suspend his campaign and delay Friday ’s debate , it looks like the drainage of years past is pulling him down .
He wants to back out of facing Barack Obama at the height of the campaign .
Why not change the topic , from foreign affairs to the economy ?
Some have already tried to protect the true villains of the crash of 2008 .
Witness Neil Cavuto of Fox News , he of the sycophantic questions to Enron executives and other thieves just before they were exposed , blaming the mortgage crisis on banks lending to “ minorities and risky folks , ” as he said last week .
There is certainly a food chain of greed , from the lowliest house - flipper in the Southern California exurbs to the Hamptons hedge fund manager .
We all put reason in a box and buried it for a time .
But before $ 700 billion is committed to a secretary whose decisions “ may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency , ” as the original draft of the bailout states , it ’s worth remembering where the biggest heist took place , and how Wall Street dragged down the rest of the country once before .
You could hear the echoes of history in Tester ’s question , riding the fierce urgency of now at a time when the Great Depression and all its gloomy atmospherics are in the air again .
When the stock market crashed in 1929 , losing 40 percent of its value over a brutal autumn , barely 2 percent of Americans owned stocks .
People asked , sensibly : how could this affect me ?
Who cared about those swells on Wall Street when cars were rolling off factory lines and the big open expanse of middle America was flush with wheat and corn ?
Today , with more than 90 percent of all homeowners paying their mortgages on time and on budget , the parallel question arises : how could this minority of bad loans drag down Western capitalism ?
It may be news to Joe Biden — with three gaffes this week , he ’s approaching a record , even for him – but Franklin Roosevelt was not yet president during the crash .
Herbert Hoover was , and there we have the reason why so many people cringed when John McCain said last week that the fundamentals of the economy were sound .
In his first days in office , Hoover said , “ Americans are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of the land . ”
Oops .
And just before he was swept to the dunce corner of history , Hoover said , “ No one has yet starved . ”
At the time , people in rural America were eating brined tumbleweed and road - kill rabbits ; the unemployment rate was 25 percent .
But the larger lesson is how Wall Street brought down Main Street .
Banks were largely unregulated then , free to gamble people ’s savings on stock market long - shots .
When the market collapsed , the uninsured deposits went with it .
By the end of 1932 , one fourth of all banks were shuttered , and 9 million people lost their savings .
In this century , thanks to the deregulatory demons released by former McCain adviser Phil Gramm and embraced by just enough lobbyist - greased Democrats , Wall Street was greenlighted again to act like a casino .
Banks in the heartland passed on their mortgages to Wall Street , where they were sliced and diced in hundreds of largely incomprehensible ways .
And while few people understand how those investment giants made money , this much is clear : it was a killing .
In 2006 alone , Wall Street firms paid out $ 62 billion in bonuses .
With all the urgency of that famous National Lampoon magazine cover that showed a cute pooch with a gun to its head , and the line “ If You Do n’t Buy This Magazine , We ’ll Kill This Dog , ” President Bush says the biggest bailout in American history must be passed now or the world will crumble .
He said a similar thing in the run-up to war .
Just once , it might be worthwhile to listen to a dirt farmer like Jon Tester , who wonders why the same breathless attention is not given to the concerns of average Americans .
Ah , but he ’s only been in the Senate two years .
Give him another term and he may start quoting Phil Gramm with approval .

A gastronomist owning a restaurant in Switzerland raised concerns and controversy around the peaceful Alpine country by stating that he is going to serve meals cooked with human breast milk .
The man , who owns a restaurant called Storchen , located in the exclusive Winterthur resort , announced that he will enrich his menu with new meals , including meat stew and a wide gamma of soups that will include at least 75 % of breast milk .
" We have all been raised on it .
Why should we not include it into our diet ? " said Hans Locher , now the most controversial restaurant owner in the small republic .
When the man posted this week ads that he seeks women donors , his announcement instantly attracted the German - speaking media .
Mt Locher mentioned that he will pay 3 pounds for 14 ounces of human breast milk .
" I first experimented with breast milk when my daughter was born .
One can cook really delicious things with it .
However , it always needs to be mixed with a bit of whipped cream , in order to keep the consistency , " he said .
The Swiss food control authorities seemed to be confused due to the fact that there is no legislation regarding the use of human breast milk .
It is difficult to say whether the cook should be banned from serving his exclusive meals .
" Humans as producers of milk are simply not envisaged in the legislation .
They are not on the list of approved species such as cows and sheep , but they are also not on the list of the banned species such as apes and primates , " mentioned Rolf Etter of the Zurich food control laboratory .

A paramedic digitally raped a drug - affected young woman in the back of an ambulance then asked as she was lying on a hospital bed if they could catch up later , a court has heard .
Simon Paul Howe , 33 , was one of two paramedics who attended to the woman in Little Collins Street after she was escorted out of the Bubble nightclub by staff .
He is standing trial in the County Court after pleading not guilty to digital rape and indecent assault alleged to have taken place in the ambulance on the way to the Royal Melbourne Hospital about 6 am on November 5 , 2006 .
Recently , I met Peter Moore , ex-head of Sega of America , ex-head of Xbox , now President of EA Sports .
I was interviewing him for Esquire magazine ( you can see that feature in the October issue ) , but there was a lot of stuff I could n't fit in .
We talked for two hours about his entire career , about his highs and lows , and about some of the key controversies of the console wars .
Over the next five days , I 'm running the best of that frank and illuminating discussion , starting with Moore 's early days in the States and his move to Sega ...
So let 's go right back to the beginning .
You graduated from a physical education college and went out to the States to teach soccer .
What happened next ?
I needed a real job .
I got a job for Patrick , the French football shoe company , and I became a sales rep in Southern California .
I covered the area from the Mexican border all the way up to Bakersfield - which is a massive geographical expanse – in a Toyota Camry with a shoe bag .
I moved up to San Francisco in the mid-eighties , and then I became president of Patrick in 1988 .
I was 11 years in total at Patrick , then I went to Reebok , to get them into worldwide sports with the focus on soccer .
Reebok was in Boston : great city , awful winters – I wanted to get back to the West Coast , and that 's how I got into videogames .
A recruiter called me and said ' what do you know about videogames ?
Do you know Sega and have you ever heard of the Dreamcast ? ' and I replied ' Not much , yes I have and no , I have n't ' .
So we moved back to the Bay Area of San Francisco where Sega 's based .
What do you think Sega saw in your work at Reebok ?
I started at Reebok as Director of Global Sports – I was identified as someone who could globalize Reebok .
I ended up as Senior Vice - President of Global Sports Marketing in the early years when we got Ryan Giggs , Dennis Bergkamp and Andy Cole .
I signed Liverpool – which was a great moment for me as a Scouser .
The Dreamcast was an interesting beast .
Sega was so financially strapped , and it had already launched in Japan to a sort of tepid , luke - warm reaction .
These are big stakes games .
I mean , when you 're launching a games console , you need hundreds of millions of dollars to get it off the ground … and so the North American launch was the last best chance – Europe was going to be launching but there was n't enough there to salvage what was going to be a tough situation with the PS2 looming 12 months out …
The US was the last best chance of getting the Dreamcast up and running .
We amassed a very strong line up of titles , but unfortunately , EA - God bless 'em – decided they were n't going to publish on Dreamcast .
That forced me to build my own sports brand , called 2 K – we came up with the name one night , because it was the Y2 K period , we needed to get the packaging done and we could n't come up with a name .
So we just said , ' let 's call it 2 K sports ' .
It was the best we could come up with .
Dreamcast was a phenomenal 18 months of pain , heartache , euphoria …
We thought we had it , but then Playstation came out , that infamous issue of Newsweek with the Emotion Engine on the cover … and of course , EA did n't publish which left a big hole , not only in sports but in other genres .
We ended up that Christmas period not being able to get to where we needed to be – we were n't far short , we just could n't get that critical mass …
It seemed that the European office were n't as confident as the American office …
We [ Sega of America ] knew we could win .
It was just indicative of the complete lack of integration – the Dreamcast logo was blue in Europe instead of orange , the concept of a globalised brand , which we 're now building here at EA Sports , just evaded the Japanese completely .
And JF , who was the general manager in Europe , went his own way , had his own positioning .
We had a very different positioning , we were very aggressive in the US – and it was a little challenging in Europe .
There was n't that , ' let 's go and get them , we can win this battle ' .
You know , I loved the console wars and still do even though I 'm no longer in the console business … the idea of being upfront , getting after Phil Harrison , getting after Kaz Hirai and then later getting after John Riccitiello …
I think the consumer loves it , it adds publicity and it adds fire around the industry .
And in those days we needed to because we did n't have the money …
In the end it did n't work out .
It was tough , but those were great days and I 've never met anybody who regretted buying a Dreamcast .
Soul Calibur anyone ?
We had a lot of content , a lot of fun and we had tremendous PR , and we got after it in a unique way – the ' Its thinking ' campaign was a great campaign , we had these wacky 15 - second spots on MTV , we launched on 9.9.99 at the MTV Music Awards , we hit the road with Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit of all people ; the Family Values and Anger Management tours – we were a big brand .
But then it all went pear - shaped in Christmas 2000 .
Okay , but let 's go back to the hopeful years .
You said you did n't have much money or much time , but you certainly seemed to make an impact .
Oh yeah .
I mean , I arrived in February and we were launching in September , so I had seven months to figure out , a ) what the industry was and b ) what the console and software were , and then build a marketing campaign .
Which we did by April .
In 60 days we came up with ' It 's Thinking ' .
We filmed a huge ad spot in Vancouver , we went ten nights and did Apocalypse , a multimillion dollar TV spot ( by ad firm Foote , Cone and Belding ) .
It was this idea that the console was actually thinking , and it was bringing 747s down , it had this Black Rain - style look .
We only ran that spot once on 9.9.99 during the video music awards and it became very viral - this is obviously a long time before YouTube .
We had a tremendous 18 months .
Dreamcast was on fire – we really thought that we could do it .
But then we had a target from Japan that said – and I can't remember the exact figures – but we had to make N hundreds of millions of dollars by the holiday season and shift N millions of units of hardware , otherwise we just could n't sustain the business .
So on January 31 2001 we said Sega is leaving hardware – somehow I got to make that call , not the Japanese .
I had to fire a lot of people , it was not a pleasant day .
We were selling 50,000 units a day , then 60,000 , then 100,000 , but it was just not going to be enough to get the critical mass to take on the launch of PS2 .
It was a big stakes game .
Sega had the option of pouring in more money and going bankrupt and they decided they wanted to live to fight another day .
So we licked our wounds , ate some humble pie and went to Sony and Nintendo to ask for dev kits .
Actually , the only company that ever called was Microsoft and that became my link with the company , because of the respect I had for Robbie Bach .
Xbox had launched , I was onstage with Robbie , I was the only third - party who'd go on stage with Microsoft at E3 - at that time people were saying Microsoft could n't get it done , but I believed they could , because I believed in online .
I always thought that online was going to be the key .
And the line I came up with was , ' we 're taking games where gaming is going ' .
Everybody laughed because we had Seganet going with just 50,000 people online … but I always think Dreamcast was the precursor to the next - gen consoles , because we then brought out a broadband adaptor – remember playing Quake 3 through Broadband ?
Only 5 % of people had broadband in those days – it sounds like it was a hundred years ago , but it was 2001 !
The first real multiplayer console game was NBA 2K1 .
I always remember when we launched Seganet .
We were in some nightclub in Hollywood , and we'd just had the band Filter onstage , which brought the house down .
I played against Ice Cube .
I was crapping myself because we had to dial the frickin ' modem to connect to San Francisco .
And it worked .
Those were seat of the pants moments , the fact that you had to get a dial - up telephone modem to work , and then we were doing a satellite video feed down from Visual Concepts … it was a wild night , I do n't remember much after that .
That was the first time anyone had seen an online console game .
Boats and debris are seen surrounding waterfront houses on Galveston Island after the passing of Hurricane Ike , Saturday , Sept. 13 , 2008 .
The storm roared ashore hours before daybreak with 110 mph winds and towering waves , smashing houses , flooding thousands of homes , blowing out windows in Houston 's skyscrapers , and cutting off power to more than 3 million people , perhaps for weeks .
The Caribbean and Gulf Coast have seen a spate of devastating hurricanes in recent years that have cost billions of dollars and thousands of lives .
As residents recover from the latest hits , they may wonder about the potential for future Ikes and Katrinas .
Hurricanes , of course , are nothing new to the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico , where tropical storms form between June and November each year .
But many factors , both natural and man-made , can affect the number , strength , size and impact of the storms that form each season .
For example , the recent surge in storms followed an almost two - decade lull that was part of a natural cycle in hurricane formation .
During that lull , new coastal residents built homes in what they thought was a paradise .
But now they 've found out just how susceptible they are to nature 's wrath .
And it looks like the situation might only get worse .
Coastal build - up
In 2003 , more than half the U.S. population ( or about 153 million people ) lived along the Gulf and Southeastern U.S. coastline — an increase of 33 million people from 1980 — and that number is just expected to keep rising .
The buildup of these communities in recent decades and the environmental damage that development has caused exacerbate the impact of hurricanes .
" There 's been an explosion of population along our coast , " said Amanda Staudt , a climate scientist with the National Wildlife Federation ( NWF ) .
" That 's just putting a lot more people in harm 's way . "
This is particularly true in Florida , Texas and North Carolina , where populations are increasing the fastest .
Hurricanes are especially a threat for homes right on the beach or on barrier islands , such as Galveston , because they receive the full brunt of a hurricane 's storm surge .
Coastal features such as barrier islands and wetlands act as natural protection against a hurricane 's storm surge , slowing it down and absorbing some of the impact .
Studies have shown that every mile of wetlands reduces storm surge by about 3 to 9 inches and every acre reduces the cost of damages from a storm by $ 3,300 , Staudt said .
" Our wetlands and barrier islands … are our first line of defense , " she said .
But the development boom in coastal areas has damaged these natural defenses , putting coastal residents even more at risk .
" The more we develop , the more we lose , " Staudt told LiveScience .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that since the 1700s , the lower 48 states have lost more than half of their wetlands .
While not all of that acreage loss is right along the coast , and some is likely a result of natural changes along the shoreline , a good chunk is due to development .
For instance , some of the Katrina damage to New Orleans was partly a result of the damage to the protective wetlands along Louisiana 's coast .
Development and subsidence , or outright sinking , of the state 's coastline today mean that Louisiana loses an area of wetlands equivalent to the size of 32 football fields every day , according to the NWF .
Many hurricane experts have warned for years against destructive coastal development and imprudent policies that encourage people to build in coastal areas , but that often does n't stop the building .
Warmer seas
Meanwhile , the oceans are growing warmer .
Global ocean temperatures have risen by about 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.1 degrees Celsius ) in the last 30 years .
And hurricanes are fueled by the warm , moist air over the tropical Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico .
The warmer the ocean surface , the more energy is available to fuel a storm 's ferocious winds .
Scientists have predicted that as global warming continues to heat up the ocean , hurricanes could become more frequent , more intense or both , and several scientists think that change is already evident .
As sea surface temperatures rise , they provide more fuel to the convection that drives the swirling storms .
This added energy could notch up the speed of hurricanes ' winds ( though several scientists say the winds can only increase so much ) .
One recent study suggested that the strongest hurricanes in particular would get a bump from warming waters .
The rainfall brought by hurricanes could also increase because as the Earth 's atmosphere also warms , it can hold more moisture .
Studies have shown that one of the most damaging parts of a storm can actually be the rain it dumps on inland areas .
Rising sea levels could increase the damage wrought to coastal areas by a hurricane 's storm surge .
Warmer water , and more of it , could also mean more opportunities for storms to form .
Another recent study suggested that global warming could extend the hurricane season ; as the warm water areas in the Atlantic expand , there could be more opportunities for storm formation , particularly early in the season .
Natural cycles
Of course , the changes man has made to coastlines and the climate system are n't the only thing affecting the intensity of any particular hurricane season .
Mother Nature provides plenty of variation as well .
Natural fluctuations in the climate that occur over a matter of years , such as El Nino and its sister La Nina , can also affect how busy the Atlantic hurricane season is .
El Nino events , which occur when tropical Pacific waters become warmer , can change the flow of prevailing air currents and stifle hurricane development in the Atlantic .
Forecasters think that an El Nino event was the reason for the calm 2006 hurricane season , which came after two of the busiest years for hurricanes on record .
La Ninas ( when tropical Pacific water become cooler ) typically mean more hurricanes .
Another natural cycle , called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation , can affect hurricane frequency over several decades through changes in sea surface temperatures , and is thought to be linked to the relative lull in hurricanes during the 1970s and 80s .
While natural cycles can affect hurricane activity from year - to - year or even decade - to - decade , most climate scientists think that global warming will continue to fuel these storms , and accompanied by the increasing coastal population and environmental degradation , lead to the " increasing destructive power of storms , " Staudt said .
No one was surprised by Hillary Clinton 's absolute dominance in the hills , hollows and other rural stretches of Kentucky in the state 's Democratic presidential primary Tuesday .
But as she rolled up an overall victory margin of 35 percentage points over Barack Obama in the state , one local result stands out .
Magoffin County -- which according to the Lexington Herald - Leader has been identified by the Census Bureau as " the least diverse place in the nation " -- delivered Clinton her largest share of the vote among Kentucky 's 120 counties .
She racked up 93 % of the vote in Magoffin ( named for a former governor and located in the state 's eastern half ) .
In raw votes , the totals were Clinton , 2,714 ; Obama , 146 .
How homogenous is the county ?
According to the 2000 census , 99.29 % of its population of 13,332 was white .
[ UPDATE : For information on the primary result in the U.S. county with the largest concentration of black residents , go here . ]

The big excitement in Microsoftland this week has been further news of Midori .
Midori is claimed to be Microsoft's " post - Windows " operating system — a new platform for the future .
The SD Times claims to have seen internal Microsoft documents describing the company 's plans for the new OS , and it says that Midori will be a commercial derivative of the Singularity project .
Say hello to a cloud - computing - ready .
NET OS .
Dreaming in the cloud
Singularity 's big feature is that it is written in managed code .
While Midori looks to follow suit , it is also written for a cloud computing world .
Microsoft has already spoken of its plans for cloud computing ; in particular , the company plans to introduce tools to enable cloud computing applications to be written as easily as normal applications are today .
Midori will offer the same ; the Midori platform will give developers the basic tools to write applications that can be run in massive parallel and that can withstand unreliable communications .
Parallelism is , of course , a key constraint for future software .
Constrained by escalating power consumption , CPU vendors are no longer giving developers " free " single - threaded performance , but multiple cores instead .
Though single - threaded performance is still making modest improvements , they 're small compared to the potential improvement seen in going from two to four to eight or more cores .
Cloud computing provides immediate access not just to a handful of cores , but to hundreds or thousands .
Cloud computing also introduces unreliability ; network connections can become slow or go down completely , so cloud software must be built to tolerate this , for example by retrying jobs performed on CPUs that have become unavailable .
Why they named it after bright green booze , I have no idea
Problem one : compatibility
Midori is also claimed to offer an upgrade path from current Windows .
As well as running directly on hardware like a normal OS , Midori will be able to run under the Hyper - V hypervisor , coexisting side - by - side with Windows and Linux .
It can also be run as a process on a Windows machine .
Initially , then , Midori might work as just another Windows program used for cloud applications .
As Midori applications become more abundant and can be used for more day - to - day computing tasks , it can run as a complete OS under Hyper - V , so the machine would be shared between a ( legacy ) Windows virtual machine and a ( new and shiny ) Midori VM .
Further still into the future , as Windows applications become less and less necessary , Midori can be run as the sole OS on a machine , with the occasional Windows app relegated to a virtual machine .
It 's clear that Microsoft needs a long - term plan for its OS .
Although the company is still utterly dominant in the desktop operating system market , the future is murkier .
In the short term , Microsoft cannot let the problems that plagued the development of Windows Vista recur .
Mojave stunts aside , Vista has failed to win over consumers .
Perhaps more importantly , it failed to deliver what MS had planned for the release .
The early software released to developers in 2003 used managed code far more extensively than Vista actually has ; plagued with bugs and compatibility problems , virtually all of the managed code was eliminated from Vista .
Problem two : parallelism
Longer term , the shift to multicore processors ( and eventually to massively multicore , with tens , hundreds , even thousands of processors ) will need a significant change from both software developers and OS vendors alike .
Parallel programming is complex at the best of times ; traditional approaches to software development make the problem even worse .
For example , programs today typically depend on having a certain amount of information that is shared between different threads and , generally , that information can be updated .
This is unproblematic in a single - threaded environment , but when multiple threads are used , the developer must ensure that no thread tries to use the information during an update .
This is done by locking and unlocking the shared data , and improper use of this locking is a common source of bugs in multithreaded programs .
It is also a cause of performance problems , and is one of the reasons why a quad core processor is rarely four times faster than a single core processor .
A platform for the future
Microsoft 's long - term operating system goals must address both of these problems ; MS needs a platform that it can modify to address new needs without being hamstrung by compatibility .
It also needs a platform that will make things as easy as possible for the increasingly parallel computers that are now inevitable .
Although parallel programming will always require some input from the developer — the fundamental complexity of doing several things at once will never disappear , and there 's no silver bullet — the system must make this as easy as possible .
Is Midori that long - term operating system ?
Well , it certainly does some of the things that a future Microsoft OS should do .
The safety and portability of managed code would eliminate many of the security flaws that still regularly crop up in software .
. NET already makes these bugs impossible ; Singularity and Midori perform even greater analysis of software and prohibit even more bugs .
To help address problems with parallel programming , Midori 's programming model uses immutable data ; immutable data can be shared without locks and so prevents lock - based bugs from ever occurring .
Another way in which Midori is engineered for high concurrency is through an asynchronous architecture .
Current OSes are usually largely synchronous ; that is , whenever software asks the OS to do something ( read a file from disk , send data over a network , etc. ) the software must wait until the OS has completed the action .
With an asynchronous design , the OS returns control to the software immediately , allowing the software to do useful work while waiting for the OS to finish the operation it was asked for .
When the operation is finished , the OS notifies the software .
Although sometimes the software has nothing to do until the operation is complete ( if it needs to know what data is in a file before it can proceed , say ) , this is not universally true .
For example , writing to a file is something that can often be done asynchronously .
Allowing applications to keep running even when long - running operations are going on in the background , and using notifications when those operations are complete , can give asynchronous programming significant performance improvements over synchronous equivalents .
The downside is that asynchronous programming tends to be more complex than synchronous programming , because it often makes it difficult to tell which order the different parts of a program will run in ; it makes the program 's structure harder to see and understand .
. NET provides good support for asynchronous programming already to try to reduce the inconvenience , and it is likely that Midori would have further improvements to make asynchronous development easier .
The ability to run Midori as a process on existing Windows systems is another strong point in its favor .
This provides a clean migration path , allowing Midori applications to run alongside Windows applications , which is essential for any post - Windows OS .
Dead end or huge hit ?
Although Midori has some compelling features for a " next " operating system , it 's premature to proclaim it to be the post - Windows OS .
Going to an all - new OS means sacrificing both the hardware and software support that Microsoft has been nurturing for the past 20 years , and that 's a very high price to pay .
The pain of losing the software can be mitigated by virtualization — Apple used a similar approach to support legacy Mac OS applications on Mac OS X — but hardware support is a bigger problem ; the only way to support hardware in a new OS is to persuade hardware vendors to write new drivers .
That 's hard enough for a new version of Windows , let alone a whole new OS .
The current Windows code has also had a vast amount of real - world testing ; though it 's not perfect , it works well in a huge variety of configurations and workloads , and giving this up is sure to give Microsoft pause for thought .
Microsoft runs many software projects for research and experimentation purposes .
Microsoft has formally admitted only that Midori is an " incubation project " — an internal project that may or may not result in an eventual commercial product .
As such , Midori could be anything from a complete dead - end , to the OS 95 percent of the world will be running in five to ten years .
I suspect that the truth will lie somewhere in between ; a future Microsoft OS will use virtualization to provide backwards compatibility , and that future OS will use managed code .
Finally , the asynchronous , networked , fault - tolerant parts will materialize within the next year as part of Microsoft 's cloud computing initiative — a software platform , libraries , and tools .
Indeed , this cloud computing platform might be Midori .
Harder to believe is that these ideas will be combined to make the future OS , and that the future OS will be fundamentally designed for cloud computing .
Microsoft might want — need — a new OS , but betting the farm on the clouds in the sky is a risky gamble .
Somewhat of a problem began after the announcement of Wii MotionPlus .
There were people who were concerned about having to purchase yet another add - on just to play certain games , and especially those looking for the multiplayer experience .
However , perhaps some of those qualms can become mitigated now .
Speaking with The Wall Street Journal , Nintendo President Satoru Iwata spoke encouragingly about Wii MotionPlus , noting that the accessory will be very affordable .
“ There will be games that will be enhanced by the Wii Motion Plus as well as games that can only be played with it .
Users will need four if they have four controllers , but we ’re going to try to offer it for as little as possible .
We have n’t announced the price yet , but the cost of making the Wii Motion Plus is not that much , so I think we can make it very affordable . ”
Oh , and as far as new accessories go – Iwata has already released the ones he originally was considering , but if any new ones are thought of , he would n’t rule out releasing them .

One September day in 2001 , Teresa Castellano , Lisa Mullineaux , Jeffrey Shaw and Lisen Axell were having lunch in Denver .
Genetic counselors from nearby hospitals and specialists in inherited cancers , the four would get together periodically to talk shop .
That day they surprised one another : they 'd each documented a case or two of Hispanic women with aggressive breast cancer linked to a particular genetic mutation .
The women had roots in southern Colorado , near the New Mexico border .
" I said , ' I have a patient with the mutation , and she 's only in her 40s , ' " Castellano recalls .
" Then Lisa said that she had seen a couple of cases like that .
And Jeff and Lisen had one or two also .
We realized that this could be something really interesting . "
Curiously , the genetic mutation that caused the virulent breast cancer had previously been found primarily in Jewish people whose ancestral home was Central or Eastern Europe .
Yet all of these new patients were Hispanic Catholics .
Mullineaux contacted Ruth Oratz , a New York City - based oncologist then working in Denver .
" Those people are Jewish , " Oratz told her .
" I 'm sure of it . "
Pooling their information , the counselors published a report in a medical journal about finding the gene mutation in six " non-Jewish Americans of Spanish ancestry . "
The researchers were cautious about some of the implications because the breast cancer patients themselves , as the paper put it , " denied Jewish ancestry . "
The finding raised some awkward questions .
What did the presence of the genetic mutation say about the Catholics who carried it ?
How did they happen to inherit it ?
Would they have to rethink who they were — their very identity — because of a tiny change in the three billion " letters " of their DNA ?
More important , how would it affect their health , and their children 's health , in the future ?
Some people in the valley were reluctant to confront such questions , at least initially , and a handful even rejected the overtures of physicians , scientists and historians who were suddenly interested in their family histories .
But rumors of secret Spanish Jewry had floated around northern New Mexico and the San Luis Valley for years , and now the cold hard facts of DNA appeared to support them .
As a result , families in this remote high - desert community have had to come to grips with a kind of knowledge that more and more of us are likely to face .
For the story of this wayward gene is the story of modern genetics , a science that increasingly has the power both to predict the future and to illuminate the past in unsettling ways .
Expanding the DNA analysis , Sharon Graw , a University of Denver geneticist , confirmed that the mutation in the Hispanic patients from San Luis Valley exactly matched one previously found in Ashkenazi Jews from Central and Eastern Europe .
The mutation , 185delAG , is a variant of a gene called BRCA1 .
When normal and healthy , BRCA1 helps to protect breast and ovarian cells from cancer .
An extremely long gene , it has thousands of DNA letters , each corresponding to one of four chemical compounds that make up the genetic code and run down either strand of the DNA double helix ; a " misspelling " — a mutation — can occur at virtually any letter .
Some are of no consequence , but the deletion of the chemicals adenine ( A ) and guanine ( G ) at a site 185 rungs into the DNA ladder — hence the name 185delAG — will prevent the gene from functioning .
Then the cell becomes vulnerable to a malignancy .
To be sure , most breast and ovarian cancers do not run in families .
The cases owing to BRCA1 and a similar gene , BRCA2 , make up less than 10 percent of cases overall .
By comparing DNA samples from Jews around the world , scientists have pieced together the origins of the 185delAG mutation .
It is ancient .
More than 2,000 years ago , among the Hebrew tribes of Palestine , someone 's DNA dropped the AG letters at the 185 site .
The glitch spread and multiplied in succeeding generations , even as Jews migrated from Palestine to Europe .
Ethnic groups tend to have their own distinctive genetic disorders , such as harmful variations of the BRCA1 gene , but because Jews throughout history have often married within their religion , the 185delAG mutation gained a strong foothold in that population .
Today , roughly one in 100 Jews carries the harmful form of the gene variant .
Meanwhile , some of the Colorado patients began to look into their own heritage .
With the zeal of an investigative reporter , Beatrice Wright searched for both cancer and Jewish ancestry in her family tree .
Her maiden name is Martinez .
She lives in a town north of Denver and has dozens of Martinez relatives in the San Luis Valley and northern New Mexico .
In fact , her mother 's maiden name was Martinez also .
Wright had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000 , when she was 45 .
Her right breast was removed and she was treated with chemotherapy .
Later , her left breast , uterus , fallopian tubes and ovaries were removed as a precaution .
She had vaguely known that the women on her father 's side were susceptible to the disease .
" With so much cancer on Dad 's side of the family , " she said , " my cancer doctor thought it might be hereditary . "
Advised by Lisa Mullineaux about BRCA testing , she provided a blood sample that came back positive for 185delAG .
When Wright was told that the mutation was characteristic of Jewish people , she recalled a magazine article about the secret Jews of New Mexico .
It was well known that during the late Middle Ages the Jews of Spain were forced to convert to Catholicism .
According to a considerable body of scholarship , some of the conversos maintained their faith in secret .
After Judaism was outlawed in Spain in 1492 and Jews were expelled , some of those who stayed took their beliefs further underground .
The exiles went as far as the New World .
For the first time Wright connected this history to memories of conceivably Jewish customs , such as sweeping dust into the center of a room and covering mirrors while mourning a loved one 's death .
She read up on the Spanish " crypto - Jews " in the library and on the Internet .
In 2001 , she and her husband made an extended visit to the valley and northern New Mexico .
Tracking down as many of her paternal relatives as she could find , she alerted them to their dangerous genetic legacy and their ethno- religious heritage .
" I have 60 first cousins , some I never knew I had , " she says .
" So I went fact - finding .
I made the trek because I needed to know where I was from .
' Did you know about our Jewish heritage ? '
I said .
It was n't a big deal to some of them , but others kind of raised an eyebrow like I did n't know what I was talking about . "
Part of New Mexico Territory until the U.S. government delineated the Colorado Territory in 1861 , the San Luis Valley lies between two chains of mountains , the San Juans to the west and the Sangre de Cristos to the east .
The Rio Grande begins here .
The town of San Luis — the oldest in Colorado — is the Spanish heart of the valley .
With an old church on the central plaza and a modern shrine on a mesa overlooking the town , San Luis bristles with Catholic symbols .
It seems a short step back in time to the founding of the New Mexico colony , when picaresque gold - hungry conquistadors , Franciscan friars and Pueblo Indians came together , often violently , in a spare and sunburnt land .
As Willa Cather put it in Death Comes for the Archbishop , perhaps the best novel about the region , the sunsets reflected on the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are " not the colour of living blood " but " the colour of the dried blood of saints and martyrs . "
The discovery of the 185delAG mutation in the valley and subsequently in New Mexico hints at a different story , with its own trail of blood and persecution .
The significance of the genetic work was immediately recognized by Stanley M. Hordes , a professor at the University of New Mexico .
During the early 1980s , Hordes had been New Mexico 's official state historian , and part of his job was assisting people with their genealogies .
Hordes , who is 59 , recalls that he received " some very unusual visits in my office .
People would drop by and tell me , in whispers , that so - and - so does n't eat pork , or that so - and - so circumcises his children . "
Informants took him to backcountry cemeteries and showed him gravestones that he says bore six - pointed stars ; they brought out devotional objects from their closets that looked vaguely Jewish .
As Hordes began speaking and writing about his findings , other New Mexicans came forward with memories of rituals and practices followed by their ostensibly Christian parents or grandparents having to do with the lighting of candles on Friday evenings or the slaughtering of animals .
Hordes laid out his research in a 2005 book , To the End of the Earth : A History of the Crypto - Jews of New Mexico .
Following the Jews ' expulsion from Spain , crypto-Jews were among the early settlers of Mexico .
The Spanish in Mexico periodically tried to root out the " Judaizers , " but it is clear from the records of trials that Jewish practices endured , even in the face of executions .
According to Hordes ' research , settlers who were crypto-Jews or descended from Jews ventured up the Rio Grande to frontier outposts in New Mexico .
For 300 years , as the territory passed from Spanish to Mexican to United States hands , there was almost nothing in the historical record about crypto -Jews .
Then , because of probing by younger relatives , the stories trickled out .
" It was only when their suspicions were aroused decades later , " Hordes writes , " that they asked their elders , who reluctantly answered , ' Eramos judíos ' ( ' We were Jews ' ) . " *
But were they ?
Judith Neulander , an ethnographer and co-director of the Judaic Studies Program at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , was at first a believer of Hordes ' theory that crypto-Judaism had survived in New Mexico .
But after interviewing people in the region herself , she concluded it was an " imagined community . "
Among other things , Neulander has accused Hordes of asking leading questions and planting suggestions of Jewish identity .
She says there are better explanations for the " memories " of unusual rites — vestiges of Seventh - Day Adventism , for example , which missionaries brought to the region in the early 20th century .
She also suggested that perhaps some dark - skinned Hispanics were trying to elevate their ethnic status by associating themselves with lighter - skinned Jews , writing that " claims of Judaeo - Spanish ancestry are used to assert an overvalued line of white ancestral descent in the American Southwest . "
Hordes disagrees .
" Just because there are some people who are wannabes does n't mean everybody is a wannabe , " he says .
But he acknowledges that Neulander 's criticisms have made him and other researchers more cautious .
Hordes , pursuing another line of evidence , also pointed out that some of the New Mexicans he was studying were afflicted by a rare skin condition , pemphigus vulgaris , that is more common among Jews than other ethnic groups .
Neulander countered that the same type of pemphigus vulgaris occurs in other peoples of European and Mediterranean background .
Then the 185delAG mutation surfaced .
It was just the sort of objective data Hordes had been looking for .
The findings did n't prove the carriers '
Jewish ancestry , but the evidence smoothly fit his historical theme .
Or , as he put it with a certain clinical detachment , it 's a " significant development in the identification of a Jewish origin for certain Hispano families . "
" Why do I do it ? " Hordes was addressing the 2007 meeting , in Albuquerque , of the Society for Crypto - Judaic Studies , a scholarly group he co-founded .
" Because the fabric of Jewish heritage is richer in New Mexico than we thought . "
His research and that of others , he said at the gathering , " rip the veneer off " the accounts of Spanish - Indian settlement and culture by adding a new element to the conventional mix .
One conference attendee was a Catholic New Mexican who heartily embraces his crypto-Jewish heritage , the Rev. Bill Sanchez , a local priest .
He says he has upset some local Catholics by saying openly that he is " genetically Jewish . "
Sanchez bases his claim on another genetic test , Y chromosome analysis .
The Y chromosome , handed down from father to son , provides a narrow glimpse of a male 's paternal lineage .
The test , which is promoted on the Internet and requires only a cheek swab , is one of the more popular genealogy probes .
Sanchez noted that the test suggested he was descended from the esteemed Cohanim lineage of Jews .
Still , a " Semitic " finding on this test is n't definitive ; it could also apply to non-Jews .
Geneticists warn that biology is not destiny .
A person 's family tree contains thousands of ancestors , and DNA evidence that one may have been Hebrew ( or Armenian or Bolivian or Nigerian ) means very little unless the person decides to embrace the implication , as Sanchez has done .
He sees no conflict between his disparate religious traditions .
" Some of us believe we can practice rituals of crypto- Judaism and still be good Catholics , " he says .
He keeps a menorah in a prominent place in his parish church and says he adheres to a Pueblo belief or two for good measure .
At the Albuquerque meeting , the new evidence about 185delAG prompted discussion not only among academics but also among some of the subjects .
Robert Martinez , no immediate relation to Beatrice Wright , teaches history at a high school near Albuquerque .
During his summer vacations he helps Hordes sift through municipal and church records in Latin America and Europe , studying family histories and looking for references to Judaism .
He traces his roots to members of the first expedition to New Mexico , led by Juan de Oñate , in 1598 .
The Spanish explorer himself had converso relatives , Hordes has found , and included conversos in the expedition .
When he went to work as Hordes ' assistant ten years ago , Martinez , who is 45 , was well aware of the disease in his family : several relatives have had breast or ovarian cancer .
" Of course , I 'd always heard about the cancer in our family on our mom 's side , " he says .
" And then two of my sisters were diagnosed within months of each other . "
Both women tested positive for 185delAG and have since died .
" I carry the mutation too , " he says .
The Jewish connection caused no stir in his family , he says .
" Me , I 'm open .
I want to know , Who am I ?
Where am I ?
We 're a strange lot , New Mexicans .
We refer to ourselves as Spanish , but we have Portuguese blood , Native American , some black too .
We descend from a small genetic pool , and we 're all connected if you go back far enough . "
Teresa Castellano , the genetic counselor , has spent time in the San Luis Valley explaining BRCA to community leaders , patients and others .
BRCA carriers , she tells them , have up to an 80 percent risk of developing breast cancer , as well as a significant risk of ovarian cancer .
If a woman tests positive , her children would have a 50 - 50 chance of acquiring the flawed gene .
BRCA mutations are passed down by men and women alike .
If a family has mainly sons , the threat to the next generation may be masked .
A year and a half ago , Castellano got a call from a laboratory technician advising her of another patient with a connection to the 185delAG mutation .
The patient 's family had roots in the San Luis Valley and northern New Mexico .
Their name was Valdez .
At the top of the pedigree were eight siblings , two of whom , sisters , were still living .
In the next generation were 29 adult children , including 15 females .
Five of the 15 women had developed breast or ovarian cancer .
Then came an expanding number of grandchildren and great - grandchildren , who were as yet too young for the disease but who might have the mutation .
Only one or two members of the disparate clan still lived in the valley .
Ironically , Castellano 's initial patient , Therese Valdez Martinez , did not carry the mutation herself .
Her breast cancer was a " sporadic " case , not associated with a known mutation .
But Therese 's sister Josephine and her first cousin Victoria had died of ovarian cancer .
Their DNA , retrieved from stored blood samples , tested positive for 185delAG .
" Something 's going on with our family , " Therese said .
" We need to wake up . "
Castellano offered to hold counseling sessions with members of the Valdez extended family in April 2007 .
With Therese 's backing , she sent out 50 invitations .
A total of 67 people , including children , attended the session in a hospital conference room in Denver .
Therese said , " One cousin — he wo n't come .
He does n't want to know .
To each his own . "
The tables were arranged in a U - shape , rather like the mountains around the valley .
Castellano stood at the open end .
She pointed out that in addition to breast and ovarian cancer the Valdez family had several cases of colon cancer .
" There 's some risk , it appears , " Castellano said , " and therefore everyone in the family should have a colonoscopy at age 45 . "
That caused grumbling among her listeners .
" This family has a lot of ovarian cancer , " she went on , " but appears not to have a breast cancer case under age 35 .
So we think the age for women for starting their annual mammograms should be 30 to 35 .
We recommend that our ' 185 ' families do it by MRI every year .
And if you do have 185 , " she added bluntly , " get your ovaries out at age 35 . "
A silence , then a question from a young woman in her 20s : " Ca n't a healthy lifestyle help ?
Do you have to have your ovaries out at 35 ? "
" Taking them out will decrease your risk but not eliminate it , " Castellano said .
Looking for support for this harsh measure , she smiled down the table at Angelita Valdez Armenta .
Angelita had undergone the operation , called an oophorectomy .
" Angie is a great example of how someone here is going to get old ! "
Months after the meeting , Angelita had her DNA tested and learned she was indeed a carrier of 185delAG .
The point of the meeting , which Castellano came to quickly enough , was to encourage family members to sign up for the DNA test .
" Do you have to be tested ? " she said .
" No .
But then you have to pretend you 're positive and be more proactive about your health and your screening . "
Noting that the men were also at some risk of breast cancer , Castellano urged them to check themselves by inverting the nipple and feeling for a pea-sized lump .
Shalee Valdez , a teenager videotaping the session , put down her camera .
" If you have the mutation , " she wanted to know , " can you donate blood ? "
Yes .
" Can it get into other people ? "
No , you had to inherit it .
Shalee looked pleased .
Castellano looked satisfied .
As of this writing 15 additional Valdezes have undergone testing for the 185delAG mutation , with six of them testing positive .
Even Stanley Hordes , whose two decades of historical research has been bolstered by the 185delAG findings , says that the greatest value of the genetic information in New Mexico and Colorado is that it " identified a population at risk for contracting potentially fatal diseases , thus providing the opportunity for early detection and treatment . "
In other words , genes are rich in information , but the information that matters most is about life and death .
As she prepared for the Valdez family meeting , Castellano recalled , she wondered how the group would respond to what she had to tell them about their medical history .
Then she plunged into her account of how 185delAG originated in the Middle East and traveled to New Mexico .
The revelation that the Valdezes were related to Spanish Jews prompted quizzical looks .
But , later , Elsie Valdez Vigil , at 68 the oldest family member there , said she was n't bothered by the information .
" Jesus was Jewish , " she said .

Explanation : A weekend trip for astrophotography in central Australia can result in gorgeous skyscapes .
In this example recorded in March of 2006 , the center of our Milky Way Galaxy rises over planet Earth 's horizon and the large sandstone formation called Uluru , also known as Ayers Rock .
After setting up two cameras to automatically image this celestial scene in a series of exposures , one through a wide - angle and the other through a telephoto lens , photographer Joseph Brimacombe briefly turned his back to set up other equipment .
To his surprise , the ground around him suddenly lit up with the brilliant flash of a fireball meteor .
To his delight , both cameras captured the bright meteor streak .
Highlighted in the telephoto view ( inset ) , the fireball trail shines through cloud banks , just left of Ayers Rock .

Democrats caved came to a new proposal on Wednesday which would allow offshore drilling 50 miles from the coast if the state approves : federal waters within 50 miles of shore would continue to be protected .
Waters off Florida ’s Gulf coast also would remain protected at least until 2022 under the plan .
The proposal is expected to come up for a vote next week .
Along with allowing offshore drilling , it is also expected to roll back tax breaks on the largest of oil companies , where those royalties will be used to spur renewable energy programs and conservation .
But the proposal , announced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s office , would essentially end the long - standing federal ban on oil and gas drilling that has barred oil companies from more than 80 percent of Outer Continental Shelf waters from New England to Washington state .
“ Our energy legislation will bring down gas prices , protect taxpayers , invest in clean renewable energy and provide an American - owned energy policy that the Bush - McCain Republicans have failed to deliver for the past eight years , ” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .
Congressional Republicans have been demanding a vote allowing access to the offshore resources , and the topic has also become a core issue of GOP presidential nominee John McCain .
But Republicans have strongly opposed new taxes on the oil companies as well as another of the Democrats ’ crazy demands : that utilities nationwide be required to use at least 15 - percent renewable energy , such as wind and solar .
Both provisions are key to the Democrats ’ plan .
House Republican leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said the Democrats ’ drilling proposal would still leave vast areas of federal coastal waters — believed to have 18 billion barrels of oil and large natural gas resources — off - limits .
Might I add , gooood !
“ They ’re trying to pull a hoax on the American people , ” Boehner told reporters Wednesday .
He said the Democrats ’ plan did n’t appear to include any sharing of royalties with states and with no financial incentives states would likely not participate , resulting “ in little or no new American energy production . ”
The Senate , meanwhile , is expected next week to take up several drilling proposals including one that would open waters off the Atlantic from Virginia to Georgia and the eastern Gulf off Florida to drilling but keep the bans in place elsewhere .
That plan also would allow for a 50 - mile coastal buffer .

Mr. Biden is Roman Catholic , giving him appeal to that important voting bloc , though he favors abortion rights .
He was born in a working - class family in Scranton , Pa. , a swing state where he remains well - known .
Mr. Biden is up for re-election to the Senate this year and he would presumably run simultaneously for both seats .
Mr. Biden is known for being both talkative and prone to making the kind of statements that get him in trouble .
In 2007 , when he was competing for Mr. Obama for the presidential nomination , he declared that Mr. Obama was “ not yet ready ” for the presidency .
The McCain campaign jumped on that early Saturday , as it responded to the selection , offering a glimpse into the line of criticism that awaits the Democratic ticket .
“ There has been no harsher critic of Barack Obama ’s lack of experience than Joe Biden .
Biden has denounced Barack Obama ’s poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what Americans are quickly realizing  that Barack Obama is not ready to be President , ” said Ben Porritt , a spokesman for Mr. McCain .
Although Mr. Biden is not exactly a household name , he is probably the best known of all the Democrats who were in contention for the spot , given his political and personal history ( not to mention his regular appearances on the Sunday morning television news shows ) .
He first ran for the Senate from Delaware when he was just 29 .
Mr. Biden has run twice for the presidency himself , in 1988 and again in 2008 , dropping out early in both cases .
He was also the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during two of the most contentious Supreme Court nomination battles of the past 50 years : the confirmation proceedings for Robert H. Bork , who was defeated , and Clarence Thomas , who was confirmed after an explosive hearing in which Anita Hill had accused Mr. Thomas of sexual harassment .
Mr. Biden led the opposition to both nominations , although he came under criticism from some feminists for not immediately disclosing what were at first Ms. Hill ’s closed - door accusations against Mr. Thomas .

Savoury pork mush .
Yum !
Bulkies : seems to be a large roll or bun in Massachusetts .
Can any natives comment ?

Scrapple : a savory mush of pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal and flour , sometimes buckwheat flour .
You know anytime you get “ savoury ” and “ mush ” juxtaposed you are in for a gourmet treat .
We have n’t just chickened out on new foods !
We have also tried some regional specialties that were special in a good way , and we ’re tracking down recipes for those to share with you , like Cheddar Ale Soup from Vermont .
In the meantime , we have a couple of questions for you :
What is the wierdest food you ’ve ever eaten while traveling ?
Share your horror stories !
Over at BearShapedSphere , one of my favourite travel blogs , Eileen writes about the new ( to her ) potato chip flavours in Chile , and asks her readers about the wierdest chip ( or crips ) flavours in their countries .
The wildest I ’ve seen were hedgehog ( in the UK ) and all the seafood - flavoured chips in Japan .
If you have come across some strange flavours where you live , head on over and tell Eileen about your potato chips .
What kind of unique US regional specialties can you recommend that we try ?
We ’ve been known to make detours just to taste really wierd stuff .
If we can find your weird food recommendations ( and if they fit my restricted diet ) , we ’ll do our best to try them out as we travel and report back .
And if ca n’t eat them , I guess that means the duty falls to Neil !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - An “ emergency ” request to the U.S. Congress for funds to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is strewn with money to buy military goods that cannot yet be used in either country .
An MV - 22 Osprey is seen landing on the USS Saipan during exercises in January , 1999 .
REUTERS / Handout
Buried in President George W. Bush ’s 159 - page request for additional war funding are plans to give the Pentagon $ 230 million for an F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft purchase .
That ’s a small portion of the more than $ 100 billion in war funds the Bush administration wants Congress to pass .
White House Budget Director Jim Nussle told lawmakers last week that failure to do so by late May would harm Pentagon operations .
But it is part of a Pentagon strategy to help modernize a war - sapped military with money outside its regular budget .
Nussle ’s urgent appeal failed to note that Lockheed Martin ’s F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter is still in the developmental stage , not entering service until around 2013 .
The F - 35 has been in the works since at least 1993 , so it ’s not exactly an unexpected cost of war in Iraq or Afghanistan , which the emergency spending claims to address .
The Pentagon said the F - 35 funding request was relevant because the fighters will replace F - 16 jets lost in Iraq .
“ We do n’t feel that it makes sense to replace existing losses with old technology , ” said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman .
He acknowledged the Pentagon might have considered replacing lost F - 16s with technology now available if war losses , and therefore the need for replacements , was greater .
Placing some longer - term expenditures in emergency war - funding bills is a way of getting around caps on the Defense Department ’s regular spending and “ makes more money available in the regular budget to meet cost overruns , ” said Amy Belasco , a Congressional Research Service defense analyst .
Chronically , major Pentagon projects have exceeded cost projections , according to government auditors .
Besides the F - 35 request , the Pentagon wants $ 492.5 million in “ emergency ” funds to buy the Air Force five CV - 22 Osprey aircraft that can take off and hover like a helicopter and make long - distance flights like an airplane .
The aircraft , manufactured by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. and Boeing Co. , will not be operational until 2009 at the earliest , with a total of 50 CV - 22 aircraft delivered by 2017 , according to the U.S. Air Force .
Another high - tech aircraft , Boeing ’s EA - 18G
Navy plane , would get $ 375 million .
But this precision attack aircraft also wo n’t even become operational for another year .
Democrats running for president are promising that if they occupy the White House in January , they will immediately begin phasing out the war in Iraq and possibly have it over with before some of these weapons are widely available .
THE UNCERTAINTIES OF WAR ?
These supplemental war funds requests , sent to Congress the past seven years , are dubbed emergencies by supporters who argue they are to pay for combat operations that ca n’t be planned in regular budgets due to the uncertainties of war .
Without the money , U.S. combat soldiers would run out of ammunition , fuel and tanks to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The money is on top of about $ 500 billion that Congress annually gives the military for its regular operations .
Increasingly , the Pentagon has tucked into the “ emergency ” bills requests for hardware and personnel with questionable relevance to the combat the measures are supposed to fund .
“ There will be people trying to get it stripped out ” this time around , said Sen .
Ben Nelson , the Nebraska Democrat who serves on the Senate panels overseeing military budgets .
There are concerns in the House of Representatives too .
At a hearing of the House Budget Committee , Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin asked Pentagon officials about long - term military costs increasingly being paid with war monies .
“ Why has the spending increased by 140 percent over the last seven years in the procurement , research and development , test and evaluation accounts ” of war funding , Ryan wondered .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , in a February 11 analysis of escalating war costs , observed that before 2005 , war funds mostly were to deploy troops , transport equipment and buy fuel , spare parts and munitions .
But starting in 2005 , CBO said , instead of just repairing war - damaged equipment , the Pentagon began using emergency war funds to replace such equipment with “ newer models ” while also accelerating “ planned purchases of new systems . ”
The controversial practice is embraced by Democratic Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania , who chairs a powerful defense spending panel .
Saying the Iraq war that he now opposes is “ stretching our forces thin and destroying our readiness , ” Murtha argued that using the emergency bills to help buy future weapons systems will help “ prepare our military and nation to face threats down the road . ”
Austrian man Martin Bierbauer was minding his own business , you know , getting his crap on , possibly flipping through a magazine or dirty joke book , when KA - BOOM ! -- he was ass - blasted off the toilet by a barrage of hailstones from the shitty depths .
" I heard the pipes rumbling a bit , and suddenly hailstones the size of golf balls started exploding out of the toilet like it was a popcorn machine .
There was an avalanche of ice that quickly filled the toilet , then the entire flat , and eventually the entire building .
I ran down the stairs with the hailstones following me , and other residents did the same . "
The incident at the block of flats in Eisenstadt , the capital of the province of Burgenland , was caused by hailstones flooding into a local drain during a torrential downpour , which became blocked .
Local council spokesman Wolfgang Leinner said : " The pressure was too great , the hailstones had to go somewhere and they came out through the toilets it seems . "
Haily shit .

I received the following description of Republican National Convention goings - on , as recounted by someone who accompanied the Oklahoma delegation , in an email today :
On the way up to Minneapolis , I must admit that I voiced my indecision as to which Presidential candidate would be worse ?
McCain or Obama .
My experiences at the RNC made it QUITE clear for me that McCain would not be better than Obama .
Not to say Obama would be any better , but it would be tough to be worse than what I saw of McCain .
I ’m sure you have all heard about the raids of private homes , the tear - gassing , the unwarranted arrests , etc. that occurred outside the RNC venue .
But what many did not hear about , and what really does n’t come across fully unless you are there to experience it first - hand , is how McCain ’s hired hands terrorized and intimidated even the RNC DELEGATES !
I spoke to a couple of non-Ron Paul supporters who voiced how they were disturbed by the heavy - handedness on display at the convention .
Let me relate just a few of my own experiences as well as some of those with me at the convention .
First , I was amazed by the sheer number of McCain ’s hired thugs .
They each wore a colored - coded ballcap ( I wonder where they got that idea ? ) with “ McCain ” emblazoned on the front , except for one color , black .
The black hats had a white star on the front , and this was a very special designation : the Ron Paul handlers .
These were assigned to monitor and handle the Ron Paul people specifically .
I do n’t know about you , but I feel honored .
That goes to show just how far we have come as a force in the Party and how afraid they are .
Getting back to the size of this goon force : I estimated that on the floor of the convention alone , there were 150 - 200 red hats .
The red hats were charged with things like spotting troublemakers , starting chants ( to overpower anyone saying something “ off - message ” ) , and generally keeping things under control and filling in with paid enthusiasm where the rank - and - file left off .
Think about that number for a moment , 150 - 200 .
That ’s almost one for every ten delegates on the floor .
And when McCain finally spoke , the floor was flooded with other paid staffers as well to help further bulk up the applause .
They also had what I call “ morale officers ” posted behind the delegations and they would say things like , “ come on , Oklahoma , you can do better than that ” and then urge them to cheer and clap louder for the speaker .
It was a tightly managed production , and what struck me was the lack of confidence McCain must have had in his ability to inspire genuine support from Republicans in attendance to the point he thought he had to have a hired army on the floor to boost morale as well as silence opposition .
There were also hired hands with white hats .
These were the ones who would deliver signs .
You know those homemade - looking signs you saw people holding ?
Those were n’t homemade .
They were made by RNC staff and then distributed to those in the audience .
One of the most absurd examples I saw was when they handed a “ Hispanics \< heart > McCain ” sign down a row with no Hispanics in it .
If you saw one of those signs on TV , that most likely was n’t a heart - felt statement from someone of Hispanic descent in the audience , but rather a convention - goer dutifully hefting the message the Powers That Be have ordained for you to see .
It was all very deceptive .
Back to the black hats .
The black hats , as I said earlier , were intended as Paul - control .
Several of our very own Paul delegates were harassed by these thugs .
One of ours had some of her McCain - provided signs torn ( because they believed she had modified them to promote Ron Paul ) and had her belongings ransacked .
Another of ours had some of his flyers on REAL ID confiscated summarily .
And on another occasion , he was told to submit his bag to be searched by someone without any security credentials .
When he refused on the grounds that he had been presented with no security credentials , he was told that his badge was CIA - issued .
Our delegate replied that he would not believe that unless someone with actual security credentials could confirm this man ’s authority to search his bag .
Sure enough , a security officer was summoned and confirmed this man ’s authority .
This indicates he may have been telling the truth when he claimed his badge was CIA - issued .
If that is true , it is very chilling since the CIA has no domestic authority and it is indeed illegal for them to operate domestically .
Many ( if not all ) of our Paul - supporting delegates had colored - hatted goons tailing them everywhere they went .
One even reported being followed to and from the bathroom .
I was not a delegate but was given the opportunity to sit with the alternates , and once they saw I was not standing and cheering when I was supposed to , we had a yellow hat ( quick response team ) assigned to stand by our row who watched us closely the entire time .
In fact , each aisle on the second tier of seating had at least one red hat standing at the bottom looking up at everyone seated there as if to say , “ we ’re watching you ” .
I could feel the hot breath of Big Brother on my neck the entire time .
I refused to compromise my integrity by applauding a criminal , but I also knew that made me a target .
We knew our every move was being watched , and we could have our belongings confiscated at any time and be thrown out if not arrested .
Some Ron Paul delegates from another state reported that at one point they were surrounded by security , had their personal effects seized including books , flyers , pins and buttons , etc , and when they protested that Ron Paul was just another Republican , they were told , “ this is McCain country ? ” .
Yes , the police state was on full display not only outside , but also inside the Republican National Convention .
If this is the way McCain and his advisors handle possible dissent , by making sure no message can be heard but theirs , and by terrorizing and intimidating anyone who might hold a different opinion , just imagine what this man will do as President .
Our body language exhibits far more information about how we feel than it is possible to articulate verbally .
All of the physical gestures we make are subconsciously interpreted by others .
This can work for or against us depending on the kind of body language we use .
Some gestures project a very positive message , while others do nothing but set a negative tone .
Most people are totally oblivious to their own body language , so the discipline of controlling these gestures can be quite challenging .
Most of them are reflexive in nature , automatically matching up to what our minds are thinking at any given moment .
Nevertheless , with the right information and a little practice , we can train ourselves to overcome most of our negative body language habits .
Practice avoiding these 25 negative gestures :
I speak two languages , Body and English .
– Mae West
Holding Objects in Front of Your Body – a coffee cup , notebook , hand bag , etc .
Holding objects in front of your body indicates shyness and resistance , such that you ’re hiding behind the objects in an effort to separate yourself from others .
Instead of carrying objects in front of you , carry them at your side whenever possible .
Checking the Time or Inspecting Your Fingernails – a strong sign of boredom .
Never glance at the time when you ’re speaking with someone .
Likewise , completely avoid the act of inspecting your fingernails .
Picking Lint Off of Your Clothes –
If you pick lint off of your clothes during a conversation , especially in conjunction with looking downwards , most people will assume that you disapprove of their ideas and / or feel uneasy about giving them an honest opinion .
Leave the lint alone !
Stroking Your Chin While Looking at Someone – “ I ’m judging you ! ”
People frequently stroke their chin during the decision - making process .
If you look at someone while you ’re stroking your chin , they may assume that you ’re making a judgmental decision about them .
Narrowing Your Eyes –
If you want to give someone the impression that you do n’t like them ( or their ideas ) , narrow your eyes while looking at them .
It immediately places a scowling expression on your face .
A slight narrowing of the eyes is an instinctual , universal expression of anger across various species in the animal kingdom ( think about the angry expressions of tigers , dogs , etc. ) .
Some people make the mistake of narrowing their eyes during a conversation as a reflex of thinking .
Do n’t send people the wrong message … do n’t narrow your eyes .
Standing Too Close – This just makes people feel uncomfortable .
Most people consider the 4 square feet of space immediately surrounding their body to be personal space .
Cross this invisible boundary with good friends and intimate mates only .
Looking Down
While in the Presence of Others – usually indicates disinterest .
Sometimes it ’s even interpreted as a casual sign of arrogance .
Always look straight ahead and make eye contact when you see someone you know .
Touching Your Face During a Conversation – Face touching , especially on the nose , is commonly interpreted as an indication of deception .
Also , covering up the mouth is a common gesture people make when they ’re lying .
Always keep your hands away from your face when you ’re speaking .
Faking a Smile – another sign of deception commonly seen on the face of a fraud .
A genuine smile wrinkles the corners of the eyes and changes the expression of the entire face .
Fake smiles only involve the mouth and lips .
It ’s easy to distinguish between the two .
Do n’t force yourself to smile … unless it ’s for the camera .
Leaning Away From Someone
You Like – a sign of being bored and disinterested .
Some people may also interpret it to mean : “ I do n’t like you . ”
People typically lean towards people they like and away from people they dislike .
This is especially true when they are sitting around a table .
If you lean away from someone you like , you ’re sending them the wrong message .
Resting Hands Behind the Head or on the Hips – usually interpreted as a sign of superiority or bigheadedness .
Only use these gestures when you ’re in the presence of close friends .
Not Directly Facing the Person You ’re Speaking To – This indicates a certain level of discomfort or a lack of interest .
When we ’re happily engaged in a conversation we face the person we ’re speaking to with our feet and torso facing directly forward .
When we ’re unsure of the other person , or not completely committed to the conversation , we tend to angle our feet and torso to the side .
Face directly forward during a conversation to give off the impression that you ’re truly interested in what the other person is saying .
Crossing Your Arms – a sign of defensive resistance .
Some people may also interpret it as a sign of egotism .
Always try to keep your arms open and at your sides .
Displaying a Sluggish Posture –
When you ’re in an environment bustling with people your posture becomes an immediate telltale sign of your confidence and composure .
Your stance literally makes a stand for you , delivering a clear message about how you should be treated .
It can make a huge difference in the way strangers respond to you .
Place your feet a comfortable distance apart , keep your shoulders pulled back , head up and greet people with direct eye contact and a firm handshake .
Scratching at the Backside of Your Head and Neck – a typical sign of doubt and uncertainty .
It can also be interpreted as an indication of lying .
Try to keep your hands away from your head when you ’re communicating with others .
Messing With the Collar of Your Shirt – It screams : “ I feel horribly uncomfortable and / or nervous ! ”
Once again , keep track of your hands .
Do n’t fidget .
Increasing Your Rate of Blinking – a clear sign of anxiety .
Some people start blinking their eyes really fast ( in conjunction with an increased heart rate ) when they get nervous .
Since most people try to make eye contact , it becomes immediately obvious to others .
Be cognizant of your blinking habits when you ’re nervous , especially if someone is looking at you from a close proximity .
Slouching Your Shoulders – indicates low self - esteem .
People associate perked - up shoulders with strong self - confidence .
Always pull your shoulders back .
Not only will you look more confident , you ’ll feel more confident as well .
Standing with Your Hands Crossed Over Your Genitals –
This casual posture almost guarantees that you ’ll lose a little respect before you even have the chance to speak a single word .
People feeling nervous or unsure of themselves will unconsciously take a guarded stance .
Quite frequently they adopt a posture that guards one of their most vulnerable areas , their genitals .
This stance pushes your shoulders forward and makes your entire body look smaller and weaker .
Again , try to keep your hands at your sides and your shoulders back .
Propping Up Your Head with Your Hands – “ I ’m getting bored ! ” Never prop up your head with your elbows and hands during a conversation .
Place your hands on the table in front of you and keep them at rest .
Wiping Sweaty Hands onto Your Clothes – a sign of frantic nervousness .
If your hands are sweating , just let them sweat .
Take a few deep breaths and try to relax .
Sitting on the Edge of Your Chair – a clear indication of being mentally and physically uncomfortable .
It ’s an apprehensive stance that will make others around you feel uncomfortable as well .
Keep your rear end firmly planted on the surface of the seat .
When you lean forward , use your back without moving your bottom .
Foot and Finger Tapping – usually indicates stress , impatience or boredom .
Monitor your habits and practice keeping your limbs at rest .
Using Your Hands to Fidget with Small Objects – a pen , paper ball , etc .
This is another sign of anxiety .
It can also be interpreted as a lack of preparedness .
It ’s always best to keep your hands comfortably at rest when you ’re in the presence of others .
Repeatedly Shifting Body Weight from Foot to Foot –
This is another gesture that usually indicates mental and physical discomfort .
People may also see this and assume that you ’re ready to abandon the conversation , especially if you ’re not directly facing them .
Do n’t shift your feet around more than once every 2 to 3 minutes .

" He thought apparently ( the DVD case ) was a great spot to hide it from me , and it was .
I did n't think to look there . "
- Belleville resident Tracy Holmes on $ 1,200 her husband hid in DVD case she sold at garage sale .
.
When Tracy Holmes of Belleville sold three DVDs for $ 10 at her garage sale Aug. 15 , she thought she was doing well .
She was getting rid of some movies that she and her husband had n't watched in a long time and making a little money as well .
About a week later , when her husband , Fred Holmes , asked her what had happened to the DVD of " Sin City , " she suddenly felt sick .
Her husband had been secretly saving up money , at least $ 1,200 so far , for a Christmas family trip to Disney World in Florida for the couple and their three children , Nick , 11 , Trevor , 7 , and Isabella , 2 .
Reporter John Mulcahy can be reached at 734-994-6858 or jmulcahy@annarbornews.com .
" He thought apparently ( the DVD case ) was a great spot to hide it from me , and it was , " Holmes said .
" I did n't think to look there . "
As best she can remember , Holmes thinks the man who bought the DVD was about 6 feet tall and in his 50s or possibly 60s .
She 's hoping that if she gets the word out , the buyer will return the money .
" My kids are pretty upset about the whole thing , and I feel just heartsick , " Tracy Holmes said .
" It 's always been a dream of mine to go to Disney World at Christmas . "
Her husband , who had been saving for a couple of years for the trip , stashed the money behind an advertisement inside the cover of the DVD , she said .
Holmes is asking anyone who knows about the money to e-mail her at nickandtrevsmom@yahoo.com .
Kathy Hilton has slammed John McCain for his ad featuring her precious daughter Paris -- especially , as we reported , after she and her hubby forked over $ 4,600 to his campaign .
Kathy told the Huffington Post , " It is a complete waste of the money John McCain 's contributors have donated to his campaign .
It is a complete waste of the country 's time and attention at the very moment when million of people are losing their homes and their jobs .
And it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next President of the United States . "

Emory political science professor Alan Abramowitz seems to have a mathematical election model that works .
Abramowitz ’s system has correctly predicted the popular vote winner within two percentage points for every presidential election since 1988 .
This year , it ’s predicting an Obama win : 54.3 percent , versus McCain ’s 45.7 percent .
The model is n’t perfect , of course , but it does factor in a wide range of variables such as GDP , a party ’s time in office , and recent polls .
“ While factors outside of the model , such as rising partisan polarization and resistance to an African American candidate by some white voters may result in a somewhat smaller popular vote margin for the Democratic nominee , ” Abramowitz writes , “ the combination of an unpopular Republican incumbent in the White House , a weak economy , and a second - term election make a Democratic victory in November all but certain . ”
If you ’re skeptical of models , check out the Iowa Electronic Market ‘s trading index for the presidential election .
For decades , it ’s been a much better predictor of presidential wins than Gallup polls .
As of today , the market ’s predicting a 54 percent win for the Democrats , versus 45 percent for the Republicans .
it could be a coincidence that those numbers are so close to Abramowitz ’s , or it could be that investors are reacting to his model ’s predictions .
A third option : it could be that Obama actually is going to win by ten points .

For years , Xen and VMware have been the virtualization technologies of choice for open source operating systems vendors .
With Red Hat 's acquisition of Qumranet yesterday and its competing Kernel - based Virtual Machine ( KVM ) open source hypervisor the winds of change may be blowing , or not .
While Red Hat is now betting at least $ 107 million that KVM is the future of virtualization , other vendors in the open source virtualization space are n't so sure .
Red
Hat executives claim that it's not a hypervisor war , and that they are now engaged in a battle with only one other vendor that has an end to end platform , namely Microsoft .
Among those that participate in the open source virtualization market , Citrix , Sun , Novell , VMware and Oracle all have a stake and few agree with Red Hat 's vision .
Simon Crosby , the CTO of Citrix 's virtualization and management division in particular has some harsh views on Red Hat 's virtualization market positioning .
In his view , Red Hat is an OS vendor and their direct competitors are other OS vendors like Novell and Oracle on the Linux side and Microsoft on the Windows side .
" They do not compete in the market for bare - metal or general purpose virtualization systems and certainly have nothing to do with the broader application delivery space .
Crosby told InternetNews.com .
" Their only interest is getting some level of virtualization built into the Linux OS so that Red Hat Linux is not at an even further disadvantage to Microsoft once Hyper - V begins shipping as part of Windows Server . "
Crosby argued that it is Citrix 's belief that the majority of the market will want bare - metal virtualization systems like XenServer and VMware ESX with some segments wanting virtualization built into the Windows OS through Hyper-V .
Crosby did acknowledge that Red Hat has been a useful contributor in the Xen.org project and that Xen is an integral part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) version 5 . Red
Hat has already publicly stated that it will continue to support Xen as part of RHEL .
However Red Hat has argued that KVM can offer certain management and performance gains over Xen , which is also something that Crosby takes issue with .
" KVM benchmarking is extremely selective , " Crosby commented .
" Where it does benefit in performance , it does so by sacrificing what we view as fundamental security concerns for enterprise virtualization deployments .
Xen 's deep separation of trust domains costs a bit in performance but provides the hard - line separation required for any secure deployment of virtualization . "
Crosby argued that in general KVM is only as secure as the Linux host OS which is where the weaknesses may lie .
" We believe that the KVM / Linux model for virtualization is insecure at a fundamental level , " Crosby claimed .
" And any performance gains that Red Hat claims will be due to the inclusion in the Linux kernel of eminently attackable code . "

GoAnimate is a new online service the allows anybody to create indepth animated videos .
Online animation services are n’t new , but most offer basic feature sets that emphasize quick creation over options .
GoAnimate on the other hand is a full suite of animation tools , covering just about every possible thing you could think to create .
Users can define everything from characters , layouts , speech and music , and on top of an extensive library of options , you can also upload your own elements or import scenes from services such as Flickr .
GoAnimate also acts as a host for created animations , complete with embedding options , and support is built in to promote clips on social voting and networking sites .
The site bills itself as a service to people who do n’t know how to use Flash , or ca n’t draw .
It ’s a fair way of defining the service , but at the same time creating an animation is n’t a quick process either .
Depth takes time , and there is also a learning curve as well to know how and when to do certain actions , even if the layout is logical .
I have n’t whipped an animation up for this posts because I do n’t want to end up wasting hours creating one , but if you ’ve ever wanted to create your own animated short , bookmark this site now , it ’s that good .

As Jed Lewison notes , if Sarah Palin were a Democrat , John McCain would be running this ad .
There are some things that every citizen should have a right to : quality health care , a job that contributes to society , and night vision goggles .
Before now , the ability to see in the dark was kept only for survivalists , hunters , and , of course , the armed forces .
Luckily , Jakks Pacific has finally given the country what it needs : affordable night vision for the entire family .
It seems there are two types of people on the planet : those that wonder why children would want a toy that lets them see in the dark and those that buy night vision goggles from toy stores because they 're under a hundred dollars .
I will admit to drooling over the Eye Clops Night Vision goggles every time I 've been in a toy store for the past few months , but I could n't bring myself to spend the $ 79.99 on a product that was most likely a gimmick .
However , when the company offered to send Ars a review sample ...
The goggles are technically a toy and aimed for children , but I found it easy to adjust the straps to fit my larger noggin .
The battery pack sits behind your head , and the goggles take five AA batteries to operate .
Since I received my unit in the middle of the day , I went to the only place that 's pitch black in a suburban home : the bathroom .
Putting in the batteries , sliding the goggles over my eyes , and then turning them on , I was excited to finally see what sub -$ 100 night vision looked like .
I turned the power switch to " on " ...
You may look like a dork , but you can see in the dark .
Fair trade
Unfortunately , we were n't able to get good pictures of the display while in use
... and I was right ; it was a gimmick .
A little LCD screen turns on inside the goggles , and in the ghostly green glow of the mirror , I saw a bright light on the goggles .
That 's it ?
An LCD screen and a flashlight ?
Lame .
Then I took the goggles off , and saw that I was standing in complete darkness , a perfect black .
The light I saw was from the array of infrared lights on the goggles , and it was invisible to the naked eye .
I put them on again and looked around .
I could see everything !
The look and feel of the goggles are surprisingly high - quality
You can flip a switch on the side of the goggles to turn on a barely - noticeable red glow on the top of the unit , and this looks like a floodlight when viewed through the goggles .
That night , I grabbed a friend and explored the back yard in the middle of the night .
Since there is only one screen , you lose depth perception , and the image is slightly magnified so it's hard to judge distances , but the unit does what 's advertised .
It provides real , working night vision .
It was time for Nerf - gun wars in my jet - black basement .
With the goggles , you 'd see three ninjas in this picture
If you become disoriented when walking around with the goggles — and with the smallish screen and lack of depth perception , it takes practice to move around effectively — you can flip up the plastic piece above your left eye to see things normally , though I did have problems with that flap falling off now and again .
My other minor complaint is that while you can switch the view to a green mode from the standard black - and - white display , it does n't do anything except mimic what you 're used to seeing in movies when people wear night vision goggles .
Unlike more expensive sets , this does n't amplify light as much as it simply picks up on infrared light , which gives the goggles some neat properties : on the highest setting , everyone 's eyes look like hollow pools of light , and your television 's remote control lights up the room like a strobe light .
In normal light , you see everything in full color , at regular brightness .
Despite the issues with the eye cover and the heavy strain on normal batteries , this is a very high - quality toy that can satisfy some serious geek lust .
Who does n't want to see in the dark ?
Testing the goggles , we turned all the lights in the room , and had my friend 's wife stand ten feet away holding up differing numbers of fingers .
She stood out in the goggles like a flare , and it was fun to tell her what she was doing when she could n't see us at all .
The possibilities for shenanigans are nearly infinite .
Claim : Musician finally masters extraordinarily difficult guitar part he heard on a record , only to learn the recording had been made with more than one guitar .
LEGEND
Origins :
When I was reading the New York Times obituary for rockabilly singer Hasil Adkins ( who passed away on 26 April 2005 ) , I was struck by something familiar about the following paragraph :
Starting in the mid-50’s , Mr. Adkins recorded hundreds of songs at home in rural West Virginia , accompanying himself on all the instruments .
He played as a one - man band because , he later said , as a child he had heard Hank Williams and others on the radio and had assumed that the one named musician in the band played all the instruments himself .
It
reminded me of a story I was sure I ’d heard several times before , about some hot - shot guitarist who proudly showed off that he ’d finally managed to duplicate a tricky guitar riff he ’d heard on a record , only to be greeted with laughter as his bandmates informed him that the part he ’d mastered was actually recorded using two guitars .
I thought maybe the version I had previously come across involved Eddie van Halen and the Beatles ’ “ And Your Bird Can Sing ” ; a little searching on that song title did indeed turn up an example of the legend , this one about former Eagle ( and solo artist ) Joe Walsh :
He was a devout eclectic , majoring in an odd conglomeration of courses — electronics , music theory and welding — and supplementing his conventional training with intensive , self - imposed extracurricular studies of Beatles songs .
He knew them all and became a local legend by performing the dual - guitar harmony riff in “ And Your Bird Can Sing ” from the Revolver album on a single guitar .
Actually , he did n’t realize it was n’t one guitar and found a way to “ make it work ” — a typical Joe Walsh philosophy in music and in life .
We ca n’t definitively say whether Joe Walsh really worked out how to perform the riff from “ And Your Bird Can Sing ” on one guitar without realizing the recording featured a second , overdubbed guitar part ( only Joe himself knows for sure ) , but the story is certainly not unique to him .
Another version of this tale is told about legendary jazz guitarist Lenny Breau :
Breau was clearly reinventing jazz guitar — and gaining a reputation among musicians throughout North America .
The mythmaking had begun .
One of the earliest legends surrounding Breau was that he had recreated Les Paul ’s 1952 recording of “ Tiger Rag ” without realizing that Paul achieved his multi-layered sound through early experiments with overdubbing multiple guitar tracks .
The self - effacing Breau later discounted the story , saying he knew Paul had overdubbed the parts — as if that diminished the fact he ’d still managed to single - handedly duplicate the sound of several guitars .
A reverse version of this legend comes from Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards , who described his thoughts when bandmate Brian Jones introduced him to records featuring blues artist extraordinaire Robert Johnson :
He put it on , and it was just — you know — outstanding stuff .
When I first heard it , I said to Brian , “ Who ’s that ? ” “ Robert Johnson . ” I said , “ Yeah , but who ’s the other guy playing with him ? ”
Because I was hearing two guitars , and it took me a long time to realize he was actually doing it all by himself .
A couple of similar tales relate other ways in which musicians uniquely adapted their styles to duplicate sounds produced by means beyond their understanding .
The first one has to do with guitarist Robbie Robertson ( formerly of The Band ) :
Listen sometime to the sliding technique that Robbie uses .
I do n’t remember where I read this , but in an interview with him I remember him saying that as a kid listening to the late night radio show , he did n’t realize that slide guitar was played with a slide ; so he adapted a technique of his own to create that effect of sliding up the string .
The second tale stars bluegrass mandolinist John Duffey :

And , like so many of his contemporaries , he learned a lot about how to play the mandolin from Monroe ’s classic 1940s recordings .
The thing he found most challenging was how Monroe managed to sing lead and play very elaborate , syncopated , counter - melodies as backup simultaneously , as he ’d heard on records like “ Sweetheart You ’ve Done Me Wrong ” and “ When You Are Lonely . ”
As he told a interviewer Dix Bruce : “ We only had 78 ’s , and they were kind of hard to slow down .
I learned a trick off of him that he was n’t really doing .
I did n’t know it was Lester
Flatt singing the lead , and I would hear this mandolin playing going on while this guy was singing .
I guessed you had to be able to do that .
I used to stand in front of a mirror , and
look , and sing a song , and make my hands independent of what I was singing .
Every once in a while I still do it just for amusement .
Bill and I did a workshop together up in Carlisle , Ontario , five or six years ago I guess , and I told him , ‘ You know I learned something off of you , and I bet you ca n’t do it . ’
I told him the story of not knowing it was Lester singing .
I sang a song and picked along behind , and he just grinned . ”
All of these stories , true or not , echo a common theme found in other legends such as “ The Unsolvable Math Problem “ : that when people are free to pursue goals unfettered by presumed limitations on what they can accomplish , they just may manage some extraordinary feats through the combined application of native talent and hard work .
On the other hand , they might also be considered as falling into the “ sour grapes ” category : they allow us to express a grudging admiration for someone else ’s accomplishments while simultaneously denigrating that person for having been foolish enough to try in the first place .

Republican - speechwriter - turned - columnist Peggy Noonan was a center of attention Wednesday when , in a casual conversation inadvertently recorded after she had wrapped up an appearance on MSNBC , she seemed to say that , in her view , John McCain had no chance of winning the presidency .
" It 's over " Noonan can be heard saying on the clip as she , NBC political director Chuck Todd and Mike Murphy ( another one - time GOP political operative ) discuss the ramifications of McCain 's pick of Sarah Palin as his running mate .
Noonan has since clarified the context of her comment , and it's not as has been interpreted , she says .
She does n't believe McCain can't win .
Indeed , in a message she sent out after the conversation on the MSNBC set made it onto YouTube , she noted that " at an on - the - record press symposium on the campaign on Monday , when all of those on the panel were pressed to predict who would win , I said that I did n't know , but that we just might find , ' This IS a country for old men . '
That is , McCain may well win .
I do not think the campaign is over , I do not think this is settled ... "
Her " it 's over " comment , she said , referred to the assumption among some GOP leaders that reactions within the Republican base -- such as the enthusiastic embrace of Palin -- reflect the attitudes of most Americans .
It is those days , Noonan says , that are " over . "
Our colleague Frank James at The Swamp blog has more on Noonan 's clarification .
-- Don Frederick
Turns out Palin did n’t quite shut down the Bridge to Nowhere after all .
She held on to $ 73 million federal dollars for a scaled down Bridge to Nowhere .
Late Update : Extra bonus McCain Lie ™ unearthed !
Down in the aforelinked article McCain spokesman Peter Feldman says this :
“ The fact is that once Governor Palin was elected and had an opportunity to look closely at the project , she killed it .
She fought for Congress to kill the provision , but they sent the funds anyway .
Palin fired the kill shot by not using a dime of that money on the bridge .
( emphasis added ) ” Feldman appears now to be saying that Palin either campaigned against the original earmark or campaigned for it to be killed after it was approved .
To the best of my knowledge I have never even heard them claim this before .
But keep the timeline in mind .
The Bridge to Nowhere earmark was killed in 2005 , a year before Palin even ran for governor .
And when she ran in 2006 she ran as a strong pro-Bridge candidate .
So when exactly is Feldman claiming she campaigned against the bridge earmark ?
When she was Mayor of Wasilla ?
MUMBAI / SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - Within hours of Bank of America agreeing to buy Merrill Lynch this week , Indian financial services firm Ambit hired five Merrill executives , a sign that Asia hopes to gain from massive Wall Street layoffs .
For China and India , whose economies are still expanding at well over 7 percent , the global financial industry crisis makes it easier to recruit bankers who are brushing off their resumes .
New York ’s governor reckons 40,000 Wall Street jobs could go in a worst - case scenario , with talk swirling of more bank deals and mergers .
Lehman Brothers , which has filed for bankruptcy protection , has around 2,000 staff in India , including its back - office operation , while Merrill has about 500 .
Ambit Holdings said on Monday it hired the five Merrill executives from a majority - owned local venture for its institutional equities and equity proprietary trading unit , including a 10 - year Merrill veteran as head .
BNP Paribas and Nomura Securities in India are looking to hire Lehman executives , according to investment banking sources who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter .
In Hong Kong , bankers said they were considering hiring from Lehman .
“ I think there ’s opportunities to improve our team or bring key people into key positions relatively easily and quickly and painlessly .
Normally , it ’s quite expensive and difficult to move investment bankers around , ” said one banker in Hong Kong .
“ All banks have the opportunity to upgrade or augment teams they were looking at anyway , because Lehman is a mix of pretty good people , ” the banker added .
Executives at Lehman ’s real estate and capital market divisions in China said there was still huge demand for talent in specific areas such as deal making and investment banking .

Lehman , like other foreign investment banks trying to build a business in India ’s fast - growing market , had poached rivals ’ teams in a mass hiring spree spiced with big salaries and bonuses .
Now , while some foreign banks may be wary about swelling their ranks , their local rivals will likely snap up people , and bankers may also opt for the relative safety of local firms .
“ The pace has definitely slowed and banks may not be looking to hire as aggressively as before , ” said Dhanpal Jhaveri , executive director of India ’s Future Capital Holdings , which is expanding its portfolio of financial services .
“ But it ’s high - quality talent , and everyone recognizes there are cycles .
People are always on the lookout for good talent . ”
SECURE BET
Bankers and headhunters are split over whether senior level or more junior executives will be hired more easily .
“ Junior and mid -level guys are more flexible and are cheaper to hire , ” said one investment banker , who recently moved to a local firm in Mumbai from a multinational .
“ More senior guys , unless they were really superb , may actually have a harder time , ” he said .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Infrastructure Development Finance Corp has discussed hiring Lehman executives , according to media reports , and other expanding local firms likely to follow suit include Tata Capital , Reliance Capital and HDFC Securities .
“ We are in the process of scaling up our operations , ” said Amar Sinhji , head of human resources at Tata Capital , which has ventures with Mitsubishi UFJ Securities and Mizuho Corp Bank .
“ We see this situation as an opportunity to source some of the best available talent in the industry , ” he said , adding Tata was looking to ramp up investment banking and private equity .
In China , too , some Lehman bankers have begun to look for jobs , not with other foreign banks , but with state banks that are seen as a more secure bet for the next few years .
Everyone , though , faces tougher times .
Indian investment banking fee income fell 44 percent in January - August , Thomson Reuters data showed , as tighter credit and higher borrowing costs dried up deals and put the brakes on fund raising .
In China , fee income is down nearly 6 percent this year .
Merrill was second in the Indian league table , which is headed by State Bank of India .
Lehman ranked 36th , down from 17th a year ago .
“ It ’s a bit of a gloomy outlook overall , but I do n’t think anyone will have trouble finding a job .
The domestic opportunity is still good , ” said Sandeep Chaudhry , business consultant leader at consulting firm Hewitt Associates .
“ Across the board though , we are going to see smaller packages ( and ) stricter performance appraisals . ”

Orion is a crewed spacecraft originally intended to be the Crew Exploration Vehicle component of the Constellation Program , which was cancelled in 2010 .
Orion subsequently became the basis of the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle ( MPCV ) .
What follows describes the role that Orion would have played in the Constellation Program .
For a description of its new planned role , see the separate article on the MPCV .
In Constellation , Orion would have have replaced the Space Shuttle Orbiter as NASA 's primary manned space vehicle , delivering crew and cargo to the International Space Station .
It was also intended that it would eventually return astronauts to the Moon .
On Aug 31 , 2006 , NASA awarded a five - year $ 3.9 - billion dollar contract to design and build Orion to Lockheed Martin , which beat a joint bid from Northrop Grumman and Boeing .
Orion had been scheduled to make its maiden orbital flight no later than 2014 and its first lunar flight no later than 2020 .
The booster that would have launched Orion was called Ares I ; a larger cargo launch vehicle was known as Ares V .
Orion crew module
The Orion crew module ( CM ) is a conical shape with a 70° slope like that of the Apollo Command Module .
This shape was deemed by NASA to be the safest and most reliable for re-entering Earth 's atmosphere , especially at the velocities attained following a direct return from the Moon .
The Orion CM is 2.5 times the volume of the Apollo CM .
It is 5 m ( 16.5 ft ) in diameter and has a mass of about 21 tons .
Four to six astronauts will travel aboard it , compared with the three - person capacity of the Apollo capsule .
A combination of parachutes and airbags will be used for the final descent to Earth , enabling the Orion CM to come down on land and eliminating the need for costly naval recovery at sea ( although spashdown will be retained as a backup option ) .
NASA expects to be able to reuse each Orion CM up to 10 times .
Only the heat shield , made of the same resin epoxy employed on all pre-Shuttle spacecraft , is non-reusable .
It will be ejected following deployment of the parachute - airbag recovery system and a new one fitted for the next mission .
Orion service module
Fig 3 .
Orion crew and service modules , side view
The Orion service module ( SM ) is cylindrical and equipped with a pair of solar panels which can be deployed like those of a Soyuz capsule .
Its main propulsion system consists of a Delta II upper stage engine using nitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine hypergolic propellants .
These same propellants will supply the spacecraft 's maneuvering thrusters , known as the SM Reaction Control System ( SM RCS ) .
NASA anticipates that , on a lunar mission , the SM RCS would be able to act as a backup for a trans - earth injection burn in case the main SM engine fails .
The SM's twin liquid oxygen tanks and a single tank of liquid nitrogen will provide the crew with air for breathing during most of the mission , while a surge tank in the Orion CM will supply about 3 hr of air after the SM has been jettisoned .
Lithium hydroxide cartridges will " scrub " the carbon dioxide exhaled by the astronauts from the ship 's air .
Fresh oxygen will be added and the air then cycled back into the system loop .
Orion and the International Space Station
To allow the Orion spacecraft to dock with the International Space Station , it would have been fitted with a simplified version of the Russian - developed universal docking ring used on the Shuttle fleet .
Both the spacecraft and docking adapter would have been covered over with a Launch Escape System ( LES ) identical in design to that found on the Soyuz spacecraft , along with a fiberglass " Boost Protective Cover " similar to that used on the Apollo CM .
Like its predecessor , it would have protected the Orion CM from both aerodynamic stresses and potential catastrophic damage during ascent .
Orion used for lunar missions
Coupled with a lunar lander , called the Lunar Surface Access Module ( LSAM ) , the Orion spacecraft would have been able to carry twice as many astronauts to the lunar surface as Apollo did and for longer stays – initially four to seven days .
While Apollo was limited to landings along the Moon 's equator , the new ship would have carried enough propellant to land anywhere on the lunar surface .
Once a lunar outpost had been established , crews would have remained on the lunar surface for up to six months .
Orion could also have operated without a crew in lunar orbit , eliminating the need for one astronaut to stay behind while others explored the surface .
NASA would have begun the first lunar expedition by launching a LSAM and a propulsion stage , called an Earth Departure Stage ( EDS ) , atop an Aries V heavy - lift rocket .
This would have consisted of a lengthened Shuttle External Tank and a pair of Solid Rocket Boosters capable of putting up to 125 tons in orbit – about one and a half times the mass of a Shuttle Orbiter .
The cargo it carried would have been able to wait for up to 30 days in orbit for the astronauts to launch aboard their Orion spacecraft .
Carrying a crew of four , Orion Crew and Service Modules would have blasted off atop an Aries I single solid - rocket booster consisting of four segments , like those flown with the Shuttle .
Once in orbit , the manned orbiter would have docked with the LSAM and the EDS in preparation for the trip to the Moon .
After a three - day journey , the four astronauts would have climbed into the LSAM , leaving the Crew and Service Modules in lunar orbit .
After landing and exploring the surface for seven days , the crew would have blasted off in a portion of the lander , docked with the CSM and returned to Earth .
NASA envisioned the possibility of building a semi- permanent lunar base , where astronauts would have made use of the Moon 's natural resources for water and fuel .
Other Orions
A number of other spacecraft , both in fact and fiction , have been called Orion .
Project Orion was a US scheme , investigated in the 1960s , to use nuclear propulsion for journeys to the Moon , planets , and stars .
Orion was also the name of the Lunar Module that landed astronauts on the Moon in 1972 in the second - to - last Apollo mission , Apollo 16 .
In science fiction , Orion III was the name of the space plane that transported a character in the film 2001 : A Space Odyssey to an orbiting space station .

Late yesterday , the House of Representatives passed a plan guaranteeing $ 25 billion in federal loans to Detroit automakers .
The New York Times reports , " Unwilling to risk one last fiscal standoff with President Bush , the House on Wednesday passed a stopgap spending measure that pushes critical spending and energy decisions off until 2009 and into the hands of the next president . "
The bill includes " $ 25 billion in loan guarantees for the nation 's auto manufacturers , " but stipulates that the money must be used to help the companies make more fuel - efficient cars .
Automakers would be required to begin making payments on the loans in five years , and complete payments within 30 years .
The Detroit Free Press adds , " The Senate is expected to pass the bill today , and the measure should get a signature from President George W. Bush shortly thereafter . "
The scope of the loan measure is hard to overstate .
This is by far the largest federal intervention into the auto industry .
The Free Press notes , " The loan deal dwarfs the $ 1.2 - billion bailout of Chrysler Corp. in 1979 , and reflects the deep economic crisis threatening the survival of Detroit automakers and the companies that rely on them . "
Detroit , however , does n't get the money right away .
USA Today notes , " The second battle ... over rules governing how the loans will be doled out now wo n't be decided until after the Presidential election . "
Industry analyst Rebecca Lindland of Global Insight told USA Today , " It 's like getting an early Christmas gift and not being able to use it until spring .
The value of this can't really be evaluated until they know the parameters .
I have to reserve judgment until the explanation for how they can use this is clear . "
The automakers had wanted the rules governing how to qualify for the loans written now , before the presidential election takes place .
They believed that " getting the rules written before the elections would have given the industry more clout in arguing for maximum flexibility in what qualifies , " because Michigan and Ohio -- the two states where the auto industry employs the most workers -- are considered critical swing states in the election .
JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel told USA Today , " The rules governing the distribution of the loans may become more onerous as the desire to win Michigan / Ohio votes would obviously become irrelevant after the November presidential election . "
The Big Three may not be finished asking for Federal help .
The Detroit News reports , " Several Michigan legislators said they would seek approval of another $ 25 billion in loans next year . "

PwnageTool and QuickPwn for 2.1 Firmware
Some of the popular press and blogs have been backing the opposition . :-)
While criticism and competition is fine it should be reported correctly , with all the facts and certainly minus the FUD .
Do you guys think we are “ less and less relevant with each passing day ” ?
We do n’t think so , and we certainly prefer our hacks to theirs .
Though even if the world deems us irrelevant , the iPhone family of devices is still fun to hack !

But we think they might want to rethink their priorities .
They probably wo n’t though , and so we get back to the “ cat and mouse ” game between Apple and the Dev Team and other third - party communities .

McCain attacks on education
By Michael Dobbs
" Education Week says Obama ' has n't made a significant mark on education ' .
That he's ' elusive ' on accountability .
A 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly . '
Obama 's one accomplishment ?
Legislation to teach ' comprehensive sex education ' to kindergartners .'
-- McCain " Education " Ad , September 7 , 2008 .
A new McCain ad caricatures Barack Obama 's education record by claiming that his only achievement is to pass legislation ensuring " comprehensive sex education " for kindergartners .
It implies that its critique of the Democratic presidential nominee has been endorsed by the non-partisan journal Education Week , when in fact it is a hotch - potch of quotes from a variety of sources stitched together to form a highly partisan political attack .
The Facts
Education
Week bills itself as the " journal of record " for education professionals .
In March last year , it ran a generally positive article about Obama , describing him as one of several Democratic candidates with a demonstrated interest in education policy .
The article noted that Obama had gained considerable " grassroots experience " of education problems in Chicago as the member of a board of a school reform initiative known as the Annenberg Challenge .
It went on to say that he had not made " a significant mark on education policy " in either the Illinois Senate or the U.S. Senate , but had pushed for the expansion of early childhood education .
The McCain ad includes captions attributing the quotes on accountability and Obama 's alleged support for " the existing public school monopoly " to a Washington Post editorial and an op -ed in the Chicago Tribune .
( Needless to say , the ad omitted the Post 's criticism of McCain for failing to come up with a detailed education plan . )
But a casual viewer or listener could easily get the impression that all the quotes came from Education Week .
The McCain ad is wrong when it claims -- in a voice dripping with sarcasm -- that Obama 's " one accomplishment " in the education field was the sex education bill for kindergartners .
While it is true that Obama supported the bill , he was not one of the sponsors .
As far as kindergartners were concerned , the principal purpose of the bill was to make them aware of the risk of inappropriate touching and sexual predators .
Other states , including California and Massachusetts , have passed similar legislation .
Obama was more closely identified with other education legislation in the Illinois State Senate , including a 2003 bill to double the number of Chicago charter schools from 15 to 30 , which he co-sponsored .
On substance , Obama has attempted to tread a fine line between his opposition to vouchers and his support for greater choice for parents , including support for charter schools .
In a speech in Dayton earlier this week , he proposed doubling the funding for " responsible charter schools , " along the lines of the earlier Chicago experiment .
The Pinocchio Test
Nobody expects television ads to be fair and objective analyses of public policy .
Almost by definition , the ads are partisan sales pitches , designed to promote one political brand while running down the rival brand .
But they should not misrepresent the record of the other side and should clearly distinguish quotes from non-partisan news sources from standard political rhetoric .
The McCain " education " ad fails this test .

' MI6 terror photographs ' found on £ 17 camera bought on eBay
Terror details :
Some of the material on the camera is said to relate to al Qaeda officer Abd al - Hadi al - Iraqi , who was captured in 2007
Police are investigating the eBay auction of a digital camera said to have contained MI6 images of terror suspects .
Suspects ' faces , names and fingerprints , as well as snaps of rocket launchers and missiles , were discovered by an online bidder who bought the camera for £ 17 , it was reported .
The 28 - year - old only found the images when he downloaded his own recent holiday snaps from the Nikon CoolPix .
He told police and was shocked when Special Branch officers arrived at his home in Hemel Hempstead , Herts , days later to seize the camera .
Officers are said to have made five visits to his home in the last week to quiz him and his family .
The Foreign Office said today : ' We can confirm a police investigation is under way . '
But a spokeswoman refused to comment on claims that the camera was sold by an MI6 agent .
Among the images which are reported to have been found on the camera is a ' top secret ' document giving details of the encrypted computer system used by MI6's agents in the field .
The Sun reports that some of the material relates to 46 - year - old Abdul al - Hadi al - Iraqi , a high - ranking al Qaeda officer captured by the CIA in 2007 .
A friend of the unnamed buyer told newspaper : ' He flew home early this month and downloaded his holiday pictures and saw some of rocket launchers and missiles .
' He knew he had n't taken them so he asked his friends about it and they suggested going to the police . '
Online bargain : A Nikon Coolpix camera like the one found with MI6 material stored on it
Neil Doyle , author of Terror Base UK , told the Sun the documents related to an operation against al Qaeda in Iraq , adding : ' It 's jaw - dropping that they got into the public domain .
' Not only do they divulge secrets about operations , operating systems and previously unheard - of MI6 departments , but they could put lives at risk . '
The report follows claims yesterday that a Cabinet Office employee is to be charged under the Official Secrets
Act after sensitive documents were left on a train in a separate incident .
The papers were taken out of Whitehall and left in an envelope on a Surrey - bound train from London Waterloo on June 10 , according to BBC News .
A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said all evidence had been reviewed and a decision passed back to police .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman refused to discuss the matter .

The General Election Debates : Its Back to the BoobTube .
Image courtesy Bettman / CorbisThe highly anticipated general election debates that kick off between the two presidential candidates next Friday will feature none of the voter - centric innovations pioneered during the primaries .
Not one YouTube video , not one instant message .
Instead , the debates will stick to the scripted , one - way broadcast television format of old .
" What they 're offering us here is little more than live video streaming , which is like , so , year 2000 , " says Micah Sifry co-founder of TechPresident.com and executive editor of the Personal Democracy Forum in New York City .
The presidential hopefuls have made a great hullabaloo over " reforming Washington " and making the government more accountable by using the internet .
But in the run-up to Election Day , the most important series of debates are ditching all of the technological innovations to include voters – all pioneered during the primaries .
“ These are , by far , the most influential political events that we have , " says George Farah , executive director of Open Debates , a group that wants to replace the current organization running the general election debates .
" It ’s the only time that tens of millions of voters are watching the candidates on the same stage , at the same time . ”
Each debate is expected to be watched by more than 60 million people worldwide , according to MySpace , which has partnered with the Commission on Presidential Debates to engage voters online .
Just under 40 million people watched each of the two presidential contenders ' nomination - acceptance speeches at the conventions .
Last summer , the internet pioneered several important new ways of connecting voters with candidates .
CNN partnered with YouTube to host two debates driven by voters ' video questions submitted via YouTube .
( Even then , CNN 's role in picking the questions was controversial .
Critics thought the network was still retaining too much editorial control over the process . )
But the most innovative forum came from TechPresident , which created a site called 10 Questions .
The site attempted to create an interactive town hall format by allowing voters as a group to surface key concerns using a Digg - like voting mechanism , rather than providing arbitrarily chosen questions that presented the candidates to bloviate , Sifry said at the time .
10 Questions.com allowed citizens to submit questions via video , which were voted up or down by the site 's users , and the process was audited to prevent gaming .
The site was widely supported by mainstream media , activists and bloggers from both ends of the political spectrum .
MTV and MySpace even included one of the site 's top questions in one of its town halls with Barack
Obama .
Participants in the forums appreciated their ability to converse as a group with the candidates .
" MTV and MySpace keep upping the ante with these candidate forums , and in terms of creating a more transparent , participatory interaction between the candidates and a mass audience , they continue to blow CNN and YouTube out of the water , " said Mike Connery , a 29 - year - old youth activist on his Future Majority blog .
But the upcoming presidential debates are by - and - large reverting back to the tried - and - trusted television format .
The Commission on Presidential Debates is hosting a series of four debates between the presidential candidates and their running mates between September 26 and October 15 .
MySpace and the Commission on Presidential Debates on Wednesday unveiled a new site called
MyDebates.org .
In addition to an online quiz , it will stream the debates online , and poll site users about which candidate they support .
MySpace is soliciting questions online , some of which may be posed by NBC's Tom Brokaw during the second town hall - style debate in Nashville , Tennessee on October 7 .
" The CPD believes that the internet can be used to personalize the debates in a way that allows for in - depth examination by individual citizens and joint discussion with others , " said the commission 's executive director in a statement .
However , Open Debate 's Farah says the commission 's use of the internet in this case is a sham .
A document obtained by the group labeled " Memorandum of Understanding "
concerning the debates between John Kerry and President Bush and their vice presidents in 2004 spell out the conditions under which the debates were to be held .
It specified everything from the color of the backdrops , to the heights of the podiums , to who will and wo n't get to speak .
One section of the document outlining the details of how a town hall event that year would unfold stated : " The commission shall take appropriate steps to cut off the microphone of any such audience member that attempts to pose any question or statement different than that previously posed to the moderator for review . "
" If you allowed voters in the process and gave them control , they might come up with a particularly challenging and unexpected question that may throw the candidate off their script , and that is something that is unlikely to happen , " Farah said .
He wants the Commission on Presidential Debates replaced with a group run by citizens and public interest groups .
The CPD is co-chaired by the former chiefs of the Democratic and Republican national committees .
Open Debates issued a statement Thursday with nine other groups , including the Personal Democracy
Forum , that asks the commission to make the terms of its contracts with the candidates publicly available .
Farah says the contract lays out most of the details of how the debates will be conducted .
Asked about the " secret debate contract negotiated by the Obama and McCain campaigns , " that the 10 pro-democracy groups asked to be made public , Scott Warner , a spokesman for the commission , says that it does n't exist , and never has .
He did n't return an e-mail about the 2004 document .
Both Obama and McCain participated in MTV and MySpace 's Presidential Dialogues series during the primary season , and did well by most accounts .
And both answer questions and appear before audiences of all sizes on the campaign trail .
But Farah argues that the televised debates are different because they may be the only opportunity for many Americans to really compare the candidates before they head into the voting booth .
" I have great respect for MySpace , and what they ’ve done with the Impact Channel , but what 's going on here is an attempt to sprinkle a little fairy dust on a crusty old
( format , ) " says TechPresident 's Sifry .
To be sure , the interactive debate format has its naysayers .
" I do n't know that the questions would be any more valuable coming from a crowd – I do n't think the whole crowdsourcing of questions has been done very well yet , " says Jon Henke , a new media consultant in Arlington , Virginia .
" The debates are just one more act to me , in a stage play . "
Lee Brenner , MySpace 's executive producer of political programming , and director of the Impact Channel , says that the commission decided on the format of the debates before MySpace got involved .
" It 's an evolving process , " he says .
" The commission is definitely taking a step in the right direction as we tried to take the best quality approach while keeping the integrity of the debates intact . "

More people had measles infections in the first seven months of this year than during any comparable period since 1996 , and public health officials blamed growing numbers of parents who refuse to vaccinate their children .
Many of these parents say they believe vaccines cause autism , even though multiple studies have found no reputable evidence to support such a claim .
In Britain , Switzerland , Israel and Italy , measles outbreaks have soared , sickening thousands and causing at least two deaths .
From January through July , 131 measles cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 15 states and the District of Columbia .
Fifteen people , including four infants , were hospitalized .
There were no deaths .
Nearly all the cases resulted when people traveling abroad or visiting from a foreign country spread the illness to others .
In Illinois , 30 people were sickened in one outbreak .
Most of those who were sickened were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status .
Sixteen were younger than a year old , too young to have been vaccinated .
But two - thirds of the rest  or 63 people  were unvaccinated because of their or their parents ’ philosophical or religious beliefs .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As angry voters spark a barrage of energy bills in Congress , the oil industry is spending record amounts of money protecting its interests .
In what may be surprising to some , the most recent figures from the Center for Responsive Politics show that the oil industry gives a relatively small sum to individual political campaigns - it 's 16th on a list of top 50 industries .
But when it comes to lobbying - and spending money that goes toward researching , writing and convincing lawmakers to vote its way - the industry ranks fifth .
If the spending continues at the current pace , the industry is set to break last year 's $ 83 million record .
The amount spent on lobbying by the industry , along with lobbying money in general , has been setting records since 2005 .
With record gas prices , a contentious fight over energy legislation and a huge election on the horizon it's not surprising the industry spent so much on lobbying this year .
Dozens of bills have been introduced in Congress .
Generally , Democrats and environmentalists have favored a strategy heavy on taxing oil companies and funding renewables , while Republicans and the oil industry have pushed for more drilling .
But so far , no major energy bills have been passed .
Is it possible all this money has been spent to maintain the status quo ?
" In the minds of most people , you rarely spend money to get nothing done , " said Massie Ritsch , communications director for CRP .
" But in government , people often spend vast sums of money to make sure nothing happens at all . "
It 's unlikely big money is the only reason Congress has n't acted on energy legislation .
The two parties are deeply divided over how to best solve the nation 's energy challenge .
And they both want to use gas prices as an election issue .
The Republicans are hoping voters will punish Democrats for opposing offshore drilling , while the Democrats hope to paint the Republicans as the party of Big Oil .
" You put the dysfunctionality and the sharp partisan issues together , and the failure to get a bill is easy to describe , " said Norman Ornstein , a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute .
" Still , you should n't ignore the money . "
The oil industry says it has spent heavily on lobbying this year because it has been the target of so many bills .
" If the menu goes up , our activity goes up , " said Judy Penniman , a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute .
" But to say nothing 's happened because of this money , I do n't agree with that . "
The oil industry may have not gotten its drilling wish list just yet , but so far they have been able to avoid higher taxes .
Meanwhile , the renewable energy folks have n't seen a big increase in funding .
Looking at the dollars spent lobbying Congress , that may not be surprising .
The renewable industry and their allies in the environmental movement have spent a combined $ 19 million lobbying Congress this year - half what the oil industry has spent .
Direct payments
Direct contributions to a political campaign , as opposed to lobbying , cannot be made by corporations - they must come from individuals .
It 's here where employees of the oil industry rank a mere 16th , giving $ 11 million in the 2007 - 2008 election cycle .
That 's well behind other industries like retirement and education - industries that might not first come to mind when one thinks big political money .
But that does n't necessarily mean the oil industry does n't exercise influence over politicians .
The sheer size of the industry - six of the 10 biggest companies in the world are oil firms - means a refinery or chemical plant sited in a politician 's district can mean lots of jobs and lots of tax revenue , said Larry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia .
" Maybe they know who their friends are , and they have other means of influencing them , " said Sabato .
If cash equals friendship , then John McCain and the oil industry are best friends .
The Arizona Republican has taken $ 1.4 million from oil industry employees in the 2007 - 2008 election cycle , more than any other politician , according to CRP .
That 's over three times as much as Barack Obama , who ranks just below Hillary Clinton as the highest Democrat recipient .
Those numbers are consistent with how employees in the oil sector give overall - nearly three quarters of their money usually goes to Republicans , although they have been leaning a bit more Democratic in the recent election , according to CRP .
With gas prices near record levels and the public clamoring for something to be done , now is a dangerous time for any politician to be taking money from the oil industry .
Politicians have already lost primaries after being labeled as in the pocket of Big Oil , according to Sabato .
But Sabato does think that as the debate over energy wears on , Big Oil is being seen less as the villain .
" Just blaming Big Oil does n't work anymore , " he said .
" People have absorbed the fact that it's a real crisis , and it will take complicated solutions to solve . "
Obama best hope that 's the case .
Although McCain is well ahead of him in total oil money raised , employees at some of the biggest firms seem to favor the junior senator from Illinois .
Employees of Exxon Mobil , Chevron and BP all gave more money to Obama than they did McCain .
Explaining why is somewhat of a mystery .
Maybe these bigger firms have more middle - level managers who like Obama 's plans on health care or the economy , said Sabato .
Or maybe they just like him because he 's a young guy on the up and up .
" They invest in people , and they like to invest in people that will be around forever , " said Sabato .
For ten months Bay Area News Group ( BANG ) executives threatened journalists with pay freezes and cuts in benefits if they organized a unit for collective bargaining on pay , benefits and work conditions .
Despite an anti-union campaign by management , non-supervisory news workers voted in June to form a unit of the Northern California Media Workers Guild Less than one month later , at least 20 journalists who had been visibly supportive of organizing a union were summarily terminated .
Last week the Guild filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board , calling the firings retaliatory and citing other anti-union actions against the newly formed unit .
The 230 - member Bay Area News Group East Bay ( BANG - EB ) bargaining unit includes the Oakland Tribune and other East Bay papers , as well as the San Mateo County Times on the peninsula .
Among those terminated was Sara Steffens , newly elected chair of the unit and one of the main Guild organizers .
" I think they wanted me out of the newsroom , " Steffans said .
" They wanted to keep me from continuing to engage co-workers as we push for our first contract and they hoped this would send a message to scare people away from further union activity .
But they made a big mistake -- so far it's only made our newsroom understand why it 's important to have a contract to protect us . "

Ohio elections officials preparing for 80 % turnout in November Nick Juliano
Published : Monday August 25 , 2008
Print This Email This ' We will get sued on Nov. 4 , ' county official predicts DENVER --
As many as 80 percent of Ohio 's registered voters could turn out on Election Day , says the state 's top election official .
" Looking at the interest in this election , we think it 's highly probable , " Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said during a panel discussion on election reforms .
Brunner addressed controversy in the state over use of electronic voting machines in the past .
While she was unwilling to force counties to completely abandon DRE machines , she said all voters would have the option to vote on a paper ballot and officials were implementing more stringent security procedures in the 53 counties that still used electronic machines .
Brunner said she could not fund the switch from electronic voting in those counties and did not want to implement an unfunded mandate on areas of the already economically struggling state .
Cuyahoga County , which includes
Ohio 's largest city , Cleveland , stopped using Diebold machines this year , before the state 's March primary .
It was a move Brunner put in motion after she broke a tie vote on the county 's board of elections .
" I do think the paper ballot system proved to us to be a much better system for Cuyahoga County , " said Jane Platten , director of Cuyahoga County 's board .
Cuyahoga County was subject to a lawsuit filed just before polls closed during the March 4 primary and precincts there were forced to stay open to account for long lines of voters .
Platten said she hopes paper ballots will allow poll workers to accommodate more voters , but said she expected there would still be long lines and legal challenges .
" We will get sued on Nov. 4 , 2008 , " she said .
" I got into the election assuming that . "
The two spoke during separate panels at a discussion in Denver sponsored by the Pew Center on the States and electionline.org .
Elections officials in counties still using electronic machines would be required to have a number of backup paper ballots equivalent to 25 percent of their turnout in the 2004 election , Brunner said .
Ohio also is allowing voters to cast mail - in absentee ballots for any reason and will count those ballots up to 10 days after Election Day as long as they are placed in the mail by Nov. 4 .
Brunner , a Democrat elected in 2006 , criticized her predecessor , Ken Blackwell , for " breaking all of the unwritten rules " by serving as the state chairman of the Bush / Cheney campaign in 2004 and by actively campaigning for a statewide ballot measure to ban gay marriage that same year .
After Ohio's 2004 vote was plagued by long lines , especially in minority areas that were allocated few voting machines , Bunner said she aimed to increase transparency and better allocate the machines this time around .
There may be a very good reason why coffee and cigarettes often seem to go hand in hand .
A Kansas State University psychology professor 's research suggests that nicotine 's power may be in how it enhances other experiences .
For a smoker who enjoys drinking coffee , the nicotine may make a cup of joe even better .
And that may explain why smoking is so hard to quit .
" People have very regimented things they do when they smoke , " said Matthew Palmatier , assistant professor of psychology at K - State .
" If you think about where people smoke or who they smoke with , you realize that it occurs in very specific places , often with a specific group of people .
Maybe it 's a reason why nicotine is so addictive — if you get used to having that extra satisfaction from things you normally enjoy , not having nicotine could reduce the enjoyment in a given activity .
" People may not be smoking to obtain a pleasurable drug state .
They may be smoking in order to regulate their mood , and that effect could make nicotine more addictive than other drugs . "
Palmatier said much previous research on nicotine addiction has looked at the drug itself rather than the other factors he is studying .
" The approach we 're taking is out of left field , " he said .
" But it seems to be one of the best explanations as to why people smoke . "
Palmatier has a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to understand how this phenomenon can be used to better design tobacco addiction treatments , usually offered in patches and pills .
He began psychological research in addiction as a graduate student and later began researching the reinforcing effects of nicotine .
" The big picture is trying to figure out why people smoke , " Palmatier said .
" There are a lot of health risks , and the majority of smokers already know what they are .
They want to quit but can't .
It 's not because nicotine is a potent drug ; it does n't induce significant amounts of pleasure or euphoria .
Yet , it 's just as difficult if not more difficult to quit than other drugs . "
At K - State , Palmatier studies rats that are allowed to self - administer nicotine by pushing a lever .
The main source of light in their testing environment shuts off when the rats earn a dose of nicotine .
After about a minute , the light comes back on to signal that more nicotine is available .
By manipulating this signal , Palmatier and his colleagues found that the rats were n't really that interested in nicotine by itself .
" We figured out that what the rats really liked was turning the light off , " Palmatier said .
" They still self - administered the nicotine , but they took more of the drug when it was associated with a reinforcing light . "
Palmatier and colleagues published a paper on their research in the August issue of Neuropsychopharmacology .
Palmatier has begun looking at how rats respond to sweet tastes after having nicotine .
He said preliminary results show that nicotine has comparable effects on sweet tastes .
That is , rats respond more for sugar - water solutions after getting nicotine .
" The taste aspect is really important because we can actually figure out how nicotine is increasing the subjects ' behavior , " Palmatier said .
" If it makes a reward more pleasurable , then it may increase the palatability of a sweet taste . "
Palmatier said that a future phase of research would be determining whether nicotine can make unpleasant experiences more tolerable , helping explain why lighting up after a bad day at work can be tempting .

Insalata caprese , an Italian classic , becomes an instant halloween classic as well .
The traditional ingredients for this delicate salad are fresh mozzarella , basil , plum tomatoes and olive oil , seasoned with salt and pepper .
Our version goes only slightly further , adding a thin slice of olive as the garnish .
And , a clever trick produces perfectly round pupils every time .
Taking a step back , let us note that this is n’t a new sport .
Gory , shocking , and other “ gross - out ” foods – body parts in particular– are already a standard of Halloween party fare .
We have even seen mozzarella eyes in a few different forms , like this fine example by our friend Dot at Dabbled .
If you like this sort of thing , you ’ll probably also like one of our favorite cookbooks , The Secret Life of Food , by Clare Crespo .
Let ’s get started by looking at a couple of the crucial ingredients :
For our irises we found these marvelous Castelvetrano olives at a local deli .
These are an Italian specialty – delicate , mild , and buttery – and they happen to have incredibly bright green skin .
You can of course use other types of green olives , but they probably wo n’t look quite as alive .
Also from the deli , we picked up these little balls of fresh mozzarella .
The ones shown here are oblong but that ’s not important– spherical will work just as well .
( You need “ real ” mozzarella– ideally mozzarella di bufala .
If all you can find is a correspondingly named low - moisture part - skim cheese product , that ’s not actually a good substitute . )
Now , go find your paring knife .
Cut a thin , clean , round slice from the tip or side of one of the olives .
This is a shallow cut , so it does n’t matter if the olive has a pit or not , but do try to make a nearly - circular slice .
And now to cut a perfectly round pupil .
Use the end of a plastic drinking straw to cut a hole through the center of your olive disk .
To do this , push down on the straw with a slight twisting motion .
It will slice out a neat cylindrical core , which you may need to remove with a toothpick or similar instrument .
For the pupil we use a small disk of black olive .
( We used pitted black olives .
Feel free to substitute higher - grade dark olives , but this is a small enough application that you can get away with it . )
Here is the “ clever ” part :
Use the same straw to poke a hole in a black olive to get a little plug of material that will exactly fit in the pupil hole of your green olive disk .
Depending on your relative olive thickness , you may need to trim the back of the black plug as necessary .
Stick your olive irises to your mozzarella balls .
Assuming that the surfaces are wet , they should stay in place by themselves .
If your cheese is particularly curvy , you might find it helpful to cut a small flat surface for them to attach to .
Serve your eyeballs– soon and neatly stacked – with tomatoes , basil , and olive oil .
This project is included in the food category in our Halloween Project Archive where you can find more ideas and recipes .
Harpers Magazine

The following from democraticunderground.com ] :
( A subscription is required for access to this piece ; however , I found this excerpt from Ann Calhoun ’s blog . )
As the Fannie Maes sink in the west , and the banks close , and the taxpayer gets stuck again bailing out more failed institutions and stock market manipulations , time to contemplate a recent essay in the latest Harpers , an excerpt from his forthcoming book : “ The Wrecking Crew , How a gang of right - wing con men destroyed Washington and made a killing , ” by Thomas Frank .
Frank , as you recall , wrote “ What ’s the Matter with Kansas . ” 
Well , what ’s the matter with Kansas is now , what ’s the matter with America .
Yes , it ’s old Reagan , Abramoff , Norquist , Reed .
Rove , Bush & Co , and all the associated neocon free - marketer , privatize - it - all , We Do n’t Need No Stinkin ’ Government Regulation Gang .
As Frank concludes , “ Take a step back , reader , and see what they have wrought . ” 
An excerpt :
“ Fantastic mis-government is not an accident , nor is it the work of a few bad individuals .
It is the consequence of triumph by a particular philosophy of government , by a movement that understands the liberal state as a perversions and considers the market the ideal nexus of human society .
This movement is friendly to industry not just by force of campaign contributions but by conviction ; it believes in entrepeneurship not merely in commerce but in politics , and the inevitable results of the ascendance are , first , the capture of the state by business and , second , what follows from that : incompetence , graft , and all the other wretched flotsam that we ’ve come to expect from Washington .
The correct diagnosis is the “ bad apple ”  thesis turned upside down .
There are plenty of good conservative individuals , honorable folks who would never participate in the sort of corruption we have watched unfold for the past few years .
Hang around with grassroots conservative voters in Kansas , and in the main you will find them to be honest , hardworking people .
But put conservatism in charge of the state , and it behaves very differently .
Now the “ values ”  that rightist politicians eulogize on the stump disappear , and in their place we can discern an entirely different set of priorities “ “ priorities that reveal more about the unchanging historical essence of American conservatism than do its fleeting campaigns against gay marriage or secular humanism .
The conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in Washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school .
Its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy - fairy nonsense ; they caution against bringing top - notch talent into government service ; they declare war on public workers .
They have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing , they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them , and they have deliberately pile up an Everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis .
The ruination they have wrought has been thorough ; it has been a professional job .
Repairing it will require years of political action . ” 
Read it and weep .
Behold the endgame of the 30 - year corrosive war on America , by the dogmatists of conservative ideology .
There ’s really nothing left to say ..
… Except that now , it is time to take action for its permanent eradication .

( CNN ) --
You 've heard of hybrids , electric cars and vehicles that can run on vegetable oil .
But of all the contenders in the quest to produce the ultimate fuel - efficient car , this could be the first one to let you say , " fill it up with air . "
The compressed air car planned for the U.S. market would be a six - seater , a New York company says .
That 's the idea behind the compressed air car , which backers say could achieve a fuel economy of 106 miles per gallon .
Plenty of skepticism exists , but with many Americans trying to escape sticker shock at the gas pump , the concept is generating buzz .
The technology has been the focus of MDI , a European company founded in 1991 by a French inventor and former race car engineer .
New York - based Zero Pollution Motors is the first firm to obtain a license from MDI to produce the cars in the United States , pledging to deliver the first models in 2010 at a price tag of less than $ 18,000 .
The concept is similar to how a locomotive works , except compressed air -- not steam -- moves the engine 's pistons , said Shiva Vencat , vice president of MDI and CEO of Zero Pollution Motors .
Gas still plays a role
The six - seater planned for the U.S. market would be able to reach speeds of more than 90 mph and have a range of more than 800 miles thanks to a dual energy engine , Vencat said .
Watch what a prototype looks like and why the cars may take off in cities »
The design calls for one or more tanks of compressed air under the car 's floor , as well as a tank holding at least 8 gallons of fuel .
Whether the engine uses just air or both air and fuel would depend on how fast the car is going .
It would run purely on compressed air at speeds less than 35 mph , Vencat said .
Since the car could only go a short distance when using just air , fuel is needed to get the full range , he explained .
" Above 35 mph , there is an external combustion system , which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air , " Vencat said .
" Heating the air increases its volume , and by increasing its volume , it increases [ the car 's ] range .
That 's why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg . "
See what the engine looks like »
Vencat said an on - board compressor would refill the air tank while the car is running , or owners could refill it by plugging it into a power outlet for four hours .
Is it for real ?
Experts are n't sure Americans will be zipping around in air cars and getting 106 mpg , or more than twice the fuel economy of hybrid- electric vehicles such as the Toyota Prius .
It is possible to power a car with compressed air , but the mileage claim is " at the edge of possibility , " said John Callister , director of the Harvey Kinzelberg Entrepreneurship in Engineering program at Cornell University 's College of Engineering .
He noted that such dramatic fuel efficiency is associated with tiny experimental cars , not bigger mainstream ones .
Who would build it ?
 Production would be similar to a franchise business
 The cars would be manufactured by privately owned plants that could produce at least 4,000 vehicles a year
 The cost of a license to build the car in an " exclusive geographical area " in the United States is about $ 460,000
 Geographical areas are defined by 110,000 new vehicle registrations .
For example , Georgia could have four plants at most , but there could be 15 in California
 The cost of a plant is $ 20 million
 The first plant is scheduled to be built in New York in 2010

" No one 's really proven a six - seater passenger car [ can get ] any better than 75 miles to the gallon .
So this would represent a big step forward , " Callister said .
" They would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the Prius . "
Another expert expressed concern about the amount of energy it would take to generate the required air pressure : 4,500 pounds per square inch , or more than 120 times the pressure inside the tires of a typical four - door sedan .
" That is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting , " said William Bulpitt , senior research engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology 's Strategic Energy Institute .
" That takes quite a compressor to do .
...
It takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure . "
If you count that energy , it 's hard to believe the car would be that much more efficient than an electric vehicle , Callister said .
India shows interest
The compressed air car will get a chance to prove itself next year when it competes for the Automotive X Prize .
The multimillion - dollar award will go to the team that " can win a stage race for clean , production - capable vehicles that exceed 100 mpg equivalent fuel economy , " according to the X Prize Foundation .
The air - car concept has also drawn the interest of Tata Motors , India 's largest automaker .
The company announced an agreement with MDI last year to further develop and refine the technology .
However , the cars have yet to hit the streets in India or anywhere else .
" The project is under progress .
We do not yet have any timeframe for launch , " said Debasis Ray , the head of corporate communications for Tata Motors .
Only prototypes exist at this point , Vencat said .
Light design
The body of the car planned for the United States would be built with fiberglass and injected foam .
The chassis , composed of aluminum rods , would be glued together , not welded .
The design allows the car to be as light as possible , Vencat said .
For anyone who has doubts about its safety , he insisted computer simulations show that the vehicle would pass crash tests and meet all U.S. safety standards .
" Do you think somebody would actually put millions of dollars into making a car that will not pass safety regulations ?
There 's no point in doing that , " Vencat said .
Callister pointed out that there have n't been any lightweight , 100 - plus mpg cars to pass crash tests but said it could be done through a " very clever design " of a lightweight frame .
A good prototype could dispel many of the doubts about the compressed air car , he added .
" I do n't think we should discount this advance if it happens , " Callister said .

Anthrax suspect ’s colleague ‘ really , really ’ doubts his guilt
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
In the wake of the apparent suicide of government scientist Bruce Ivins , the FBI is preparing to declare the anthrax case closed , even though , as the New York Times reports , the evidence against Ivins was largely circumstantial .
Genetic analysis has identified a flash in Ivins ’ laboratory at Fort Detrick as the source of the anthrax used in the attack , and the envelopes used to mail the anthrax were purchased at a nearby post office .
However , the Times notes that at least ten people had access to the flash in question , and the FBI has never found evidence that Ivins was in New Jersey on the dates when the letters were mailed .
According to the Washington Post , “ Knowledgeable officials asserted that Ivins had the skills and access to equipment needed to turn anthrax bacteria into an ultra - fine powder that could be used as a lethal weapon .
Court documents and tapes also reveal a therapist ’s deep concern that Ivins , 62 , was homicidal and obsessed with the notion of revenge . ”
However , colleagues of Ivins told the Post that Fort Detrick was not equipped to create weaponized anthrax , with one explaining , “ USAMRIID does n’t deal with powdered anthrax . …
I do n’t think there ’s anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it .
You would need to have the opportunity , the capability and the motivation , and he did n’t possess any of those . ”
Anthrax expert Dr. Meryl Nass has also cast doubt on whether Ivins had either the expertise needed to produce weaponized anthrax or access to a large enough supply of spores for the volume of anthrax used in the attacks .
The claim that Ivins was homicidal has come from just one source , social worker Jean Carol Duley , who alleges that he “ has actually attempted to murder several other people .
…
He is a revenge killer . ”
No one else has yet come forward to back Duley up , and her own credibility is now under attack , with both RAW STORY ’s Larisa Alexandrovna and Salon ’s Glenn Greenwald pointing out that Duley only received her degree in social work a year ago and has a history of DUI and other convictions .
NBC News reports that Ivins was well - liked in the community of Frederick , MD , where Fort Detrick is located .
He played in a church band and volunteered at the local Red Cross .
Neighbors told NBC they trusted Ivins and considered him “ really safe . ”
NBC ’s Meredith Vieira spoke to Dr. Russell Byrne , who had been both a colleague and a friend of Ivins for 15 years .
Sounding distraught , Byrne said he was “ still trying to process a lot of information .
It ’s come in really quickly .
A lot of it is just consternation at the ridiculous motives they ’re attributing . ”
The other motive that has been suggested for why Ivins might have mailed out anthrax is that he could have been hoping to profit from his participation in work at Fort Detrick on an anthrax vaccine .
However , Byrne found that unlikely , explaining that the government owns the patent on the vaccine and that Ivins himself was only one of several researchers , so there could have been no more than “ small monetary incentives . ”
Byrne further found it unlikely that Ivins would have been able to transform the anthrax spores into a powdered form at the laboratory without him knowing .
“ I was the division chief , and I did n’t know that anybody did that , ” he stated .
“ All of the challenges that we did with animals were with wet spores . …
The dry spores I was n’t aware of . ”
Byrne said he had n’t recently been working in the same lab as Ivins , but people who were told him him that “ changes really began to accelerate in the last year .
…
He would sit at his desk weeping .
He really could n’t do his work any more because the pressure was tremendous . ”
Byrne has told the press he believes Ivins was hounded by the FBI , and Ivins ’ lawyer has blamed FBI harassment for Ivins ’ suicide .
“ I think he committed suicide when he was walked out of the building , escorted by law enforcement officials , ” Byrne told Vieira .
“ That meant the end of his career . ”
Ivins was sent for psychiatric evaluation on July 10 , because of his “ deteriorating emotional condition , ” and was barred from returning to the base .
Until then , he had maintain his full security clearance and continued to take part in sensitive research and discussions .
Byrne concluded , in reference to Duley ’s allegations , “ It ’s possible that somebody could hide that [ violent side ] from all of your co-workers and nobody would ever hear about it , but I really , really doubt it . ”

It would seem to me that we should dispatch the secretary of state immediately to do two things .
First of all , we need to train and equip the Kurds to fight the terrorists in their midst .
The PKK is a terrorist organization .
Those 3,500 terrorists can best be dealt with by trained and armed Kurds .
We do n't have to put our military in harm 's way .
The Kurds have the capacity to do it against those in the PKK -- but also to try to get Turkey to realize that there 's nothing to be gained by crossing into that border and creating yet another hostile situation .
None of us need it .
None of us want it .
And I would hope that maybe the base in Irbil that was shut down earlier could become the base in which those operations could be staged .

CAMERON : Mr. Paul ?
PAUL : This is a -- this is a result of a foreign policy of interventionism .
The founders advised non-interventionism .
And even our president won the election in the year 2000 to have a more humble foreign policy , not to go into nation - building , and not get involved in the internal affairs of other nations .
And we won an election on that .
But here we are .
We 're over there and we 've invaded this country and this is just another unintended consequence .
The war is spreading , the war is likely to go into Iran , nobody 's willing to take anything off the table .
What would it be like if somebody came in here into Mexico and did some of these things -- say , like , putting missiles in Europe ?
We 're just looking for trouble .
It 's so unnecessary .
And we jeopardize ourselves .
And , quite frankly , we 're not able to afford this .
So we do n't need to go looking for trouble .
We do n't need another Cold War .
And all we have to do is start talking to people and trading with people .

August 1st , 2008 : What Summer 's All About
I took my son to the library to choose his prize ( a book ) for completing the library 's summer reading program .
I took him from the pool and returned him to the pool .
We were in the library 10 minutes .
Would have been 5 , if fewer people had stopped me and told me how cool it was to see a kid who so clearly loved the pool and / or was Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes .
They enjoyed him so much , I thought you might too ....
Cuuute!lol !
Aw yes , animal Friday !
( better hold the recipes )
I hope he does n't ride his wagon down hills , off cliffs ...
That is an absolutely amazing capture .
The expression , the hair , the fact that he was willing to hold still in such a pose ... it 's all perfect !
Thanks for sharing !
Ritalin ?
LOL !!!
That is one expressive kid .
You could serve me a bucket of KFC with Matt Damon in the middle and I could n't get that excited look on my face .
Very cool .
Why is his hair not blue ?
Just have to smile right back with a photo like that !
Why is his head not shaved ?!
Lovely pic Monster .
Crazy kid .
Thanks for sharing .
Awesome monster !
I 'll be smiling all day !
Great picture , monster .
Made my morning .
The pictures you show of your family look like y'all are always having so much fun !
( Donnie , is that YOU ? )
.. just throwing that out there ..
He is cute ... but I 'm afraid I could n't help being reminded of these ...
He 's going to grow up to be one handsome fellow .
Here mom ... you want a photo ... take this !
hehe

McCain may be trying to distance himself from Bush , but his VP pick tells a different story .
Palin pick means McCain is like Bush
As the political class prattles on about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , we are overlooking the most important aspect of her selection as the GOP running mate : what it says about John McCain .
And what it says is , he ’s just like George W. Bush .
Advertisement
In choosing Palin , McCain was in full Bush mode .
Like Bush , he followed his gut , ignored advice from experts and acted on impulse .
In fact , McCain ’s rash and reckless choice of Palin makes Bush look downright careful by comparison — so McCain may well be more Bushian than Bush himself .
If you liked eight years of a president who went with his gut , acted on impulse and gambled our nation ’s future on a hunch , you ’ll love John McCain .
Let ’s take a test .
Who does the following describe : A wealthy and hot - tempered rebel , he spent half his life fighting to live up to a famous father and grandfather , encouraged always by an indomitable mother .
A self - described moderate on the campaign trail , he courts ultra - right - wing preachers behind the scenes and promises to appoint stridently conservative judges .
A multimillionaire who supports more tax cuts for more millionaires , he surrounds himself with supply - siders and calls for policies that would drive us deeper into debt .
The chief cheerleader for the war in Iraq , he said we ’d be “ welcomed as liberators ” and angrily challenges anyone who questions his distorted and out - of - touch view of reality .
A self - styled reformer , his Kitchen Cabinet is stocked with Washington lobbyists .
Deeply out of touch on economic issues , he repeats nostrums like “ the fundamentals are strong ” even as the fundamentals are deteriorating .
He carefully courts the press , who suck up to him even though he supports authoritarian policies like wiretapping Americans without a court order .
He is supported by oil company lobbyists and supports drilling in some of our most sensitive ecosystems .
Although he gladly accepts government health care for himself , he would abandon you to take on colossal insurance corporations on your own .
Charming and disarming at first blush , his wit masks a petulant temper and a self - righteous streak that even members of his own party worry about .
If you guessed George W. Bush , you ’re right .
And if you guessed John McCain , you ’re also right .
Aided by a team of a dozen researchers and writers , I spent months going through McCain ’s record .
In ways both large and small , frightening and funny , on matters of both style and substance , and on issues of policy and politics , McCain represents a continuation of the Bush years .
His defenders — and they are legion in the national press corps he accurately calls his “ base ” — will howl , but a clear - eyed reading of the record makes a compelling case that on nearly all of the things that matter most , John McCain would be more of the same .
The war hero part of McCain ’s biography is indeed real .
But the notion that he is a maverick and the argument that he ’s a reformer are myth .
McCain has in fact voted with President Bush 91 percent of the time , and yet otherwise sensible people call him a maverick .
Sports fans , being less gullible than politicos , would never call a baseball player who hit from the right side of the plate 91 percent of the time a lefty .
Yes , there have been brief apostasies ( apparently 9 percent of the time ) , but even when he has broken with Bush , over time he has recanted his heresy and fallen back in , as he has done on taxes .
McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts in 2001 , but now he proposes making the Bush tax cuts permanent .
That ’s like marrying a girl you would n’t date .
And , like Bush , McCain has a remarkable affinity for lobbyists .
His campaign has , by my count , 134 lobbyists serving as bundlers or advisers or staff members .
He has chosen to associate himself with people who have lobbied for foreign dictators , big oil companies and every corporate special interest you can think of .
And yet he gets away with calling himself a reformer .
Now , 134 lobbyists are not lining up to support McCain because they actually believe he ’s a reformer .
If John McCain ’s a reformer , I ’m a Hassidic diamond merchant .
If Barack Obama can get every voter to learn just two numbers , he will be president .
Those numbers are 91 and 134 .
If by Election Day every American knows McCain votes with Bush 91 percent of the time and has 134 lobbyists in his campaign , then the myth of the maverick reformer will be dead .
And with it , McCain ’s chances of following his unlikely soul mate as president .
Paul Begala is a political contributor to CNN .
He served as counselor to the president in the Clinton White House .

Flat - earthers are people who believe , here in the 21st century , that the Earth is flat .
( Believers in a round earth are called globularists . )
And what about the fact that no one has ever fallen off the edge of our supposedly disc - shaped world ?
Mr McIntyre laughs .
“ This is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions , ” he says .
“ A cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason — the North Pole is central , and Antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the Earth .
Circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the Earth . ”
If , like me , you have questions about how the Earth could possibly be flat , some of them are answered in the Flat Earth FAQ .
Q : “ What about the stars , sun and moon and other planets ?
Are they flat too ?
What are they made of ? ” A : The sun and moon , each 32 miles in diameter , circle Earth at a height of 3000 miles at its equator , located midway between the North Pole and the ice wall .
Each functions similar to a “ spotlight , ” with the sun radiating “ hot light , ” the moon “ cold light . ”
As they are spotlights , they only give light out over a certain are which explains why some parts of the Earth are dark when others are light .
Their apparent rising and setting are caused by optical illusions .
In the “ accelerating upwards ” model , the stars , sun and moon are also accelerating upwards .
The stars are about as far as San Francisco is from Boston .
( 3100 miles )
BTW , the “ ice wall ” is what separates the edge of the earth ’s disc with outer space or whatever ether or monsters are beyond the earth .
We know the wall as Antarctica .
I call shenanigans on all this …it ’s gotta be a hoax .
Nobody ’s this ignorant , right ?
Please ?

About Me
Cepheid Variables : A Galactic Internet ?
Making contact with an extraterrestrial civilization , whether by microwave , laser or neutrino , highlights the problem of time .
Suppose you are looking for a newly emerging technological culture around another star .
When do you transmit ?
After all , even the most powerful signal sent to Earth a million years ago would have no listeners , which is why some have suggested putting actual artifacts in promising solar systems .
Rather than transmitting over time - scales measured in eons , you leave an object that can be decoded and activated for communications .
All kinds of interesting science and science fictional scenarios flow from that idea .
But what if you want to contact not just a few highly targeted systems , but instead send a signal intended for everyone in the galaxy with the means to receive it ?
As John Learned ( University of Hawaii ) and team speculate in a new paper , one way to do that would be to select highly visible and important stars to carry your message .
Cepheid variables are a natural fit .
Because of the clear relation they show between luminosity and variability , they ’ve helped us figure out distances on a galactic scale , and have been crucial in our studies of the Hubble constant .
As well as being important to science , they ’re bright and easily observed , like the ‘ water - hole frequencies ’ an obvious place to search for signals .
Image :
This NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of a region of the galaxy M100 shows a class of pulsating star called a Cepheid Variable .
Though rare , these stars are reliable distance indicators to galaxies .
Could they also be put to work as galactic communications beacons ?

Exactly how might a super - civilization modulate an entire star ?
The authors speculate about using neutrinos for the purpose :
Neutrinos would seem to be the ideal delivery means for transporting a pulse of energy to the stellar core , both due to penetration ability and to speed .
If one wanted to employ infalling material as the trigger , this disturbance would propagate at near the local speed of sound , and might well evaporate prior to reaching the core in any event .
Neutrinos of about 1 TeV would have an attenuation length of about 106 km at solar densities .
We have not modeled Cepheids in order to determine the optimum neutrino energy , but it is irrelevant for the present discussion : we leave it as an engineering problem for the star tickling civilizations out there .
The initial ﬂavor mix of the neutrino beam makes little difference since oscillations will mix the ﬂavors and in any event the cross-sections are ﬂavor independent .
The Star Ticklers — it sounds like a 1950 ’s title , maybe from one of the Ace science fiction double paperbacks .
And it ’s a curiously provocative concept .
Deeply interesting here is the supposition that , if a modulated signal were being broadcast through the use of Cepheid variables , we might already have evidence for it in the abundant data collected about these stars .
Normally , Cepheids are studied through a small number of randomly spaced observations conducted over a long period of time .
The authors run through the methods of data collection and analysis , and point to places where those methods might actually mask the presence of an interesting signal .
And they suggest a way to pull a signal , assuming one is there , out of the noise .
This is also worth quoting :
Thereafter the conclusive ﬁnding of an ETI signal would come about by identiﬁcation of regularities which are hard to understand from any natural oscillator , such as involving repeated complex sequences , prime numbers , a limited “ alphabet ” ( e.g. something akin to the familiar ASCII code ) , or even an apparent raster - like arrangement .
At this point we cannot but fall back upon the supposition that we will recognize unnatural stellar ﬂuctuations when we see them .
In sum , we think the normal method of employing Fourier transforms ( with windowing , gap ﬁlling , long term averaging , etc. ) and other methods in common use to analyze the periodicity of Cepheids may cloud the discovery of intentional modulation , and that cycle - by - cycle periods need to be examined .
The prospect that existing records of Cepheids and possibly other variables might contain the signature of a galactic internet is an exciting one indeed .
It ’s also interesting to look at the mechanism involved in generating the signal .
The neutrino trigger generator might consist of a power station perhaps 100 AU out , one that draws energy from the radiation of the Cepheid itself , accumulating it over the course of a complete cycle and then setting off the trigger pulse .
An unstable stellar system becomes the universe ’s biggest signal amplifier .
Anything that helps us with what the authors call the ‘ needle in a haystack ’ problem is all to the good .
We want to find ways to narrow the SETI search in productive directions .
Here Cepheids are useful because the entire galaxy contains only about 500 known examples .
Giant yellow stars massing between five and ten times the mass of the Sun , with 103 to 104 times solar luminosity , Cepheids would be not only visible but highly studied by any civilizations trying to learn about the cosmos .
That makes them a productive medium for the kind of culture that can muster the resources to impose a signal upon them .
The paper is Learned et al. , “ The Cepheid Galactic Internet ” ( abstract ) .

Today , outspoken Republican Mike Huckabee criticized the idea being pushed by some members of his own party that Mitt Romney should be John McCain ’s running mate .
Not because Romney is a Mormon , but because he is a flip - flopper .
“ I think a lot of people , not just social conservatives , but a lot of the Republicans I know are not necessarily comfortable with Romney .
But it has nothing to do with religion .
It has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions he ’s held , and that ’s it , ” Huckabee said to CBS News .
Evangelical leader Richard Land touted Romney last week , “ There are people in the evangelical community who would have a problem with his Mormonism .
I am not one of them .
I mean , I ’m very clear that I do not believe Mormonism is a Christian faith .
But that does not disqualify someone from being President or Vice President .
And my guess would be that , probably , about 15 to 20 percent of the evangelical community would have a problem with his Mormonism . ”
Advertisements
Before I discuss this , I want to make it perfectly clear , that I have no issue with Romney ’s faith , but I think that Land ’s estimate of evangelicals who have a problem with Romney is n’t even close to the truth .
If only 15 % - 20 % of evangelicals had a problem with Romney , he ’d be the nominee right now .
The reality is that many evangelicals believe that Mormonism is a cult , and I would guess that the number of evangelicals who have issues with Romney is closer to 60 % - 80 % .
However , Huck did hit the other problem with Romney right on the head .
Romney is the gold medal gymnast of flip flopping .
The other problem that evangelicals had with Romney is that is Johnny come lately to their positions .
They do n’t trust Romney , and they are already distrustful of McCain , but I can understand why McCain would select Romney .
Mitt brings money and Michigan into the campaign , but putting the two of them on the same ticket is a big risk .
Romney has his own baggage , and this is a boom or bust move .
Romney is n’t going to excite the GOP base , and may push the evangelical vote away .
McCain is counting on the support of Independents who already leaning towards Obama , but a selection of Romney could mean a mass defection of Independent support .
I think that there are better lesser known options like Rob Portman out there for McCain .
As someone who wants change , I hope McCain does pick Romney , because that ticket looks like a sure loser to me .
By huge margins , Americans think the economy is in lousy shape  and they blame President Bush .
This fact , more than anything else , makes it hard to see how the Democrats can lose this election .
But is the public right to be so disgusted with Mr. Bush ’s economic leadership ?
Not exactly .
We really do have a lousy economy , a fact of which Mr. Bush seems spectacularly unaware .
But that ’s not the same thing as saying that the bad economy is Mr. Bush ’s fault .
On the other hand , there ’s a certain rough justice in the public ’s attitude .
Other politicians besides Mr. Bush share the blame for the mess we ’re in  but most of them are Republicans .
First things first : pay no attention to apologists who try to defend the Bush economic record .
Since 2001 , economic conditions have alternated between so - so and outright bad : a recession , followed by one of the weakest expansions since World War II , and then by a renewed job slump that is n’t officially a recession yet , but certainly feels like one .
If you have ever had a hard drive fail on a remote server you may remember the feeling you had after trying to issue the following commands :
# reboot bash : / sbin/reboot : Input / output error # shutdown -r now bash : / sbin / shutdown : Input / output error
Obviously , there is a problem with your drive .
These commands are failing because the kernel is unable to load the / sbin / reboot and / sbin / shutdown binaries from the disk so that it can execute them .
A fsck on the next boot might be able to correct whatever is wrong with the disk , but first you need to get the system to reboot .
If your machine is located at a managed hosting provider then you could submit a reboot ticket , but you 'll have to wait for someone to take responsibility .
Would n't it be nice if there was a way to ask the kernel to reboot without needing to access the failing drive ?
Well , there is a way , and it is remarkably simple .
The " magic SysRq key " provides a way to send commands directly to the kernel through the / proc filesystem .
It is enabled via a kernel compile time option , CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ , which seems to be standard on most distributions .
First you must activate the magic SysRq option :
echo 1 > / proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
When you are ready to reboot the machine simply run the following :
echo b > / proc/sysrq-trigger
This does not attempt to unmount or sync filesystems , so it should only be used when absolutely necessary , but if your drive is already failing then that may not be a concern .
In addition to rebooting the system the sysrq trick can be used to dump memory information to the console , sync all filesystems , remount all filesystems in read - only mode , send SIGTERM or SIGKILL to all processes except init , or power off the machine entirely , among other things .
Also , instead of echoing into / proc / sys / kernel / sysrq each time you can activate the magic SysRq key at system boot time using sysctl , where supported :
echo " kernel.sysrq = 1 " >>
/etc/sysctl.conf
If you would like to learn more about magic SysRq you can read the sysrq.txt file in the kernel documentation .
This short NY Times profile of economist David Galenson reminded me that I never shared Old Masters and Young Geniuses with you .
The book was recommended to me by Malcolm Gladwell — which means that many of you can now form your opinion of it without even reading it — through a talk that he gave a couple of years ago .
Gladwell also wrote an article for the New Yorker about Galenson ’s work but it was rejected :
When Mr. Gladwell submitted an article about Mr. Galenson ’s ideas to The New Yorker , he suffered his first rejection from the magazine .
“ You buy this Galenson stuff ? ” Mr. Gladwell recalled his editor saying to him .
“ What are you , crazy ? ”
But never mind all that , Old Masters and Young Geniuses is one of the most interesting books I ’ve read in the past few years .
I have n’t studied enough art history to know if Galenson ’s thesis is correct , but the book presents an interesting framework for thinking about innovation and how to best harness your own creativity .
The main idea is this .
Instead of people being super creative when they ’re young and getting less so with age ( i.e. the conventional wisdom ) , Galenson says that artists fall into two general categories :
1 ) The conceptual innovators who peak creatively early in life .
They have firm ideas about what they want to accomplish and then do so , with certainty .
Pablo Picasso is the archetype here ; others include T.S. Eliot , F. Scott Fitzgerald , and Orson Wells .
Picasso said , “ I do n’t seek , I find . ”
2 ) The experimental innovators who peak later in life .
They create through the painstaking process of doing , making incremental improvements to their art until they ’re capable of real masterpiece .
Cezanne is Galenson ’s main example of an experimental innovator ; others include Frank Lloyd Wright , Mark Twain , and Jackson Pollock .
Cezanne remarked , “ I seek in painting . ”
Galenson demonstrates these differences through analysis of how often artists ’ works are reproduced in textbooks , auction prices , and museum shows .
The pattern is clear , although the method is less than precise in some cases and Galenson has since backed off his thesis somewhat .
But the compelling part of the book is what the artists themselves say about how they work .
The text is littered with quotes from painters , poets , writers , sculptors , and movie directors about how they perceived their own work and the work of their peers and predecessors .
Their thoughts provide ways for contemporary creators to think about how their creativity manifests itself .
The transcript of Gladwell ’s talk is a good introduction to there ideas .
Galenson ’s next book , And Now for Something Completely Different , appears to be available online in its entirety in a preliminary form .
Much more information is available on his web site .
Return to the Gym Workout
By : Manny Fausset
Recently , after training steadily for 18 months , I decided to take a long absence from the gym .
It was difficult at first , since the gym atmosphere has been my second home for eight ( 8 ) years now .
This was very difficult for me , not only because of the great physical catharsis that working out provides , but also because a lot of my friends work out and the only time I see them is at the gym .
Like myself , my friends ' personal lives are so full , that the only time we would get to visit is at the gym or not at all .
However , the time away from the gym allowed me to pay more attention to other aspects of my life that I had long neglected and finally acquiesced to my mother and took a long needed vacation .
During my vacation , I went to Texas and visited my family for a week and allowed myself to indulge in my mother 's home cooking ( a little too much ) .
My vacation was perfect ; during the day , I would visit old school friends , and in the evening , the family would gather around the fire and sip whiskey .
Once I returned , however , I could feel the neglect from my absence of the gym was felt around my waistline .
I decided it was time to get back in the gym again and hit the weights again .
Recalling my former experiences of over - zealousness in the return to the gym , I decided to modify my workout so as not to overtrain and not incur an injury .
I found this workout very accommodating and effective in helping me getting me back to my strength levels and general fitness back without " killing " myself and preventing any injuries .
I prefer the " three on one off " routines , meaning , work out for three consecutive days , and take the fourth day off .
Once my body returned to its pre-vacation shape , I would then go back to full intensity and weight .
Week One :
Day 1 : Chest , Shoulder , Triceps , and Abdominal ;
Bench Press : 2 X 15
Flyes : 2 X 15
Behind the Neck Press ( Standing ) 2 X 15
Side Raises 2 X 15
Close Grip Bench 2 X 15
Triceps Pushdowns 2 X 15
Day 2 : Legs
Leg Presses 2 X 20
Squats 2 X 15 , Leg Extensions 2 X 15
Leg Curls 2 X 15 , Stiff - Legged - Deadlifts 1 X 15
Standing Calf Raises 4 X 15
Day 3 : Back and Biceps
Seated Rows 2 X 15
Wide Grip Pulldowns 2 X 15 , Hyperextensions 2 X 15
Preacher Bench Curls 2 X 15
Hammer Curls 2 X 15
Throughout the execution of the exercises , the weight should be light yet moderately taxing to which you should be able to do the second set of the exercise with one to two minute 's rest .
Any more than two minutes , the weight is too heavy .
Again , this is only a recommended workout schedule .
The point of the workout is too allow the muscle fibers , ligaments , tendons , insertions to adapt to the strain of load bearing exercises , which , in essence , laying down the foundation .
Without laying the foundation , the lifter will experience an injury .
After conducting the workout for one - two weeks , modify the workout to include medium weight or a repetition range between 10 - 12 repetitions .
For example :
Week Two :
Day 1 : Chest , Shoulders , and Triceps ;
( Do not count warm - up sets )
Bench Press 1 X 15
1 X 10
Incline Press 1 X 15 , 1 X 10
Dumbbell Shoulder Press 1 X 15
1 X 10
Rear Shoulder Raises 1 X 15
1 X 10
Triceps Close Grip Bench 1 X 15
1 X 10
Triceps Pushdowns 1 X 15 , 1 X 10
Modify your entire workout and exercises for all your other body parts as shown above .
The purpose of the modified workout is to work not only your red muscle fibers , but also your intermediate muscle fibers .
Again , let me remind you is this workout is not for size , strength , but for easing back into your old routine and giving your body an opportunity to adjust to the heavy weight and intensity .
Once your body has adjusted to the prior workout , it 's time to add the heavy set to your workout .
Again , I will use the day one workout scenario to make an example of how a return to the gym workout would look like :
Week Three :
Day 1 : Chest , Shoulders , and Triceps ;
( Do not include warm - up sets )
Bench Press 1 X 15 , 1 X 10 - 12 , 1 X 6 - 8
Dumbbell Incline Bench Press 1 X 15 , 1 X 10 - 12 , 1 X 6 - 8
Shoulder Dumbbell Press 1 X 15 , 1 X 10 - 12 , 1 X 6 - 8
Shoulder Dumbbell Side Raises 1 X 15 , 1 X 10 - 12 , 1 X 6 - 8
Lying Triceps Extension 1 X 15 , 1 X 10 - 12 , 1 X 6 - 8
Triceps Pushdowns 1 X 15 , 1 X 10 - 12 , 1 X 6 - 8
The entire workout , in theory , should allow you full recovery of every set within 1 - 2 minutes after each set completion .
If however , you discover that your recovery between sets is longer , drop the weight .
If your recovery is taking approximately 30 seconds , then you should increase the weight .
The purpose of this workout is to allow your body an " active recovery " back to your former self before the long imposed vacation .
In addition , allow your body to recover fully from each cycle , for example , after your Day 1 workout , if your upper body does n't feel sore at all , then perhaps its time to go into the second week workout .
What I have basically outlined above is the sets and repetitions approximations ; try not to deviate from the time / repetitions approximations , however , as for the exercises , feel free to modify to your desire .
Personally , I hate flat Barbell Bench Press because I feel that Dumbbell Bench Press gives me a greater stretch at the bottom of the movement , so feel free to modify the workout to the exercises you like or use machines if that is your preference .
But nonetheless , do not compromise your form in order to finish your set .
Best wishes ,

Jeremy Jaynes may have the name of a porn star , but he has the heart of a spammer .
Jaynes filled his Raleigh , North Carolina home with multiple computers , routers , and some dedicated servers , then started blasting AOL subscribers with spam .
He sent 12,197 pieces of spam ( complete with falsified headers ) on July 16 , 2003 , then 24,172 on July 19 , and then another 19,104 on July 26 , all of them hawking a " penny stock picker , " a FedEx refund product , or a " history eraser . "
When police raided his home , they found CDs stuffed with 176 million e-mail address and another 1.3 billion e-mail user names , many of them AOL usernames that had been stolen by a former AOL employee .
Jaynes was charged under Virginia law , since that 's where AOL 's servers are located .
The state has a tough anti-spam law , and multiple courts found Jayne guilty and sentenced him to nine years in prison for " intent to falsify or forge electronics mail transmission information or other routing information in any manner in connection with the transmissions of unsolicited bulk electronic mail . "
But in a ruling today , the Virginia Supreme Court tossed the conviction and overturned the law .
Why ?
It ran afoul of the First Amendment to the US Constitution and placed an illegal limit on free speech , according to the justices .
The court found that the law was " overbroad . "
While the state has a legitimate interest in curtailing spam e-mail , the court also noted that the right to anonymous speech is a key part of US free speech law ; punishing someone for faking the header information of an e-mail in order to remain anonymous is not , in the court 's view , constitutional .
Had the law limited itself to commercial or fraudulent e-mail , it would have been acceptable .
Since it did not , the law could have punished , say , an anonymous e-mail pamphleteer who falsified e-mail header info .
That means the law " is not narrowly tailored to protect the compelling interests advanced by the Commonwealth , " according the court 's decision .
State lawyers asked the judges to slap a " limiting construction " on the law that would not overturn it , but would instead limit it to only those cases in which it would be constitutional .
The court said no .
In words that should bring a tear to the eyes of anyone who has ever railed against " activist judges , " the court noted that " a statute can not be rewritten to bring it within constitutional requirements ...
Such a task lies within the province of the General Assembly , not the courts . "
And with that decision , the law was struck down and Jaynes was free to go .
Here 's the confusing bit : as we reported in March of this year , the very same Supreme Court had in fact upheld Jayne 's conviction , even when it considered the anonymous speech issue .
As the court noted today , however , that decision was " withdrawn by the Court after a petition for rehearing was granted " and the case was considered anew .

3 Repent and ask Allah ( SWT ) for forgiveness for any sins you commit .
You need to let go of past mistakes and work on improving the future .
Whatever has happened is done .
It is in the past and there is nothing you can do to change it or better it .
The only thing you can do is sincerely repent to Allah ( SWT ) and ask for forgiveness and leniency .
Use those negative experiences as motivation to get better and do good .
Schoolchildren could be given ' smart drugs ' in a bid to boost brainpower
Schools will soon have to ensure all pupils have access to brain - enhancing ' smart drugs ' , according to officially funded experts .
They said teachers risk claims of bias against poorer children if they fail to give all pupils the same chance to take a new generation of pills which boost attention , concentration and memory .
Researchers predict that within a generation , cognition enhancing drugs - or ' cogs ' - will be so advanced that parents and teachers will be able to ' manipulate biology ' to enhance pupils ' brainpower .
Brave new world : Schoolchildren will be able to take drugs which help develop different mental capacities
But schools will have to address ' ethical issues about haves and have - nots ' , said the scientists led by Bristol University .
' If " cogs " are only available to those who can afford them , what does this mean for equality ? ' their report asked .
' It may be unethical to deny the chance for pupils to take advantage of such enhancements .
' Educators will at least need to know about what smart drugs are being taken by their pupils .
More children are taking the controversial pill Ritalin to enhance exam performance .
Schools will have to examine ' ethical issues about haves and have - nots ' researchers say
' They may need to have a hand in deciding whether some pupils need to take such drugs . '
Schools may also need to hold drug tests to monitor and regulate the use of performance - enhancers , according to the researchers .
They were commissioned by Futurelab , a think - tank and charity funded by the Government to help shape the future of education .
The study depicts a brave new world , where pupils ' DNA profiles would be stored on memory sticks .
Brain scanners would give staff real - time read - outs of pupils ' thinking , allowing them to tailor lessons more effectively .
It also predicted that within 25 years , so - called ' smart drugs ' will be specific enough for pupils to choose drugs for particular mental faculties .
These could include improving memory , attention , mood or motivation .
Doctors are already reporting that healthy students are taking Ritalin , the controversial hyperactivity medication , as it is thought to boost concentration .
Modafinil , a stimulant known as the ' stay awake ' pill , is also being taken to boost exam performance .
There is a booming Internet black market in the drugs , with reports of parents encouraging children taking exams to use them .
Some students at Oxford University are believed to be trading them in college libraries .
Meanwhile , procedures designed to treat degenerative diseases are also being developed to assist with learning and concentration .
Dubbed ' Botox for the brain ' , they involve magnetic pulses stimulating particular brain regions .
Yesterday 's report , part of a £ 1.5 million project on the future of schooling , warns that the sideeffects of long - term use of smart drugs are unknown .
The Academy of Medical Sciences has previously warned that smart drugs need to be regulated .

Secret Letter from John F. Kennedy , President of the United States , to Levi Eshkol , July 5 , 1963 about inspections of Israel 's Dimona nuclear weapons facility .
Obtained from the Israel State Archive and published at George Washington University 's National Security Archive website .
On inauguration day , a new U.S. president is a demigod , the embodiment of aspirations as vast as they are varied .
Over the course of the years that follow , the president inevitably fails to fulfill those lofty hopes .
So the cycle begins anew , and Americans look to the next occupant of the Oval Office to undo his predecessor ’s mistakes and usher in an era of lasting peace and sustained prosperity .
This time around , expectations are , if anything , loftier than usual .
The youthful and charismatic Sen. Barack Obama casts himself as the standard - bearer of those keenest to fix Washington , redeem America and save the world .
“ Yes , we can , ” Obama ’s anthem proclaims , inviting supporters to complete the thought by inserting their own fondest desire .
Yes , we can : bring peace to the Middle East ; reverse global warming ; win the global war on terrorism .
Yet Sen . John McCain ’s campaign has been hardly shy about fostering grandiose expectations .
Speaking earlier this month , while most Americans were fretting about the cost of oil , McCain uncorked one of his patented straight - talking promises : “ I ’m going to lead our nation to energy independence . ”
As far as McCain would have us believe , you can take that to the bank .
Will the next president actually bring about Big Change ?
Do n’t get your hopes up .
Regardless of who wins Nov. 4 , we should temper our expectations of what George W. Bush ’s successor will accomplish , especially on foreign policy .
In reality , presidents do n’t make policy ; administrations do .
To judge by the cadre of advisors they ’ve recruited , neither candidate holds much affinity for outside - the - box thinkers .
Obama ’s “ national security working group , ” for example , consists chiefly of Democratic war horses , including former secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher and former national security advisor Anthony Lake -- a group that is not young , not charismatic and not known for innovative thinking .
McCain ’s national security team features a strong neoconservative presence , including pundits such as Max Boot and Robert Kagan , along with hawkish Washington insiders such as Randy Scheunemann and James Woolsey .
All figured prominently among advocates of invading Iraq ; none has yet to repent .
Agents of change ?
Not likely , unless having a go at Iran qualifies as creative thinking .
The very structure of American politics imposes its own constraints .
For all the clout that presidents have accrued since World War II , their prerogatives remain limited .
A President McCain will almost certainly face a Congress controlled by a Democratic and therefore obstreperous majority .
A President Obama , even if his own party runs the Senate and House , wo n’t enjoy all that much more latitude , especially when it comes to three areas in which the dead hand of the past weighs most heavily : defense policy , energy policy and the Arab - Israeli peace process .
The military - industrial complex will inhibit efforts to curb the Pentagon ’s penchant for waste .
Detroit and Big Oil will conspire to prolong the age of gas guzzling .
And the Israel lobby will oppose attempts to chart a new course in the Middle East .
If the past provides any indication , advocates of the status quo will mount a tenacious defense .
Then there is the growing gap between American power and the demands of exercising global leadership .
The limits of American power are most obviously apparent in the realm of military affairs .
For McCain , Iraq remains the central front in the war on terrorism , and he ’ll stay as long as it takes to win .
Obama ’s central front is Afghanistan , and he wants to bolster the U.S. commitment there .
Their disagreement masks a more fundamental problem :
The next commander in chief will inherit an intractable troop shortage .
The United States today finds itself with too much war and too few warriors .
That alone will constrain a president conducting two ongoing conflicts .
A looming crisis of debt and dependency will similarly tie the president ’s hands .
Bluntly , the United States has for too long lived beyond its means .
With Americans importing more than 60 % of the oil they consume , the negative trade balance now about $ 800 billion annually , the federal deficit at record levels and the national debt approaching $ 10 trillion , the United States faces an urgent requirement to curb its profligate tendencies .
Spending less ( and saving more ) implies settling for less .
Yet among the campaign themes promoted by McCain and Obama alike , calls for national belt - tightening are muted .
Above all , there is this :
The rest of the world does n’t take its marching orders from Washington and wo n’t , no matter who happens to be president next year .
Governments will respond to American advice , threats or blandishments precisely to the extent that doing so serves their interests , and no further .
This alone sharply restricts what Bush ’s successor will be able to accomplish , whether dealing with allies such as Israel and Pakistan or with adversaries such as Iran and North Korea .
Will the tone and tenor of American diplomacy under either a President Obama or a President McCain differ from what we have seen over the last seven years ?
Yes , and probably in ways that most nations -- and many Americans -- will welcome .
But no matter how much charisma or straight talk emanates from the White House , the world will remain stubbornly intractable .
In matters of substance , Big Change will remain elusive .
The next president will leave his own imprint on U.S. policy .
It just wo n’t be nearly as distinctive or dramatic as the most enthusiastic Obama and McCain supporters have talked themselves into expecting .

Introductory essay by Lumumba author Leo Zeilig
In a small forest clearing about an hour ’s drive from Congo ’s southern - most city of Lubumbashi the first prime minster of an independent Congo , Patrice Lumumba , along with two of his comrades , was shot on January 17 , 1961 .
A Belgian officer organised the firing squad ; the three bodies were quickly buried , metres from where they had fallen .
The following day , another Belgian officer dug up the bodies ; cut them into pieces and dissolved them in acid .
The assassins were determined to ensure that there would be no trace left of Lumumba or of their crime .
When the news finally reached the world on February 13 , 1961 , that Lumumba had been killed there was uproar .
Protests swept cities and towns across the globe .
In Rome , the Italian Chamber of Deputies descended into chaos as demonstrators broke up the proceedings .
In Belgrade , protesters shouted , ``Lumumba will live for ever ’’ .
In Shanghai , a demonstration estimated at half a million was held .
Why was there such uproar ?
Who was Lumumba ?
Lumumba was a self - educated nationalist leader .
Born in 1925 in Congo ’s Kasai province , he was expelled from school and ran away , like many young Congolese , to the regional capital of Stanleyville – named after the colonial adventurer who ploughed his way through central Africa in the 19th century , it is now Kisangani .
The Belgian Congo , as it was known , was an inhospitable place .
By the 1940s it was emerging from a period of brutal colonialisation .
The combination of famine , forced labour and systematic violence had killed more than 10 million Congolese people between 1891 and 1911 .
But by the time of Lumumba ’s arrival in Stanleyville a new colony was being promised .
Industry was being developed and new mining communities were established across the country .
Copper was at the centre of the boom .
Produced in huge quantities in the south and mined by the public - private giant Union Minière du Haut - Katanga ( UMHK ) .
The Belgian Congo was the source of huge profits for the colonial state and private businesses .
Arriving in Stanleyville in 1944 , Lumumba quickly became a leading member of the évolués in the city .
The évolués – meaning literally ``the evolved ’’ -- were a group of educated Congolese men who were trained to take part in the civilising mission of the Belgian state .
They were given low - ranking jobs in the administration and groomed to regard themselves at champions of the ‘ Belgian Congo ’ community .
Lumumba became a clerk in the Stanleyville post office .
Apartheid state
The Congo was an apartheid state – strict segregation determined every aspect of life .
Lumumba ’s daughter , Juliana , explained : `` When you reached 18 years old you had to carry a permit , which would indicate what you did .
If you were stopped , you had to justify why you were in town ...
And if a black man looked at a white woman , he could find himself in prison . ’’
For much of the 1950s Lumumba ’s ideas did not stray from those held by the majority of the évolués .
He was an advocate for the colonial project .
In June 1956 this began to change .
Arrested and imprisoned for embezzlement , Lumumba started to see through the lies of the Belgian rulers , the cherished ``motherland ’’ .
Released in September 1957 Lumumba decided to make his new life in the capital Leopoldville ( today ’s Kinshasa ) .
The city was a modern metropolis – but still deeply segregated .
Leopoldville became infected by the ideas of independence and political liberation .
By November 1958 Lumumba was elected to lead what became the principal party of national liberation –- the Mouvement National Congolais ( MNC ) .
But Belgium was desperate to control the pace of radicalisation and sought to manipulate and divide the country ’s emerging political parties .
Other Western states were also desperate to ensure that Congo ’s independence did not mean real political and economic autonomy .
The United States had been heavily involved in the region since the start of the 20th century .
Ryan and Guggenheim , the US mining groups , had interests in the region .
The US also had investments in the UMHK .
The US State Department would not tolerate any political movement that refused to privilege the old relationships .
End of conciliation
Two events signaled the end of Lumumba ’s conciliatory politics .
He was inspired by the independence of Ghana in 1957 .
The first black leader on the continent was the Ghana ’s Kwame Nkrumah .
Nkrumah took a personal interest in the struggle of the MNC and became a comrade and confidant to Lumumba .
The second was more important .
On January 4 , 1959 , Leopoldville erupted in violence .
A demonstration was crushed by the notoriously brutal Force Publique , the colonial army .
Hundreds were killed .
The belief that a long transition and common understanding could pave the way to Congolese independence was over .
Congolese society was transformed .
Mass meetings took place , strikes spread and the movement for independence finally broke away from the ranks of the évolués .
Lumumba threw himself into the frenzy .
By March 1959 , the MNC had 58,000 members .
Lumumba ’s militancy rose with the gathering radicalisation .
Now he demanded independence without delay .
But other members of the évolués saw their future in an alliance with the colonial power , and later with the US .
Arrested , beaten and imprisoned at the end of 1959 , Lumumba was only released when negotiations were launched in Brussels in January 1960 .
In the negotiations he refused all compromises .
The Congo state would not be divided up – with the country ’s wealth controlled by the provinces -- as the Belgian rulers had hoped .
Nor would the MNC accept the Belgian king as the head of state in an independent Congo .
By the end of negotiations a date had been set for independence : June 30 , 1960 .
But Lumumba ’s radicalism had meant that he was hated by the Belgian elite .
They decided to undermine efforts of the MNC to win the May 1960 general election .
Independence
However the MNC emerged victorious .
Lumumba was now the undoubted leader of Congo ’s future .
Still he refused to accept deals with the departing power .
Congo ’s independence would be just that : an independent nation state free to decide on its own path .
On the day of independence Lumumba reminded his audience of the struggle for freedom : ``For this independence of the Congo , even as it is celebrated today with Belgium , a friendly country with whom we deal as equal to equal , no Congolese worthy of the name will ever be able to forget that is was by fighting that it has been won . ’’
Celebrations were quickly extinguished .
In July , Belgium promoted the secession of the mineral - rich provinces Katanga and Kasai .
These new ``states ’’ were immediately recognised , armed and supported by the old colonial power .
Some évolués – using the language of ethnic divide and rule – helped provide an African veneer to these artificial breakaway provinces .
Lumumba attempted to mobilise his supporters .
As the power he had just acquired began to slip away , he turned the ranks of the MNC and those who had propelled the Congo to independence .
But the forces against him and his comrades were too great .
Leading militants of the nationalist movement fell to bribes and cooption .
Joseph Mobutu -- the future dictator of the country , until then an ally and friend of Lumumba – was openly bribed by the US and persuaded to organise a coup in September .
By October 1960 there were four operations underway to assassinate Lumumba .
Western states openly called for his government to be removed .
Lumumba fled the capital in November and attempted to reach his supporters in Stanleyville .
Arrested days later he knew that this probably meant death .
Writing in prison to his wife he said , ``History will one day have its say , but it will not be the history that Brussels , Paris , Washington , or the United Nations will teach , but that which they will teach in the countries emancipated from colonialism and its puppets . ’’
Less than two months later he had been killed , six months after his election .
Symbol of the fight against imperialism
Lumumba ’s intransigent resistance to Western attempts to break Congo ’s independence still needs to be celebrated today .
He has rightly become a symbol , in Africa and elsewhere , of the fight against imperialism .
Lumumba , in his last months , began to edge away from the politics of national liberation and to see other forces at work .
Francois , his son and now a political activist in the Kinshasa , explained : `` He discovered in the course of 1960 that not all Congolese had the same interpretation of independence , that our ‘ brothers ’ were fighting for something completely different .
So in his actions and in his speeches he became more precise and spoke of workers , justice and equality . ’’

There has been a lot of brouhaha over Ma.gnolia going open source and I 'm not sure most of it is justified .
There are certainly features that work to Ma.gnolia 's advantage , but even though embracing open source and data portability ( among other features ) improve the service , they are unlikely to make it competitive .
Not only is Ma.gnolia minuscule compared to Yahoo's Delicious ( recently relaunched to version 2.0 ) , but compared to Yahoo's Buzz and Digg , even Delicious itself is minuscule and that 's not about to change .
The times , they 're a -changin '
The launch of Yahoo's Buzz was a somewhat controversial move on the company 's part .
First , many thought that it would cannibalize the Delicious user base ( which I 'm now sure it will to an extent ) , second , it launched with an incredibly exclusive beta and several severe limitations in social capabilities ( most of which still exist today ) , and third , it was yet another large corporation taking a shot at the house that Digg built .
Regardless , it was also a brilliant move and not just for the reasons I 've mentioned before .
Traffic figures and user acceptance have been excellent , ( already surpassing Digg by some measures ) , and recent reviews have been generally positive .
Apart from displaying Yahoo's ability to enter and dominate a space within a matter of months , it also shows that they understand the changing landscape of the social bookmarking space .
Even after the launch of delicious 2.0 , the service no longer grips the imagination ( or even fleeting fascination ) of the digerati , who have already moved on from social bookmarking to social news and networking , and perhaps the launch of Yahoo Buzz in advance of the Delicious relaunch was Yahoo's way of hedging its bets .
All that is to say that bookmarking as a social activity is soon to become a thing of the past .
In fact there is already interest in non-social bookmarking with services like Instapaper ( my personal favorite ) popping up everywhere you turn .
As people move away from the rather passive activity of sharing bookmarks to actively participating in the submission , promotion , and propagation of news and networking on the basis of their interests , social news and networking sites are bound to replace bookmarking sites like Ma.gnolia and Delicious .
The only reason to make bookmarking social was so that you could find new sites from people that share interests or activities with you .
StumbleUpon has done such a par excellence job of doing exactly that , it further diminishes the importance of sharing bookmarks in the traditional sense .
But that 's not all
Even if there was hope for the social bookmarking space , there are several other points to consider .
- Open source without a willing community means nothing .
Developers , developers , developers !
Going open source allows people freely to interact with and build for / on your platform , but you need people who want to do this , for it to be fruitful .
- Social news and networking is already open source .
We 've had pligg for a very long time now , plus there is Meneame and more recently Reddit has also gone open source .
- Just because you built it does n't mean they 'll come .
You do n't have to look much farther than mixx to realize that you can do everything right , have all the right partnerships in place , and still not get the following you deserve .
Success rarely comes easy and almost never overnight .
While Ma.gnolia 's efforts are commendable they do n't predict a very bright future for the site and the ongoing decline in use and impending obsolescence of social ' bookmarking ' is partly to blame .

Scientists are finding that particles that are barely there – tiny objects known as nanoparticles that have found a home in electronics , food containers , sunscreens , and a variety of applications – can breach our most personal protective barrier :
The skin .
The particles under scrutiny by Lisa DeLouise , Ph.D. , are almost unfathomably tiny .
The particles are less than one five - thousandth the width of a human hair .
If the width of that strand of hair were equivalent to the length of a football field , a typical nanoparticle would n't even belly up to the one - inch line .
In the September issue of the journal Nano Letters , a team led by DeLouise at the University of Rochester Medical Center published a paper showing that nanoparticles pass through the skin of a living organism , a type of mouse commonly used as a model to study the damaging effects of sunlight .
It 's the strongest evidence yet indicating that some nanoparticles are so small that they can actually seep through skin , especially when the skin has been damaged .
The health implications of nanoparticles in the body are uncertain , said DeLouise , an assistant professor of Dermatology and Biomedical Engineering and an expert on the properties of nanoparticles .
Other scientists have found that the particles can accumulate in the lymph system , the liver , the nervous system , and in other areas of the body .
In her study , she found that the particles accumulate around the hair follicles and in tiny skin folds .
DeLouise , a chemist , points out that her study did not directly address the safety of nanoparticles in any way .
" We simply wanted to see if nanoparticles could pass through the skin , and we found that they can under certain conditions , " she said .

DeLouise 's work is part of a broad field known as nanomedicine that is a strategic area at the University of Rochester Medical Center .
The area includes research , like hers , looking at the properties of nanoparticles , as well as possibilities like new forms of drug delivery and nano - sensors that can immediately identify microbes and other threats to our health .
While nanoparticles are becoming widely used in the manufacture of consumer products , they are also under a great deal of study in research labs , and there are some processes – including ordinary candle flames – that produce them naturally .
Some of the particles are so small , less than 10 nanometers wide ( a nanometer is one - millionth of a millimeter ) , that they are nearly as small as the natural gaps between some skin cells .
In its paper in Nano Letters , the team studied the penetration of nanoparticles known as quantum dots that fluoresce under some conditions , making them easier to see and track compared to other nanoparticles .
The scientists looked at the distribution of quantum dots in mice whose skin had been exposed to about the same amount of ultraviolet light as might cause a slight sunburn on a person .
The team showed that while the nanoparticles were able to breach the skin of all the mice , the particles passed more quickly through skin that had been damaged by ultraviolet light .
Part of the explanation likely lies with the complex reaction of skin when it 's assaulted by the Sun 's rays .
In response to ultraviolet light , cells proliferate , and molecules in the skin known as tight - junction proteins loosen so that new cells can migrate to where they 're needed .
Those proteins normally act as gatekeepers that determine which molecules to allow through the skin and into the body , and which molecules to block .
When the proteins loosen up , they become less selective than usual , possibly giving nanoparticles an opportunity to pass through the barrier .
In the future , DeLouise plans to study titanium dioxide and zinc oxide , two materials that are widely used in sunscreens and other cosmetic products to help block the damaging effects of ultraviolet light .
In recent years the size of the metal oxide particles used in many consumer products has become smaller and smaller , so that many now are nanoparticles .
The effects of the smaller particle size are visible to anyone who takes a walk on the beach or stops by the cosmetics counter at a department store :
The materials are often completely transparent when applied to skin .
A transparent lip gloss that protects against UV light , for example , or a see - through sunscreen may contain nanoparticles , DeLouise says .
" A few years ago , a lifeguard at the swimming pool wearing sunscreen might have had his nose completely covered in white .
Older sunscreens have larger particles that reflect visible light .
But many newer sunscreens contain nanoparticles that are one thousand times smaller , that do not reflect visible light , " said DeLouise , who noted that many people apply sunscreens after their skin has been damaged by sunlight .
Initial funding from two sources allowed the team to gather the evidence necessary to expand the project dramatically .
DeLouise 's project was first funded by the University 's Environmental Health Sciences Center , which supported graduate student Luke Mortensen during his research .
The University 's Clinical and Translational Science Institute has also awarded $ 100,000 to the team , and DeLouise has just received $ 394,000 from the National Science Foundation to expand the project for the next three years .
She will be working with dermatologist Lisa Beck , M.D. , who is an expert in allergic skin disorders .
In addition to DeLouise and Mortensen , authors of the paper include Günter Oberdörster , Ph.D. , professor of Environmental Medicine and a widely recognized authority on the bio-effects of nanoparticles .
Oberdörster is director of the Particulate Matter Center , funded by the Environmental Protection Agency , where scientists study the link between tiny air particles we breathe every day and our cardiovascular health .
Dermatologist Alice Pentland , M.D. , professor and chair of the Department of Dermatology and an expert on how sunlight brings about skin cancer , was also an author .
Red Hat confirmed Friday that hackers compromised infrastructure servers belonging to the company and the Fedora Project , including systems used to sign Fedora packages .
In the Fedora breach , company officials said they had " high confidence " the hackers did not get the " passphrase used to secure the Fedora package signing key . "
Regardless , the company has converted to new Fedora signing keys .
Red Hat 's Fedora project leader Paul Frields made the announcement Friday on the fedora - announce - list with the subject line " Infrastructure Report . "
When contacted , Red Hat officials pointed to Frields ' announcements as the company 's official statement .
In the Red Hat compromise , the intruder was able to sign a small number of OpenSSH packages relating to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 ( i386 and x86_64 architectures only ) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ( x86_64 architecture only ) .
As a precaution , Red Hat released an updated version of those packages , a list of tampered packages and a script to check if any of the packages are installed on a user 's system .
" This is a significant issue and they have to work to address it , " says Jay Lyman , an open source analyst with The 451 Group .
" These are some of the growing pains of a distribution becoming more complex .
They are building more and more into their operating systems , and with that comes more complexity and more challenges .
But what I think is most important here is the response . "
Red Hat first hinted at a problem on Aug. 14 , when Frields wrote that the Fedora infrastructure team was investigating an issue that could result in some service outages .
The message was followed up on Aug. 16 saying the team was " continuing to work on the problem . "
By that time , there were grumblings and rumors online and in discussion groups that internal systems may have been hacked , which indeed was the case , and was confirmed Friday by Red Hat .
In his announcement , Frields said changing the Fedora signing keys could require " affirmative steps " from every Fedora system owner or administrator , and said , if needed , those steps would be made public .
Frields also said that through checks of Fedora packages and source code that the company did not think packages had been compromised and said " at this time we are confident there is little risk to Fedora users who wish to install or upgrade signed Fedora packages . "
The Fedora Project released alpha code for Fedora 10 , its next version , earlier this month .
On the Red Hat side , the company issued an OpenSSH update and guidance on how users can protect themselves .
The company said it was " highly confident " that the Red Hat Network , an internal system that makes updates and patches available to its customers , was not compromised by the hacker .
The company , however , said it was issuing its alert for those who " may obtain Red Hat binary packages via channels other than those of official Red Hat subscribers . "
Frields also made it clear that the affects of the intrusions on Fedora and Red Hat were not the same and that Fedora packages are signed with keys different from those used to sign Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages .
This story , " Hackers Crack into Red Hat " was originally published by Network World .
Researchers announced this week that they are perfecting a procedure designed to turn pollution into a type of plastic used to make everything from DVDs to eyeglass lenses .
The effort is being touted as a way to capture and use climate change–causing carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions from coal - fired power plants and other sources instead of releasing it into the atmosphere or burying it underground .
" One is producing a material from CO 2 instead of just discarding it , " chemist Thomas Müller of the Center for Catalysis Research at RWTH Aachen University in Germany said yesterday at a press conference at the semiannual meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans .
" It can be a contribution to solving the CO 2 problem . "
Plastics such as polycarbonates are long chains of carbon atoms bonded to such elements as oxygen .
The tough plastic is currently constructed from the long carbon chains , or polymers , made from fossil fuels .
But Müller says that chemists could convert the nearly 10 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted by coal - fired power plants — if captured — into such plastics by applying pressure and using energy to trigger the necessary chemical reaction .
Muller says his team used an undisclosed catalyst to transform captured CO 2 into the polymers such as epoxide and dimethyl carbonate needed to make a polycarbonate .
Chemist Toshiyasu Sakakura of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba , Japan , reported that his team achieved similar results by combining captured CO 2 with methanol as well as a compound made of the catalyst phosphine on silica ( more commonly known as sand ) .
Much to Sakakura 's surprise , using elemental sand to support the catalyst dramatically boosted its effect .
" Surprisingly , in that case , one plus one is not two , " Sakakura said at the press conference .
" One plus one equals 100 . "
The chemists are not sure why silica , which is not a catalyst , appeared to help produce more polymers than expected .
Sakakura said that the only waste product of these chemical reactions was water .
But the processes do have a downside : coaxing the carbon dioxide molecules to form longer chains requires high temperatures and great pressure — and , so , extra energy .
Because that additional energy would likely come from burning fossil fuels , Müller says , the " overall process of converting CO 2 to polymers at present would produce more CO 2 . "
That means the process would only pay off environmentally if clean alternative energy sources such as solar or wind power are used to fuel it .
" We need alternative sources for energy , " he says .
In that event , everything from soda bottles to police riot shields might one day help sequester some of the most common greenhouse gas currently warming the planet .
This is my OLD blog .
I 've copied this post over to my NEW blog at :
http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/07/django-blog-project-9-migrating-blogger/
You should be redirected in 2 seconds .
Last post , I talked about adding comments to my new sample blog application .
This was about the last basic feature I needed to add before I started actually using it for real .
Of course there are still a number of features I 'd like to add , such as automatic syntax highlighting with Pygments , and incorporating django - tagging and some more intersting views , not to mention comment moderation .
But I think those will have to wait -- I want to start using my new blog for real sometime .
So for the past few days , I 've been working on my Beautiful Soup screen scraper script to copy all my Blogger posts over to my new Django blog .
Initial results came quickly ( it 's pretty cool to see such a huge data dump after only a few lines of Beautiful Soup'ing ) but the details ( especially with the comments ) kind of slowed me down .
I 've finally got everything copied over to my satisfaction .
Below is the script I used to do it .
Note , I realize it's not pretty -- just a one time use hack .
But hopefully someone else doing the same thing might find it useful .

I also made some changes to my Django blog code as I migrated my Blogger posts .
The main addition was a LegacyComment model along with the associated views and templates .
My Blogger comments consisted of HTML markup , but I did n't want to allow arbitrary HTML in my new comments for fear of cross site scripting .
So I separated my legacy Blogger comments from my new Django site comments .
Here are my model changes .
I added a LegacyComment class which contains pertinent comment attributes and a ForeignKey to the post that it belongs to .
I also added a lc_count ( for legacy comment count ) field to the Post class which stores the number of comments for the post .
It is updated by the save ( ) method in the LegacyComment class every time a comment is saved .
Hmmm , I just realized the count will be wrong if I ever edit these comments .
Well , since these are legacy comments , hopefully I wo n't have to edit them .

Here is an excerpt from my views .
py file showing the changes :

In the list page template I used the truncatewords_html template filter to show a 50 word post summary on the list pages instead of the full post .
I also added the legacy comment count with the Django free comment count to display the total number of comments .

ANNANDALE , Va. ( MarketWatch ) --
Has the stock market already voted by absentee ballot in this November 's presidential race ?
It may very well be in the process of doing just that .
And a big clue as to how it is voting is provided by Thursday 's dismal stock market , in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % fell by 345 points .
For the still - young month of September , the Dow is now down 3.1 % .
This points to an increased likelihood that the Democrats will reclaim the presidency in November 's election .
The reason I can even attempt to draw these conclusions from the stock market 's recent behavior is an analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research , an institutional research firm based in Venice , Fla .
Specifically , the firm constructed two market averages out of how the Dow has performed in past presidential - election years ( back to 1900 , in fact ) .
The first of these two benchmarks tracked the market 's average performance during years since then in which the incumbent political party eventually won the White House , while the other reflected average returns when the incumbent party lost .
Upon comparing these two benchmarks , as Ned Davis noted earlier this week , " There does not seem to be a lot of difference in election years between those years where the incumbent party wins or loses , except in the month of September where the divergence is striking . "
How big a divergence ?
During Septembers of years in which the incumbent party goes on to win the White House , the Dow has produced an average gain of 0.32 % .
During Septembers in which the incumbent party lost , in contrast , the Dow has produced an average loss of 0.71 % .
That difference , which totals just over one percentage point , may not appear to be that big .
But on an annualized basis it works out to around 13 % .
Good statistician that he is , Davis realizes that correlation is not the same as causation .
One needs to couple the raw statistics with a plausible theory as to why the stock market would perform differently when the incumbent party wins the White House than when it loses .
" Perhaps it is the uncertainty over change , " Davis speculates , " or perhaps the stock market predicts or reflects the election results . "
Another qualification that Davis emphasizes : " The sample sizes are relatively small . "
So we can't be as confident in drawing any conclusions as we would if there were lots more data points .
Regardless , however , the stock market 's losses this week can't be good news for John McCain 's campaign .

Story Highlights • U.S. arming nationalist guerrillas , ex-Saddam Hussein loyalists in Diyala province
• Just two months ago , same insurgents were focused on fighting U.S. troops
• In town of Tahrir , insurgents have created an anti-al Qaeda alliance
• Insurgents say al Qaeda killings , strict rules , " tyranny " brought about falling - out
Adjust font size :
BUHRUZ , Iraq ( CNN ) -- U.S. forces have begun arming nationalist guerrillas and former Saddam Hussein loyalists -- and coordinating tactics -- in a marriage of convenience against al Qaeda radicals in one of Iraq 's most violent provinces , senior U.S. commanders tell CNN .
This new alliance , a result of the deepening divisions among Iraqi insurgent factions , was on display earlier this week at a highway intersection in the town of Tahrir .
There , a group of some 15 insurgents publicly chanted : " Death to al Qaeda . "
" The al Qaeda organization has dominated and humiliated Sunnis , Shiites and jihadis .
It has forced people from their homes .
They can't get enough blood .
They killed many honest scholars , preachers and loyal mujahedeen , " one of the group 's spokesmen read from a written manifesto .
It 's a sharp turnaround from just two months ago when the same insurgent forces were focused on fighting U.S. troops and driving them out of Diyala province , about 40 miles north of Baghdad .
U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon , commander of Multi-National Division North , believes U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in Vietnam and Latin America offer precedents for the strategy he is now pushing in this region of Iraq .
( Watch how insurgents are turning against al Qaeda )
" We 've seen this in previous counterinsurgency operations , using local nationals , arming them and forming them into scouts , " he told CNN .
" That 's the primary role we want to use them in .
They know the territory .
They know the enemy . "
The changing strategy is n't just confined to Diyala , according to U.S. officials .
Gen. David Petraeus , commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , told CNN Thursday that tribal forces in Anbar , the restive Sunni province west of the Iraqi capital , have " decided to oppose al Qaeda and fight with the coalition forces against them . "
" What 's taken place in Anbar is almost breathtaking , " he said .
" In the last several months , tribes that turned a blind eye to what al Qaeda was doing in that province are now opposing al Qaeda very vigorously .
And the level of violence in Anbar has plummeted , although there clearly is still work to be done . "
( Full story )
At the highway intersection in Tahrir , the insurgents said they had named their anti-al Qaeda alliance the United Jihad Council .
They said the newly formed council was an umbrella organization of smaller insurgent units , including the 1920s Brigades , the Mujahedeen Army , Islamic Army and the Salaheddin Brigades .
CNN videotaped gunmen posting lookouts on rooftops throughout Tahrir and patting down civilians -- checking for potential al Qaeda infiltrators -- as they made their way to prayers at local mosques .
Locals say al Qaeda amputated fingers for smoking
Nationalist insurgents say al Qaeda excesses are behind their falling - out .
Several sources said al Qaeda members burned a 7 - year - old child alive and murdered women and other children in the towns and villages around the provincial capital of Baquba .
They did not give names or dates to back up their claims .
" They [ al Qaeda ] ruled with tyranny .
They really harmed our town , so we had to stop them , and they left , no return , " said one young gunman , who claimed membership in the nationalist 1920s Brigades .
Other civilian and insurgent sources in the towns of Tahrir and neighboring Buhruz said al Qaeda had imposed strict regulations , including a ban on smoking -- punishable by the amputation of a finger or hand -- and a curfew on citizens walking in the streets after 4 p.m .
Some citizens said al Qaeda had even banned Friday prayers .
Based on anecdotal evidence , offered by civilians in Buhruz , al Qaeda was financing its military operations by forcing citizens to pay a " war tax , " as well as by kidnapping for ransom , selling smuggled fuel on the black market , and even using forced labor to harvest oranges and dates from sprawling plantations throughout the region .
In Buhruz , Capt .
Ben Richards is one of the U.S. field commanders cementing the U.S. military alliance with its former foes from the nationalist insurgent factions .
He said the new strategy was highly pragmatic .
( Watch a marriage of convenience )
" If we go in with the mindset that every one of these persons has tried to kill an American , I do n't think that 's true , though in many cases it may be .
But if you think that , then you 're setting yourself up for a mindset that is not productive for us or for the Iraqi people , " Richards , commander of a troop of Stryker combat vehicles , told CNN .
Richards described assistance from the former insurgent factions and what he calls other " concerned local nationals " as " militarily crucial . "
His key ally in the region is a man known as Abu Ali , who says he has never belonged to an insurgent force but was an officer in one of Saddam Hussein 's feared military intelligence units .
To date , Abu Ali says he has received 39 weapons and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition from the U.S. military .
The insurgent factions he represents , however , are known to have significant arsenals of their own weapons , including light machine guns , assault rifles and rocket - propelled grenades .
Publicly , Abu Ali is grateful for the assistance he and his followers have received from the U.S. military .
He predicts he can help clear the entire province of al Qaeda militants within six months if the U.S.
Army provides more ammunition and supports insurgent operations with air cover and help from tanks and armored personnel carriers .
But while the marriage of convenience may be successful for now , Abu Ali and his followers seem to have no intention of making a lasting commitment to the Americans .
" After we are done with al Qaeda , " Abu Ali says , " we will ask the Americans to withdraw from Iraq .
...
If they do not withdraw , there will be violations and the American army will be harmed . "
He adds , " Especially after the help the U.S. Army has provided us , we would like them to go home as our friend , not enemy . "
With the alliance only beginning to bear its first successes , few U.S. commanders seem to be looking toward the end of the affair .
But there is a realization that it is a balancing act -- to prevent al Qaeda infiltration and to maintain the collaboration of nationalist insurgents .
" It 's a risk worth taking , " Mixon said .
Changing lug nuts not a war crime , jury told Reuters
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008
Print This Email This GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - Osama bin Laden 's driver performed vital services that enabled " the world 's most dangerous terrorist " to launch attacks , a prosecutor told jurors before they began deliberations on Monday in the first U.S. war crimes trial at Guantanamo .
But defense lawyers for Yemeni captive Salim Hamdan argued he was merely a hired laborer akin to the defense contractors who provide services to U.S. forces .
" Changing lug nuts and oil filters " were hardly war crimes , they said ..
Hamdan was not even trusted to know where he was driving bin Laden until after a convoy departed , Lt. Cmdr. Brian Mizer , his U.S. military defense lawyer , told the jury of six U.S. military officers .
Hamdan , who is about 38 , was captured in November 2001 in Afghanistan , where he had worked in bin Laden 's motor pool since 1996 .
He could face life in prison if convicted of conspiring with al Qaeda and supporting terrorism in the first U.S. war crimes tribunal since World War Two .
Even if he is acquitted , or sentenced to less than the six years he has already spent in captivity , the United States says it still can hold him as an " unlawful enemy combatant " until the end of the war on terrorism declared by President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks .
Hamdan says he drove for bin Laden because he needed the $ 200 monthly wage but denies joining al Qaeda , pledging loyalty to bin Laden or participating in attacks .
Prosecutors portrayed Hamdan as a key conspirator who enthusiastically drove and protected the al Qaeda leader , knowing that bin Laden 's goals included murdering Americans and taking down Western nations .
" He 's an al Qaeda warrior .
He has wounded - and the people he has worked with - have wounded the world , " prosecutor John Murphy said .
The prosecutor said Hamdan ferried al Qaeda weapons and served as bin Laden 's bodyguard .
He was assigned to drive him to safety if his convoy came under attack , providing the last line of defense for the man at " the top of this terror pyramid , " Murphy said .
" These terror attacks could not have been carried out without the ability to transport the leadership before , during and after the attacks and allow them to kill on another day , " he said .
The defense recounted testimony that Hamdan was bored by bin Laden 's speeches and that when captured at a checkpoint in Afghanistan , he ran and hid in a ditch rather than fire the AK - 47 he carried .
Afterward , Hamdan led U.S. forces on a tour of Kandahar , pointing out al Qaeda safe houses , Mizer said .
He said Hamdan had cooperated with U.S. interrogators , and alluded to secret testimony that journalists were not allowed to hear , apparently referring to an offer Hamdan had made to help U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
" You know what happened , how we squandered that opportunity , " Mizer told the jurors .
Mizer also recounted written testimony from accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who described his fellow Guantanamo prisoner as a primitive Bedouin only interested in bin Laden 's money and unfit to plan and execute attacks .
Defense lawyers portrayed the prosecution 's case as guilt by association and said Hamdan was no more involved in al Qaeda attacks than were bin Laden 's cooks , farmers and goatherds .
" Hitler 's driver was never charged with a war crime and it does n't work that way today , " defense lawyer Joseph McMillan said .
Hamdan 's trial is the first to be conducted by the controversial tribunals the Bush administration create to prosecute non-U.S. citizens outside the civilian and military court system .
An Australian former captive , al Qaeda trainee David Hicks , avoided trial at Guantanamo by pleading guilty to providing material support for terrorism and finished his nine - month sentence in his homeland last year .
At least four of the six military jurors must agree by secret , written ballot in order to return a guilty verdict for Hamdan .

Google turns the Big 10 years old on Sept. 7 and there are no shortage of stories about what the company has achieved in a decade , as well as comparisons to how Google fared compared to Microsoft 's first 10 years .
As the leading search engine and the best executor of search advertising on the Web , Google earns about $ 16.5 billion in annual sales , its stock sells at $ 450 and the company boasts a market cap of $ 142 billion .
Not bad , right ?
Fine , but we at eWEEK are more interested in what Google will do in the next 10 years .
Come along for the ride ...
The Chrome Wars
The most obvious place to start is with Google 's Chrome Web browser , which took 1 percent of the browser market within its first day of release .
What will happen if more and more people choose Chrome over IE ?
There is no easy answer to that question .
Media and bloggers like to say Chrome will break Windows but the fact is that you can't get to the browser without having Windows or Linux boot up your machine .
Here 's what I believe .
Instead of going to Microsoft Office for word processing , spreadsheet and presentation software , users will increasingly go first to Chrome on Windows , Linux and Mac machines , and then to Gmail , and other Google Apps , such as Docs .
This will happen in the consumer sector , but thanks to new apps such as Google Video for businesses and increased reliability from Google 's cloud infrastructure , businesses will begin to live on the Web , too .
This is already starting in small businesses but medium and large enterprises will start to adopt Google within 10 years .
Internet Explorer will be rendered irrelevant as Chrome becomes the new IE and Google Apps becomes the new Office .
What will happen to Microsoft ?
Microsoft will revitalize Windows by battling back with Live Mesh and will look to pursue the mobile space , but as Microsoft Watch 's Joe Wilcox noted , the software giant is well behind in this area .
Chrome Comes to Android
Chrome is a hit , but Google co-founder Sergey Brin has also said Chrome will slip into Android .
Chrome and Android share the same WebKit rendering engine .
With Google bringing the speedy JavaScript virtual machine from Chrome to Android , expect blazing fast access to Web applications .
In the next few years , Google will successfully map the Chrome desktop experience to Android phones , which start to challenge Apple 's iPhone for quality user experience and mobile market share .
A two - horse race for mobile Web consumption ensues between Google and Apple .
Nokia and other phone makers will continue to make phones but their software will be supplanted by Chrome and other Google Web apps .
Microsoft Windows Mobile market share begins to decline .
Users will continue to access Chrome and Google Search and Apps from Android phones .
The conversation around Google 's search ad business on the desktop remains strong , but Google begins to look less like a one - trick pony as Chrome and Android open up more mobile ad opportunities for Google .
Though less than a month old , the bug reports against .NET 3.5 SP 1 are starting to pile up .
While bugs are an inevitable part of any release , the way a company responds to them varies greatly .
Microsoft 's .NET division generally requires users to call product support for specific hot fixes , with widely available service packs only shipped once a year or two .
For users with previously working programs , it takes a lot of effort just to figure out that Microsoft , rather than the vendor , is the culprit .
And once that is established , one still has to figure out which KB article references the needed hot fix .
If the user and / or the developers do not figure it out right away , countless man-hours can be wasted .
Below is a list of the verified issues that we know about :
Serialization
When a generic class implements ISerializable and has a static delegate member that makes use of the generic type arguments , binary deserialization hangs ( on a 32 - bit system with Windows Server 2003 ) or throws an OutOfMemoryException ( on a 64 - bit system with Windows Server 2008 ) .
Issue 361615
WinForms
In some circumstances a user can drag toolstrips from one MDI child Form to another .
Imagine clicking a button on one document and having an entirely different one react .
Issue 361894
Reflection
ExecutionEngineException with ParameterInfo.GetOptionalCustomModifiers and GetRequiredCustomModifiers on 3.5 SP1 .
This bug in the pair of methods is affecting the popular framework , Rhino Mocks .
Issue 361606
WPF
. NET 3.5 SP1 breaks use of WPF under IIS .
Seems some people have been using WPF to generate images in real time for web sites .
Unfortunately , WPF no longer seems to work under IIS .
Issue 361469
Type Checking
Under certain circumstances , a class that works under 3.5 will not pass PEVerify when run under 3.5 SP1 .
Essentially this means you will get a type load exception if you try to use the class at runtime .
Issue 361539
Numerics
Spurious " The operation overflows at compile time in checked mode " This is a bug in the new Semantic Error Checker for C# .
It is triggered when subtracting 2 from ulong .

Facts About Problem Banks : Should You Be Worried About Your Money ?
Do you think your bank is in trouble ?
Worried about your savings accounts in problem banks ?
Some musings on the banking and financial crisis and the plight of troubled banks .
I took a few days to absorb the latest news in the financial industry ; if you read the mainstream media these days , it ’s as if financial armageddon is upon us .
Do you remember any of these jaw - dropping stories from your local paper ?
Drama In Wall Street Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy .
A potential buyer ( Barclay ’s ) balked as a buyer .
Merrill Lynch is taken over by Bank of America .
AIG , a large insurance company , got a forced restructuring .
Several global banks are setting up a $ 70 billion loan program for troubled institutions .
The Federal Reserve is taking steps to better its lending programs .
When we read something along these lines , we often wonder what ’s next for savings account rates and our high yield savings accounts .
During times of financial upheaval , the government tries to do its best to calm the crazy markets and to ensure liquidity in our financial systems .
But , with these financial institutions falling like dominoes , you may wonder — how nervous should you be ?
Well , there ’s SIPC protection for investment accounts and FDIC protection for bank accounts .
At this time , it ’s important that we understand the details of what SIPC and FDIC coverage will do for us , as there are some limitations to their reach and there are specific applications for them .
Because of such coverage , I ’m not particularly concerned by losses due to a bank or brokerage failure , but I do wonder : in what state can I expect to find my money if my bank fails , and how big an inconvenience is it going to be to have to deal with my accounts in limbo ?
How much should I worry ?
Problem Banks and The Accounts You Have With Them
Several other bloggers have tackled this issue in the past , particularly when discussing the demise of IndyMac Bank , a thrift that went under a few months ago as the second biggest failed bank in the U.S.
I ’d like to chime in with my thoughts on this topic in light of economic events and shocks in the stock market :
# 1 You ’re okay if your money stays within SIPC and FDIC limits .
If your bank or brokerage folds , you ’ll get your money returned to you if you are within insurance guidelines .
For FDIC , it ’s $ 100,000 per depositor in individual accounts , $ 250,000 in retirement accounts ; for SIPC , it ’s $ 500,000 per account ( regardless of type or registration ) .
Interestingly , if you ’ve got accounts properly structured at your bank , you and your spouse may have as much as $ 1.1 million in deposits insured at your bank .
If you ’ve got money outside of that coverage , you become a creditor of the bank , and you ’ll fall in line to get your money back equivalent to 40 cents to 100 cents on the dollar ( averaging 72 cents on the dollar ) depending on how the FDIC conducts the sales of assets of your bank .
# 2 Struggling financial institutions continue to function in some capacity even after they fail .
Such companies are ultimately taken over by the FDIC ( they declare bankruptcy ) or by another company that absorbs them .
The larger they are , the less likely it will be that they ’ll just up and disappear leaving you with losses .
In past cases , a bank in trouble will be bought out by another , will merge with some other entity and keep doing business as usual .
Bankrate states that most of the time , the average bank customer is unaware that changes are going on behind the scenes .
The FDIC facilitates the “ transfer of ownership ” and assets of one bank to an acquiring bank .
# 3 Acquired banks have it easier than those that file for bankruptcy .
Normally , you ’ll be able to use your cards , checks and other tools if the bank is simply in a buyout transition .
But you may be more inconvenienced if your bank goes bankrupt : in this case , you can probably expect your assets under FDIC protection to be mailed to you expeditiously and you may have to review your accounts for pending transactions you ’ll need to address and resolve in some other manner ( e.g. your direct deposits and payouts to merchants ) outside of your bank ’s systems .
Reconciling all that just means extra work for us when we ’re busy enough as it is .
Not fun .
Case Study : Washington Mutual
This all brings to the forefront the plight of a popular bank among bloggers — one which we ’ve brought to your attention in the past , due to the great interest rates it has been offering .
Because of what ’s been happening , I ’ve been keeping a close eye on Washington Mutual , which has been widely cited as one of those vulnerable banks on the brink .
The latest on this bank is that its S & P financial rating has been cut to junk status and that some suitors are knocking at its door .
I ’ve written about WaMu in the past , discussing its attractive rates .
However , it seems that in order to try to stem their problems , they had hiked their free checking and savings account APY to 4.00 % (! ) in order to gain customers .
Of course , this was done in the past as a last ditch effort to “ look good ” , even as they were trying to right a “ sinking ship ” .
There are folks out there who will take that rate and are willing to live with the risk of their bank undergoing changes .
But I ’d be wary about developments like this , while the worst of any financial crisis continues to wind its way throughout the financial industry .
My take ?
If you ’ve got money in WaMu that you do n’t need quick access to and is FDIC protected , I ’d keep my funds in place and see how things play out ; otherwise , I ’d be moving some funds around right about now ( to keep under the FDIC guidelines at the very least ) .

@ Fergie24 : For starters , their overhead has to be ridiculous compared to most publishers .
Add significant spending in R&D and acquisitions , subtracted by the likely high number of games ultimately made for a loss , and that 's where your Warcraft money goes .
It 's been crazy to grow up with the games industry and see it reach a point where analysts ( professional and armchair alike ) can make legitimate Hollywood analogies with some of the industry 's titans .
Look at Activision Blizzard as similar to Warner Bros .
" The Dark Knight " is on pace to make a boatload of money , and everyone 's happy , right ?
Well they needed it , because " Speed Racer " shit the bed with authority .
Even in the unlikely event the foreign box office take and home markets turn a profit for that piece of crap , it wo n't make up for the expectations set by WB for investors .
Batman essentially wipes the slate clean , but that 's a microcosm of the win / loss records each studio — film or game — will endure during a given fiscal year .
According to American leaders , Russia ’s control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia represents an assault by an arrogant adversary on a freedom - loving ally .
The John McCain campaign advocates slapping economic sanctions on Russia and pressing forward with admitting Georgia to NATO — even at the risk of confrontation with Russia .
The Barack Obama campaign is less strident , but shares the assumption that the United States bears responsibility for backing Georgia in the face of Russian aggression .
This reasoning is faulty and perilous .
It is based on four fallacies .
The first is that Georgia is a democracy .
It is not .
Elections in Georgia are riddled with fraud , and the president , Mikheil Saakashvili , has a penchant for aggrandizing his personal power at the expense of fair procedures .
Abuse of citizens by predatory police is rampant in Georgia , and the judiciary is hapless and corrupt .
The second fallacy is that the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia embrace Georgian rule .
Ever since the Soviet Union began unraveling in the late 1980s , Georgia has treated its ethnic minorities poorly .
That is why the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia rose against the Georgian government in the early 1990s and why they still welcome the Russians today .
Some of Russia ’s other post - communist neighbors have become genuine democracies and treated their minorities fairly .
Lithuania , Bulgaria and Mongolia are examples .
Georgia is not part of that group .
The third fallacy is that Russia is dispensable .
In fact , it is vital to helping the United States meet its three biggest strategic challenges .
The first is the rise of China .
Like the United States , Russia has a powerful interest in checking Chinese expansionism .
The second is reducing dependence on Middle Eastern oil .
Russia is the world ’s largest exporter of hydrocarbons .
While mild anti-American propaganda abounds in Russia , Russian schools do not portray the West as wicked root and branch .
Russians treasure their cultural autonomy , but they would rather join the West than destroy it .
If America is to reduce its dependence on those who truly wish it ill , Russia can help .
The third challenge is fighting terrorism .
Here American and Russian interests are virtually identical .
Close cooperation with Russia , whose global espionage operations are second only to America ’s , is crucial to success in counterterrorism .
The fourth fallacy is that Russia can be manipulated .
It cannot .
A decade of robust economic growth has enabled Russia to clear its foreign debts , rebuild its state apparatus , and slash poverty .
The regime is not democratic , but the government enjoys broad and stable popular support .
Given Russia ’s revived capabilities , it unsurprising that the Bush administration ’s ill - advised push to admit Georgia to NATO provoked resistance .
A pro-democratic government in Moscow would have opposed the move as strongly as the Putin- Medvedev administration has .
Russians of every political stripe regard the prospect of Georgia ’s admission to NATO as a menace .
America often faces a painful trade - off between principles and interests .
The Russo - Georgian conflict poses no such quandary .
America ’s commitment to the principle of self - determination favors Russian rather than Georgian sway in Abkhazia and South Ossetia since that is what most inhabitants of these regions prefer .
America ’s strategic interests are served by bolstering ties with a leading oil producer , bulwark against Chinese ambitions , and essential link in the war on terror .
Yet both Republicans and Democrats now back massive support for rebuilding Georgia ’s military , which was devastated in Georgia ’s reckless play for South Ossetia in August .
Building up a diminutive , poorly governed client state on Russia ’s border is a fool ’s gambit .
It contradicts American principles and vital national interests .
M. Steven Fish is a professor of political science at the University of California - Berkeley and the author of “ Democracy Derailed in Russia : The Failure of Open Politics ” ( Cambridge , 2005 ) .
He wrote this article for the Mercury News .
Just over a year since the beginning of the worst U.S. financial crisis since the Great Depression , and only six months after the federal bailout of Bear Stearns , the seizing up of credit markets continues .
The failure of eight U.S. banks this year , including IndyMac , and the recent instability that struck the two government - sponsored mortgage giants , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , requiring a special government rescue operation , has had the entire financial world on edge .
Mortgage - related losses by themselves “ could cause a trillion dollars in credit to vaporize , ” according to a special July 28 , 2008 , Business Week report .
The downside effects of financial leveraging ( the magnification of results associated with borrowed money ) mean that each dollar lost by financial institutions could lead to reductions in lending of fifteen dollars or more , creating a shockwave so massive that it could reveal structural weaknesses throughout the economy .
Already the economy is reeling , with faltering growth , a deep slump in housing , massive job losses , rapidly rising oil and consumer goods prices , and a falling dollar .
Yet , the good news from the standpoint of capital is that the financial system has been stabilized somewhat ( though the crisis is far from over ) as a result of repeated government rescue operations , essentially socializing the losses of private investors , on the principle that the financial entities concerned are “ too big to fail . ”
The Federal Reserves Board ’s assets in June 2007 consisted almost entirely ( 92 percent ) of Treasury securities .
Now these amount to just 54 percent of the Fed ’s assets , and have been replaced by , among other things , loans to financial institutions whose shares have been falling .
Moreover , as a result of the Bear Stearns rescue and subsequent Fed interventions , the public now bears the risk on a lot of collateralized mortgage obligations , i.e. , largely worthless paper assets — a further cost to the taxpayers .
This raises an important question : “ Why No Outrage ? ”
This is the title of an article by longtime gold bull James Grant , editor of Grant ’s Interest Rate Observer , writing in the July 19 , 2008 , issue of the Wall Street Journal .
Why is it , Grant asks , that “ America ’s 21st century financial victims , ” the general public , “ make no protest against the Federal Reserve ’s showering dollars on the people who would seem to need them least ?….
Have the stewards of other people ’s money not made a hash of high finance ?
Did they not enrich themselves in boom times , only to pass the cup to us , the taxpayers , in the bust ? ”
Why , he asks , is there no populist outburst , in the historic tradition of U.S. society ?
Further , why , in the context of a 2008 presidential contest , are the candidates of the two major political parties virtually silent on the extent of the robbery taking place , and even on the financial crisis itself ?
“ The American people , ” he writes , “ are famously slow to anger , but they are outdoing themselves in long suffering today . ”
The fact that such questions are being asked in the leading U.S. financial paper by a noted financial analyst should give us reason to pause .
Moreover , the answers that Grant gives to his questions are as interesting as the questions themselves : “ Possibly , in this time of widespread public participation in the stock market , ‘ Wall Street ’ is really ‘ Main Street . ’
Or maybe Wall Street , its old self , owns both major political parties and their candidates .
Or , possibly , the $ 4.50 gasoline price has absorbed every available erg of populist anger , or — yet another possibility — today ’s financial failures are too complex to stick in everyman ’s craw . ”
Grant ’s own preferred explanation is that the populists really won in the days of the New Deal and later , and now , due to the expansion of the state ’s role , Wall Street has become so “ hand - in - glove with the government ” that the space for political opposition within the system has evaporated .
To be sure , he writes , “ government is …— in theory — by and for the people . ”
But even that , he suggests , is not enough to explain the lack of public angst , which remains largely a mystery .
Although we have long been opposed ( and remain so ) to views that place monetary policy at the heart of explanations of the course of modern capitalism — a perspective that Grant is identified with — we nevertheless agree with his assessment here that the state and finance are in bed with each other ( or have at least closed ranks in the crisis , representing a common ruling - class viewpoint ) .
This also extends to the two major political parties and their candidates .
And it includes the media , which ought to be raising a stir .
The silence in the context of a general election speaks volumes .
We also find ourselves in accord with Grant ’s conclusion that in the end there seems to be no completely satisfactory explanation for lack of popular protest over a series of ad hoc grants showering hundreds of billions of dollars of public money on the masters of finance , collectively the richest group of capitalists on the planet .
And that raises the question :
Is this outrage present nonetheless , growing underground , unheard and unseen ?
Will it suddenly burst forth , like some old mole , unforeseen and in ways unimagined ?
That too , we think , is a possibility .
The July 28 Business Week , through Michael Mandel its chief economist , offers this hopeful perspective from a ruling - class standpoint :
Nothing will happen until after the election and then the next president will most likely act immediately to initiate a massive bailout of the entire mortgage - based financial system .
A new president , Business Week presumes , will have sufficient political clout to socialize private losses even more fully at the expense of the taxpayers , without generating a public revolt .
The truth is that the last thing that the capitalist class wants is an explosion of outrage and the destabilization of what for them is a good thing indeed …vast profits from speculative bubbles , plus the government ’s increasing absorption of losses on the downside : all paid for by an acquiescent or oblivious public .
It is win -win for capital , and lose - lose for everyone else .
In 2006 the richest 1 percent of the U.S. population received their highest share of the nation ’s adjusted gross income in two decades , and maybe since the 1929 stock market crash , while their average tax rate fell to the lowest level in eighteen years or more ( Wall Street Journal , July 23 , 2008 ) .
Needless to say , the object of capital as a whole is to keep this game going as long as it can .
Is there an alternative for the world ?
Yes , but it is one that has to be created .

A mishap in the handling of the text resulted in a significant mistranslation of the interview of FARC spokesperson Rodrigo Granada published in our March 2008 issue .
This has now been corrected in the online version .
The final sentence in the second to last paragraph in the article should read :
Uribe would have kept in prison the prisoners to be released and would have embarked on a political campaign at home and abroad aiming to show that direct interventions henceforth would be the most appropriate way to secure the release of those being held by the FARC - EP .
Greg Palast ’s preface to the new Monthly Review Press book On the Global Waterfront : The Fight to Free the Charleston 5 by Suzan Erem and E. Paul Durrenberger states :
The entire story rides on a detective story .
We open on a scene with six hundred police in riot gear facing a few dozen angry - as - hell workers on the docks of Charleston .
In the darkness , rocks , clubs and blood fly .
Five union men arrested for conspiracy to riot .
Four blacks and one white .
The prosecutor : a white , Bible - thumping Attorney General running for Governor and a city ripped in half — union / non- union , white / black .
The movers and shakers versus the moved and shaken … .
[ T ]he fight to free the Charleston 5 shows how courage , heart , and solidarity can lead to victory in the midst of a mad march into globalization that threatens to turn us all into the Wal - Mart 5 Billion .

I remember back in the day , before we could pick what part of the video to go to ..
I 'd watch this on repeat for that few seconds of Rebecca getting banged .
Gooooood times .
The hacker who obtained Sarah Palin 's personal email covered his tracks using proxy servers from CTunnel.com .
Some of the screenshots he posted show Web address starting with CTunnel.com and ending with codes that could ultimately get him caught .
That scenario seems particularly likely given that the webmaster behind the proxy servers is all but begging law - enforcement authorities to request his records , since he believes the Palin hacker abused his service .
As quoted in the Register , the webmaster practically draws the Feds a map :
To prevent abuse of the service - such as the occasional bomb threat or other illegal act that 's been known to happen - [ webmatser Gabriel ]
Ramuglia logs each user 's IP address , along with the time and web destination .
That often is n't enough to track down people who access extremely popular websites .
But in this case , the perpetrators included a whole string of random - looking characters when posting screenshots of Palin 's hacked account .
That will probably be enough for him to pinpoint the proverbial needle in the haystack .
" ... I should be able to find that in my log . "
This will only help catch the hacker if he did n't do something else to mask his identity , like use a second anonymizing service .
And if the hacker really is from the relatively experienced Church of Scientology antagonists at Anonymous , it seems unlikely he was that sloppy .

The BJ ’s Wholesale Club destined for the Red Hook waterfront might be part of a six - level shopping plaza with several other stores and even some residential units , The Brooklyn Paper has learned .
Documents obtained by The Paper reveal that developer Joe Sitt wants to renovate a historic warehouse on the former Revere sugar refinery site ; erect several new buildings for shopping , parking and housing ; and create — by 2011 — a 40 - feet - wide public esplanade along the water ’s edge of the Beard Street property next door to the recently opened Ikea .
While Sitt ’s company , Thor Equities , said it has not reached a deal with BJ ’s and would not comment about the “ request for proposals ” that Sitt issued this summer , if the plans are still current and the city approves a zoning change to allow commercial and residential development , the project would make Red Hook one of the borough ’s major big box retail destinations .
The documents , which were part of a package to solicit bids from architects to build the shopping plaza , sought proposals “ to maximize commercial retail square - footage ” of at least 400,000 square feet — more than 14 percent larger than Red Hook ’s Ikea .
The latest RFP builds on earlier versions of the plan that have circulated since Sitt bought the site in 2005 for $ 40 million .
Red Hook residents who fought tooth and nail against Ikea are delaying judgment on this newer retail project .
“ Caution is the code word for the day , ” said John McGettrick of the Red Hook Civic Association .
“ I have many more questions than I have answers [ about Thor ’s plans ] . ”
For others , opposition is in full bloom .
“ A waterfront is our most - limited land resource , so I think this is not the right place [ for such a project ] , ” said John Quadrozzi , who owns the nearby Gowanus Industrial Park , a waterfront manufacturing site .
This story was updated at 12:30 pm on Friday , Sept. 26 , adding a comment from Thor Equities denying a deal had been struck with BJ’s .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Two NATO helicopters fired upon by Pakistani forces on Thursday were U.S. military aircraft operating inside Afghanistan , the Pentagon said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ They were U.S. helicopters , ” Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters at a briefing .
“ The flight path of the helicopters at no point took them over Pakistan . ”
A Pakistani military spokesman said the helicopters had crossed the border into Pakistani territory , while Pakistan ’s president , Asif Ali Zardari , denied troops had shot at the helicopters , insisting that only warning flares had been fired .
Zardari , speaking to reporters in New York with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , said the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan was often unclear , a comment Rice agreed with , saying “ yes , the border is very , very unclear . ”
Whitman said U.S. and NATO military officials were speaking to their Pakistani counterparts to determine what had happened and to ensure there would be no recurrence .
“ This is an unfortunate incident .
It just goes to demonstrate the importance of coordination along that border , ” he said .
“ The Pakistanis have to provide us with a better understanding of why this took place . ”
Citing early reports , Whitman said neither helicopter was hit by ground fire and did not return fire against Pakistani positions .
Officials said the aircraft would likely have fired back had they been hit .
“ We avoided a serious incident , ” Whitman said , but added : “ The incident is troubling , no doubt ” .
Frustrated by an intensifying Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan , the United States has stepped up attacks on militants inside Pakistan with six missile attacks and a helicopter - borne ground assault this month .
Pakistan strongly condemned the raids and said it would not tolerate any infringement on its territory .
The Pakistani army has vowed to stand up to aggression across the border .
Since the September 3 U.S. commando raid in South Waziristan , there have been reports of two other incidents in which Pakistani forces were said to fire on U.S. helicopters crossing the border .
In both cases , U.S. officials have denied the reports .
The Pakistani military also said it recovered a pilotless aircraft that crashed in South Waziristan this week .
A Pakistani security officer described it as a U.S. aircraft that tribesmen claimed to have shot down .
The Pentagon denied that any U.S. drones had been lost .
These days , green living is a hot topic .
Scan the pages of a range of publications , and you ’ll see stories about how people and businesses are working to save water , save energy , and generally save the Earth .
But what you do n’t always hear about is what else they ’re saving : cold , hard cash .
Too often , it seems like making your life greener means spending more , like loading up your cart with organic produce at Whole Foods or shelling out big bucks for hemp - fiber blue jeans .
But that need n’t be the case .
One of the best ways to be more eco-friendly is to cut back on your use of energy and natural resources — which cost money .
In taking steps to protect the environment , you can protect your wallet as well .
Saving Electricity
Anything that saves energy also saves cash .
According to the Energy Information Administration , the average cost of electricity across the United States is 12.7 cents per kilowatt - hour ( kWh ) .
A kilowatt - hour is the amount of energy you use when you run a 1,000 - watt appliance , such as an electric space heater , for one hour .
So every hour you keep that space heater turned off puts another 13 cents in your pocket .
It may not sound like much , but all those 13 - cent savings can add up to real money .
If you ran that space heater for four hours per day throughout December , January , and February , it would cost you $ 46.44 by the time March rolled around .
So even changes that look small can make a big difference .
Big changes , such as investing in more energy - efficient appliances , can make an even bigger difference in the years to come .
Use Energy - Efficient Light Bulbs
Energy - efficient light bulbs are a classic example of an eco-friendly product that costs some money upfront but saves lots more money over the long run .
Suppose an old 60 - watt incandescent bulb burns out in your bedside lamp .
You ca n’t buy another cheap incandescent bulb to replace it because the new efficiency standards for lighting have pushed them out of the market .
So you go down to the home center and find three choices :
Eco-Incandescent Light Bulbs .
These more efficient incandescents cost about $ 7 for a pack of four or $ 1.75 per bulb .
They last 0.9 years and use 53 watts of energy .
Compact Fluorescent Lamps ( CFLs ) .
These cost a bit more — about $ 8 for four , or $ 2 per bulb .
But they also last 9.1 years and use just 14 watts of energy .
LED Bulbs .
These cost the most upfront at roughly $ 9 for four , or $ 2.25 apiece .
But they also last the longest — an amazing 22 years — while using only 9 watts of energy .
At a glance , it looks like the LED bulb is the most expensive .
But you do n’t need to replace it for the next 22 years .
Over that entire period , if you use it three hours per day , it burns roughly 217 kWh — less than 10 kWh per year .
That costs you about $ 28.20 .
Add the $ 2.25 you paid for it , and the bulb ’s total cost for the 22 years comes to $ 30.45
The CFL bulb lasts less than half as long , so over that same 22 - year period , you need to replace it twice .
That means you spend more on the bulbs themselves , at $ 4 total .
On top of that , the energy they use comes to 337 kWh , which costs you about $ 43.80 .
That brings their total 22 - year cost up to $ 47.80 — significantly more than the LED .
If you choose the eco-incandescent bulbs , you need to buy 24 of them over 22 years , spending $ 42 on the bulbs alone .
And that cost is dwarfed by their energy use : a whopping 1,277 kWh ( 58 kWh per year ) for $ 166 .
In total , these bulbs burn through $ 208 in 22 years .
They ’re more efficient than your old burnt - out incandescent , but compared with the LED bulbs or even the CFLs , they ’re no bargain .
Buy Energy - Efficient Appliances
Replacing a major appliance costs a lot more than replacing a light bulb , but it also offers a bigger payoff in the long run .
Because most appliances use far more energy than a light bulb , cutting out even a fraction of that energy use can make a major dent in your electricity bill .
A refrigerator is a good example .
The Energy Star website has a handy tool for calculating how much you can save by replacing an old , inefficient fridge with a new one that carries the Energy Star label .
For instance , if you have a 20 - year - old , 20 - cubic - foot fridge with a freezer on top , the site estimates it uses 1,031 kWh per year .
At the average national rate , that old beast of a machine is costing you $ 131 a year to run .
Now suppose you upgrade to a new Energy - Star - rated refrigerator of about the same size .
Your new fridge uses only 576 kWh each year — a little more than half as much as your old one .
Making the switch shaves $ 73 per year off your electric bill .
Of course , replacing your old fridge is n’t cheap .
A large , Energy - Star - rated top - freezer refrigerator costs about $ 1,000 .
At that rate , your new fridge will take over 14 years to pay for itself in energy savings .
However , if your old fridge is on its last legs and you need to replace it anyway , choosing an Energy Star model is a good bet .
Similar refrigerators without the Energy Star label cost almost as much and use at least 10 % more energy .
A quick way to compare the energy costs of two different models is to look at their yellow EnergyGuide labels .
These show how much electricity the appliances use and estimate how much per year they cost to run .
With this information , you can quickly figure out which model will cost you less over the long term .
Install Solar Panels
This one is a really big investment , but it has the potential for big savings .
Exactly how big depends on several factors , including where you live , how much sunlight hits your roof each day , how much electricity you use now , and how much you ’re paying for that electricity .
Fortunately , there ’s an easy way to do the math .
Just check out a solar calculator , like the one on the EnergySage Solar Marketplace , and answer a few simple questions about your location and energy use .
In a few minutes , you ’ll have an estimate of how much a solar array will cost you and how much it can save you over 20 years .
For example , when I entered my information into this solar calculator , it told me I could buy a solar setup that would meet all my energy needs for about $ 3,600 .
That ’s the net cost after a tax credit that would pay for 26 % of the total .
The site said the system would pay for itself in 4.2 years and would save me $ 10,000 over its 20 - year lifetime .
If you ca n’t afford to invest thousands of dollars upfront , there are other ways to go solar .
You can take out a low - interest loan to pay for the solar panels or lease the system from the solar company .
However , you probably wo n’t save as much this way as you will by buying the system outright .
My estimate at EnergySage said I ’d only save $ 8,300 over 20 years with a loan and $ 1,700 with a lease .
Saving Gas
According to an Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) calculator , the average passenger vehicle in the U.S. travels 12,480 miles in a year at 21.4 miles per gallon , using 583 gallons of gasoline .
This produces the equivalent of 11,807 pounds ( 5.26 metric tons ) of CO2 .
It would take about 34 trees to remove that amount of CO2 from the atmosphere , according to the carbon calculator at Carbonify .
While taking your car off the road may not be practical , there are many ways to cut down the number of miles you drive it .
Some include :
Making more trips on foot , by bike , or on public transportation
Combining errands into a single car trip instead of making several shorter trips
Joining a carpool
If you live fairly close to your workplace , biking to work can be a great way to save gas and get exercise .
Suppose your daily commute is 5 miles each way and your car has a fairly average fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon .
For each day you bike to work , you ’ll save 0.4 gallons of gasoline .
Gas costs an average of $ 2.25 per gallon as of March 2020 , so biking to work will save you about $ 0.56 per day on gas .
This may not sound like much , but it adds up over time .
Biking to work just twice a week throughout the year puts an extra $ 54 in your pocket — and even more if gas prices are higher than the national average where you live .
It also saves 41.6 gallons of gasoline , keeping 0.37 metric tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere .
And the money you save on gas is the tip of the iceberg .
Driving fewer miles also reduces wear and tear on your car , saving you money on maintenance .
All told , the Internal Revenue Service estimates that every mile you drive costs you about $ 0.575 .
That means your 10 - mile round - trip commute actually saves you $ 5.75 per day , or $ 598 per year .
An added bonus of biking to work is the healthy , open - air exercise .
If you do it regularly , your daily commute can take the place of a gym membership , saving you another $ 50 or so each month , or an additional $ 600 per year .
Saving Trees
According to the EPA , Americans use about 67 million tons of paper and paperboard every year .
About 73 % of that is recycled or burned for energy , but that still leaves over 18 million tons of paper per year cluttering up landfills .
Fortunately , a few quick tricks can cut out a big chunk of your paper use — and the costs that go with it .
Switch to Cloth Napkins
A packet of 400 paper napkins costs about $ 15 on Amazon .
If you use one napkin at each meal , the packet lasts 133 days , so a year ’s supply costs about $ 41 .
By contrast , you can buy a dozen cloth napkins on Amazon for only $ 9 ( including shipping ) and use them for years .
However , cloth napkins also make more laundry .
Tossing them in the laundry after every use gives you 21 napkins to wash every week .
Amy Dacyczyn , the author of “ The Complete Tightwad Gazette , ” calculates that it takes about 200 napkins to make one full load of laundry .
That means one napkin per meal adds up to about 10 extra loads of laundry per year .
How much will those 10 loads cost ?
According to the laundry calculator developed by Michael Bluejay , also known as “ Mr. Electricity , ” the cost of one load of laundry ranges from $ 0.32 to $ 1.34 , depending on the type of washer you have , the water temperature , the detergent you use , and how you dry your clothes .
That means your total cost for the extra laundry could be anywhere from $ 3.20 to $ 13.40 per year .
However , you can cut this cost by using the same napkin several times .
If you do n’t happen to spill something on it or use it to wipe away a sticky sauce , a napkin can stay clean for several meals .
If you wash two napkins each week instead of 21 , you only need to do about one extra load of laundry per year instead of 10 .
Even at the highest price of $ 1.34 per load , that ’s a savings of over $ 30 the year you buy your cloth napkins .
For future years , the savings jump to over $ 39 .
What about the number of trees saved by switching to cloth ?
For a single person , it ’s not very many .
However , small changes add up to big changes when a lot of people make them .
According to Norwex , a manufacturer of eco-friendly products , if every household in the U.S. eliminated 70 paper towels or napkins , it would save more than 540,000 trees .
Read Online News Sites
Not so long ago , a newspaper was one of the only ways you could stay up to date on daily news .
But today , more and more people are choosing to read the newspaper online .
A 2018 Pew Research survey found that only 16 % of Americans now get their news from print newspapers — less than half the number who read online news sites .
One reason for the growing popularity of online news is the price .
Some newspapers , such as The Wall Street Journal , charge almost as much for digital - only access as they do for home delivery .
However , most newspapers are much cheaper to read online .
The New York Times .
Daily delivery of the Times costs $ 10 per week , or $ 520 per year .
A digital subscription to NYTimes.com and the NYTimes smartphone app costs $ 5 for the first four weeks and $ 4.25 a week after that .
That ’s just $ 208 for the first year — less than half the price of print .
Switching to digital saves you $ 312 per year .

The Washington Post .
Print delivery of the Post is available only in the Washington , D.C. metro area .
A print - plus - digital subscription costs $ 4 per week for the first 12 weeks and $ 14.70 per week after that .
That comes to $ 636 for the first year .
You can save by paying for a full year in advance , but it still costs $ 200 .
A digital - only subscription costs only $ 29 per year , and an extra $ 10 per year gets you a second subscription to share with a friend plus unlimited downloads of e-books by Post journalists .
Switching to digital saves anywhere from $ 161 to $ 607 per year .

USA Today .
A print - plus digital subscription costs $ 10 per month for the first three months and $ 30 a month after that , or $ 300 a year .
An ad - free digital subscription costs only $ 5 per month , or $ 60 a year , for a savings of $ 240 .
According to Slate , it takes about 12 trees to produce 1 ton of newsprint , which is equivalent to 280,000 pages .
A Sunday paper has around 172 pages , and a daily paper might use half as much .
That means a year ’s subscription to a newspaper contains about 36,000 pages .
If 100 readers cancel their print subscriptions and switch to online news sources , it saves about 150 trees .
Use Less Office Paper
The idea of the paperless office has been around for decades , but it ’s far from a reality .
In fact , the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates a typical office worker goes through 350 pounds of office paper per year .
Even if you ca n’t do much about overall paper use at your workplace , you can reduce the amount of office paper you use personally .
Here are a few strategies to try :
File Electronically .
When you receive a document for work , do you automatically print it out and file it ?
Printing out just one 10 - page document each week adds up to 520 pages , or over one ream of paper , per year .
That ’s about 6 % of a tree , according to Conservatree .
If every worker in a 170 - person office started filing documents in electronic form instead , that office would save ten trees each year .
And since each ream of paper costs about $ 5 , the office would also save about $ 850 per year on paper alone .

Choose E - Bills .
A 2018 survey by Consumer Action found between 45 % and 74 % of Americans still prefer to receive their bills in paper form .
Between credit cards , cable , cellphone , landline , and other utilities , a person can receive as many as 10 such bills in a month .
Assuming each bill weighs about 1 ounce , including the bill itself , envelope , and enclosures , opting in to receive and pay all your bills electronically could save about 7.5 pounds of paper each year .
It would also save you $ 66 per year in postage for the 10 $ 0.55 stamps you would no longer be using each month .

Use Direct Deposit .
Paper paychecks use less paper than bills , but they still add up over time .
Having paychecks mailed to you every other week uses up about 0.4 pounds of paper each year .
Switching to direct deposit saves you 26 trips to the bank .
It also gets the money into your account faster , so you can use it right away .

Cut the Catalogs .
According to CNBC , Americans received about 9 billion paper catalogs in 2017 — roughly 27 for each person in the country .
If each catalog weighs about 5 ounces , then those 9 billion catalogs add up to 1.4 million tons of paper per year .
Conservatree estimates it takes eight trees to make just 1 ton of catalog paper .
If 10 % of Americans canceled all their catalog deliveries and ordered online instead , it would save over 1 million trees .
Final Word
Of course , there are lots of reasons to choose a greener life , aside from the money it saves .
For many people — myself included — the biggest benefit is knowing we ’re doing all we can to prevent a major global warming catastrophe .
We also care about preserving natural resources , such as water and forests , for future generations .
But I ’ll admit it : I feel especially good about my green choices when I know they ’re putting money in my wallet as well .
What are your favorite green - living strategies ?
Do they save you money ?
Last night I attended a reading in Downtown Brooklyn from Danica McKellar - aka Winnie Cooper 's - new book , Kiss My Math : Showing Pre-Algebra Who 's Boss .
Having lost a rather undignified tussle for the last seat with a little boy , I sullenly took my place behind the 30 or so chairs , which were filled with a mixture of earnest - looking teachers ( the event was filed under " education " ) , excited kids and creepy Wonder Years fans .
" This is a book signing , " reminded posters all over the store .
" Absolutely no pictures , merchandise or memorabilia will be signed during the event . "
Tables held stacks of the actress - turned - mathematician 's books , the bestselling Math Does n't Suck : How to Survive Middle - School Math without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail ( now in paperback ) and the new one , aimed at slightly older girls .
Both books featured a sassy - looking McKellar and a teen - mag aesthetic .
( " Do You Pick Supportive Friends ?
Take This Quiz ! " and " What Guys Really Think About Smart Girls ! " )
When I paged through I saw headings like , " Can a guy be too cute ?
The Function Graph " and " When He Does n't Call Back : Factorials . "
" I'm a middle - school teacher , " said one young woman , " and I really want to get girls more involved . "
" I just think she 's hot , " said a creepy nerd in his mid-thirties .
McKellar , when she stepped up , looked exactly like Winnie Cooper .
Attired in a fitted purple jersey dress and gold hoop earrings , it was hard to believe she was 33 - which is , I guess , the point .
She had a bubbly , girlish speaking style and a SoCal intonation and peppered her speech with " hecks " and " goshes . "
" I was scared of math , " she began frankly , explaining she did n't see herself as fitting the stereotype of the math nerd and doubting her early successes .
" When a girl fails at math , it 's like confirmation of what she already believes about herself . "
McKellar explained that she wants to show that math is for everyone , " that you can be that girly girl who wears four - inch heels and is good at math " - and that " being smart does n't make you a nerd , whatever that even means ! "
Math , she said , " is like exercise for your mind , " and useful in more contexts than most girls understand .
" If you want to open a cute little boutique ?
You 're going to need math !
I even have a section on unexpected careers that require math , like designing , " she said .
Despite McKellar 's enthusiasm , the audience - with the exception of one elderly man with a none - too - clean iron - gray ponytail who guffawed indiscriminately throughout - remained stony - faced .
( " Do you remember math tests ? " she asked confidentially at one point .
Silence .
" Well , I sure do ! " she continued pluckily . )
The reading portion , because it's a math text , was necessarily brief .
Then , of course , questions .
" I'm a teacher , " said the first speaker .
" Are you going to continue with the series and do pre-calc , calculus and trig , too ? " McKellar said she might .
" I 'm also a teacher , " said the next .
" And I 'm already seeing girls feeling really discouraged by seventh grade .
" " I'm a middle - school teacher , too , " said a third .
" are you going to be doing any speaking at schools ? "
A guy asked if she was encouraged by the recent reports that girls were as good at math as boys .
" Those statistics are nothing new , " said McKellar heatedly .
" It 's not a question of ability ; girls just do n't see themselves as able to compete at a high level . "
Someone asked about her speech before Congress for funding for scholarships for women .
" The truth is , scholarships are n't the problem , really , " said McKellar .
" By college , it 's too late - women do n't think of themselves as mathematicians , end of story .
They 're not applying for those scholarships . "
" Do n't you think it 's unfair to be focusing on girls when kids across the board are struggling with math ? " asked one guy aggressively .
" Well , lots of boys read the book , " said McKellar defensively .
She went on to say that textbooks had always been geared towards a male sensiblity , so this was more about redressing a balance .
" When is The Wonder Years coming out on DVD ? " demanded an old man with a mustache and a Nascar cap .
McKellar very graciously replied that she did n't know but that " I 've heard there are bootlegs out there , but they 're illegal . "
As the customers lined up , marshaled strictly by the B&N employees , to have their books signed , I heard an 11 - year - old girl say , shyly , " I like your book .
It made math fun . "
McKellar beamed with pleasure .
At that same moment , I noticed a group of young guys pass by the picture window in front of which the actress and math genius was standing and give her rear end a thorough and unabashed once - over .
The two things , combined , seemed like a pretty good window into the one - time Maxim model 's life .
Kiss My Math , indeed .

To understand how new industrial technology will impact employees , a team from Intel 's Internet of Things Group conducted a study to find out what workers from the factory floor to the boardroom can expect in the intelligent factory of the future .
Led by Dr. Irene Petrick , industrial innovation director , and Dr. Faith McCreary , principal engineer and researcher , the global study involved interviewing 145 employees working in industrial manufacturing – including petrochemical , metal fabrication , and food and beverage companies with factories , primarily in North America .
" Current manufacturers who are considering new digital implementations need to think not just about the technology piece , but also about their workforce , ” said Petrick , an internationally recognized expert in strategic road mapping and innovation .
“ It 's not just about the numbers of jobs that are changed .
It 's about the types of jobs , and their needs .
It 's the co-evolution of technology and people in the factory . ”
Upgrading to Industry 4.0
Industry 4.0 — a term that refers to the digital transformation of manufacturing , business and society — ushers in the fourth industrial revolution where advances in technology combine the physical , digital and biological worlds , according to the World Economic Forum .
The foundation for this modern industrial revolution is the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT ) , which enables continuous data exchange — from the production robot to inventory management to the microchip , according to Hannover Messe , the German industrial trade show that coined the term Industry 4.0 .
Using automated robotics , artificial intelligence ( AI ) , cloud computing , sensors and data analytics , these smart factories connect all production and logistics processes together , making manufacturing more intelligent , efficient , and sustainable .
McCreary and Petrick found that employees both welcome and worry about the intelligent factory of the future .
“ There 's an incredible appetite for change , and it comes at all levels in the company , " said Petrick .
But , she noted , there ’s an understanding gap in how to integrate smart technology with existing systems .
Some workers even had magical thinking around how these smart technologies actually work , demonstrating a lack of concrete understanding of the underlying technologies that need to come together to create a cohesive solution .
Putting in a new machine or upgrading one in place may not be enough .
Many manufacturers still need to explore how to take the critical next step of creating a new communications infrastructure with greater bandwidth to actually collect , connect , and analyze data , Petrick said .
" It 's more complex than just , ‘ I have this great new machine , ’ " said Petrick .
" It takes a combination of technology upgrades to achieve the true benefit . "
Once data is gathered , it needs to be analyzed and used .
Ultimately , the study found that industrial employees recognize that data should drive decision - making , and there should be data scientist - like thinking by workers at all levels in the smart factory .
“ They 're making a very practical decision to say , ‘ How can we put data at the heart of our organization , ’ as opposed to saying , ‘ We ’re taking the data out and handing it to data scientists , and somehow then we 'll make decisions about our factory , ’ ” said McCreary .
Intelligent Factories Focus on Quality
Companies have a wide range of digital adoptions available .
In many of those scenarios , human beings do most of the work .
In highly digital companies , however , those same workers are connected to automated processes .
The intelligent factory goes beyond that , with IIoT devices and analytics autonomously making decisions and optimizing processing without much human intervention .
A company ’s motivation for adding technology depends on its current level of digital intensity , which surprised the researchers .
McCreary said companies that are currently at a low level of digitization are motivated by how much time it takes to do a particular task .
In semi-automated companies , where both people and machinery work together , it ’s about productivity .
However , in high digital - intensity businesses , " when they start to talk about the leap to the intelligent factory , it becomes about quality , " McCreary said .
" That actually was a surprise , ” Petrick said .
“ We would have all thought it ’s about efficiency , efficiency , efficiency , and that 's all it 's ever going to be .
Our results suggest that there 's more nuance there at the upper levels of digital intensity . "
Workers at low - to high - digital intensity factories all expressed concerns about skill gaps with the adoption of new technologies , especially at companies with little digitalization , the study found .
Employees who embrace technology and coming changes are often motivated by the desire to adapt as a way to stay relevant and employable over the long - term .
Future Intelligent Factories
While smart technology is rapidly evolving , Industry 4.0 technologies are not yet on the radar for many manufacturers .
Seventy - eight percent of the manufacturers surveyed use computers in their operations and 32 percent discussed how they deploy robots on the factory floor .
Many employees surveyed wanted more and expressed interest in using some 4.0 technologies to solve today ’s problems , which they described mostly as process challenges and improvements to particular tasks , not large - scale manufacturing transformation .
" When taking the journey to the intelligent factory , we must be able to translate the grand vision into changes that workers care about , namely solving the problems they face today , " said McCreary .
The worst possible future state ?
No change from the way things work today .
This thought was expressed across the board by study participants .
Industrial workers expect and want fundamental shifts in the nature of their work , with many employees expressing hope that technology will take over onerous tasks .
“ It 's not just the factory that ’s transforming .
It 's the roles in the organization , and the people within it , ” said McCreary .
Creating the factory of the future , it turns out , is n’t just about automation using smart machines .
It ’s about the complete transformation of the workplace .

In this region of Africa , saltwater from the Red Sea will flood the area , and localized earthquakes continue to affect those who dare to live anywhere near this region .

According to a new international study , the United States has the highest rates of pot and coke use , followed by New Zealand .
The other 15 countries surveyed by the World Health Organization did n't even come close .
Approximately 42.4 percent of those surveyed in the US say they 've used marijuana , with 20.2 percent admitting to having tried the drug by age 15 .
From Alternet :
The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy tried to dismiss the study , Bloomberg News reported :
Trying to find a link between drug use and drug enforcement does n't make sense , said Tom Riley , spokesman for the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy in Washington .
" The U.S. has high crime rates but we spend a lot on law enforcement and prison , " Riley said yesterday in a telephone interview .
" Should we spend less ?
We 're just a different kind of country .
We have higher drug use rates , a higher crime rate , many things that go with a highly free and mobile society . "
Funny , ONDCP takes precisely the opposite line whenever a state considers liberalizing its marijuana laws .
In a March press release , deputy Drug Czar Scott Burns railed against a New Hampshire proposal to decriminalize marijuana , saying such a move " sends the wrong message to New Hampshire 's youth , students , parents , public health officials and the law enforcement community , " and would lead to " more drugs , drug users and drug dealers on their streets and communities . "
CREDIT Hedi Slimane or blame him .
The type of men Mr. Slimane promoted when he first came aboard at Dior Homme some years back ( he has since left ) were thin to the point of resembling stick figures ; the clothes he designed were correspondingly lean .
The effects of his designs on the men ’s wear industry were radical and surprisingly persuasive .
Within a couple of seasons , the sleekness of Dior Homme suits made everyone else ’s designs look boxy and passé , and so designers everywhere started reducing their silhouettes .
Then a funny thing happened .
The models were also downsized .
Where the masculine ideal of as recently as 2000 was a buff 6 - footer with six - pack abs , the man of the moment is an urchin , a wraith or an underfed runt .
Nowhere was this more clear than at the recent men’s wear shows in Milan and Paris , where even those inured to the new look were flabbergasted at the sheer quantity of guys who looked chicken - chested , hollow - cheeked and undernourished .
Not altogether surprisingly , the trend has followed the fashion pack back to New York
Was n’t it just a short time ago that the industry was up in arms about skinny models ?
Little over a year ago , in Spain , designers were commanded to choose models based on a healthy body mass index ; physicians were installed at Italian casting calls ; Diane von Furstenberg , the president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America , and Anna Wintour , the editor of Vogue , called a conference to ventilate the issue of unhealthy body imagery and eating disorders among models .
According to the report cited by the Globe and Mail newspaper , the troops were forced to abandon a counter attack when the weapons on their vehicles ran out of ammunition only 90 minutes into the battle .
One French platoon had just one radio , which was quickly knocked out , leaving them powerless to call for reinforcements .
The Ohio Republican Party spearheaded a lawsuit Friday over a directive from the office of Democratic Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner that would allow some early voters to register and vote on the same day .
The suit , filed by two Ohio voters in the Supreme Court of Ohio , in Columbus , ramps up the battle over voting procedures in a critical swing state with 20 electoral votes .
But the parties ' roles are reversed from the 2004 election .
This time , a Democrat is setting the rules , and the state Republican Party is charging ...
Li-On , Israel
ISRAEL will almost surely attack Iran ’s nuclear sites in the next four to seven months  and the leaders in Washington and even Tehran should hope that the attack will be successful enough to cause at least a significant delay in the Iranian production schedule , if not complete destruction , of that country ’s nuclear program .
Because if the attack fails , the Middle East will almost certainly face a nuclear war  either through a subsequent pre-emptive Israeli nuclear strike or a nuclear exchange shortly after Iran gets the bomb .
It is in the interest of neither Iran nor the United States ( nor , for that matter , the rest of the world ) that Iran be savaged by a nuclear strike , or that both Israel and Iran suffer such a fate .
We know what would ensue : a traumatic destabilization of the Middle East with resounding political and military consequences around the globe , serious injury to the West ’s oil supply and radioactive pollution of the earth ’s atmosphere and water .
But should Israel ’s conventional assault fail to significantly harm or stall the Iranian program , a ratcheting up of the Iranian - Israeli conflict to a nuclear level will most likely follow .
Every intelligence agency in the world believes the Iranian program is geared toward making weapons , not to the peaceful applications of nuclear power .
And , despite the current talk of additional economic sanctions , everyone knows that such measures have so far led nowhere and are unlikely to be applied with sufficient scope to cause Iran real pain , given Russia ’s and China ’s continued recalcitrance and Western Europe ’s ( and America ’s ) ambivalence in behavior , if not in rhetoric .
Western intelligence agencies agree that Iran will reach the “ point of no return ” in acquiring the capacity to produce nuclear weapons in one to four years .
Which leaves the world with only one option if it wishes to halt Iran ’s march toward nuclear weaponry : the military option , meaning an aerial assault by either the United States or Israel .
Clearly , America has the conventional military capacity to do the job , which would involve a protracted air assault against Iran ’s air defenses followed by strikes on the nuclear sites themselves .
But , as a result of the Iraq imbroglio , and what is rapidly turning into the Afghan imbroglio , the American public has little enthusiasm for wars in the Islamic lands .
This curtails the White House ’s ability to begin yet another major military campaign in pursuit of a goal that is not seen as a vital national interest by many Americans .
America , we have reached the point of no return !
The government of the United States is about to embark on a course that will prove to be ruinous for our country .
This morning , Congress is jubilantly announcing a tentative agreement on the Wall Street bailout plan .
The plan , if approved this week by the full Congress and signed by the President , is a betrayal of the constitutional oath taken by our leaders .
It is a violation of the public trust and an extreme abuse of the fiduciary responsibilities that each member of Congress and the President has to the American people .
In short , any member of Congress who votes for the measure is guilty of treason and should be dealt with accordingly .
Why is voting for the plan a treasonable offense ?
One reason is because it gives enormous power to the Treasury Secretary , who is an unelected official .
He will have power to buy deeply distressed mortgage - backed securities and other bad debts held by banks and investment firms with taxpayer money .
This includes bad debts held by foreign banks that do business in the U.S.
So essentially , by approving the plan the Congress will be handing over $ 700 billion of taxpayer money to an unelected official and an imperial president .
The whole thing reeks of fascism .
In all of the debate over the bailout plan , no one ( except Ron Paul ) has questioned whether the move is constitutional .
Congressional leaders are ignoring the will of the people where polls indicate that only thirty percent of Americans approve of the legislation .
The Treasury Secretary and the President are being given extraordinary new powers to act as economic dictators .
And the federal government through the plan is again turning to public debt to stimulate the economy to presumably put us back on sound economic footing .
As this government induced crisis worsens , Washington is acting more and more like Italy under Mussolini than America under Jefferson .
Without question , it is a government induced crisis .
For nearly twenty years , Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Fed embarked on a policy of easy money – low interest rates and expanding money supply .
He became the parent who just could n't say no to the American people .
His policies as Fed chairman led to the dot com bubble and bust in the late 90s .
To stimulate the economy after 911 he lowered the federal funds rate to an unbelievable one percent !
The rate stayed there for a year and was increased slowly for the next three years after that .
Rates were low enough for a long enough period of time to cause severe misallocations in the economy .
Thus , the housing bubble was born .
Of course , it also took the absolute stupidity of many Americans to get into debts that they could not afford – a concept that seems to be an implied right of American citizenship which is expressed through laws like the Community Redevelopment Act .
Lastly , by sprinkling in some fraud by lenders and borrowers alike you have the recipe for the disaster that looms over us today .
So , what do our esteemed leaders propose to get out of this mess ?
They are proposing more of the same things that got us into this mess .
Passing a $ 700 billion bailout package is easy money to the politicians and says to the stupid and fraudulent that any mistakes or criminal actions you may have committed will be remedied by the deep pockets of the American taxpayer .
Congress will appropriate this money as if there will be no repercussions down the road .
This sounds very familiar to the mindset of Fed governors when they lowered rates to one percent .
Congress is also being as stupid as those Americans who got themselves into debt that they could n't afford .
The U.S. government does n't have $ 700 billion dollars to spend .
Hell , it does n't have $ 10 .
It has $ 9 trillion in debt on the books with at least another $ 50 trillion in future obligations like Social Security .
At some point soon , foreign countries will stop loaning the U.S. money .
Our currency will become worthless and our standard of living will deteriorate .
Yes , debt does matter whether you are a business , a family , or a huge government .
Lastly , fraud is a component part of our leaders ' proposal to get us out of this mess .
We are being told that this “ rescue ” plan is for Main Street not Wall Street .
We are being told that somehow putting up huge sums of taxpayer money to buy bad assets is the best answer to get out of the mess that deregulation of the financial industry caused .
The lies go on and on .
Make no mistake about it , the politicians will pass this plan to help their benefactors on Wall Street – those that have helped them get elected .
It is a fraudulent use of taxpayer money .
If not the politicians plan than what should be done to remedy the crisis ?
Immediately , the government should cease intervening in the crisis .
Let the market determine its own equilibrium .
Former private assets like Fannie and Freddie should be liquidated .
Government spending , especially military spending , should be reduced .
The budget should be balanced , taxes cut and regulations on businesses eliminated .
Any protectionist measures enacted by Uncle Sam should immediately be repealed .
In the area of foreign affairs , the U.S. should bring troops home from bases around the globe and stop riling up hostilities with Pakistan , Iran , North Korea , Russia , and Venezuela .
These moves would free up funds to be used at home where they are needed and not on high - risk , no gain military adventures .
In conclusion , any member of Congress who votes for the bailout package is betraying their constitutional oath , violating the public trust and abusing their fiduciary responsibility to the American people .
On November 4th they should be thrown out of office and not replaced with a clone from the other major party .
Instead , minor party candidates should be elected to return our government to “ We the People ” .
I urge all Americans to write letters to the editor , talk to community groups , friends and family , become involved in minor party candidate campaigns and vote your conscience .
The vicious cycle perpetrated on us by the politicians in Washington must end .
But it cannot end without the efforts of all of us .

37 - year - old company worker had stacked books two meters high in his room
Not -So -Daily Link of the Day : Miyagi Prefectural Police officials in northeastern Japan have announced on Monday that they discovered a man dead in his apartment underneath several hundred manga volumes and magazines .
They are investigating the cause of death and whether the 37 - year - old male company employee is another casualty of last week 's earthquake in Miyagi .
According to the investigation , the man 's co-workers visited his apartment in Sendai City 's Aoba Ward at around 9:00 p.m. on June 14 after he failed to appear at work .
( The magnitude - 6.8 earthquake occurred at 8:43 a.m. that day and caused 10 confirmed deaths so far . )
The officials say that the man stacked books two meters ( about six feet ) high throughout his entire room .
They consider it possible that the books fell on top of the man 's chest and abdomen and thus prevented him from breathing .
However , a June 15 autopsy was inconclusive , which left open the possibility that the man 's death was unrelated to the earthquake .
YouTube has moved to ban videos that incite violence following criticism in the UK and US that it needed to toughen its policies .
Google - owned YouTube has updated its community guidelines - specifically pointing out that a new addition is to make sure no videos " directly incite violence " .
" We realise it 's not always obvious where we draw the line on content that 's acceptable to upload , " said YouTube in a blog post .
" We 've updated the community guidelines … included in the update are a few new things to steer clear of , like not directly inciting violence . "
Within YouTube 's community guidelines section , the updated rules include two points on violent videos .
" Graphic or gratuitous violence is not allowed , " points out one guideline .
" If your video shows someone getting hurt , attacked or humiliated , do n't post it . "
The second relevant guideline highlighted as a " common sense rule " relates to hate speech .
" We encourage free speech and defend everyone 's right to express unpopular points of view , " states the rule .
" We do not permit hate speech ( speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin , religion , disability , gender , age , veteran status and sexual orientation / gender identity ) . "
YouTube was taken to task in the UK in July over its policing of the " dark side " of the internet by a culture , media and sport committee report looking at harmful content on the internet .
In a press briefing on the topic , committee chairman John Whittingdale criticised YouTube for not going far enough with proactive measures , beyond a pledge to take down material when it is " flagged " up by users .
He cited one specific example of " concern " that involved a video of what appeared to be a gang rape that was viewed around 600 times .
He said that YouTube was made aware of the content by a user but it was not taken down until a second warning came through .

Four American Christians are staging a sit -in at a Chinese airport , which they refuse to leave until the authorities return 315 Bibles they were trying to bring into the country .
The group - from Vision Beyond Borders - spent the night sleeping on couches at Kunming airport in southern Yunnan Province after customs officials removed the Chinese language bibles from their luggage .
The bibles were printed in Indonesia , transferred to Thailand and transported to Kunming in duffel bags by the Wyoming - based group which distributes bibles around the world .
Pat Klein , one of the members of the group , told reporters that he was bringing the books into China because his contacts in the Chinese Christian community were unable to get hold of sufficient copies .
Bibles are widely available in Chinese bookstores , though only versions and translations authorised by the authorities .
Although a nominally atheist country , China is home to a rapidly growing number of Christians .
A single domestic publisher - approved by the government - backed Christian association - claims to produce 8000,000 copies per month .
This makes it the largest Bible - publishing factory in the world , but the copies are printed under supervision for use at authorised churches and hotels .
Customs officers restrict imports of Bibles and other material deemed " harmful " to stability .
" I heard that there 's freedom of religion in China , so why is there a problem for us to bring Bibles ? "
Klein told the Associated Press .
The customs office in Kunming said it was " dealing with the issue " , but declined to comment further .
Religious in China has come under scrutiny since the start of the Olympics , partly because US president George Bush used his visit for the opening ceremony in Beijing to visit a church and to call for people to worship freely .
According to a human rights group , a Chinese Christian activist - Hua Huiqi - was detained by police and then escaped on his way to the same service .
Police deny detaining Hua .
Recently , I wrote about the low - profile Aerotecture wind turbines , which are designed to be installed on the rooftops of city buildings .
Now I ’ve heard of another rooftop wind turbine under development .
It ’s called the Helyx Wind Generator , and it ’s composed of two twisted wings of fiberglass that rotate around a vertical axis .
The turbine is also colored bright green , which I find quite appealing for some reason .
It was invented by Toby Kinkaid in Portland , Oregon , and Kinkaid says the turbine is especially designed to take advantage of low wind speeds .
You can see the turbine in action in these videos :
The 40 - inch tall turbines will soon be tested on the rooftops of several buildings at Portland State University , with the help of faculty and students .
The aim of the project is to see if the turbines will adequately harvest energy in an urban environment .
These test turbines will power 40 - watt generators and send out data over a wireless computer network telling researchers how efficient the devices are and whether they have a place in Portland State ’s active sustainable energy program .
Students and faculty members will measure the output of the generators at various places on the roofs , finding just the perfect windy spots for them .
Kinkaid estimates the devices can be mass produced for $ 1.50 per watt , meaning a 40 - watt machine would cost $ 60 , excluding installation .
He said the prototypes cost about $ 200 each because they ’re made one at a time , by hand .
Toby Kinkaid ’s company is Oregon Wind .

Aug. 18 , 2008 --
If you make it to your 92nd birthday , your odds of staying spry as you head toward the century mark may be better than you expect .
That news comes from a study of 2,262 Danish adults starting at age 92 .
Everyone born in 1905 in Denmark and still living there was invited to participate , whether they lived at home or in an institution and needed someone to help them take part in the study .
They were followed until they reached 100 .
The study was all about seeing whether exceptional longevity came with high levels of disability .
The short answer :
It did n't .
Extreme age did n't bring extreme disability , overall .
The elders did have a slight decline in their ability to perform routine activities , mental skills test scores , grip strength , and other measures , and fewer were independent at 100 than at 92 .
" Nonetheless , our finding also suggests that individuals who survive into the highest ages have a health profile that is similar in many aspects to that of individuals who are seven or eight years younger , " write the researchers , who included Kaare Christensen , MD , PhD , DMSc , of the Danish Aging Research Center at the University of Southern Denmark .
It 's not that no one got sick , slowed down , or died -- only 166 people were still enrolled in the study at age 100 .
It 's more that they did n't linger in what the researchers call a " frail ... vegetative state . "
" Even though individuals in this age range have an increased risk of disability for each additional year of life , the frailest and most disabled members of the cohort are those who are most likely to die at any given age , " explain Christensen and colleagues .
Their bottom line : " Most individuals can expect to experience physical decline before they die , but the postponement of this individual decline makes it possible for us to live into a fourth age " stretching toward 100 .
The study appears in this week 's online early edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The McCain / Palin GOP is already in the process of stealing the Ohio vote , as was done in 2004 .
Among those at the center of the GOP strategy is Bush Family computer operative Michael Connell , who programmed the key vote counting mechanisms that were used to give George W. Bush his second term .
Except for John Kennedy in 1960 , no candidate since 1856 ( James Buchanan ) has won the White House without carrying the Buckeye State .
No Republican has ever done it .
On October 27 , 2004 , we published " Twelve Ways Bush is Now Stealing the Ohio Vote " at www.FreePress.org .
Despite four years of denial by the Democratic Party and the corporate media , all methods mentioned in that article ( plus many more ) were used in the theft that gave George W. Bush his second term .
Much has now changed in Ohio , including the transition from a Republican Governor ( Robert Taft ) and Secretary of State ( J. Kenneth Blackwell ) to Democrats Ted Strickland and Jennifer Brunner .
Brunner has made strong public commitments to conducting a fair registration process , an orderly election and a reliable vote count this fall .
She is being pushed by the King - Lincoln - Bronzeville federal civil rights lawsuit , filed originally against Blackwell .
To help guarantee an election that truly reflects the will of the voters , Freepress.org will convene a conference on election protection procedures web - cast from Columbus this September 26 - 8 .
It will reinforce the positive steps Brunner has taken , and will help train poll workers and judges to safeguard the vote in Ohio and around the nation .
But much of the electoral apparatus remains beyond public control .
Serious questions remain about how reliable the final vote count will be , and how much of it the Republican party will cage , confuse and steal in its crusade to put John McCain and Sarah Palin into the White House .
Here are some of the key factors that still endanger the vote in Ohio and around the nation : 1) ILLEGAL DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE SURROUNDING THE VOTE COUNTIn a federal court decision delivered in August , 2006 , Judge Algernon Marbley ruled that all materials related to the 2004 presidential vote in Ohio must be preserved .
Standing federal law required that these materials be protected for 22 months dating from November 4 , 2004 .
In response to the King - Lincoln lawsuit , Marbley 's decision came in time to make it a federal offense to destroy any poll books , ballots and other records relating to the 2004 election in Ohio at any time .
Around the time of the decision , GOP Secretary of State Blackwell , who also served as Ohio co-chair of the 2004 Bush - Cheney campaign , issued ambivalent orders to the state 's 88 county Boards of Elections about preserving these materials .
Blackwell subsequently lost his 2006 campaign for governor of Ohio , and was replaced by Brunner as secretary of state .
Brunner publicly announced that she would establish a repository in Columbus for all 2004 election materials .
In accordance with the King - Lincoln lawsuit , a definitive recount would then establish what actually happened during the Bush re-election .
But in August of 2007 , Ohio Attorney - General Mark Dann informed the King - Lincoln attorneys that 56 of the 88 county Boards of Elections had illegally destroyed all or some of their records and ballots from 2004 .
No repository has been established for what remains , and no definitive recount is now possible .
Ironically , Florida Governor Jeb Bush did preserve materials from the 2000 election there from all but one of the counties in that state .
The materials are being held in a repository in Tallahassee .
But no such resource --- and no definitive recount --- will be possible in Ohio .
There have been no state or federal prosecutions for the illegal destruction of these materials .
Nor does there seem to be any guarantee similar destruction will not follow the 2008 election .
2 ) MASSIVE RESIDUAL ELIMINATION OF REGISTERED VOTERS :
In the run-up to the 2004 elections , GOP - controlled Boards of Elections in Ohio eliminated some 308,000 registered voters from the rolls used at the polls to determine whether or not citizens are eligible to vote .
The purges were conducted in heavily Democratic districts in Cuyahoga ( Cleveland ) , Lucas ( Toledo ) and Hamilton ( Cincinnati ) Counties .
The numbers of voters eliminated represented more than 5 % of the 5.4 million Ohioans who voted in 2004 .
The GOP also challenged the right of some 35,000 registered voters to cast ballots , based largely on letters the Republicans sent to voters which then came back undelivered , thus allowing them to claim the lack of a valid address .
Challenges were also issued to prevent thousands of ex-felons from voting , even though there is no state law disenfranchising them .
Overall , the removals far exceeded Bush 's official victory margin of less than 119,000 votes .
After the 2004 election , another 170,000 voters were eliminated in Franklin ( Columbus ) County , also now heavily Democratic .
Despite massive grassroots voter registration drives , those voters have never been restored to the registration lists .
None were notified when they were eliminated , and no public accounting has been made of exactly who was disenfranchised .
Parallel purges were used in Florida 2000 , and throughout the US in 2004 .
There is every reason to believe the GOP will repeat them in 2008 wherever possible .
3 ) RENEWED ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE ADDITIONAL REGISTERED VOTERS :
Throughout Ohio's 88 counties , GOP - controlled Boards of Elections have continued " caging " registered voters by sending them notices requiring that the post office return those that cannot be delivered .
A loophole in Ohio law allows partisan challengers to then demand that the names of those whose forms come back be eliminated from the voter rolls .
This practice has been used by the GOP throughout the nation to purge voter rolls in inner city precincts .
In many cases those removed are soldiers currently serving in Iraq .
The Advancement Project has notified Brunner that it will challenge any mass purges in Ohio 2008 .
For her part , Brunner has ruled that returned notices cannot be used as a basis for eliminating voters from the registration rolls .
She has further attempted to counter - act the purges by requiring that any registered voter fingered for removal be issued notice and given a pubic hearing by the purging BOE .
But the process remains intimidating for prospective voters --- especially the heavily - targeted list of those voting for the first time .
With sixty days left to election day , the on - going impact remains unclear .
4-5 ) RESISTING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO ABSENTEE BALLOTS WHILE RE-INTRODUCING CHAOS : Brunner and voting rights advocates want the Boards of Elections in all 88 Ohio counties to mail absentee ballots to all voters .
Previous restrictions on casting such ballots have been lifted .
Brunner has strongly supported the practice of making these paper ballots available throughout the state .
It would , among other things , help eliminate long lines at the polls , increase access for the infirm and disabled , and circumvent electronic voting machines , which her office has deemed to be easily corruptible .
" As we prepare for Election Day , " Brunner has said , " we are promoting clear , consistent , statewide standards for absentee voting .
Every Ohioan who requests an absentee ballot should have the same rights and responsibilities , " no matter what county they might be in .
Ohio's GOP leadership has made a loud public show of supporting this universal access to absentee ballots .
But the Republican - controlled legislature pointedly failed to authorize enough money to the Secretary of State 's office to pay for the full mailing .
In a stunning display of public cynicism , the GOP leadership has since told Brunner , in a non-binding promise , that she should just go ahead and order the local BOE 's to do the mailings .
The Legislature , they say , will then vote the additional money at some point in the future .
Brunner has refused to do this , pointing out that the potential shortfall would be in the millions , and that such an order --- in essence , an unfunded mandate --- might be illegal .
As a result , using a calculation based on per capita postage rates , she has informed every BOE how much state money they can expect .
She is encouraging those that have the additional money in their budgets to do the mailings on their own .
The GOP - sponsored shortfall has thus introduced chaos into what should have been the orderly , manageable process of providing every Ohioan with a paper ballot prior to election day .
As it now stands , some counties will be mailing absentee ballots and others will not .
The uneven distribution is expected to favor GOP voters in better - funded rural and suburban districts .
Should problems arise as a result of this uneven distribution , the GOP will certainly blame Brunner .6 ) RESISTING SAME -DAY REGISTRATION AND VOTINGA loophole in a recently passed Ohio election law allows voters to register to vote and then cast an absentee ballot at the same time by coming in person to their Board of Elections between September 30 and October 6 .
Ironically , the loophole was accidentally inserted into an otherwise highly repressive bill by Republican State Senator KevinDewine , second cousin of the former US Senator Mike DeWine , who lost his seat in 2006 .
By allowing voters to cast absentee ballots as they register , they can avoid long election - day lines and the perils of electronic voting machines .
Furthermore , the only election ID required is the last four digits of the voter 's Social Security number .
The Ohio Republican Party has called on Brunner " to revoke a directive to allow residents to register to vote and cast an absentee ballot the same day . "
The GOP says her directive is illegal .
The party is expected to deploy a full attack on this provision that would otherwise allow thousands of Ohioans to participate in the process for the first time with relative ease and security .
7 ) THE PERSISTENT SPREAD OF ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINESIn addition to mass elimination of Democratic voters , a principle method of stealing the 2004 election in Ohio was through the manipulation of electronic voting machines .
Since then , the Ohio - based Diebold Company has admitted that its machines are vulnerable to manipulation and the dropping of significant numbers of votes .
Decertification and lawsuits involving Diebold and other electronic machines in California and elsewhere have proliferated .
Some 800,000 Ohio ballots --- representing about 15 % of the state 's vote --- were cast on Diebold machines in 2004 .
Additional votes were cast in Ohio and nationwide on machines made by ES&S , Hart Inner - Civic , Triad and others , all of whom have come under serious legal and legislative scrutiny .
Studies by the Brennan Center , Princeton University , the Carter - Baker Commission , the Government Accountability Office , the Conyers Committee and others , have all concluded that results coming from such machines can be easily manipulated , and election outcomes reversed , with just a few keystrokes .
A $ 1.5 million report to Brunner 's office concluded that electronic machines could easily have been used to steal the 2004 election in Ohio .
But because of the Help America Vote Act , authored by former Ohio Congressman Bob Ney ( just recently released from Federal prison ) , electronic voting machines will be in far greater use in Ohio and around the nation during the 2008 election than ever before .
The reinstatement of electronic voting machines has also been forced into effect in New York and elsewhere despite widespread attempts to require the use of paper ballots .
Without a massive influx of absentee ballots , voters in 54 of Ohio 's counties are likely to be forced to use touchscreen machines , with parallel increases nationwide .
This includes Ohio's largest city , Columbus , and other major urban center such as Dayton , Toledo and Youngstown .
In 2004 , the compiled tabulation of Ohio's electronic vote was deisgned for Secretary of State Blackwell by Michael Connell , a Bush family loyalist who programmed the Bush - Cheney web site in the 2000 election .
Connell directed the Ohio vote count to servers in a basement in Chattanooga , Tennessee , which also housed e-mail traffic for the White House .
Thousands of emails from Karl Rove and other key Bush Administration operatives have mysteriously disappeared from servers in this basement .
Many worked side - by - side with the Connell - designed ones to which Ohio 's official election results were outsourced , under supervision by Rove and Blackwell .
Like Rove , Connell now works for the McCain / Palin campaign .
An IT associate , Steve Spoonamore , himself a McCain supporter , has stated that Connell 's IT apparatus can be used to steal elections .
Attempts to force Connell to testify under oath have thus far been successfully resisted by the GOP .
Brunner has ordered a halt to some better - known e-voting abuses , such as " sleep overs " whereby electronic machines have been stored at the homes of poll workers prior to election day .
At the behest of attorneys working through the King - Lincoln lawsuit , other potential abuses in the electronic apparatus are being exposed and eliminated by Brunner .
She has issued the 2008 - 74 County Board of Elections Security and Risk Mitigation Plan which requires Boards of Elections to secure the machines and file plans that safeguard the hardware and software as well as establish chain of custody .
Her 2008 - 73 memorandum , concerning " Minimum Security Requirements of Vote Tabulation Servers , " mandates that " Each board of elections shall develop and / or maintain a policy for account and password management for granting access to the server and access to related workstations , if any , for its election system . "
The directive goes on to require that , " Each Board of Elections shall have a policy for maintaining sign - in documentation of server activity and related workstation activity ... " " We want Ohio 's voters and the rest of the nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment , ballots and supplies , " Brunner says .
" That begins with security practices at boards of elections and polling places , documented chain of custody , and now procedures to make secure voting machine delivery .
" But electronic touchscreen voting remains a black hole through which a close election could once again be stolen , in Ohio and throughout the nation .
8 ) RESIDUAL CHAOS FROM PRECINCT ELIMINATION AND MANIPULATIONIn the lead - up to Ohio 2004 , Blackwell eliminated numerous precincts where voters had cast their ballots for decades .
Consolidation was uneven .
Some 321 precincts have been shifted in Franklin County alone .
Blackwell admitted to a Congressional hearing that false , misleading and out - of - date information was posted on the state 's official web site , misdirecting thousands of voters to the wrong polling stations .
In many cases , they were then denied the right to vote altogether , or forced to cast provisional ballots which were never counted .
The chaos resulting from these precinct eliminations has not been entirely overcome .
For financial and other reasons , Brunner has not restored all the precincts to pre-Blackwell levels .
It is expected that her website will provide accurate information about precinct status and location .
But it 's likely some problems will persist .
9 ) DATA MININGEarly indications are that the Republicans are heavily involved in data mining .
Registered voters are already reporting strange letters from undisclosed senders or unidentified nonprofit organizations " welcoming " voters to the system .
As in 2004 , voters should expect a deluge of phone calls as well , telling them if they vote they 'll be arrested if they have outstanding parking and traffic tickets , back child support payments due , or are on parole , probation or reside in a halfway house .
None of these are legal grounds for disenfranchisement .
But we expect thousands of such calls will be made to keep first - time and uninformed voters away from the polls .
10 ) EXPANDED VOTER IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTSA
US
Supreme Court decision has upheld an Indiana law , drafted and passed by the GOP , requiring photographic identification for voter registration .
Because millions of young , poor , homeless , minority and elderly voters may not have voter ID , various state laws are expected to eliminate large numbers of mostly Democratic voters from casting ballots throughout the country .
In key swing states like Ohio , which now require ID other than signature to vote ( except by absentee ballot ) , the outcome of the election could be significantly affected .
Attempts by voter registration organizations to help such voters obtain suitable ID are proceeding .
But the law may still deprive crucial numbers of citizens their right to vote , and play a decisive role in the November 4 outcome .
Overall , there is no doubt that four years of intense public scrutiny , legal action and grassroots organizing have made the theft of the 2008 election in many ways a more difficult proposition .
Widespread training of poll workers , poll judges and independent observers ( including video teams ) will add to the safeguards available during the registration process , voting and vote count .
Should thousands of trained election protection activists committed to the democratic process come to the polls this year , it may prove impossible for the 2008 election to be stolen , as happened in 2000 and 2004 .
But the Supreme Court approval of photo identification requirements and the proliferation of electronic voting machines will prove serious challenges to a fair registration , voting and vote count process .
Given the number of ploys used by the GOP in Ohio and elsewhere in 2004 , it 's certain additional methods of election theft will surface this year that no one has seen before .
Unless they are effectively countered , there is little doubt that John McCain and Sarah Palin will follow George W. Bush and Dick Cheney into the White House .-- Bob Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman are co-authors of four books on the electoral process , including AS GOES OHIO : ELECTION THEFT SINCE 2004 , newly published at www.freepress.org and www.harveywasserman.com .

The other day I was enduring The Sex Education Show on Channel 4 , in which a self - consciously " liberated " presenter called Anna ran screeching around the place like a one - woman hen night , banging on about boobs and willies in a bid to " get Britain talking " about sex .
And the script essentially ran as follows :
" Hey , Britain !
Let 's all be honest and open , yeah ?
Penises !
There !
I said it !
Some are big , some are small !
Here 's a photo of one !
Are you shocked ?
You must n't be shocked !
Although it 's OK to be amused !
Tee hee !
Are n't we pushing back the boundaries ?
Is n't this healthy ?
Come on , we 're all adults .
This is good for us !
Celebrate it !
Vulva !
Wow !
Can you believe I just said that ?
Condom !
Orgasm ! Clitoris ! Etc ! "
Do n't get me wrong : I 'm all for snickering nob gags and frank images of nudity , but I 'd rather not have them accompanied by some tissue - thin justification about " healing the nation " or " getting people talking " .
Just tell us a joke , show us your bum and piss off .
Anyway , as luck would have it , Anna did show us her bum .
Sort of .
In a mirror .
While she was trying on lingerie , because this was a modern documentary , see ?
Just as in London you 're famously never more than 4ft from a rat , so in 21st - century factual entertainment shows the presenter is never more than four minutes from a pointless TV stunt .
Like trying on some frilly pants .
Or getting a bikini wax .
The bikini wax section caused me some anguish .
After braving a " full Hollywood " ( where they suddenly rip the whole lot clean away , like DLT having his face pulled off ) , Anna held a little chat with a studio audience , encouraging them to help heal broken Britain by loudly discussing their pubes .
Things were ticking along predictably - ie a 50 - 50 mix of words and chortling - when something upsetting happened .
They asked the men in the studio whether they trimmed their pubic hair , and almost every single one of them put their hands up .
Then they read out the results of a survey they 'd done , which claimed that , yes , 60 % of men trim their pubes .
What , really ?
60 % ? Huh ?
And then they asked the women in the studio if they preferred the male trimmed - pube look - and they all nodded like Churchill the car - insurance dog .
First I felt woefully out - of - touch .
Then I simply hated the world a little more .
And then an uneasy thought came over me .
If the majority of other men genuinely spend hours hoisting their scrotum over the bathroom sink with one hand , nail scissors in the other , meticulously snipping and pruning their man-bush into a tiny ornamental hedge , until their entire pubic region resembles a tranquil arboretum in miniature , albeit one with a cheerful bit of dick poking out of it , then maybe all my ex-girlfriends have been secretly revolted by my comparatively slovenly lower appearance .
Did they think I was some sort of wild hobo ?
I phoned one up and asked her .
" What the hell are you talking about ? " she asked .
I told her that according to something I 'd seen on telly , most men trim their pubes .
" Well , duh .
It was obviously bullshit , " she barked .
" Really ? "
" Really . "
Phew .
This was a relief .
Aside from the icky pubic - hair aspect of the whole thing , no one wants to feel like the odd one out .
I did n't want to be the sole dishevelled caveman in a world full of smooth , sculpted statues .
I thought I 'd missed a memo .
I 've missed memos before .
For instance I never bothered with scarves for years , because I could n't work out how you were meant to wrap them round your neck without the dangling ends getting in the way .
And then about two years ago someone showed me the method whereby you fold the scarf in half and poke the end through the loop and - hey presto - it all stays neatly in place .
Wow , I thought .
Everyone else has known this for years , and I 've just found out now !
I bought a couple of scarves to celebrate , and smugly paraded around in them like a child who'd just learned to tie his own laces .
And then a few weeks later I was sitting ( uncharacteristically scarfless ) with a friend having a drink , when she suddenly pointed at someone walking past the window in a scarf , and scowled , " God !
Why is everybody suddenly wearing their scarves that way , as if they 're at university ?
They look like such tossers . "
I shrank in my seat , wondering how I 'd missed not one , but three memos : the one that 'd taught everyone else this particular method of scarf - tying , the second one that decreed it fashionable , and the third that decided it was passé .
Fortunately , it seems no pubic - hair memo has been issued at all : on closer inspection , the " survey " that threw up the 60 % - trim rating had only asked 50 men , with no indication of how representative these 50 men were .
They could 've been male strippers .
Or indie Camden eyeliner types whose black jeans are so tight , they have to shave their minges off just to do up their flies .
I would n't put anything past those twats .
They probably do n't have human - size testicles anyway .
But that 's an argument for another week , because we 're out of space and time .
Goodbye .
· This week Charlie failed to buy a coconut ( out of curiosity ) for the second week running : " And I will continue to keep you all up to date on this situation , every week from now on , here in this end note section "
The unsurprising announcement comes as the bank , which has suffered badly from losses on mortgages it had made , continues to stumble .
Shares in Washington Mutual fell nearly 10 percent on Wednesday to $ 2.09 ; they have plunged 94 percent over the last 12 months .
This week alone , investors have been frightened by Standard & Poor ’s cutting of the bank ’s debt rating to junk .
Goldman Sachs , which Washington Mutual has hired , started the auction several days ago , these people said .
Among the potential bidders that Goldman has talked to are Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase and HSBC .
NEW DELHI --
Five blasts in heavily - populated market areas and near a subway station around India 's capital in less than an hour Saturday evening killed at least 15 people and injured more than 80 , capping a summer of attacks around the nation targeted at economic areas .
Indian Mujahideen , an Islamic extremist group , claimed responsibility for the attacks in an email to Indian media outlets .
The blasts had hallmarks of recent attacks in the city of Ahmedabad in the western state of Gujarat in July that killed 53 and in the tourist city of Jaipur in Rajasthan in May that killed more than 60 .
A series of blasts in the high - technology capital of Bangalore in July also killed one .
The Delhi blasts were triggered at a popular shopping hour early evening Saturday , a working day in Delhi .
Police defused two other live bombs , one at a cinema and one in a children 's park near India Gate , the monument in the heart of the city on New Delhi 's equivalent of the National Mall in Washington and a popular spot for an evening excursion for families .
Police say Indian Mujahideen is a front for the Students Islamic Movement of India -- a terrorist group banned by the Indian government since 2001 .
In previous emails , Indian Mujahideen had warned that Delhi would be a target .
Shahbaz Hussain , a senior SIMI leader when the group was banned in 2001 , was arrested Aug. 25 .
A 32 - year - old cyber - cafe owner in Lucknow , Uttar Pradesh , police say he is the sender of past emails attributed to Indian Mujahideen .
Rajasthan police say he also was the mastermind of the Jaipur attacks .
Indian Mujahideen also sent an email before the Ahmedabad blasts claiming the group 's responsibility .
Among the five blasts in New Delhi , one was in Karol Bagh near the city center 's commercial district ; two were around Connaught Place , a shopping area in the center of the city popular with tourists and locals alike ; two were in the popular middle - class M Block Market in Greater Kailash 1 , a tony residential district in South Delhi .
One eyewitness near one of the Connaught Place attacks said there was a loud blast followed by people running in panic .
The area is heavily policed and officers were on the scene in two minutes .
They ordered local stores shuttered .
In the Watchmen comic book ( and forthcoming movie ) , one of the most intriguing characters is the omnipotent Dr. Manhattan , a superhero who can manipulate the physical laws of the universe as the result of a strange accident involving " atomic physics . "
After being exposed to radiation , Dr. Manhattan is suffused with a blue glow and can see through time .
But it turns out there was actually a real - life version of Dr. Manhattan , a physical chemist named Louis Alexander Slotin who was exposed to the same radioactive particles as Dr. Manhattan and many other superheroes .
Unfortunately , Slotin did not develop superstrength .

As Think Artificial puts it :
It 's May 21 , 1946 , Louis Alexander Slotin , scientist with a Ph.D. in physical chemistry , is working on the Manhattan Project with his colleagues .
Their experiment involves fission reaction , placing two half - spheres of beryllium around a plutonium core .
At 3:20 p.m. Slotin is grasping an upper beryllium hemisphere with his left hand while maintaining separation of the sphere with a screwdriver - a tool that was not part of the protocol .
The screwdriver slips and the upper hemisphere fell , causing a critical reaction and a burst of hard radiation .
His colleagues report seeing a " blue glow " as the air ionized and felt a wave of heat .
Slotin retracted his hand in reaction and the upper hemisphere fell on the floor .
He was exposed to a lethal dose of radiation , equivalent of being 1500 meters away from a detonation of an atomic bomb .
Nine days later , Slotin becomes the second victim in history to die of a criticality accident .

So this is what would really happen to somebody exposed to high levels of radiation in the middle of a science experiment .
No super - strength , no super - size .
Just a human body , blasted by mutation - causing particles racing through the " blue light . "

In an address at the Wasilla Assembly of God last June , the Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin told ministry students at her former church that the United States sent troops to fight in the Iraq war on a ' task that is from God ' : " Our national leaders are sending them out on a task that is from God , " she said .
" That 's what we have to make sure that we 're praying for , that there is a plan and that plan is God 's plan .
" She also urged ministry students to pray for a plan to build a $ 30 billion natural gas pipeline in the state , calling it ' God 's will ' : " What I need to do is strike a deal with you guys . "
As they preached the love of Jesus throughout Alaska , she said , she 'd work to implement God 's will from the governor 's office , including creating jobs by building a pipeline to bring North Slope natural gas to North American markets .
" God 's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built , so pray for that , " she said .
A proposal for a uniform " Alcohol Facts " label was submitted today by the National Consumers League ( NCL ) , the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) , and others in a petition to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau .
The petition urges the agency to require a new label for alcoholic beverages that would give consumers clear information about alcohol content , serving sizes , calories , and ingredients .
The groups argue that " Alcohol Facts " labels will do for alcoholic beverages what Nutrition Facts labels have done for packaged food : provide readable information that would empower consumers to make informed decisions about the products they consume .
Rules governing alcoholic - beverage labeling suffer from jurisdictional gaps between the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the Treasury Department ’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau ( TTB , formerly the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms ) .
The FDA can weigh in on alcoholic - beverage labeling in only a small number of cases .
And , TTB has no institutional expertise in diet or nutrition .
Adding further confusion are TTB ’s inconsistent standards for beer , wine , and hard liquor , and the abundance of products that increasingly blur those three traditional categories of alcoholic beverages .
" Existing labeling rules are inconsistent , confusing , and do n’t help consumers compare beverages ’ alcohol or calorie content , " said NCL President Linda Golodner .
" While wine and hard liquor list alcohol content , beer does n’t .
And while ‘ light ’ beer and low - alcohol wines list calories , regular beer , wine , and hard liquor do n’t . "
" Consumers who are trying to maintain a healthful weight have very little information about how many calories alcoholic beverages are contributing to their diet , " said George Hacker , director of CSPI ’s Alcohol Policies Project .
" Given America ’s concern over the epidemic of overweight and obesity , it makes no sense that such a significant source of calories goes undisclosed on labels . "
The Alcohol Facts label would disclose :
Alcohol content and standard servings .
Labels would list the number of drinks per container and the amount of alcohol in a standard serving .
The label would also state the U.S. Dietary Guidelines ’ definition of moderate drinking as no more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men .
Calorie information .
Labels would list calories per serving so consumers concerned about excess weight or obesity could put alcoholic beverages in the context of their diet .
Ingredients .
Labels would list ingredients so consumers can compare beverages , and so the seven million Americans with food allergies can know if an alcoholic beverage contains milk , eggs , gluten , or other allergens .
Currently , sulfites and Yellow Dye No. 5 are the only ingredients that are required to be listed .
" It seems silly that a bottle of lemonade has to list its ingredients , but a bottle of hard lemonade doesn’t , " Hacker said .
" Our proposed label would let consumers see exactly what ’s in various brands of beers , wine , and hard liquors . "
" Consumers who are seeking to moderate their alcohol intake have a right to know how much alcohol is in a serving and how many servings are in a given container , " Golodner said .
A recent survey commissioned by CSPI found that 58 percent either do not know the caloric content of beer or believe it to be lower than it is .
Eighty - nine percent support calorie labeling on alcoholic beverages .
" Current labeling requirements for alcoholic beverages are outdated , " according to the petition .
" They do not reflect current scientific knowledge of consumer expectations . "
Sixty - seven consumer groups and four deans of public health schools joined NCL and CSPI on the petition .
" Reprehensible . "
Stoller wonders if conservatives are trying to knife McCain .
And Bill Bennett called out McCain for lying as well ?
I missed that one .
Update : Oh , this is old , from January .
Funny how nothing has changed .
Not selling on eBay
Sarah Palin , in her speech , told a carefully stated — but accurate — story of putting a state - owned jet up for sale on eBay .
Palin did not , as the ADN reported at the time , succeed in selling it on eBay ; she tried and failed .
She did n't actually claim to have though :
While I was at it , I got rid of a few things in the governor 's office that I did n't believe our citizens should have to pay for .
That luxury jet was over the top .
I put it on eBay .
And she did put it on eBay , which seems like a good piece of symbolism and a clever stunt , even if she wound up selling it through more traditional channels .
But McCain , retelling the story , misstated it today :
" You know what i enjoyed the most ?
She took the luxury jet that was acquired by her predecessor and sold it on eBay — made a profit , " he said , introducing Palin .
Well , no .
And the state sold it at a loss of half a million dollars .
Speaking of Graphics
An Essay on Graphicacy in Science , Technology and Business
by Paul J. Lewi , PhD , Eng , Consultant ( 1937 -2012 )
Graphics can be defined as translations of numbers in the form of a drawing , design or plan to explain or illustrate something .
For our purpose , however , this definition is at the same time too broad and too narrow .
In this essay we only consider graphics that are derived from tabulated observations or measurements .
On the one hand , we omit technical , organizational and architectural drawings and graphics representing mathematical functions .
On the other hand , we also extend the scope of graphics from explanation and illustration of known facts and relationships to the exploration and search for relevant questions and working hypotheses .

As of yesterday afternoon , Bob Barr 's Presidential campaign is effectively over .
There were signs of serious trouble even before yesterday , but his “ no - show ” at Ron Paul 's Campaign for Liberty news conference — followed by an insulting suggestion that Ron should join Barr on the LP ticket in the VP slot — demonstrated just how out - of - touch the Barr campaign is , and how poor Barr 's vote total is likely to be .
In earlier articles here on nolanchart.com I tried to give Barr every benefit of the doubt .
I observed that in theory he should be one of the Libertarian Party 's stronger Presidential candidates .
I opined that while his pronouncements on the campaign trail were hardly hard - core libertarian , they were mostly to - the - point and well stated .
I did not support him for the nomination , but I was more or less comfortable supporting him once he became the LP nominee .
There has been evidence all along that the Barr ' 08 campaign has been mismanaged .
Ballot access drives were begun late , and conducted erratically .
As of today , it appears that Barr 's name will be on the ballot in 46 or 47 states .
( Harry Browne appeared on 50 ballots in 1996 and 49 in 2000 .
Michael Badnarik made it onto 48 in 2004 . )
Barr has failed to achieve ballot status in West Virginia , due entirely to Shane Cory 's ineptitude , and there are lawsuits pending in five states ( LA , MA , ME , OK and PA ) to determine whether Barr will be on the ballot .
Fundraising has also been a flop .
As I write this , the fundraising “ meter ” on the Barr '08 website shows the total raised by the campaign at $ 881,500 — about $ 700,000 since the Denver nominating convention .
That works out to about $ 6,400 a day or $ 200,000 / month .
In the days leading up to the nomination , Barr 's people were throwing around numbers like $ 20 million .
The reality is likely to be barely more than $ 1 million .
But all that would be beside the point if Bob Barr were campaigning proudly as a Libertarian and taking advantage of every opportunity to reach out to like - minded Americans .
Unfortunately , he 's not .
Following advice from his campaign manager , Russ Verney , Barr has avoided use of the “ L ” word wherever possible .
There 's a big empty space in the banner at the top of the Barr '08 website , where the word LIBERTARIAN could ( and should ) appear .
It does n't , despite several suggestions that this be remedied .
Barr 's campaign literature , signs and bumper stickers do not include the “ L ” word either .
And a press release issued by the campaign earlier this week describes Barr as a “ Former Congressman ” with no mention of the Libertarian Party .
Clearly , Barr is not running as a Libertarian ; he 's running as an independent candidate : “ Former Congressman Bob Barr . ”
Which may be just as well , given the way he 's been behaving .
Yesterday , Congressman Ron Paul held a news conference to denounce the two - party duopoly .
He invited four alternative candidates — Chuck Baldwin , Bob Barr , Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader — to participate .
Baldwin , McKinney and Nader showed up ; Barr did not .
Instead , he held a separate follow - up conference of his own at which he tooted his own horn and “ invited ” Ron Paul to be his running mate .
This was insanely stupid , for several reasons .
First , because Barr has no authority to unilaterally change running - mates .
Second , because it's a insult to Ron Paul , who is far better known and more widely admired .
( Reportedly , Ron Paul and his top people are furious . )
And third , because even if Ron Paul accepted the invitation and the Libertarian National Committee approved the substitution , it is too late to make a substitution on most states ' ballots .
For a description of what happened at the Campaign for Liberty press conference , see this Washington Post article .
Why has the Barr campaign has gone so badly awry ?
The simple answer is that the two men running it — Russ Verney and Shane Cory — are not Libertarians , do not understand what motivates Libertarian activists , and have no interest in building the LP .
Verney is a gun -for - hire of no discernible ideology .
Cory is a Republican who left his former job at LP headquarters in disgrace , after abusing his authority prior to the Denver convention .
( Just today , Verney posted a Campaign Update on the Barr '08 website , praising George W. Bush for his “ leadership ” during the days following the 9/11 attacks seven years ago .
Any true Libertarian would have instead pointed out that Bush has USED the 9/11 attacks as an excuse to erode our civil liberties ! )
With these two running the campaign it will continue to embarrass Libertarians and waste our resources .
Bob Barr will never qualify for inclusion in the phony “ Presidential debates . ”
He will not get the 5 % of the vote that would qualify the LP for future matching funds — which it should not accept in any case .
Indeed , at this point it seems likely that Barr will not get even 1 % of the popular vote .
( Bettors on intrade.com are currently betting 2:1 against Barr receiving 1 % . )
So what 's a Libertarian to do ?
First , accept that the fact that the Barr '08 campaign is effectively over .
Do n't waste any time or money supporting a campaign that avoids the “ L ” word , has demonstrated its incompetence time and again , and goes out of its way to insult friends and allies .
By all means , vote for Bob Barr in November .
I plan to , and I urge every Libertarian to do likewise .
Whatever vote Barr receives will be seen by most people as “ the Libertarian vote ” and we want that to be as high as possible .
And if you want to campaign for Barr locally , then do so .
Print up flyers , put up homemade campaign signs , etc .
But do not , under any circumstances , send any money to the Barr ' 08 campaign .
Most of the money will be wasted , and the rest will be spent muddying the waters about what genuine libertarianism is all about .
If you are inclined to contribute to a Libertarian campaign , send your money to someone who will make good use of it .
Two examples are Mike Munger and Morey Straus .
If you are burned out on politics , but still want to support the battle for individual rights and liberty , send your money to an outfit like the Institute for Justice .
Contribute to the local animal shelter .
Or take your kids to the park and buy them ice cream .
In sum , do something that will actually advance the cause of liberty or in some other way make your world a better place .
Obama campaign issues rebuttal to book 's claims Associated Press
Published : Thursday August 14 , 2008
Print This Email This UPDATE : Click here to read the full rebuttal to " The Obama Nation " ( PDF link ) .
By NEDRA PICKLER , Associated Press Writer HONOLULU - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama hit back Thursday with a 40 - page rebuttal to the best - selling book " The Obama Nation , " arguing the author is a fringe bigot peddling rehashed lies .
Jerome Corsi's anti-Obama book , " The Obama Nation : Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality , " claims the Illinois senator is a dangerous , radical candidate for president .
The book is a compilation of all the innuendo and false rumors against Obama  that he was raised a Muslim , attended a radical , black church and secretly has a " black rage " hidden beneath the surface .
In fact , Obama is a Christian who attended Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago .
The Obama campaign picked apart the book 's claims in a rebuttal titled " Unfit For Publication , " to be posted on the Obama campaign 's rumor - fighting Web site , FightTheSmears.com .
The title is a play on the book Corsi co-authored against 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry 's military service called " Unfit For Command . "
" Jerome Corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the Bush - Cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago , " said Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor .
" His is just one of what will likely be many more lie - filled books rushed to print this election cycle , which are cobbled together from debunked Internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda .
We will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal . "
Corsi 's book is off to a swift start and is No. 1 on The New York Times ' hardcover nonfiction best - seller list , even though Obama 's campaign would argue the book should be listed as fiction .
Obama 's campaign says the book is full of factual inaccuracies that include the wrong date for the Obamas ' marriage .
Corsi also writes that Obama left much of his family background out of his autobiographies  his father 's polygamy and alcoholism , his sister 's birth in Indonesia and that his then - fiance Michelle accompanied him on a visit to Kenya  but the campaign points out page numbers from " Dreams From My Father " where Obama discussed all those things .
In " The Obama Nation "  the title is a twist on the word abomination  Corsi catalogs various allegations that have haunted Obama on right - wing blogs and anonymous e-mails .
Corsi suggests , without a shred of proof , that Obama may be using drugs today .
Obama has acknowledged using marijuana and cocaine as a teenager but says he quit when he went to college and has n't used drugs since .
Corsi makes an issue of the fact that , before he quit smoking cigarettes , Obama did n't want it widely known that he smoked .
" If Obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us , what else does he take pains to hide ? "
Corsi asks in the book .
Corsi also dwells on Obama 's mother marrying Obama 's African father and later marrying someone from Indonesia  whom Corsi describes as " a second man of color to be her mate . "
The Obama campaign says the description is one of many examples of Corsi's " offensive language " in the book .
He claims Obama received extensive Islamic religious education as a boy in Indonesia , education that was only offered to the truly faithful .
Actually , Obama is a Christian and as a boy he attended both Catholic school and Indonesian public schools where some basic study of the Koran was offered .
He accuses Obama of wanting to weaken the military even though Obama 's campaign calls for adding 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 Marines .
In an interview with The Associated Press , Corsi defended raising the issue of drugs without any evidence .
" I do n't need more , " he said .
" I 'm putting this question forward .
I 'm putting the evidence forward .
Voters can make up their own minds . "
Corsi writes for World Net Daily , a conservative Web site whose lead headline Thursday was " Astonishing photo claims : Dead Bigfoot stored on ice . "
In a series of Web posts several years ago , Corsi said Pope John Paul II was senile and unconcerned about sexual molestation of boys , referred to Islam is " a worthless , dangerous Satanic religion " and suggested Kerry was secretly Jewish .
Corsi apologized for the remarks and now says he did n't mean them and was simply trying to provoke discussion .
" Obama Nation " is published by Threshold Editions , a division of Simon & Schuster that is run by Mary Matalin , the former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney .
Corsi readily acknowledges the political goal of his book .
He considers Obama a " radical leftist " who should not be elected president .
Corsi said he has no plans to work against Obama with groups comparable to 2004's Swift Boat Veterans for Truth but said he would be willing to consider it .
Kerry has set up his own Web site , http://www.truthfightsback.com, to push back against accusations from Corsi and others .

Psilocybin cancer study seeks volunteers Reader Evan from Entheogenic Reformation writes to inform us of a new study seeking volunteers :
In recent years , scientists at some U.S. universities have been conducting studies using entheogens , resuming research in pharmacology , psychology , creativity , and spirituality that was suspended following the drug excesses of the 1960s .
Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University are seeking volunteers with a current or past diagnosis of cancer who have some anxiety or are feeling down about their cancer to participate in a scientific study of self - exploration and personal meaning brought about by the entheogen psilocybin , a psychoactive substance found in mushrooms used as a sacrament in some cultures , given in a comfortable , supportive setting .
When discussing the benefits of this study , the principal investigator Roland Griffiths Ph.D. said ; " the primary mystical experience might fundamentally change the perception of disease and perhaps quality of life in people distressed by life - threatening diagnoses of cancer . "
Volunteers enrolled in the study will receive careful preparation and 2 sessions in which they will receive psilocybin .
Structured guidance will be provided during the session and afterwards to facilitate integration of the experiences .
The study complies with FDA regulations .
f you would like to discuss the possibility of volunteering , please call 410 - 550- 5990 or email cancer@bpru.org and ask for Mary , the study 's research coordinator .

Some insects live much of their lives under water , using air bubbles gathered at the surface to survive .
Now scientists have discovered just how deep they can go .
Based on a new model of how the air bubbles work , the deepest - diving bugs could as far down as 98 feet ( 30 meters ) , researchers said this week .
The scientists figured out how the air bubbles work , and why they would n't pop at such depths .
However , most bugs never go deeper than a few yards ( meters ) , they said .
" Some insects have adapted to life underwater by using this bubble as an external lung , " said John Bush , associate professor of applied mathematics at MIT and a co-author of the study , detailed in the Aug. 10 issue of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics .
The air bubble 's stability is maintained by hairs on the insects ' abdomen , which help repel water from the surface .
The hairs , along with a waxy surface coating , prevent water from flooding the spiracles — tiny breathing holes on the abdomen .
The spacing of these hairs is critically important :
The closer together the hairs , the greater the mechanical stability and the more pressure the bubble can withstand before collapsing .
However , mechanical stability comes at a cost .
If the hairs are too close together , there is not enough surface area through which to breathe .
" Because the bubble acts as an external lung , its surface area must be sufficiently large to facilitate the exchange of gases , " said Morris Flynn , a former applied mathematics instructor at MIT who is now at the University of Alberta .
Other researchers have worked on ideas to use similar external lungs to allow humans to dive for long periods .
But the surface area required to support human respiration is impractically large — in excess of 100 square meters , Bush and Flynn report .
Once it became clear that Darius would n't plead to the charge of reckless endangerment , Dougherty and Mullen decided to let him talk .
He talked for two hours and seemed willing to talk indefinitely .
He was cagey when it came to identifying collaborators or detailing certain methods whose secrecy was essential to his freedom of movement ; otherwise , almost any question elicited long tales of his exploits that gave way episodically to ornate , unnecessary digressions .
Once I asked Darius what he was doing at Fifty - seventh Street before his arrest .
My question implied that he'd been in the station .
His answer began like this : " No , no .
I was mainly in the tower , not the station .
Now : Towers are for what is known as train - traffic control .
The board lights tell you where everything is at .
All right ?
Okay .
So every single train from Fifth Avenue , on the N and the R , down to Canal Street .
Not only that but there 's a communications box for listening to the crew on every train .
You also have what is known as fire watch .
I watch the board for any thing relating to a fire condition .
Now , if it 's something minute , I can hopefully go down and end the problem without having to call the fire department .
If it 's close to the third rail , use a dry chemical .
If it 's something major , call the fire department , call Command , have the power turned off for that section because otherwise the fire department cannot go on the tracks , that 's part of their protocol ....
And if need be you can have EMS on standby , just in case .
So you always take all necessary precautions .
Okay !
Now on this particular day , I 'm in the tower ... "
Darius 's obsession has always been concentrated on the subway , but a long interview with him will teach you how far beyond it he has roamed .
He may describe his experiences as a substitute engineer on the freight trains of Conrail , Norfolk Southern , Delaware & Hudson , or CSX .
( " CSX is definitely my favorite .
Every single engine is freshly painted . " )
He may tell you how to manipulate the employee - transfer protocol of the metro bus system to get a job as a shifter ( cleaning and prepping buses at depots ) , and how to use that position to take buses out on express routes .
He might explain Job 179 ( conductor ) on the Long Island Railroad : what track you 'll be on ( 17 or 19 ) , how to let the crew know when you 've finished preparing the train for departure ( two buzzes on the intercom ) , how you return to Penn Station " as equipment " ( without passengers ) .
It is unlikely that Darius will omit the year he spent wearing an NYCTA superintendent 's shield .
While he was doing a stint as a conductor , he discovered that he could have a shield made in a jewelry store .
He began wearing it on a vest he pulled over his TA - specified shirt and tie .
He had a hard hat and pirated I.D. Darius considered himself a track - department superintendent , so he signed out track - department vehicles and radios and drove around the city , supervising track maintenance and construction projects and responding to emergencies .
He was sensitive to the threat of close scrutiny by superiors , but given his high position and network of allies , that was rare .
Darius worked regular hours : eight to four from Tuesday to Thursday , seven in the evening to three in the morning on Friday , and three until eleven on Saturday morning .
That way he was off from Saturday morning until Tuesday morning .
" Because of my title and my position , " Darius told me , " I figured I had the seniority to do it . "
A member of the pioneering warez group aPOCALYPSE pRODUCTION cREW ( aPC ) has been jailed for 18 months .
Barry Gitarts , also known as ' Dextro ' , was sentenced after he was convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Criminal Copyright Infringement .
Thus far , there have been 15 convictions of aPC members .
aPOCALYPSE pRODUCTION cREW ( aPC ) , was thought to be first organized ‘ warez ‘ group to coordinate the pre-release uploading of mp3s to the Internet .
Founded in 1997 by members known as acid^rain and Viper , aPC ’s forté was the pre-release of music CDs which they obtained from music industry insiders and magazine workers .
The group was raided as part of Operation Fastlink .
According to evidence presented at his May 2008 trial , Barry E. Gitarts , aka ‘ Dextro ’ , operated and financed a server based in Texas which was used by aPC to store thousands of music files , movies , software and games .
The New York resident was convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Criminal Copyright Infringement .
On Friday , Gitarts , aged 25 , was sentenced in Alexandria federal court to 18 months in jail for his role in aPC .
Another ex-member of aPC , Jacob Stahler , aka Lunatik , was on the witness list at the May trial , and there has been speculation that he testified against Gitarts .
Stahler himself was also convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Copyright Infringement , but was later sentenced to just 2 years probation .
So far there have been a total 15 criminal convictions of aPC members , including that of Mark Shumaker of Florida ( aka ‘ MarkAlso ’ ) , a previous leader of the group who already admitted criminal copyright infringement back in 2003 .
Hello , this is the Open Flash Chart project .
Note : “ Open Flash Chart 2 ” is LGPL .
OK , Open Flash Chart 1.x was great and it works like a dream .
But I made some little mistakes which over time grew and anyoyed me and made the source code weird .
So I decided it was time to re-jigger the code and make it pretty again .
The big change is moving the data format to JSON .
This has made a big difference and has allowed some pretty cool new features .
While I was hacking away at the source code I moved it all to Actionscript 3 , and used Adobe Flex to compile it .
This means everything is open source .
If you want to make changes to the charts all you need is laid out in these instructions .
Just because there is a new version does n’t make V 1.x obsolete .
You can use both versions at the same time so leave your current working code in V 1.x and make all the new charts using which ever version you find easier to use .
Why is V2 better ?
Well it uses JSON as the file format and this means you can do cool stuff like Grant Slender has : http://code.google.com/p/ofcgwt/

DAMMAM , Saudi Arabia
Once a month , Nayla says , she writes a letter to Oprah Winfrey .
A young Saudi homemaker who covers her face in public might not seem to have much in common with an American talk show host whose image is known to millions .
Like many women in this conservative desert kingdom , Nayla does not usually socialize with people outside her extended family , and she never leaves her house unless chaperoned by her husband .
Ms. Winfrey has not answered the letters .
But Nayla says she is still hoping .
“ I feel that Oprah truly understands me , ” said Nayla , who , like many of the women interviewed , would not let her full name be used .
“ She gives me energy and hope for my life .
Sometimes I think that she is the only person in the world who knows how I feel . ”
Nayla is not the only Saudi woman to feel a special connection to the American media mogul .
When “ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” was first broadcast in Saudi Arabia in November 2004 on a Dubai - based satellite channel , it became an immediate sensation among young Saudi women .
Within months , it had become the highest - rated English - language program among women 25 and younger , an age group that makes up about a third of Saudi Arabia ’s population .
In a country where the sexes are rigorously separated , where topics like sex and race are rarely discussed openly and where a strict code of public morality is enforced by religious police called hai ’a , Ms. Winfrey provides many young Saudi women with new ways of thinking about the way local taboos affect their lives  as well as about a variety of issues including childhood sexual abuse and coping with marital strife  without striking them , or Saudi Arabia ’s ruling authorities , as subversive .

Tbilisi and Kremlin agree to end hostilities over South Ossetia in deal brokered by French leader Nicolas Sarkozy
The Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , has signed a ceasfire pact brokered by the French to end hostilities in Georgia .
George Bush today said the development was " a hopeful step , " but added : " Now Russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations . "
Foreign secretary David Miliband welcomed the declaration but added that Russian " aggression " against Georgia and threats to neighbouring states , such as Poland , were unacceptable .
The Russians had been refusing to pull back their forces in Georgia until Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili signed the six - point ceasefire plan arranged by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France earlier this week - although they had refused to sign it themselves .
Saakashvili reluctantly signed the plan yesterday – which calls for Russian troops to pull back but also grants them limited patrols inside Georgia , while accusing the Russians of being " evil " and " 21st century barbarians " .
Kremlin sources have now confirmed that Russia has signed the pact .
" The president informed participants of the security council meeting that
he had just now signed the six - point plan , " said the Kremlin 's chief
spokeswoman , Natalia Timakova .
Under the plan , some emotive issues remain open to interpretation – including whether Georgia is able to send troops back into areas of South Ossetia .
The ceasefire agreement should prompt international talks to define the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Meanwhile , the risk of a new era of east - west confrontation triggered by Russia 's invasion of Georgia heightened yesterday when Moscow reserved the right to launch a nuclear attack on Poland because it agreed to host US rockets as part of the Pentagon 's missile shield .
Miliband welcomed Medvedev 's signing of the peace plan and said the priority was to ensure that commitments made in the agreement were " speedily and fully implemented " .
Earlier , Washington accused Russia of " bullying and intimidation " in Georgia , Russia 's deputy chief of staff turned on Warsaw and said it was vulnerable to a Russian rocket attack because of Thursday 's pact with the US on the missile defence project .
" By deploying , Poland is exposing itself to a strike - 100 % , " warned Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn .
He added that Russia 's security doctrine allowed it to use nuclear weapons against an active ally of a nuclear power such as America .
The warning worsened the already dismal mood in relations between Moscow and the west caused by the shock of post - Soviet Russia 's first invasion of a foreign country .
There were scant signs of military activity on the ground in Georgia , but nor were there any signs of the Russian withdrawal pledged on Tuesday under ceasefire terms mediated by the European Union .
Instead , the focus was on a flurry of diplomatic activity that exposed acute differences on how Washington and Berlin see the crisis in the Caucasus .
Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , went to Tbilisi to bolster Georgia against the Russians as President George Bush denounced Russian " bullying and intimidation " as " unacceptable " .
Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , met Russia 's President Dmitry Medvedev on the Black Sea close to Georgia 's borders and sent quite a different message , offering a mild rebuke of Moscow .
" Some of Russia 's actions were not proportionate , " she said .
Unlike the Americans and some European states who are saying the Russians should face " consequences " for their invasion , Merkel said negotiations with Moscow on a whole range of issues would continue as before and spread the blame for the conflict .
" It is rare that all the blame is on one side .
In fact , both sides are probably to blame .
That is very important to understand , " she said .
In Tbilisi , Rice was much more forthright , saying that the invasion had " profound implications for Russia ...
This calls into question what role Russia really plans to play in international politics .
" You ca n't be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours . "
Saakashvili said : " Russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west .
It 's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere , " said Saakashvili .
" We are looking evil directly in the eye .
Today this evil is very strong , and very dangerous for everybody , not just for us . "
Rice 's show of solidarity with Georgia 's beleaguered president was theatrically undermined when Russia dispatched a column of armoured personnel carriers towards the Georgian capital .
As the talks were taking place , 10 armoured personnel carriers laden with Russian troops set off from Gori , penetrating to within 20 miles of Tbilisi .
" Georgia has been attacked .
Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once , " said Rice .
The withdrawal " must take place , and take place now ...
This is no longer 1968 , " she added in reference to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago next week .
The ceasefire terms favour the Russians who routed the Georgians .
But the secretary of state argued the plan would not affect negotiations over the central territorial dispute between Georgia and the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
The deal allows Russian troops to remain in the two provinces and to mount patrols and " take additional security measures " on Georgian territory beyond the two enclaves .
Senior Russians continued to insist yesterday that Russian troops had not stepped outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia despite the fact they have been deep inside Georgian territory in several places all week .
" Our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone , " said Sergei Ivanov , the deputy prime minister .
Moscow also indicated it would resist possible European attempts to deploy international peacekeepers in the contested territories .
" We are not against international peacekeepers , " the Russian president said .
" But the problem is that the Abkhazians and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except Russian peacekeepers . "
He also attacked the agreement between Washington and Warsaw on the missile shield and said claims that the shield was aimed at Iran were " fairy tales "
" This clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti-missile forces in Europe has as its aim the Russian Federation , " said Medvedev .
" The moment has been well chosen . "
The timing of Thursday 's agreement on missile defence means that tensions are soaring on Russia 's southern and western borders .
Polish armed forces yesterday paraded in Warsaw to mark a rare defeat of the Russians 888 years ago and President Lech Kaczynski hailed the accord on the Pentagon project as a boost for Poland 's security .
In return for hosting 10 interceptor rockets said to be intended to destroy any eventual ballistic missile attacks from Iran , Poland is to receive a battery of US Patriot missiles for its air defences and has won a mutual security pact with Washington .
Legendary investor Warren Buffett reckons the US government can make a sizeable profit if it manages its $ 700 bn ( £ 380 bn ) banking bail - out package carefully - and he urged Congress to act quickly to avert an " economic Pearl Harbour " .
Having been uncharacteristically quiet through much of the financial crisis , the " Sage of Omaha " broke cover late on Tuesday by investing $ 5bn in Goldman Sachs , delivering a powerful shot in the arm to the sickly banking industry .
The Nebraska billionaire , whose fortune was estimated at $ 62bn before the recent financial turmoil , threw his weight wholeheartedly behind Henry Paulson 's rescue package for Wall Street , arguing that US industry would " grind to a halt " without action .
" Last week , we were at the brink of something that would have made anything that 's happened in financial history pale , " he told CNBC television .
" I 'm not saying the Paulson plan will eliminate the problems but it 's absolutely necessary , in my view , to avoid going off the precipice . "
Buffett , whose opinions are hugely influential among millions of private investors in the US , said that if the treasury acted shrewdly by buying banks ' distressed assets at a competitive price , taxpayers would end up financial winners .
" I bet they 'll make a profit , " said Buffett , who pointed out that hedge funds specialising in junk assets were already picking up mortgage - related securities with a view to making profits of 15 % to 20 % .
He said a positive return was
feasible if the government ignored the book value of instruments or the original cost to banks and instead paid the prevailing market rates for the bombed - out assets .
" They 'll pay back the $ 700bn and make a considerable amount of money if they approach it like that , " said Buffett .
" I would love to have $ 700bn at treasury rates to buy fixed - income securities - there 's a lot of money to be made . "
Buffett's $ 5bn investment in Goldman Sachs ' preferred stock was matched by a further $ 5bn capital - raising yesterday as the bank took the opportunity to bolster its balance sheet .
Goldman 's shares , which fell as low as $ 86 last week , rose by 2 % to $ 127.88 during early trading in New York .
It is the first time that Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway business empire has made a significant play in banking since an unhappy dalliance with Salomon Brothers during the late 1980s and early 1990s .
" The price was right , the people were right , the terms were right and I decided to write a cheque , " said Buffett , adding that he had plenty of cash and was on the lookout for opportunities .
" Otherwise , it 's a bit like saving up sex for your old age - at some point you 've got to use it . "
A keen Democrat who is backing Barack Obama , he said he hoped Paulson would remain treasury secretary irrespective of the election outcome .
Urging Congress to act swiftly , Buffett said Wall Street 's troubles were inseparable from the finances of US consumers .
" The economy is a bit like a bath tub - you can't have cold water at the front and hot water at the back , " he said .
" This is sort of an economic Pearl Harbour we 're going through .
I think most of [ Congress ] will get it and they 'll do what 's right for the country . "
The Republican presidential candidate , John McCain , yesterday defended his choice of running mate , Sarah Palin , the governor of Alaska , in the face of widespread scorn that she lacks experience , especially in foreign policy .
Asked about her lack of experience on Fox News Sunday , McCain said : " She 's been commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard ... she 's had judgment on these issues .
She 's had 12 years of elected office experience , including travelling to Kuwait . "
Republicans accused Palin 's critics of being sexist in their readiness to dismiss her .
The appointment of the social conservative as vice - presidential nominee , has been enthusiastically greeted by the party 's rightwing .
One of McCain 's closest advisers , Senator Lindsey Graham , said she had more experience than McCain 's presidential opponent , Barack Obama .
" She 's been a governor ... that 's more than Obama . "
Palin 's appointment came as a surprise to Obama 's campaign team , which immediately criticised her lack of experience .
But Obama later changed the tone to politely welcome the historic nature of having the first woman on a Republican ticket .
His campaign team dispatched staff to Alaska to look into her background , including her initial support for the state 's expensive and infamous Ketchikan bridge , known better as the Bridge to Nowhere .
Although opinion polls taken over the weekend are being eagerly awaited by both camps , Real Clear Politics , a website that tracks major polls and provides a running average , yesterday had Obama on 47 % and McCain on 44 % .
In the battlefield states , Obama was ahead in Pennsylvania and McCain in Florida , with the two tied in Ohio .
In a theme echoed by other Democrats throughout the day , Senator John Kerry , the failed Democratic candidate for the presidency in 2004 , described Palin as having been picked to placate the Republican party 's rightwing , which is suspicious of McCain .
Kerry told ABC
News : " He 's chosen somebody who does n't believe climate change is man-made . "
He said it was insulting to Hillary Clinton supporters to suggest that Palin , given her anti-abortion and other socially conservative views , might woo them .
The former Democratic Senate majority leader , Tom Daschle , described the appointment as " inexplicable " .
But Rush Limbaugh , whose radio show attracts millions of rightwing listeners , enthusiastically welcomed her .
" Palin equals guns , babies , Jesus ... Obama just lost blue - collar , white Democratic voters in Pennsylvania and other states , " Limbaugh said .
James Dobson , the conservative Christian leader who had been opposed to McCain , said the selection of Palin had won him over .
After appearing with McCain at a rally in Dayton , Ohio , on Friday , Palin made her second campaign speech on Saturday near Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
Her stop in Pittsburgh showed a vulnerability that could be a worry for McCain .
Some of the audience left as she was speaking and there was booing when , in an appeal to Democratic voters to switch to McCain , she mentioned Hillary Clinton .
As the Republicans wheel out their latest asset , there is still disagreement on how to deploy one of their oldest : the incumbent president .
As George Bush ends his second term in office , he has acquired the distinction among the general American population of being one of the most disliked presidents in history , alongside Harry Truman and Richard Nixon , with his popularity rating at about 28 % .
Although polls show that two out of three Republican loyalists still continue to think highly of Bush , the loathing with which he is now regarded by huge swaths of the country has a direct bearing on the re-election hopes of scores of Republican members of Congress in swing states .
Unless Bush is kept in the shadows their jobs could be on the line in November .
While part of the alliance of interests in the so - called Reagan coalition continue to adore the president , others are disillusioned by him .
Top of the list of the disgruntled are the economic conservatives , for whom tight public spending , tax cuts and balanced budgets are key .
Equally livid is the libertarian wing that has been an influential part of the movement since the 1960s .
It defines conservatism as vesting power in the individual , free of government interference , but blames Bush for having extended the reach of Washington more than any other president since Lyndon Johnson .
On the other side of the widening rift within US conservatism , the Christian right remains broadly supportive of the president .

Is Natural Pool Water Safe ?
According to Brown , people always ask the health question first .
He says people just need to think about pools a little differently .
" Instead of creating an abhorrence of nature where everything is dead , it 's creating natural healthy water that takes care of itself , " says Brown .
Brown believes properly designed natural pools provide virtually no risk of dangerous contamination , provided they are used reasonably , and not constantly stuffed to capacity with bathers .
He says most health departments do n't have any regulations on residential pools , so consumers have little worry about breaking any local codes .
However , that 's not necessarily the case with public pools , which often do have strict requirements .
After centuries of giving humanity little more than nicotine and death , the tobacco plant may be the wellspring of a revolution in gene therapy .
Scientists are using a modified tobacco virus to deliver delicate gene therapies into the heart of diseased cells , with the potential to treat most cancers , viruses and genetic disorders .
The tobacco mosaic virus , which plagues the plant but is harmless to humans , is hollowed out and filled with " small interfering RNA " molecules , or siRNA , which some scientists consider to be the most significant development in medicine since the discovery of vaccines .
The virus ' tubular shell provides a safe way to slip the delicate siRNA drugs into cells , serving as both a protective coating and a Trojan horse .
" This tobacco mosaic virus is literally a nano - sized syringe , " says
William Bentley , a professor of bioengineering at the University of
Maryland , who is leading the study of the virus .
Bentley 's team has successfully hollowed out the virus and filled it with siRNA , and then used it to slip the frail substance into all sorts of cells , from kidney tissue to cancer .
The researchers have proven that the tiny capsules provide adequate protection , and that they release their payloads once inside – hitting their target genes right on the mark .
The short , double - stranded RNA molecules known as siRNA can program cells to destroy disease - causing proteins .
Their molecules turn on a cell 's own built - in disease - fighting mechanisms .
They can be programmed for a wide range of ailments – from cancers to viruses – and because they use the cell 's own defense mechanisms , they produce minimal side effects .
In addition to treating cancers and genetic disorders , siRNA could prove useful against a variety of rare diseases that have , and always will be , overlooked by big pharmaceutical companies – the long tail of disease .
People suffering from similar , exotic maladies could band together and recruit a small team of scientists , as if they were the Seven Samurai , to champion their cause and quickly design a cure .
“ The speed with which you develop siRNA drugs is truly amazing , ” said Stephen Hyde .
“ In the past , a traditional small molecule drug might take several years of intensive research effort by a large team of scientists to develop .
Today , with siRNA technology , it is possible for a single researcher to develop a drug candidate in a few weeks . ”
Says Stuart Pollard , the vice president of Alnylam , a New England biotech firm that specializes in gene - blocking drugs : " RNA interference is a revolution in biology . "
The problem is in the delivery : siRNA molecules are very fragile , and ca n’t get where they need to go without some assistance .
“ Unfortunately , siRNA drug molecules are easily damaged and thus the biggest challenge to their use is developing methods to deliver enough of the siRNA to the place in the body where they can be used to combat disease , ” says Hyde .
Scientists have been looking for a better way to deliver the delicate molecules inside the body .
Researchers have tried packaging the ephemeral drug in adenoviruses – tiny spheres that cause respiratory infections – or nanoparticles .
But adenoviruses can play havoc with the immune system and nanoparticles can cause all sorts of collateral damage .
Some scientists avoid the problem entirely by developing drugs that operate in the eyes and lungs – areas where RNA can survive without much support .
Meanwhile , siRNA therapies are being tested as a cure for respiratory syncitial virus , blindness and pachyonychia congenita ( an exotic genetic disorder ) .
In a recent clinical trial , Alnylam packed siRNA into a nasal inhaler and found the spray cut in half the number of patients who were infected with respiratory syncitial virus .
Even better , the drug had no side effects .
It was comparable to a saltwater placebo .
A lucky coincidence led Bentley and his team at the University of Maryland to use the tobacco mosaic virus as a delivery mechanism .
His lab is across the hall from the office of James
Culver , a biotechnology expert who had been using the virus to produce nano wires and batteries .
Bentley 's team can produce boatloads of the plant pathogen , empty it out and cram siRNA into the hollow core .
Bentley hopes that a drug company will take interest in his discovery , but he has a long way to go before it is ready for human trials .
First , the team must gather more evidence that the system is an effective way to deliver medicine .
It has worked with cells in a dish , but not yet been proven effective in living organisms .
Unfortunately , some scientists foresee a problem that could make the viral carrier unsuitable for long term use : Humans will eventually develop an immune response to the plant virus that would limit their effectiveness .
Bentley is optimistic that the virus will not cause health problems because most people already have traces of it in their blood – from second - hand smoke – and it does not seem to cause irritation or obvious immune - system problems .
Protecting the payload is not the only challenge , said Ben Berkhout , a biotechnology expert at the University of Amsterdam .
Even if the delicate molecules are packaged in the perfect substance , they still need some sort of a guidance system .
" You want to efficiently get the siRNA drug into the cells where the therapeutic action should be , ” said Berkhout .
By coating each tube with special proteins that can recognize and penetrate cancer cells , Bentley 's team hopes to make smart drugs that will only go where they are needed .
If that trick works , tobacco may finally be able to turn over a new leaf .

Mother buys assault rifle for son who was planning Columbine - style school attack
A mother has admitted helping her son build a cache of weapons by buying him a rifle and gunpowder .
But investigators are still trying to ascertain if she knew her troubled , bullied son , 14 , was planning on carrying out a school massacre similar to Columbine .
Michele Cossey , 46 , pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of child endangerment .
She admitted that she bought her son Dillon a rifle with a laser scope and gunpowder , which investigators said he was using to build grenades .
Prosecutors said Dillon came to idolize the Columbine High School shooters , who killed 12 classmates and a teacher before committing suicide in 1999 in Colorado .
Michelle Cossey , right , has admitted to buying a rifle and gunpowder for her son Dillon , left , who was planning a Columbine - style attack on a high school
They also said Dillon was planning an attack last year on Plymouth Whitemarsh High School , which some former schoolmates attended .
Cossey , bullied over his weight , had left public school half way through middle school and was being home - schooled .
Over time , violent Internet sites fueled his revenge fantasies , his defence lawyer said after his juvenile court plea .
Assistant District Attorney Christopher Parisi said he thought purchasing the weapons was " an attempt to boost his self - esteem , and in some way help the child , as misplaced as those thoughts may have been . "
Michelle Cossey 's sentencing hearing wo n't happen until after she undergoes a psychiatric evaluation .
The maximum possible prison term is 3 ½ to 7 years , but her defence attorney she could get less than a year - or even just probation - under sentencing guidelines .
Authorities did not think the school attack was imminent , but Dillon Cossey did amass an arsenal - knives , swords , BB guns , the rifle and partly assembled homemade grenades - in his bedroom at his home in Plymouth Township , about 20 miles ( 32 kilometres ) northwest of Philadelphia .
Police learned of the planned attack when Cossey invited a friend to join him .
The friend went to police last fall .
Dillon Cossey was sentenced to a juvenile treatment facility .

So long , SAW ?
Corps testing lighter alternatives to belt - fed M249 By Matthew Cox - mcox@militarytimes.com <
mailto:mcox@militarytimes.com
> Posted : September 15 , 2008
Marine infantry units soon may replace their light machine guns with new automatic rifles designed to help gunners move faster on assaults .
Weapons officials at Marine Corps Systems Command in Quantico , Va. , are testing magazine - fed weapons from at least six gun makers in a search for a lighter alternative to the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon , which weighs close to 17 pounds unloaded .
At the squad level ,  the biggest hindrance to being able to effectively fire and maneuver is the weight of the SAW ,  said Patrick Cantwell , capability integration officer for the Infantry Automatic Rifle program at SysCom .
The winning IAR design  which the Corps wants to weigh no more than 12.5 pounds 
could begin replacing the SAW in infantry squads as early as next year .
" We see this being the automatic riflemans primary weapon , " Cantwell said .
" We obviously want it as soon as possible , but we are looking at sometime in 2009 . "
The M249 has been in service with the Corps since the mid-1980s .
The standard model weighs about 22 pounds when loaded with a 200 - round belt of 5.56 mm ammunition .
Despite its weight , the weapon spits out up to 750 rounds per minute , providing small units with a tremendous rate of sustained automatic fire .
WHY THE ARMY SAYS NO THANKS
That s why the Army , which also uses the M249 , has ruled out a soldier version of the Marine IAR .
" We are not considering adopting an auto rifle for the infantry squad , " said Col. Robert Radcliffe , director of the Infantry Centers Directorate of Combat Developments at Fort Benning , Ga .
Currently , Marine and Army infantry squads equip their fire teams with one M249 each .
The difference , Radcliffe said , is that Marine squads have three fire teams , and Army squads have two fire teams .
" It s really all about firepower .
The Marine Corps has a 13 - man squad ; we have a nine - man squad

that s a four - man difference . "
Army infantry officials , however , do want to find a replacement for the M249 .
Since 2003 , Army Materiel Command has stood up a robust refurbishing program that rebuilds worn - out SAWs to nearly new condition .
But heavy operational use continues to take its toll on the M249s performance , Radcliffe said .
" We recognize that we need to find another solution for the light machine gun in the squad , " Radcliffe said .
One option for replacing the SAW could be the MK46

a newer version of the M249 , redesigned for reduced weight and adopted by U.S. Special Operations Command in 2000 .
FNH USA makes the M249 and the MK46 .
The MK46 has a fixed stock and 16.3 - inch barrel .
FNH removed features such as the magazine - feeding well , the tripod mount and the gas regulator , reducing the weight to 15.4 pounds unloaded .
The current M249 comes in two versions .
The standard model features a fixed stock and a 20.5 - inch barrel , and weighs in at 16.8 pounds unloaded .
The paratrooper model has a collapsible stock and a 14.5 - inch barrel , and weighs in at 15.95 pounds unloaded .
Like the M249 , the MK46 has the same cyclic rate of fire of 750 rounds per minute .
" We are interested in the MK46 , " said Army Maj .
Thomas Henthorn , chief of the small - arms division at Benning , describing his brief impressions after shooting the MK46 there Aug .
6 . " It does feel lighter than the SAW . "
Benning officials were quick to point out , though , that no decisions have been made on the MK46 , and they offered no timeline for future testing .
NOT GOING AWAY COMPLETELY
Marine officials are adamant the SAW is not going away .
The M249 will remain in use by the rest of the Corps and will be available to Marine infantry commanders if they feel they need more firepower , Cantwell said .
The plan is to buy 4,100 IARs and reduce the number of SAWs in the Corps from 10,000 to 8,000 , Cantwell said .
" We are still going to maintain SAWs in the company , " he said .
" Only 2,000 SAWs will be replaced .
The reminder will be kept as an organizational weapon for when commanders need them . "
The Marine Corps has been talking about the need for a lightweight IAR since 2001 .
But the program picked up momentum in early summer when Marine weapons officials began testing prototypes from several gun makers .
Corps officials would not say which companies are participating in the program .
But so far , officials from FNH USA , the current maker of the M249 ; General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products ; Heckler & Koch ; LWRC International LLC ; and Patriot Ordnance Factory Inc. have confirmed they are competing for the contract .
Weapons sources also confirmed that Colt Defense LLC is participating in the IAR competition , but Colt officials would neither confirm nor deny the companys participation .
One of the biggest changes Marine gunners will notice about the IAR is that its magazine - fed only , compared with the M249s belted ammunition .
The M249 also can fire standard - issue magazines .
Early on in the program , the requirement called for the IAR to use detachable , 100 - round magazines .
Now , Marine weapons officials are requiring only that it be able to run on the same 30 - round magazines infantrymen use in their M16A4 rifles and M4 carbines .
Large - capacity magazines are not being ruled out for the future , but " we wanted everybody to have the same ammo and the same magazine , " Cantwell said , explaining that is easier to redistribute ammo when all the magazines are the same .
Army infantry officials maintain that switching from a 200 - round belt to a 30 - round magazine would cause Army squads to lose the high rate of fire they have with the M249 .
" Volume of fire is important , " Radcliffe said .
" The Marine Corps thinks it can get that out of a magazine - fed weapon .
We dont think the Army can . "
The M249s sustained rate of fire is 85 rounds per minute .
The requirement for the IAR calls for the weapon to fire 36 rounds per minute for 16 minutes , 40 seconds .
The IAR also will be able to fire at a higher rate of 75 rounds per minute for eight minutes , Cantwell said .
Unlike the M249

ADDING INSULT TO INJURY ….
Michigan is arguably the top “ blue state ” target of the McCain campaign , and it ’s an unpredictable contest , for a variety of reasons .
State Republicans , though , have a plan to give the McCain campaign an edge : suppress the vote .
The chairman of the Republican Party in Macomb County Michigan , a key swing county in a key swing state , is planning to use a list of foreclosed homes to block people from voting in the upcoming election as part of the state GOP ’s effort to challenge some voters on Election Day .
“ We will have a list of foreclosed homes and will make sure people are n’t voting from those addresses , ” party chairman James Carabelli told Michigan Messenger in a telephone interview earlier this week .
He said the local party wanted to make sure that proper electoral procedures were followed .
State election rules allow parties to assign “ election challengers ” to polls to monitor the election .
In addition to observing the poll workers , these volunteers can challenge the eligibility of any voter provided they “ have a good reason to believe ” that the person is not eligible to vote .
One allowable reason is that the person is not a “ true resident of the city or township . ”
The Michigan Republicans ’ planned use of foreclosure lists is apparently an attempt to challenge ineligible voters as not being “ true residents . ”
The scheme would , of course , disproportionately affect African - American families in the area , who are more likely to vote Democratic , and more likely to be in foreclosure as a result of sub - prime loans .
This is just part of a “ comprehensive voter - challenge campaign ” Michigan Republicans are launching this year , which will coordinate with the regional McCain campaign to train volunteers in challenging those who wish to vote on Election Day .
( Whether the foreclosure - driven scheme will be implemented statewide is unclear . )
Asked about the GOP ’s efforts , Carabelli said , “ I would rather not tell you all the things we are doing . ”
Because nothing says “ democracy ” like Republicans acting in secret to prevent Americans from participating in an election .
And nothing says “ in touch with the needs of working families ” like trying to capitalize , politically , on a foreclosure crisis , by stopping victims from voting .
The mind reels .
OPW INTERVIEW -- Aug 30 -- Mike Jones is now an advisor to Userplane and AOL and is CEO of Tsavo .
What is this mysterious Tsavo ?
Here 's my interview with Mike . - Mark Brooks
What 's your role at Tsavo and AOL now ?
With AOL I function as a Strategic Advisor , facilitating the transition to Sam Wick for daily management of the Userplane business .
The majority of my time operationally is setting up Tsavo and finalizing the transition with some of our initial , undisclosed acquisitions .
Tell us more about Tsavo .
Tsavo is focused on building technology facilitating highly - personal and relevant experiences with online content .
I would like to see a world where , instead of browsing through 30,000 blog posts a day , there is a system that actively understands and learns my media consumption behavior .
What kind of media are you particularly going to be looking at and serving up to users ?
Our current focus is on a wide - reaching publishing network with niche vertical focus .
Overall we are viewing it from the standpoint that Tsavo will be a multi URL network across a whole series of verticals .
Is there an official launch date ?
No there ’s not .
Since we ’re starting off with a few acquisitions , we have active staff and revenue today ; my CTO Nate Thelen and his lead engineer Gabe Harriman and our head of product Mike Macaadan focus primarily on building the relevancy sub-structure .
You will begin seeing our acquisition announcements in the next few months , and the relevancy technology begin surfacing in the next six months and beyond .
What kinds of sites and services are you looking to acquire at this stage ?
We ’re looking for content sites that have strong editorial and original content .
We ’re looking for a few back - end technologies that relate the semantic web and content aggregation .
Are dating sites within your realm of interest ?
Probably not .
I do n’t believe it will fit initially with our focus on media & relevance .
I do have interest and am researching other types of subscription services .

When Labour cabinet members were asked about their religious allegiances last December , following Tony Blair 's official conversion to Roman Catholicism , it turned out that more than half of them are not believers .
The least equivocal about their atheism were the health secretary , Alan Johnson , and foreign secretary David Miliband .
The fact that Miliband is an atheist is a matter of special interest given the likelihood that he may one day , and perhaps soon , occupy No 10 .
In our present uncomfortable climate of quarrels between pushy religionists and resisting secularists - or attack - dog secularists and defensive religionists : which side you are on determines how you see it - there are many reasons why it would be a great advantage to everyone to have an atheist prime minister .
Atheist leaders are not going to think they are getting messages from Beyond telling them to go to war .
They will not cloak themselves in supernaturalistic justifications , as Blair came perilously close to doing when interviewed about the decision to invade Iraq .
Atheist leaders will be sceptical about the claims of religious groups to be more important than other civil society organisations in doing good , getting public funds , meriting special privileges and exemptions from laws , and having seats in the legislature and legal protection from criticism , satire and challenge .
Atheist leaders are going to be more sceptical about inculcating sectarian beliefs into small children ghettoised into publicly funded faith - based schools , risking social divisiveness and possible future conflict .
They will be readier to learn Northern Ireland 's bleak lesson in this regard .
Atheist leaders will , by definition , be neutral between the different religious pressure groups in society , and will have no temptation not to be even - handed because of an allegiance to the outlook of just one of those groups .
Atheist leaders are more likely to take a literally down - to - earth view of the needs , interests and circumstances of people in the here and now , and will not be influenced by the belief that present sufferings and inequalities will be compensated in some posthumous dispensation .
This is not a trivial point : for most of history those lower down the social ladder have been promised a perch at the top when dead , and kept quiet thereby .
The claim that in an imperfect world one 's hopes are better fixed on the afterlife than on hopes of earthly paradises is official church doctrine .
Atheist leaders will not be tempted to think they are the messenger of any good news from above , or the agent of any higher purpose on earth .
Or at very least , they will not think this literally .
Best of all , if David Miliband becomes prime minister , the prospect of disestablishment of the Church of England will have come closer .
This is a matter of importance , for two chief reasons .
The first is that the CofE 's privileged position gives other religious groups too much incentive to try sharp - elbowing their way into getting similar privileges , such as the ear of ministers , tax exemptions , public funding for their own sect 's faith schools , and the big prize of seats in the legislature .
Secondly , the CofE has far too big a footprint in the public domain , out of all proportion to the actual numbers it represents : just 2 % of the population go weekly to its churches .
Yet it controls the primary school system - 80 % of it - and a substantial proportion of the secondary school system , with dozens more academy schools soon due to fall under its control .
It is entitled to have 26 bishops sitting in the House of Lords , plus a number more who have been made life peers on retiring ; and it has the automatic ear of government - do not suppose that if Rowan Williams phones
No 10 he is told no one is at home .
Having a statedly atheist British prime minister makes it more likely that the functional secularity of British life and politics , the foregoing exceptions noted , will become actual secularity .
Secularism means that matters of public policy and government are not under the influence , still less control , of sectarian religious interests .
The phrase " separation of church and state " does not quite capture the sense in which a genuinely secular arrangement keeps religious voices on a par with all other non-governmental voices in the public square , and all the non-governmental players in the public square separate from the government itself .
It means that churches and religious movements have to see themselves as civil society organisations like trades unions , political parties , the Scouts , and so on : with every right to exist , and to have their say , but as self - constituted interest groups no more entitled to a bigger share of the public pie of influence , privilege , tax handouts , and legal exemptions than any other self - appointed interest group .
As things stand , religious groups in our society get a slice of the pie vastly larger than their numbers or merits truly justify .
The big advantage of an atheist prime minister would be that he or she would see that fact , and act accordingly .
An atheist is not going to have the lingering sense that because someone has chosen to believe one or another ancient dogma , he is to be respected and honoured , listened to , given the public 's money to bring up his children in the same beliefs and exempted from some of the laws of the land .
Note that none of the foregoing represents either a desire or a prediction that an atheist prime minister will actively militate against religion , certainly not by outlawing it or passing laws that make religious observance more difficult .
Instead , one result of the removal of privileges and public money might be that the artificial amplification of religious voices and points of view in our society , and the hold that religion can exert on children and the psychologically needy , might become less .
Religion flourishes in conditions of active support and active persecution ; in a socially and politically liberal climate it diminishes through natural causes .
Religion is a matter of choice in that , unlike race , age , gender or disability , you can change it , or not have it at all .
True , most people 's faith was driven into them when they were small children , and belief can be hard to shake off if your community will reject or hurt you for your apostasy .
But it is still fundamentally voluntary .
As such it should pay its own way and take its place in the queue along with everyone else .
That is something that an atheist prime minister might say , and we might all breathe a great deal more easily as a result .
Despite appearances , the world is not seeing a resurgence of religion , only a big turning - up of the volume of religious voices .
This is itself a response to increasing secularism among people tired of the disruptions , obstructions and conflicts religion so often causes .
Public acknowledgement of atheism by a senior politician who might soon lead his country is just one indicator of the fact that the tide is actually running in the opposite direction : and that is a welcome and hopeful sign .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
It took the Trim family of Arlington , Texas , three hours to go $ 15,000 into debt .
Alex Trim 's three - hour ER visit after a bicycle accident resulted in a $ 15,000 medical bill .
One evening last spring , Alex Trim was knocked unconscious when a car hit his bike and he slammed into the windshield .
Three hours , many stitches and seven CT scans later , Alex was discharged in pretty good shape .
About a month later , the bill arrived in the mail .
" I did n't have a clue you could go into $ 15,000 debt in one night , " said Alex 's father , Callvin Trim .
" When I saw that bill , I was just kind of numb . "
That did n't even count bills from the doctors and the ambulance service .
Plus , Trim , who has insurance , owed more than $ 1,100 in copayments from when he'd had kidney stones earlier in the year .
His son did not have insurance .
Trim said it was " very expensive " to add him to his own policy at the private school where he's an IT director .
His wife , Gayle , had just started a job as an executive assistant at a commercial real estate company and was n't yet eligible for insurance .
A report out last month from the Commonwealth Fund found that 28 percent of the population said they were paying off medical debt in 2007 , up from 21 percent in 2005 .
" Two - thirds of the people who go into medical debt have insurance , " said Mark Rukavina , executive director of the Access Project .
" When medical debt hits , it hits very quickly .
It 's a jolt , and it 's generally not very predictable . "
" These are all honest , hardworking people , " added Jessie Maurer , a medical billing advocate in West Des Moines , Iowa , who helped the Trims .
" This could happen to just about anybody . "
By avoiding the mistakes below , the Trims managed to get their debt under control .
Here 's how they did it .
Mistake No. 1 : You ignore your bills
" The most dangerous thing people do when they get into debt is ignore the statements and notices , " said Mary Jean Geroulo , a former hospital administrator and now a partner at Stewart and Stimmel , a health care law firm in Dallas , Texas .
" They think doctors and hospitals wo n't send them to collection agencies , but they absolutely will , " she added .
As soon as he received the whopping bill from the hospital , the Trims contacted Maurer , the medical billing advocate .
To find an advocate , visit the Medical Billing Advocates of America .
The Fairness Foundation and the National Foundation for Credit Counseling also offer help to those in debt .
Mistake No. 2 : You do n't look for errors in your bills
" I had a client once who was charged for a surgery she never had , " said Nora Johnson , vice president of Medical Billing Advocates of America in Caldwell , West Virginia .
" Another one was charged more than $ 5,000 for disposable gloves . "
Maurer says she caught about $ 3,000 in errors in Alex Trim 's bills .
To catch errors , you have to get an itemized bill .
Trim had to ask for one ; he says the hospital did n't automatically send it .
Mistake No. 3 : You do n't negotiate the price down
" People think they have to pay the amount on the bill .
But doctors and hospitals are very willing to negotiate , " Rukavina said .
" Remember , the squeaky wheel gets the grease . "
Maurer , for example , says one of her clients owed $ 14,000 for a five - hour stay in a hospital emergency room .
" She could afford to pay $ 4,000 , so I told her , ' Show them a certified check for $ 4,000 . '
She did and told them , ' This is all I have in the world , ' and they took it . "
The hospital that treated Trim took $ 2,000 off his bill , which brought the final charges down to $ 10,000 .
Mistake No. 4 : You 're embarrassed to ask for financial assistance
There are an abundance of organizations to help people financially strapped with medical debt , but you have to seek them out .
The Patient Advocate Foundation has a state - by - state directory of financial resources .
The foundation also has a program for " co- pay relief " ( if your co-pay is , say , 20 percent , 20 percent of a $ 200,000 hospital bill is a lot of money ) .
Since many financial assistance programs are for one specific illness , it 's worth searching around on the Internet .
Cancer patients should read this Empowered Patient column with information on financial resources for people with cancer .
Mistake No. 5 : You do n't work out a payment plan
Just as hospitals and doctors are often willing to negotiate on prices , they 're also often willing to work out interest - free monthly payments .
To pay off his debt , Trim worked out interest - free monthly payments with the doctors and hospitals that treated him and his son .
He pays $ 250 a month and owes so many different people , he is n't sure how much he owes in total -- but he knows it 's at least $ 10,000 .
" My whole life , I 've tried to be smart with money , " he said .
" Now I 've had to empty out my 401 ( k ) to pay for all this . "
Of course , it 's best to avoid medical debt in the first place .
If you do n't have insurance , take this eligibility quiz to find out whether you qualify for low - cost public health insurance programs .
The group Coverage for
All also offers a state - by - state guide of health - care choices and has a help line open 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
The Department of Health and Human Services has a guide to low - cost insurance programs especially for children .
If you have insurance , make sure it pays every penny it owes .
See this Empowered Patient on challenging insurance company denials , and remember the golden rule : appeal , appeal , appeal .
" Do n't take a ' no ' from the customer service representative on the other end of the 800 number , " Rukavina of the Access Project said .
" Always issue a complaint or grievance . "
Shopping around at different hospitals before you have an expensive procedure can save you thousands of dollars when it comes time to pay co-payments .
" I used to run hospitals , so I know how these things are priced , " Geroulo said .
" Just because a procedure costs $ 10,000 at one hospital does n't mean you can't find it for $ 5,000 down the road . "
She adds that although most of us shop around for other large purchases , like a car , we 're not used to doing so for medical procedures .
" Patients need to learn to be a lot smarter and a lot savvier about their health care , " Geroulo said .

A new survey of global public opinion [ PDF ] reveals the appalling truth .
Americans are now among the people on earth most supportive of government 's torturing prisoners .
The United States is in the same public opinion ballpark as some of the most disgusting regimes on the planet :
Support for the unequivocal position was highest in Spain ( 82 % ) , Great Britain ( 82 % ) and France ( 82 % ) , followed by Mexico ( 73 % ) , China ( 66 % ) , the Palestinian territories ( 66 % ) , Poland ( 62 % ) , Indonesia ( 61 % ) , and the Ukraine ( 59 % ) .
In five countries either modest majorities or pluralities support a ban on all torture : Azerbaijan ( 54 % ) , Egypt ( 54 % ) , the United States ( 53 % ) , Russia ( 49 % ) , and Iran ( 43 % ) .
South Koreans are divided .
So America 's peers in the fight against torture , in terms of public opinion are Azerbaijan , Egypt , Russia , and Iran .
This is what America now is : a country with the moral values of countries that routinely torture and abuse prisoners , like Egypt and Iran .
Even the Chinese , living in a neo - fascist market state , oppose torture in all circumstances by 66 percent , compared to Americans where only 53 percent do !
More horrifying : a higher percentage of Americans - 13 percent - believe that torture should generally be allowed than in any other country save China , Turkey and Nigeria .
And in the last two years , as the American president celebrates and authorizes the torture of people who have not been allowed a fair trail , support for torturing terror suspects has increased from 36 percent to 44 percent .
The only other countries where support for torturing terror suspects has grown are India , Nigeria , Turkey , South Korea and Egypt .
In all other developed countries , support for an absolute ban on torture has actually risen in the past two years .
America is now leading the way in legitimizing and celebrating torture as a legitimate tool for governments .
After the technical sessions concluded on the first day of OSCON , some attendees headed across town to see Mark Shuttleworth , the charismatic founder of the Ubuntu Linux distribution , give a presentation to local Portland group Legion of Tech .
This took place at McMenamins , an unusual venue where theater and pub converge to provide an atmosphere that is emblematic of Portland 's unique culture .
During the presentation , Shuttleworth delved into his past experiences , discussed the challenges and joys of space tourism , and provided intriguing insights into his vision for the future of humanity and the Linux operating system .
Shuttleworth , who traveled to space in a Russian Soyuz craft in 2001 after selling his company Thawte to Verisign , is notable for being the second self - funded space tourist .
During his presentation at McMenamins , he shared the details of his experience in space .
He spoke fondly of the time he spent training in Russia and described several aspects of space flight and astronaut traditions .
" [ It was ] an extraordinary privilege to have gone through and one that I hope to repeat , " he said .
He also shared his views about the future of the space program and the importance of reaching for the stars .
Although he believes that manned research efforts in space are too costly and less efficient than more automated approaches , he contends that humanity 's experience in space will be essential for shaping a future in which society extends beyond earth 's sphere .
" A majority of our space research should be unmanned , " he remarked .
" But fundamentally , [ experience in space ] is our life boat — that 's what the dinosaurs did n't have , so it 's essential research . "
Shuttleworth is particularly emphatic about the need to conduct more extensive research on Mars , and the potential for Mars to sustain life — a possibility that he regards as " profound " in significance .
Linux with global impact
After returning from his trip into space , he decided that he wanted to turn his attention to efforts that could have a broader positive impact .
His enthusiasm for using Linux to bring affordable technology to the developing world was sparked by a promising project he saw in Africa that promoted Linux adoption in classrooms .
He began to work towards creating Ubuntu by leveraging his previous experiences with the Debian community .
" I wanted to be sure that anything I devoted time to would potentially have a global impact , " he said .
" It struck me that there was a real opportunity to have a global impact by accelerating development of the Linux desktop . "
The community , he said , was " only just scratching the surface of what was possible with free software , " and he wanted to take it to the next level by finding a way to " deliver the pieces that Debian could n't deliver on its own . "
To do that , he believed that the key was to build a completely free stack that could be released at consistent and predictable intervals with solid commercial and community backing .
He wanted to pursue a completely service - driven business model so that the distribution could be done for free .
Delivering that preintegrated stack and achieving profitability while adhering to the community 's values is the highest priority for Canonical , Shuttleworth 's company .
He acknowledges that the business model is unproven , but he is convinced that its enormous potential is worth the risk .
" The process of delivery is a real responsibility , " he said .
" I believe passionately that we can make this commercially sustainable . "
He sees the greatest potential for growth in emerging markets and in the mobile space , where he believes that software freedom has the most to offer .
His mission is to bring Linux to new audiences , he said , not to displace the other major distributions .
He notes that the subnotebook market offers a unique opportunity for Linux vendors .
" I think there is real room for linux to be a commercial success there , " he said .
He is also enthusiastic about Canonical 's partnership with Intel on the Moblin project , which seeks to create a standardized Linux platform for mobile Internet devices .
Shuttleworth 's presentation offered a compelling glimpse at the man behind one of the most successful Linux distributions .
His dynamic style of expression and obvious enthusiasm for Linux and space exploration captivated the audience .
Although Shuttleworth 's ambitions and sometimes misguided opinions have evoked controversy and strong responses from both critics and supporters in the past , the vision he shared during his presentation at McMenamins is one that held universal appeal to listeners .
Shuttleworth — the shrewd businessman who has touched the stars and poetically articulates his hopes for a more noble future for humanity — is a speaker that one does not quickly forget .
He is scheduled to speak again today at OSCON during a formal keynote , but I doubt that it will be as compelling as the personal revelations that he shared in that small theater last night .
Washington , August 26 : Researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center , Emory University , US , have shown by experiments that monkeys have the feeling of empathy , and they enjoy sharing things with others .
Empathy in seeing the pleasure of another ’s fortune is thought to be the impetus for sharing , a trait this study shows transcends primate species .
For the experiment , Frans de Waal , director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes Research Center , and Kristi Leimgruber , research specialist , led a team of researchers who exchanged tokens for food with eight adult female capuchin monkeys .
Each capuchin was paired with a relative , an unrelated familiar female from her own social group or a stranger ( a female from a different group ) .
The capuchins were then given the choice of two tokens : the selfish option , which rewarded that capuchin alone with an apple slice ; or the pro-social option , which rewarded both capuchins with an apple slice .
The monkeys predominantly selected the pro-social token when paired with a relative or familiar individual , but not when paired with a stranger .
According to de Waal , “ The fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them . ”
“ We believe prosocial behavior is empathy based .
Empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness , and in our study , closer partners made more prosocial choices .
They seem to care for the welfare of those they know , ” he added .
de Waal and his research team will next attempt to determine whether giving is self - rewarding to capuchins because they can eat together or if the monkeys simply like to see the other monkey enjoying food .

For my money , Christine Peterson offered the most important message I heard at OSCON .
Way back when , she invented the term “ Open Source ” and , if we get behind it , which we should , the No Secret Software !
rallying cry could be as big or bigger .
It ’s simple : when data is gathered and used for the people as part of civic processes ( voting is a good example ) , processing it using secret software , especially if it ’s a private - sector secret , should be totally out of bounds .
This is very closely aligned to the struggle for the use of open - source software where appropriate , but “ Open Source ” is a term of art and is associated with ill - groomed inarticulate geeks who have odd opinions about lots of things .
“ Secret software ” is a term that anyone can understand instantly , and it sounds creepy and dangerous ; because secret software in the public sector is creepy and dangerous , and simply should n’t be allowed .
Ms Peterson gently chided the Open - Source community for having let the e-voting debacle happen in the first place ; it was foreseeable and should have been headed off .
I think she has a point .
Her aim in the OSCON talk ( which is online at blip.tv ) was to give warning of similar battles looming in the realm of security data , which is already vast and is growing fast .
It will be gathered by our governments and will be put to lots of uses involving lots of software and storage .
We will get better security and simultaneously less potential for abuse if we rule out the use of secret software .
So , let ’s do that .
It ’s not enough to be right about an important issue .
It ’s vital to frame our opinions and beliefs in language that ’s simple and believable and whose meaning is clear and self - evident .
I think we ’re in Ms Peterson ’s debt for giving us this important rhetorical tool .
I ’m going to start putting it to use whenever these issues come up in the civic sector .
I think if we all get behind this , we ’ll strengthen our position in some debates that really matter , and we ’ll be better citizens .

I was sick last weekend , and I 'm still feeling lousy .
I have no energy and feel like I could sleep all the time .
If I 'm not feeling any better by this afternoon , I 'll probably have to visit the doctor .
I 've just been holding off because of the expense .
You see , I recently opted out of my employer - paid medical plan for a free one withbetter benefits .
The new plan does not even require me to visit health care providers .
All I have to do is pray .
Health care will be a big issue in the 2008 U.S. election .
Given that the United States is the only Western democracy without universal health care , it should be a big issue .
While Obama promises universal health care , McCain seems satisfied with the quality of our current health care system , a system ranked 37th by the World Health Organization .
I propose a two - tiered system of universal health care for the United States which would be far less expensive than anything the Democratic Party has in mind .
Under my plan , atheists would receive health care at government expense just like what everyone receives in the counties with the highest quality health care systems .
Christians and believers of other absurdities would automatically be placed on the Prayer Care Plan .
This plan would not cost the government ( or anyone else ) anything at all .
When believers got sick , they would pray for recovery .
It 's really that simple .
Of course , any participant of the Prayer Care Plan could switch to the secular version and receive actual health care whenever they decided to abandon their ridiculous faith .
Of course , I suspect few would switch .
After all , prayer is a great cure for all ailments .
( Cough , cough ! )
I 'm feeling better already .
Obama brings in $ 66 million for August RAW STORY
Published : Sunday September 14 , 2008
Print This Email This Breaking the monthly record for presidential campaign fundraising yet again , Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama brought in $ 66 million for the month of August , several news agencies reported .
The Obama campaign added more than 500,000 first - time donors in August , bringing the total number of contributers to his historical bid for the presidency to 2.5 million , The Washington Post reported .
Campaign officials attribute the success to McCain 's nomination of Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate , a choice that also brought an influx of money to John McCain , who raised $ 47 million in August , his last month of private fundraising and best month so far .
" John McCain says that he 'll take on the special interests and lobbyists , but McCain can't fix a problem he 's been part of for three decades .
The 500,000 new donors to the Obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the American people are looking to kick the special interests out and change Washington , " said David Plouffe , Obama 's campaign manager .
Although the Obama campaign said its total cash on hand in August was $ 77 million , that wealth may not translate into an advantage over John McCain , Reuters reported .
Both candidates are aided by their parties and the Republican National Committee is generally more successful at gathering funds than its Democratic counterpart .
Reports indicate that the Democratic National Committee has fallen short of August fundraising goals .
Obama will seek to press home his advantage through large - scale advertising blitzes , seek to stretch McCain 's limited resources across the electoral map and fire up a massive get - out - the vote effort , Agence France Presse reported .
Latest polls Sunday showed a tight race , with a slim advantage to McCain .
The Republican led by three points by 50 to 47 percent in Sunday 's tracking survey by Rasmussen .
Gallup 's latest snapshot on Saturday had McCain up 47 percent to 45 percent .
But Obama opened up a 12 point lead in the midwestern battleground of Iowa , 52 percent to 40 percent , according to a Des Moines Register poll .
The state went Republican in 2004 .

Physicists have investigated little - known solutions to Maxwell ’s equations , in which light beams can be linked and knotted in various configurations .

Usually , light beams shine in a straight line , with the possible exception of light being bent by gravity .
But scientists are now investigating how to make light beams into looped and knotted configurations .
The possibility for these structured light beams arises from some curious solutions to Maxwell ’s equations , which describe the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism .
Physicists William Irvine of New York University and Dirk Bouwmeester of the University of California , Santa Barbara , and Leiden University in The Netherlands have published a study in Nature Physics on their analysis of knotted light .
The scientists looked at the physical properties of knotted light and discovered that it can be experimentally generated using circularly polarized laser beams .
In some little - known solutions to Maxwell ’s equations , all the electric and magnetic field lines form circles that are all linked to each other .
These loops of field lines can be used to construct the donut shape of a torus .
In such a scenario , each circle wraps around the torus once , and no two circles cross each other .
Smaller tori could then be nested within larger ones , filling three - dimensional space with circles of light beams .
These solutions differ from any known existing form of light because of the intricate knotted structure , the physicists told PhysOrg.com .
As they explained , this structure is based on the Hopf fibration , which was introduced in 1931 to mathematically investigate the structure of spheres in four and higher dimensions , a topic that seemingly has nothing to do with light .
After investigating knotted light ’s properties , the physicists determined that they could use laser fields to create the structures .
Starting with a single - pulsed beam of circularly polarized light , and tightly focusing the beam , it should be possible to create various shapes of looped light beams .
By using holographic techniques and a spatial light modulator , the shape and profile of the looped light could also be controlled .
These same techniques have recently been used to produce Airy beams , which are light beams that do n’t spread out as they propagate .
Currently the physicists are preparing for an experimental realization of the new solutions either using electromagnetic radiation in the optical regime , i.e. light , or in the microwave regime .
The main challenge will be to deal with ultra-short pulses of radiation in order to create a broad spectrum of frequencies as needed for the construction of the light knots .
Because knotted light beams have both beamlike properties and unique unexplored properties , the physicists predict that creating the beams could have applications in several areas .
These could include applications in plasma confinement , atomic particle trapping , manipulating cold atomic ensembles , and generating soliton - like solutions in nonlinear media .

The Archers is a radio soap opera - " an everyday story of country folk " - that has been running for more than 15,000 episodes since May 1950 .
What I find particularly intriguing about The Archers in terms of the future of radio is that it is , in a way , happening in real - time .
Every evening on Radio 4 the programme contains events that happened ( approximately ) " today " in Ambridge - so if it 's Easter in real - life then it 's Easter in The Archers .
It 's also very topical - featuring real - life events such as outbreaks of foot - and - mouth disease or the World Cup .
As a drama , each episode is split into distinct scenes - typically indicated by a fading to silence - a convention for audio drama because of its need for clear signposting .
The other interesting aspect is the many distinct facets of each scene - which characters are involved , the time of day , the current location , the storylines that intersect at that moment and even the weather .
So earlier this year the Radio Labs team started to design and build a prototype website for The Archers based around the drama 's scenes and facets .
To start with we created a data model that represented what we thought was important in The Archers - including scenes , characters , character relationships ( such as marriages or parent - child ) , locations , storylines and tags .
Then we took the daily Archers podcast and built a web interface for a production team to use to segment and tag each episode .
This allows a user to split the episodes into individual non-overlapping scenes and describe each scene with a title and synopsis and then tag it with the characters , location , storyline , weather and anything else they can think of .
Once the user has finished this splitting and tagging , the individual scenes are extracted from the audio , saved as separate MP3 files ( using ffmpeg if you 're interested ) and associated with the metadata .
Now we 've got lots of scenes from the drama as MP3 files , timelines , storylines , characters and geography ( we 've even got maps ! ) .
What kind of Archers website could we build round this ?
First we created pages for every one of these facets ; a page for every episode , for every scene , for every character , every family , every storyline , every place and every tag .
Each of these pages aggregates the scenes that were involved and , at the second order , the characters / storylines / places / tags / etc that were also involved in those scenes .
All of these facets are clickable so you can browse from a character to a storyline to another character and so on .
And on each page the relevant scene 's audio is aggregated in a single player - allowing you to catch up fully on that storyline or character , just listen to individual scenes or skip past the characters you do n't like .
That 's about as far as we got - building the skeleton of an enhanced Archers website allowing you to navigate around and through all the facets of this drama .
But from this data we could also create custom podcast feeds for each of these pages - just want the Archers podcast for scenes featuring Eddie Grundy ?
Or a cut - down omnibus podcast with just the most crucial scenes for each week ?
No problem .
We could even do a podcast feed for just those scenes featuring cows !
One problem with a real implementation of this concept is that we only have 7 - day Listen Again rights for the audio .
So only the episodes and scenes for the last week would feature any audio .
But thanks to the annotations we can create in the production interface and the superbly detailed episode synopses on the Archers website we should still be able to build something that works as an audio- less , text - enhanced service .
So ... going back to my initial thoughts about how the Archers is in some kind of pseudo - real - time .
My favourite idea would be to deliver the scenes from the Archers to the audience * as they happen * - so at 11 in the morning , when over in Ambridge Kathy has gone over to Home Farm for coffee , your podcast application gets updated in real - time with that latest scene .
Or maybe with some clever VOIP shenanigans we could phone you up and let you listen in to the conversations in The Bull .
For the dedicated Archers fans only I suspect .
Finally , some other thoughts :
Social history - The Archers often includes topical events and current affairs and generally represents the era in which we now live .
So having an accessible , findable , addressable archive on the web going back 50 years could be a valuable social history resource .
Going smaller -
Are scenes and characters the smallest units we can chop this drama into ?
Practically I think they are , though one could imagine going towards a finer grain of detail with marked - up conversations , characters ' movements between locations , internal motivations ...
What we built is only an incomplete internal prototype for the moment , there 's lots more to do and there are lots of issues about how we'd do this for real - particularly around how we would practically annotate all these episodes .
Maybe it could be a community thing ?
Interestingly , though possibly not surprisingly , the BBC has looked at this area before - Celia Romaniuk presented a paper on " Soap Operas and the Semantic Web " back in 2003 proposing an RDF vocabulary for describing the world of soap operas .

As a result , the credit default market is best described as an insurance market where many of the individual trades are undercapitalized .
But even worse , many of the insurers are grossly undercapitalized .
In one case in the New York courts , the Swiss banking giant UBS is suing a hedge fund that said it would insure nearly $ 1.5 billion in bonds but was unable to do so .
No wonder  the hedge fund had only $ 200 million in assets .
If A.I.G. collapsed , its hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage - related assets would be added to those being sold by other financial institutions .
This would just depress values further .
The counterparties around the world to A.I.G. ’s credit default swaps may be unable to collect on their trades .
As a large hedge - fund investor , A.I.G. would suddenly become a large redeemer from hedge funds , forcing fund managers to sell positions and probably driving down prices in the world ’s financial markets .

The Federal Reserve was also trying to arrange at least $ 70 billion in loans from investment banks , but it ’s hard to see how Wall Street could come up with that much money .
More promisingly , A.I.G. asked the Federal Reserve for a bridge loan .
True , there is no precedent for the central bank to extend assistance to an insurance company .
But these are unprecedented times , and the Federal Reserve should provide A.I.G. with some form of financial support while the company liquidates its mortgage - related assets in an orderly manner .

Palin's Dominance Dooms McCain
Palin's Dominance Dooms McCain
The distinguished professor falls for a carnival headliner .
From The Blue Angel -- “ the downfall of an enamored man ” Image The Morning After the Party 's Over
Michael Collins
" Scoop " Independent News
( Wash .
DC ) Senator John McCain can't live without Sarah Palin but he can't live with her either , at least not much longer .
McCain is much like Professor Rath in " The Blue Angel . "
He 's infatuated with someone much younger and he has joined the carnival just to be near her .
The Palin act travels from one town to the next attracting crowds of Bush - Cheney dead enders .
She steps forward , with the confidence of a high school cheerleader while the full professor of perverse politics looks on with admiration and affection .
At the start of his campaign , he was unable to draw a crowd or deliver a speech that just about anyone found the least bit engaging .
In early side by side coverage of a same day event , CNN showed Obama hitting one out of the park and McCain struggling to engage 200 onlookers .
The net effect of the Palin addition is in dispute .
If you 're part of the Republican media shill brigade , it 's been terrific , a brilliant choice .
Looking at it objectively , there 's been little impact on the ticket , unless you buy into the Gallup Poll that showed what looked like a McCain convention bounce .
To " stand up " the bounce , Gallup simply added more Republicans to their sample , driving up McCain 's numbers .
But if you 're candidate John McCain , you 're locked and loaded , exhilarated , and infused vicariously by your vision of Palin 's draw .
Palin's job is to add luster to McCain but sometimes the candidate is just who he is - tired and weary .

McCain was a man of special privilege .
Despite his mild admonition for participating in the last financial meltdown due to his acceptance of gifts from savings and loan failure Charles Keating , McCain has been a press darling .
He 's provided good box office for sound bites on a variety of issues .
For a short time , he went against the grain of right wing madness .
In his Norfolk , Virginia speech announcing his 2000 candidacy for president , he took on the worst elements of U.S. politics .
McCain also pulled off one of the great pieces of modern street theater , also in the 2000 primaries .
He stood before the Russian embassy and castigated the New York Republican Party for taking his name off the primary ballot on a technicality .
He was quickly restored to the ballot .
But time and the nonstop coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign began to wear on his patience .
The press had actually criticized him , very lightly and not too often .
He was not pleased .
Then he got Palin .
Despite the array of initial criticism and the ongoing attacks on her character and political deviance , she 's shown that she can draw a crowd .
McCain was infatuated .
He followed her just about everywhere and continues to do so .
To a crowd of 7,000 people in Lancaster , PA , McCain said , " " With the help of this running mate , this stalwart and great American , we will always put our country first " Sept. 9 , 2008 .
The reality is another story .
For the first time in nearly eight years , a cross section of the corporate media has opened up on the right wing establishment .
The Post , a long time stenography pool for the Bush administration , ran a serious front page story on embarrassing family details .
The New York Times editorialized along with the St. Petersburg Times .
Now ABC 's Brian Ross and his Blotter investigative team are on the case .
You might remember Ross from " Foleygate , " the scandal that broke in late August 2006 and tarnished congressional Republicans right up until the 2006 mid term election .
Ross broke the story .
In less than one month , .he and his team produced over 20 stories on Foley and his relationship with congressional pages .
Now he and his " Blotter " team are focused on Palin .
On Sept. 11 , 2008 .
we got Palin Backstab ?
Commissioner Praised Then Fired followed up with ' Troopergate ' Inquiry Reaches Palin Husband on Sept. 12 .
Ross is approaching the pace of the Foley story .
In addition to corporate media news groups , the National Enquirer has a team on the ground in Alaska .
From the National Enquirer
Palin's Dominance Dooms McCain
What options does candidate McCain have right now ?
He can strike out on his own for rallies and events .
This is obviously necessary but represents a major gamble .
His crowds will soon be compared to hers and we know how that will come out .
He can continue to follow Palin and bask in the glow of her crowd pleasing act .
But to what end ?
The large media outlets will begin to comment on his dependent role as political house husband .
He 'll be seen as clinging to Palin 's apron strings , afraid to leave the nest , etc .
The third option consists of riding out the numerous scandals that are Palin .
Vindictive firings ; charging the state travel for 300 days spend at her home ; tens of thousands of airfares and other travel for her family ; book banning ; filtrations with the secessionist Alaska Independence Party ; etc .
There are so many developing scandals to choose from , including some that are n’t even hinted at currently .
Then there 's the Defenders of Wildlife devastating television ad on hunting wolves from airplanes and their micro documentary Aerial hunting in Alaska .
These are tearing up the airwaves at YouTube with original posts and mirrors totaling over a million views by now .
There are derivative videos that are equally devastating .
McCain took a " bridge to nowhere " thinking it was the path to his salvation .
Given his total abandonment of any degree of consistency and civility in this campaign , it 's hard to have much sympathy .
Palin was a bad move no matter how hard the Orwellian faction spins it .
Now Palin has McCain trapped .
Very soon , he wo n't be able to live with her .
But without her , his decent into triple digit crowds and positions that represent a shrinking minority of the electorate will only cause the public to recall his infatuation with a woman who encouraged the slaughter of wolves and payment for their subsequent dismemberment .

A team of Australian and US researchers have discovered a new species of iguana in the central regions of Fiji , which makes three living Pacific iguana species including one that is critically endangered .
The study suggests that the ancestors of the Pacific iguanas arrived up to 13 million years ago after an 8000 kilometer rafting trip from the New World .

Detailed genetic and morphological analyses show that there are three living kinds of Brachylophus iguanas , not two as indicated in current taxonomy .
Scientists named the newly revealed iguana species Brachylophus bulabula .
The scientific name bulabula is a doubling of bula , the Fijian word for ‘ hello , ’ thus signifying an even more enthusiastic greeting .
Fijian Iguana , Brachylophus fasciatus .

“ The iconic Fijian iguanas are famous for their beauty and also their unusual occurrence in the middle of the Pacific Ocean because all of their closest relatives are in the Americas ” , said Scott Keogh , an Associate Professor at the Australian National University in Canberra , Australia , and lead author of the study .
The other coauthors of the study are Danielle Edwards at the Australian National University , Robert Fisher at the U.S. Geological Survey in San Diego , and Peter Harlow at Macquarie University in Australia .
The mystery of how the Pacific iguanas originally arrived has long puzzled biogeographers .
Their closest relatives , found only in the New World , are separated by about 8,000 miles of ocean .
The highest islands of Fiji have been above sea level for at least the last 16 million years , and the current study ’s findings suggest that the Pacific iguanas , both extinct and living , were likely on the islands much of that time , following a long - distance rafting trip from the New World .
The Pacific iguanas have been adversely affected by human presence .
Two species were eaten to extinction after people arrived nearly 3,000 years ago .
The three living Brachylophus iguanas face threats from habitat loss and modification , and from feral cats , mongooses and goats .
The Fiji crested iguana , Brachylophus vitiensis , is now listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List .
An important study finding regarding conservation of the genetic diversity in these iguanas is that , with only one exception , every island for which there were samples was represented by at least one distinct iguana lineage .
The new discovery was published in a special themed edition of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B , which pays tribute to Charles Darwin ’s contribution to the Pacific region .

POPE Benedict XVI may have raised the ire of the Muslim world almost two years ago when he invoked a harsh medieval description of Islam during a speech in Germany , but for almost 300 Catholic pilgrims , an Islamic school will be home during World Youth Day .
" Pope Benedict clarified his comments on Islam , " said Pinad Elahmed , a teacher in charge of inter-religious activities at Malek Fahd school in Greenacre .
" Anyway , no one here even thought of it when we decided to offer hospitality to the pilgrims .
" We are Muslims but we are also very committed Australians and that means living in a multicultural , multi - faith country .

Over those five years , the U.S. manned space program will be relying heavily on Russia and its Baikonur Cosmodrome facility in Kazakhstan .
Baikonur is an entire Kazakh city , rented and administered by Russia .
The Cosmodrome was founded in 1955 , making it one of the oldest space launch facilites still in operation .

“ It is now clear that both John McCain and Rick Davis did not tell the truth about Davis ’s continuing financial relationship with Freddie Mac , one of the actors at the center of this financial crisis .
It ’s troubling not only that Davis ’s firm — with which he is still associated and which the McCain campaign paid directly last year — continued to be compensated by Freddie Mac until as recently as last month , but that the firm did little work and apparently was being paid simply to provide access to the McCain campaign .
“ The question that now needs to be answered is this : did Freddie Mac or any other special interests buy access to John McCain by compensating top officials , including Rick Davis ? ” said Obama - Biden communications director Dan Pfeiffer .

The index 's market cap stood at $ 118.36 billion at the end of trading Tuesday .
Outlook for Emerging Markets
" There is a general risk aversion going on at the moment , " said Julian Mayo , London - based co-manager of U.S. Global Investors Eastern European Fund EUROX , - 0.18 % .
" If you combine that with falling commodity prices , that 's why Russia is down , " Mayo said .
As of June 30 , about 62 % of the total net assets of the EUROX fund were invested in Russia .
The prices of oil and other commodities fell sharply on Tuesday .
See Futures Movers .
The latest sell - off in Russian equities follows a string of declines in recent weeks , triggered by Russia 's military conflict with Georgia , which broke out in early August and escalated tensions with the west , particularly the United States .
Oil and gas stocks , which dominate the RTS stock market , led the declines , with the RTS Oil & Gas index plunging 7.8 % .
Metals and mining shares also fell sharply .
For example , shares of mining giant Norilsk Nickel ( MNOD ) fell 12.8 % on the RTS exchange .
Shares of oil major Lukoil ( LKOD ) fell 9.3 % and state - controlled oil and gas giant Gazprom ( OGZD ) dropped 8.5 % .
In New York , the Market - Vectors Russia ETF RSX , - 0.52 % , which tracks the performance of the Russian stock market , fell 9.2 % .
Shares of steel company Mechel MTL , fell 13.6 % .
Shares of Vimpel Communications VIP , - 2.52 % dropped 11.1 % and Mobile TeleSystems MBT , - 2.61 % fell 8.6 % .
" The negative influence came from oil prices , " said Ilya Fedotov , senior analyst at Moscow - based Veles Capital Investment Company , in emailed comments .
" Also , further closing of marginal long positions has continued , while fire was further fueled by Russia 's finance minister 's comment on impossibility of further tax privileges for oil companies , " Fedotov said .
Russia 's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Tuesday that the oil industry should not expect any more large tax breaks , Reuters reported .
" As an economist , I can say that Russia has reached a line beyond which you cannot cut taxes , " Kudrin was quoted as saying .
Kudrin said that the recent tax breaks for the oil industry should be enough to boost growth in crude production , according to the report .
Major exporter of commodities
Russia is a major exporter of commodities such as oil and metals .
The Eastern European country has also been perceived as an increasingly risky bet following its military conflict with Georgia .
In the short term , the Russian market is being driven by sentiment and liquidity flows rather than fundamentals , Mayo said .
" We are not overly concerned because fundamentals remain very supportive in Russia , " Mayo said .
" The market is now trading at five times next year 's earnings . "
Oil prices have fallen from record highs near $ 147 a barrel to about $ 100 a barrel currently .
However , Russia will continue to run current account surpluses even if oil prices fell to $ 70 a barrel , Mayo said .
In addition , the latest earnings reports from most Russian companies were either in line with or above market expectations , he said .
Mayo is not very worried about the rise in geopolitical risk .
" If you look at the individual stocks , you say -- are these companies being affected by what 's happening in Georgia ? " he said .
" And the answer is clearly no .
Political noise is there , but ultimately it 's just that -- noise . "
Russian equities have fallen sharply in recent weeks , as many investors fled the market after the war with Georgia escalated geopolitical risk .
Even before the Georgia conflict , investors were put off by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin 's call for an investigation of Mechel , which wiped out billions of dollars of its market capitalization , as well as the dispute between oil giant BP Plc BP , - 2.80 % and its Russian partners in the TNK - BP joint venture .
More broadly , investors have been worried about state interference in the economy and the protection of property rights , especially when it comes to sectors the Russian government considers strategic , such as oil and gas .
In comparison to the RTS index 's 39 % tumble this year , the MSCI Emerging Markets index is down 28 % year - to - date .
Russian equity markets are at their lowest levels since the middle of 2006 , said Win Thin , senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in a research report .
" Some believe it is due to capital flight stemming from political tensions with Georgia and the West , " Thin said .
" However , we note that plunging commodity prices are also weighing on equities and the ruble . "
Russia 's central bank has intervened in the markets to support the falling ruble several times in recent weeks .
Russia has the third - largest reserves in the world , which stood at $ 582.5 billion as of Aug. 29 .
The Russian ruble is " fundamentally very undervalued still , " Mayo said .
" While sentiment may drive the currency down , we 'd expect appreciation of the ruble in the long term . "
EDITORIAL
THE Post today enthusiastically urges the election of Sen. John S. McCain as the 44th president of the United States .
McCain ’s lifelong record of service to America , his battle - tested courage , unshakeable devotion to principle and clear grasp of the dangers and opportunities now facing the nation stand in dramatic contrast to the tissue - paper - thin résumé of his Democratic opponent , freshman Sen. Barack Obama .
McCain has been in Washington for many years now , but he is not of Washington .
He knows where the levers of power are located – and how to manipulate them – but he is not controlled by them .
McCain ’s selection of the charming , but rock - solid , outsider Sarah Palin as his running mate underscores the point .
Neither plays well with others .
And this is an unalloyed asset at a time when special interests – lobbyists , lawyers and organized labor chief among them – wield enormous influence in the nation ’s capital .
McCain ’s Democratic opponents , Obama and Sen. Joseph Biden , lead a party constructed of special interests – public - employee unionists in particular .
There are many reasons to support the McCain - Palin ticket .
Here are but a few :
* National security : The differences between McCain and Obama are especially stark .
McCain says 9/11 represented a two - decade “ failure . . . to respond to . . . a [ growing ] global terror network . ”
He understood that Iraq is a critical front in the war on terror – and he urged perseverance even in the dark days that preceded the success of “ the surge . ”
Obama backed policies that would have abandoned Iraq to its fate , he bitterly opposed the surge , and once insisted that US forces invade Pakistan in search of Osama bin Laden – seemingly without regard for the potential consequences of attacking a nuclear - armed nation , ally or not .
Regarding a nuclear Iran , McCain has pushed for the strongest possible international sanctions and diplomatic pressure .
Obama opposes sanctions .
And , when Russia invaded the former Soviet republic of Georgia , threatening a return to the Cold War , McCain reacted with stern disapprobation : “ We must remind Russia ’s leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values , stability and peace of that world . ”
Obama called for UN action – unaware , apparently , that Russia ’s Security Council veto would have prevented any .
* Taxes : McCain knows that when government absorbs ever - larger shares of national income , the economy suffers .
High tax rates diminish investment , killing jobs and stunting growth .
And while Obama promises tax cuts for “ 95 percent ” of Americans , what he actually is proposing is some $ 650 billion in tax - credit - driven hikes in entitlement and other spending , to be paid for with heavier imposts across the board , but especially on investment – like a sharply higher capital - gains tax .
This is bad news for the millions of ordinary Americans who own stocks , either personally or through pension funds or who plan someday to sell their homes or other real property .
McCain , wisely , vows to keep capital - gains taxes at 15 percent and to keep the Bush - era tax cuts in place – understanding that new growth will boost revenue , and promising to make up the rest with spending restraint .
And he ’s called for a one - year freeze on most discretionary spending and an end to pork - barrel giveaways .
* Trade : “ I object when Senator Obama and others preach the false virtues of economic isolationism , ” says McCain – noting that “ globalization is an opportunity ” for US workers .
He adds that while emerging economies like those of China and India are worrisome , the answer is competition informed by education and innovation – not protectionism .
* Energy :
On the economic issue most vexing Americans today – energy prices – McCain is aggressive
He is a strong convert to offshore drilling : “ We have trillions of dollars ’ worth of oil and gas reserves in the US at a time we are exporting hundreds of billions of dollars a year overseas to buy energy . ”
He also strongly backs nuclear power – a carbon - free form of energy that America can produce relatively cheaply .
Obama , meanwhile , hews to the Democratic Party line on energy : no nukes , no drilling and no comprehension of the consequences of such policies .
None of this implies an iota of disrespect toward Obama .
It took a formidable candidacy to defeat Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton – a candidacy , by the way , which we strongly supported earlier this year .
And the intelligence , the organizational skills and the ability to communicate that Obama demonstrated from the beginning dramatically underscore the history that is being made by the first African - American to head a major - party presidential ticket .
He should be around for a long time , and we hope that he is .
In the end , though , sound security , economic and energy policies – plus allegiance to principle – are critical to keeping America safe and strong .
On all counts , John McCain and Sarah Palin understand this – and that ’s why we ’re in their corner to the finish .
It was once thought that the earliest recording of the human voice was made by Thomas Edison in 1877 , when he recorded Mary had a Little Lamb on his new invention – the phonograph .
BUT , a new recording has turned up .
It was made on April 9 , 1860 and it is of a woman singing the French folk song “ Claire de la lune ” .
It has now been heard for the first time in 150 years .
You can hear the recording here in mp3 format .
Do n’t expect Dark side of the Moon production here – remember , we ’re talking first recordings ever made .
The interesting thing is that the recording was never intended to be played back – or at least the technology to play it back was never imagined at the time .
It was recorded by a “ phonautograph ” , which etches waveforms onto paper .
French inventor Edouard - Leon Scott de Martinville built the device , which uses a diaphragm that responds to sound to etch the lines onto paper via the soot from an oil lamp .
Scientists have managed to play back the recording using a virtual “ stylus ” , which is really a computer program that reads the recording from a scanned image .
The process sort of reminds me of this extremely interesting technique .
A group of audio historians called “ First Sounds ” have been working as archiving early recordings and worked with Paresian Mr. Giovanni , who retreived the sounds from the paper at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBNL ) in California .
As the phonautograph was a manually - cranked device ( no , they did n’t have crystal timing then ! ) , the speed varied throughout the recording and likewise the pitch changes somewhat over time , giving it a bit of a warbly sound .
The oldest sound ever recorded ( also on the phonautograph ) is here .
It ’s one of the early “ beta tests ” of the unit , and yielded a garbled mess .
The oldest recognizable sound ever recorded was that of a tuning fork at 435 Hz on the phonautograph .
Presented here in various stages of restoration .
If you ’re into vintage recordings and the history of it all , this is an amazing DVD – definitely check it out .
NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander inserted the four needles of its thermal and conductivity probe into Martian soil during the 98th Martian day , or sol , of the mission and left it in place until Sol 99 ( Sept. 4 , 2008 ) .
The Robotic Arm Camera on Phoenix took this image on the morning of Sol 99 while the probe 's needles were in the ground .
The science team informally named this soil target " Gandalf . "
New data from Mars ' surface is puzzling NASA scientists :
A fork - like probe on the Phoenix Mars Lander has sensed changes in humidity in the Martian air , but finds the dirt below perplexingly dry .
The measurements , the latest of which were taken over the last few days , indicate that water vapor is settling on or in the Martian dirt then being released back into the air on a daily cycle .
So mission scientists have expected to find water molecules sticking to the Martian surface .
" If you have water vapor in the air , every surface exposed to that air will have water molecules adhere to it that are somewhat mobile , even at temperatures well below freezing , " said Aaron Zent of the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , Calif. , and the lead scientist for Phoenix 's thermal and electroconductivity probe , which is making the humidity measurements .
Phoenix 's mission on the red planet , which began after a May 25 landing there , is all about the tantalizing search for Martian water .
The lander has already confirmed the presence of a subsurface layer of water ice , first detected in 2002 by NASA 's Mars Odyssey orbiter , which is still circling the planet .
The Phoenix spacecraft is searching for clues that this layer was once liquid — a sign of Mars ' past potential habitability .
Phoenix is also trying to characterize the current behavior and cycling of water on Mars .
" Phoenix has other tools to find clues about whether water ice at the site has melted in the past , such as identifying minerals in the soil and observing soil particles with microscopes , " said Phoenix project scientist Leslie Tampari of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
But , she added , " theconductivity probe is the main tool for checking for present - day soil moisture . "
Mission scientists have several reasons to think that the water vapor detected in the Martian air should be present as a thin layer of moisture on the ground .
One is that in similar areas of below - freezing permafrost on Earth , a thin layer of unfrozen water is detected .
One of the goals in sending the conductivity probe aboard Phoenix was to see if a similar thin film of moisture was present in the Arctic plains of Mars , where the spacecraft landed .
Another is the probe 's measurements of relative humidity in the air on Mars .
" The relative humidity transitions from near zero to near 100 percent with every day - night cycle , which suggests there 's a lot of moisture moving in and out of the soil , " Zent said .
The discovery of the water ice layer and the apparent sublimation ( or transition directly into the gas phase ) of ice samples gathered in Phoenix 's scoop are two more signs that moisture should be collecting on the surface dirt .
But so far , the four insertions of the lander 's probe , the most recent of which occurred on Wednesday and Thursday , have n't turned up any water .
" All the measurements we 've made so far are consistent with extremely dry soil , " Zent said .
" There are no indications of thin films of moisture , and this is puzzling . "
The probe can detect water in the dirt by gauging how electricity moves through the surface between the four needles of the probe .
The instrument can detect films of water barely more than one molecule thick .
Despite the failure to find a thin film so far , the Phoenix team is n't giving up .
They are planning a variation of the insertion experiment that will involve scooping away a bit of dirt before inserting the probe to reach closer to the subsurface ice layer .
" There should be the same amount of unfrozen water attached to the surface of soil particles above the ice , " Zent said .
" It may be too little to detect , but we have n't finished looking yet . "

Myth # 1 : Languages are all difficult to learn / languages are all pretty much equally difficult to learn .
time - consuming
difficult

The dog bites the man .

Myth # 2 : Language ( insert language here ) is difficult because it has dialects .
a certain familiarity with one or more major dialects is almost always an absolute must when learning a language
One good example is a show in Japan called Koi no karasawagi ( 恋の空騒ぎ ) hosted by a comedian named , Akashiya Sanma
明石家 さんま ) , who is pure comedic genius .
He was raised in Nara though , and that means he speaks in a Kansai dialect , something you 'll rarely find in a textbook .
To learn the dialect you generally have to go to Japan and live there or watch a lot of tv until you get used to it .
Shows with people talking in the dialect are on tv all the time , and when you go to Osaka people will generally be unable to switch to standard Japanese without a bit of effort , but does this make people stop learning Japanese or lower the value of the language ?
Of course not .
Here in Korea you 'll find the Gyeongsangnam - do ( Busan ) dialect everywhere , in shows like Gag Concert ( the corner 대화가 필요해 in particular ) , a ton of movies , tv , everywhere .
And yet nobody recommends against learning Korean for that reason .
Then there is the very obvious example of a language such as English with multiple standards , most of which people are used to to a certain extent , which is why the average English speaker has no problem understanding a range of standards from CNN to Dr. Phil to BBC to Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ( most parts there anyway ) to the dialogue in Blood Diamond to Crocodile Dundee , Once , and all the rest .
This is certainly equal to the number of major dialects you 'll find in a lot of countries , and yet nobody is discouraging students from learning English for this reason .
The fact is that every language comes with a certain range of ways to use it , and only certain languages like Icelandic have managed to exist with largely a single standard .
The only exceptions to this rule about dialects might be languages that are used as second languages in countries where most people have a different first language , such as Indonesian , Tok Pisin , and so on .
Languages like these often vary by region to a much larger extent than simple dialects , so it 's only with these languages that I 'd put any credence into the idea that it might be hard to make use of due to being used differently region by region .
The same thing goes with slang , which every language has .
Slang is pretty much just a dialect that exists among common ages and occupations instead of regions , and only those that have common interests are interested in learning and using it .
Myth # 3 : You need a perfect accent to be fluent in a language .
Myth # 2 and myth # 3 actually cancel each other out , which is interesting because I 've actually seen them both brought up in the same post as proof that a language is impossible to learn .
" My friend has been learning ( language ) and it's so hard because it has so many dialects and he still can't get the accent right after a year . "
First of all , a dialect is composed of the following :
A different accent from the official language , and
Different vocabulary from the official language .
Myth # 4 : Everybody in ( country x ) is good at English so it 's a useless language to learn .
/
That language is only spoken by ( insert number ) million people so it 's useless to learn .
On a per capita basis , Spanish is n't all that remarkable .
The countries it is spoken in are generally places that are not able to offer much more opportunity than one would have back home ( we 'll say the US or Canada ) .
Even Spain has a lower GDP per capita than the US and Canada .
In the US as well there 's a huge Spanish - speaking immigrant population , meaning that there are already a huge number of jobs that pay less than the average , and yet have a person already bilingual in Spanish and English filling it .
Requirements
Must be able to travel 25 % of the time
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
English required , multiple languages are a plus
Excellent teamwork skills

Myth # 5 : Children are really good at learning languages , adults are not .
26,280 hours
Motivation : you have to want to learn the language enough to stick with it over a period of time ;
Sacrifice : you have to want to learn it enough that you 'll change your schedule to study it , meaning less time for other things you might otherwise do with the time ;
Learning to let go of your L1 : the one definite advantage children have over adults is that they are good at accepting reality as is .
Some adult students have a very hard time coming to the realization that they are not simply learning a different code to express their L1 ( 1st language or mother tongue ) but rather a completely different language .
Some never get past this .
5 to 6 year olds have a working vocabulary of 2,500 to 5000 words .
That works to about one word every 5 or 10 hours , a shoddy performance for any person immersed in a language all day .
Children take forever to learn to write .
Adults can familiarize themselves with an alphabet in about a week , and can read at a fair speed within a month or two , and that 's not even their native tongue .
Children spend far longer learning to read and write in the language they already use every day .
My last post on Norwegian being the easiest language for English speakers garnered quite a bit of attention , and in the midst of all of the responses and comments I noticed quite a bit of false information about languages and how to learn them that you hear quite a bit both on and offline , and I decided to write a fairly detailed post on some of the major myths about languages , and how and why to learn them .
I started out with seven but two of them were similar to another two and thus ended up with five .
Anyone who has spent a fair amount of time on the subject has probably heard a lot of these , and many believe them to be true .
Here they are , in no particular order :
This is one of the biggest myths out there , and it comes from stories heard from others or personal experiences when learning a language .
The most common example given to back up this assertion is that someone ( often a friend or a friend of a friend ) spent some time in another country like Norway or France , and found out that learning a language takes a huge amount of time , and since Norwegian and French are supposed to be not all that challenging to learn , that all languages are therefore difficult to learn .
Stop right there though : does not equal .
All languages are time - consuming , no exceptions there .
Even constructed languages like Occidental , Interlingua and Ido that take very little time to learn the grammar still take time to learn all the vocabulary you will need to have a conversation without having to check a dictionary , and it takes a while to get used to the flow of a sentence , what words are used in what contexts , and so on .
This does not make them difficult , however .
The difference between a language that is difficult to learn and one that is simply time - consuming is the difference between typing up a 100 - page document in a language that uses Roman letters ( time - consuming and perhaps tedious but certainly not difficult ) , and typing up the same document in some other script , like Bulgarian or Georgian .
It 's the same document , but all of a sudden you have to hunt and peck for every key , and it takes you about a week before you can even type a single word with any measure of confidence .
That 's the difference between the two .
Or if you like , it 's the difference between walking 100 kilometres on a gradual slope versus walking the same distance on a steeper slope .
Either way it 's a pretty long walk :
Here 's our stickman a year or so into learning Norwegian .
He did n't think it was going to be such a long walk , and he spends a lot of time learning vocabulary and trying to practice every day .
However , all this new vocabulary and practice fits in very nicely with the English grammar that already exists in his head , and he 's never really shook his fist at the textbook and asked whether he 's ever going to figure out what makes this language tick .
He knows that most of what he needs is to keep learning and keep finding ways to practice , to make sure he does n't forget to pay attention to when a verb is common ( en ) or neuter ( et ) , and other small points like small differences in word order , remembering that Norwegians will use av ( of ) sometimes where English uses from ( Norwegian ) , and other points that have more to do with paying close attention than trying to learn a whole new language from the ground up .
The hardest part for him was actually just setting up an environment where he was able to practice the language every day , but luckily he has set up a schedule where he is able to converse with people in Norwegian only for at least a full hour every day in exchange for helping them in their studies for the next hour .
Sometimes he just pretends to be Norwegian online too and gets a lot of practice there .
Here 's the next 100 km journey :
Here 's our second stickman , and he 's studying Arabic .
Look at him go .
You 'll notice he also has the same distance to travel from left to right ( distance along the x - axis , that is ) , but this time the slope is much steeper because he is dealing with a grammar , writing system , culture and everything else that he 's not familiar with .
That does n't necessarily mean he 's having a worse time though ; for all we know Stickman 2 may enjoy the challenge of Arabic and would find himself bored with Norwegian .
If he 's good at languages he might also arrive at the right side of the image before Stickman 1 , but if we are to assume that they both have the same linguistic skill and motivation ( and therefore time put into study ) , Stickman 1 is definitely going to arrive first .
Another way to visualize how not all languages are equally difficult to learn : you 're in German class , and your next few chapters are about genders .
Now all of a sudden let 's imagine that German no longer has three genders but has only one .
Would the textbook grow in size or shrink ?
Or let 's say the cases disappear too and you do n't have to learn this part anymore :
Because now the only correct way to say it is .
Would the language be easier to learn ?
Most definitely .
Would it now no longer be time - consuming ?
Not at all .
That 's the difference between the two .
This myth is one of the first to pop up in forums and other sites online when a discussion on learning languages appears .
Somebody will come along and say " you think my language is easy to learn , but we have some crazy dialects that nobody can understand ! " , and in some cases succeeds in driving the prospective student away because of this .
The thing is though , almost every language has dialects .
Not only that , but most of these dialects are on regular television as well , nationwide television .
That means that when you 're living in a country you 'll come into contact with these dialects quite often .
In fact , and this is important , .
Exceptions to this are few .
We are not talking about complete fluency in a dialect , but an understanding of how it differs from the ' norm ' and some of the major expressions used in it .
Generally , the rule goes as follows : if a dialect is known well enough that even a person that has grown up using only the standard version of a language can understand some of it , the student of the language will need to understand it to a similar extent as well .
Now , if a language has so many dialects , and therefore so many accents , what is this ' perfect accent ' that a person needs to have to be fluent ?
Do the speakers of the dialect not count as fluent speakers as a result ?
A language with a number of dialects implies a language with a certain range of acceptable pronunciation that deviates from the norm , which means that you do n't need a perfect textbook accent to be fluent .
This is not to say that you can claim fluency with a horrendous accent , of course .
No English speaker could claim fluency in French with a very English - sounding " je voodray oon bilett see voo play " .
A certain amount of accent , however , when not to the extent that it impedes comprehension at all , can sound very nice .
You can also become the governor of California with an accent , so the idea that a person needs to speak in the exact same way as native speakers of the language is absurd .
An accent is fine as long as you can be understood without any difficulty , and as long as it does n't result in you making mistakes like saying bitch for beach .
Enough exposure to the language will help you avoid that .
Huge myth right here .
I can't count the number of comments I saw on the Norwegian language post that were of this nature .
Let 's take this myth apart , piece by piece .
The idea that a language is useless to learn because most people can get by with English is based on using a language for its most basic of uses : getting from point A to point B , talking about simple concepts , and so on .
Now the first use here , getting from point A to point B , can and is accomplished almost without language most of the time .
Getting a train ticket from one city to another can be accomplished by saying the name of the city , handing over the money , and nodding or shaking your head when they ask whether you want a one - way or two - way ticket .
Buying a newspaper can be done by handing over money without a word , coffee at Starbucks is always easy to order , hand gestures work from time to time , and people in general are kind to travelers so the actual amount of language that has to be learned to explore a country is close to nothing .
The second basic use for a language , talking about simple concepts , is admittedly one place where the above claim is true .
Simple questions like " How old is this statue " , " Can people who are 19 drink beer in your country " and the conversations that come from that are easily done in English in most cases .
However , people do not put the time into languages that they do in order to carry out simple conversations .
The largest motivations for learning a language include : love of a country and its culture , friends and family , and career advancement : i.e. money .
So the question is : is a language spoken by 5 million people ( again using Norwegian as an example ) necessarily less useful for one 's pocketbook than a language spoken by many more ?
Let 's use Spanish as an example of the latter .
Spanish is spoken by some 500 million people as an official language in 21 countries .
Norwegian is spoken by 5 million people in one country and is closely related to two others with a total population of 20 million for the three .
Spanish obviously has a lot more content than Norwegian , including tv , news , music , just about anything .
But what about the financial benefit for a person learning Spanish ?
It 's never bad for one 's career prospects to learn another language , but Spanish is a bit overrated in this area for two reasons :
In other words , supply is high and demand is relatively low .
How about Norwegian ?
Well , Norway has a GDP per capita of $ 83,922 , almost twice that of the United States .
The number of jobs is scarcer than the jobs you could get using Spanish , but then again Wal - Mart employs far more than Silicon Valley but the latter is definitely the place most people would rather work . ( and no , I 'm not implying that Spanish is the Wal - Mart of languages .
I like Spanish a lot . ) This brings us back to the first part of myth # 3 , that people in Norway already speak good English so learning the language would be useless .
Let 's take a look at this job posting for example for Opera ( the company that makes the browser of the same name ) , based in Norway :
As you can see , Norwegian alone wo n't get you the job ; however , in addition to multiple languages being a plus , the number one concern a company has when hiring employees from overseas is whether they will be able to live in the country over the long term .
Is the prospective employee really going to enjoy living here ?
Will he or she be able to adapt to the culture ?
Will he or she get along with the other employees ?
Knowledge of the language of the country you are applying for the job in is a huge benefit in these interviews , because the prospective employer already knows that you have put in a large amount of time into studying the language , and thus are n't just applying to overseas positions on a whim .
To conclude here : in terms of basic communication with hundreds and millions of people Norwegian loses out , but in terms of making more money , which is why a lot of people study languages in the first place , a language like Norwegian is possibly even a more useful tool than a widely - known language like Spanish or Portuguese .
This punch a language packs per capita is also why a language like German remains so usefull careerwise in spite of being used in a limited geographical area : every country that uses German is stable and has a highly developed economy .
I 'm always surprised that this myth is brought up so much , because basic math alone tells us that this is n't the case .
Let 's pick a random language on Wikibooks : we 'll go with Turkish .
Turkish is a so - called Category II language , meaning that it will take an estimated 1100 class hours to learn the language .
Okay then , how long does it take a child to learn their mother tongue ?
People learning a difficult language are often amazed at how a child of five years old or so can speak the language so well .
Okay , but how many hours of practice has the child had so far ?
Subtracting eight hours a day for sleep ( and even that 's being generous since people dream in their native tongues all the time while asleep ) and the first six months of life when a baby is pretty much in a daze , we have a total ofof exposure to the language so far for this child .
Babies also have no responsibilities whatsoever besides talking in and being talked to in the language , and they never have to go out of their way to practice it .
Their life is a total and complete immersion in this language .
Of course they can speak it after 26,280 hours of immersion .
So could any adult put into the same situation .
The problem with learning a language as an adult is simply one of :
The other clear advantage children have over adults is pronunciation and tone .
However , as far as I know there have been no comparative studies made where an adult is thrown into complete and utter immersion that children are subject to , and I seriously doubt that an adult that is put into the same situation -- 24 hours of immersion a day , no contact whatsoever with the outside world and his native tongue , having to talk in and being talked to in the language by family , friends and schoolmates -- would still have a problem with pronunciation and tone after 26,280 hours of this .
Adults simply have a much harder time breaking away from the responsibilities they have , most of which require using their mother tongue , and that 's why children seem to be such gifted students of languages when really they are nothing special in this regard .
Two last points :
In news that has brightened up my morning considerably , Codemasters has just given us the hot - off - the - press news that Overlord II is on the way !
In addition to a full sequel , the story of the Overlord and his cackling minions will also come in two supplementary titles -- bringing the evil lord to Nintendo systems for the first time .
Overlord II is set to up the stakes in terms of scope .
Among the new features are full - scale battles against a new foe , The Glorious Empire , and minions that ride upon wolves and other such creatures .
Overlord II is currently in development in the Netherlands and I am so excited I may just vomit .
The Wii also gets some Overlord favor this time around with Overlord Dark Legend .
This prequel puts you in command of a younger Overlord as he learns how to become an all - powerful tyrant .
Wiimote controls are of course on the cards , with a new " minion throttling " feature already promised .
Finally , Overlord Minions is preparing to conquer the Nintendo DS , and is centered around four minion elites : Giblet , Blaze , Stench and Zap .
You use the touch screen to direct this " Special Farces " crew in a bid to stop The Kindred , who want to resurrect a race of half - dragon people .
As readers will know , I am a huge Overlord fan and so this news is music to my ears .
Hopefully our titular antihero is a little more despotic this time around ( he was more amoral than evil last time ) , but if the dark humor and unique gameplay is intact , I 'll be a very happy minion in 2009 .
2009 will see the return of the Overlord and the vicious yet lovably insane Minions and today we are proud to announce 3 new Overlord titles for next year , which includes a full sequel and two additional new Overlord titles for the Nintendo formats .
Overlord II is the sequel to the original twisted fantasy action adventure and is now in development at Triumph Studios for the PLAYSTATION3 computer entertainment system , Xbox 360 and Games For Windows .
However as well as this , 2009 will also see the series debuting on new formats .
Exclusive extensions include the action title Overlord Dark Legend for Wii , featuring minion control through Wii Remote movement , and Overlord Minions , a dedicated puzzle action title , for Nintendo DS .
More details regarding the upcoming games can be found below :

Connecting players to the game world in three dimensions , the use of the Wii Remote gives unprecedented control over the minions .
For example , individual Minions can be plucked from the horde , held by the neck and then , by vigorously shaking the Wii Remote , throttled to imbue him with some Overlordly power and turn him into a manic minion missile .
With a now - explosive body , the insane little critter can be guided into enemies with hilarious , if rather fatal , consequences .
Backed by a rich , tongue - in - cheek story from award - winning games author Rhianna Pratchett , the game features Overlord favourites including Halflings , trolls , elves , and dwarves and introduces wicked witches , gingerbread men and Lil’ Red Riding Hood , the seeming sweet girl with a very personal lupine secret .

Controlling the Special Farces team of four , players negotiate fiendish levels and take on a huge range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred , a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin , a race of humanoid dragon hybrids , determined to replace the Overlord ’s despotism with their own .
Extending the Overlord series ’ trademark humour , gameplay focuses on the mischievous physical comedy of the minion ’s antics and is delivered in a stylised cartoon visual style .

What Really Happened
August 3 , 2008
The FBI knows of a man who was caught entering the lab where the Anthrax used in the letters was kept , after he had been fired for a racially motivated attack on a co-worker .
So , why is the FBI wasting its time with Steven Hatfill ?
History teaches us that since the dawn of the industrial age , all wars have been started with deceptions and manufactured provocations .
Hitler staged a fake attack from Poland to start WW2 .
FDR maneuvered Japan into attacking the fleet at Pearl Harbor then presented the attack as a total surprise to the American people .
News Story identifying Dr. Philip Zack as the man caught entering the Anthrax storage area at Fort Detrick without authorization .
In this story , it is reported that Dr. Zack was caught on a security tape making an unauthorized entry into the Anthrax storage area .
Foreign press picks up story that Anthrax letters were sent by American bio-war scientist … and that the FBI is dragging its feet on the case .
FBI ’S PRIME SUSPECT ON ANTHRAX LETTERS IS JEWISH !
No wonder they were dragging their feet .
Salon ’s story of the attempt to frame Dr. Ayaad Assaad , an Egyptian , for the Anthrax letters
Already the hate email is pouring in insisting that coverage of this story is " anti-Semitic " .
Clearly , a certain nation is terrified of this story getting wide coverage .
The time has come to face the unpleasant fact the citizens of the United States may well be the victims of the most incredible hoax in history regarding who is really behind the attacks on the World Trade Towers , the mailing of Anthrax letters to political and media leaders , and even to doubts that Daniel Pearl ’s killers are actually who we have been told they are .
The fact is that evidence presented to the public as to who was behind 9 - 11 is largely faked while evidence that links the Israeli Spy / Phone Tapping Ring to the attacks has been classified by the US Government itself , as reported in Carl Cameron ’s four part story on the spy ring on Fox News ( subsequently erased from the mainstream media ’s web sites ) .
" reports that Israel was conducting spying activities in the United States may have a grain of truth
Note the of second paragraph from the bottom of this story in which a US official admits that even if the Israelis were running a spy ring in the United States , the information would be kept from the American people .
The time has come to seriously consider that the American people are being tricked into a war .
Such things are hardly new .
Recently declassified documents prove beyond al doubt that Pearl Harbor was not only NOT a surprise , but was the desired result of an 8 step ONI plan written by Arthur H. McCollum and implemented by Franklin Delano Roosevelt , in order to trick the people of the United States into a war against Hitler , via the back door of Japan .
And according to Victor Ostrovsky , a former Mossad agent , the bombing of Libya during the Reagan administration was the result of a trick played by the Mossad in which a radio transmitter was smuggled into Tripoli and used to create fake radio messages for the US to intercept .
The motto of the Mossad is , " By way of deception , thou shalt do war " .
The Israeli government has a history of tricking the United States into attacking their enemies for them .
A classic example is the Lavon Affair .
THE LAVON AFFAIR
In 1954 , Israeli agents working in Egypt planted bombs in several buildings , including a United States diplomatic facility , and left evidence behind implicating Arabs as the culprits .
The ruse would have worked , had not one of the bombs detonated prematurely , allowing the Egyptians to capture and identify one of the bombers , which in turn led to the round up of an Israeli spy ring .
Some of the spies were from Israel , while others were recruited fro the local Jewish population .
Israel responded to the scandal with claims in the media that there was no spy ring , that it was all a hoax perpetrated by " anti-Semites " .
But as the public trial progressed , it was evidence that Israel had indeed been behind the bombing .
Eventually , Israeli ’s Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon was brought down by the scandal , although it appears that he was himself the victim of a frame - up by the real authors of the bombing project , code named " Operation Susannah . "
So now we have the present situation .
Ruined buildings , dead people , Anthrax in the mail .
There is a constant hue and cry to try to blame Arab Muslims by the Israeli government , which seeks to enlarge its territory ( Israel has invaded every single nation it shares a border with since its creation ) and by the US government , which seeks to grab control of what remains of the world ’s oil reserves .
Either through this mutually reinforcing agenda , of perhaps because of blackmail of our officials by Israel , the US has become Israel ’s partner in this hoax , which leads us to the reason for the US to classify evidence that links Israel ’s arrested spies with the events of 9 - 11 .
" Evidence linking these Israelis to 9/11 is classified .
I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered .
It ’s classified information . "
— US official quoted in Carl Cameron ’s Fox News report on the Israeli spy ring .
History teaches us that since the dawn of the industrial age , all wars have been started with deceptions and manufactured provocations .
Hitler staged a fake attack from Poland to start WW2 .
FDR maneuvered Japan into attacking the fleet at Pearl Harbor then presented the attack as a total surprise to the American people .
Evidence that 9 - 11 is another such deception mounts every day .
Almost a year ago , in March 2001 , long before the attacks on the World Trade Towers , while the American people were being distracted by " All Condit , All The Time " , the United States Government was already informing other nations of plans to invade Afghanistan in October , 2001 .
And , in October 2001 , the United States did in fact invade Afghanistan , right on schedule , which means that the attacks on the World Trade Towers occurred at just the exact moment when the United States needed a population angry enough to support a war .
Have we been hoaxed ?
Would someone really sacrifice some buildings ( as FDR sacrificed some ships ) to start a war ?
Against the $ 5 trillion worth of oil under the Caspian Sea , the price of a new World Trade Center in New York is just pocket change , a cheap price to pay indeed for control of such vast oil reserves , and an even better deal if the oil under Iraq can be added to the prize package , especially for a government too deeply in debt to get out without massive conquests of someone else ’s resources .
The fact that the Anthrax Letters were NOT sent by an Arab Muslim but by a Jewish gentleman with the intent to FRAME an Arab Muslim strongly suggests that the entire sequence of recent events has been one gigantic frame - up , which would explain again why the US Government is itself classifying evidence that links some of the arrested Israeli spies with the events of 9 - 11 .
History may be repeating itself again .
We cannot afford to dismiss the possibility that , once again , Americans are the victims of a hoax designed to trick them into sacrificing their wealth and the lives of their children in a war of someone else ’s making ; a war of the worst kind , war for profit and empire .
One more lesson from history needs to be repeated .
Since the dawn of the industrial age , the overwhelming majority of wars have been LOST by the side that initiated them .
Just one more reason for caution .
" By way of deception , thou shalt do war " — Motto of Israel ’s Mossad
A pathetic attempt to shift the focus on the Anthrax letters
As most readers are already aware , the Anthrax contained in the letters sent to Congress was determined to be from a US military laboratory .
This raised the question in the public ’s mind as to who , inside a US facility , would be playing games with Anthrax .
Suspicion focused on Dr. Ayaad Assaad , an Egyptian scientist working at Fort Detrick , based on an anonymous letter .
Because Dr. Assaad ’s race fit in perfectly with the agenda of sparking a war into Arab lands rich in oil , the media ballyhooed that the FBI was closing in on the " Arab Anthrax Terrorist " .
Ah , but the best laid plans gang aft aglay , and the FBI discovered that the end of the hunt for the sender of the Anthrax letters was NOT Dr. Assaad the Egyptian , but Dr. Zack , who is Jewish .
At this point , both the FBI and the mainstream media stopped making any public comments on the case .
The above BBC article is clearly another step in the plan to try to shift the suspicion for the Anthrax letters further away from the Dr. Zack , to spare Israel further embarrassment in what appears to be a modern day revival of the Lavon Affair .
However , the claim that the Anthrax letters were simply an experiment in mail delivery that went awry is discredited by recalling that the envelopes and their contents were written in a way to cast suspicion for the letters in a specific direction , at Arabs !
This clear evidence of a deliberate frame up proves that not only was this not simply a test procedure , but that the Anthrax in the letters was intended to kill people , while the letters themselves pointed the finger of blame .
It would appear that even the BBC is not above spreading a little bit of propaganda .
Proof of a deliberate frame - up is before your eyes – someone INTENDED for Arabs to take the blame .

Dandelion Salad

September 5 , 2008
SocialistWorker.org
Lockdown in St. Paul | SocialistWorker.org
Adam Turl describes the police - state tactics used to squelch dissent in Minneapolis and St. Paul during the Republican National Convention .
THERE WAS a criminal conspiracy engulfing Minnesota ’s Twin Cities during the Republican National Convention ( RNC ) – but it did n’t involve masked anarchists , as mainstream media outlets warned .
The real conspiracy was a plot by 30 federal , state and local law enforcement agencies to repress dissent and protests under the rubric of “ national security ” and the “ war on terror . ”
The repression caught in its wake antiwar protesters , environmentalists , pacifists , anarchists , socialists and reporters–in short , anyone who might show ( or report on ) signs of dissent against a government waging two barbaric wars while it ca n’t even provide health care to its own people .
As of the late afternoon before John McCain ’s convention speech September 4 , at least 320 people had been arrested in the previous five days–on the street or in police raids .
At least 16 of them faced felony charges , and 47 others faced serious “ gross misdemeanor ” charges .
Other reports put the number of felony arrests as high as 120 – at least five of them involving minors .
As of September 3 , many of those arrested remained in jail , held illegally beyond Minnesota ’s 36 - hour limit on detention without formal charges .
Reportedly , many prisoners had n’t been allowed to meet with lawyers or make phone calls–and some prisoners were said to be holding a hunger strike in protest .
Outrageously , eight people have been charged with “ second - degree furtherance of terrorism , ” “ conspiracy to riot ” and “ commit civil disorder . ”
Not one of them was charged with any actual act of violence or property damage .
Government documents show that their organization , the RNC “ Welcoming Committee , ” along with other activist groups , had been investigated –and infiltrated –over at least the past year , with the help of the FBI and FBI - led Minneapolis Joint Terrorist Task Force .
As Indymedia observed : “ Based on past abuses of such informants by law enforcement , the National Lawyers Guild is concerned that such police informants have incentives to lie and exaggerate threats of violence , and to also act as provocateurs in raising , and urging support for , acts of violence . ”
Despite flimsy or nonexistent evidence , over the Labor Day weekend , several homes and activist meeting centers were raided .
Computers , cell - phones , e-mails , political pamphlets and protest plans seized , and dozens of people were arrested .
These first raids occurred before any protests had even been held in the Twin Cities .
As Glenn Greenwald observed on Salon.com :
Just review what happened yesterday and today .
Homes of college - age protesters were raided by rifle - wielding police forces .
Journalists were forcibly detained at gunpoint .
Lawyers on the scene to represent the detainees were handcuffed .
Computers , laptops , journals , diaries , and political pamphlets were seized from people ’s homes .
And all of this occurred against U.S. citizens without a single act of violence having taken place , and nothing more than traffic blockage even alleged by authorities to have been planned .
Bruce Nestor of the Minnesota chapter of the National Lawyers Guild noted that “ conspiracy to riot was the charge used against the Chicago Eight in 1968 as part of a politically motivated prosecution …
These charges are an effort to equate publicly stated plans to blockade traffic and disrupt the RNC as being the same as acts of terrorism .
This both trivializes real violence and attempts to place the stated political views of the defendants on trial . ”
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
THE RED herring of “ terrorism ” was used as a cover for rampant violations of activists ’ civil liberties –beginning with the “ pre-emptive ” arrests , raids and harassment prior to the protests .
For example , police in the Twin Cities impounded a bus owned by the family of Delyla and Stan Wilson for “ safety violations ” after pulling them over on Interstate 94 –prior to the large Labor Day march on the Xcel Center , the site of the convention .
Police began tailing the Wilson family –who were leading a demonstration in favor of sustainable gardening , recycling and water conservation–after deciding that their gardening and environmental tools could be used as weapons .
Responding to accusations that the police took the Wilsons ’ bus to stifle dissent , police Sgt. William Palmer said the family was “ free to go to the protests , ” but they “ just ca n’t drive this bus to get there . ”
Another group of activists from the organization Earth Justice were detained on their way to the protests , and their bus seized by police .
And on August 31 , police tailed and then detained activists who had been attending the Veterans for Peace ( VFP ) conference at the Ramada Inn in Bloomington , just outside the Twin Cities .
Law enforcement personnel also surrounded a house where members of Eyewitness–a group that had successfully fought unjust arrests from the Republican convention in New York City in 2004 – were staying .
Police escalated their tactics from harassment to outright brutality during largely nonviolent direct action protests on Labor Day .
When protesters tried to block traffic leading into the Xcel Center , the cops attacked protesters with chemicals and projectiles .
According to the Coldsnap Legal Collective , “ With no provocation , police have indiscriminately used rubber bullets , concussion grenades , and chemical irritants to disperse crowds and incapacitate protesters . ”
A Coldsnap spokesperson told reporters that prisoners were denied medical treatment as punishment , including one arrestee with hemophilia , another with asthma and yet another with a broken finger .
According to the Wall Street Journal , police responded to protests with “ pepper spray , tear gas , smoke canisters and what they call ‘ distraction devices ’ that give a loud bang and a flash of light … ”
A member of Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) who witnessed some of the violent police attacks told reporters that police were “ treating [ U.S. ] civilians like you would Iraqis . ”
Parts of the city did seem to be occupied by an army .
According to the New York Times , as “ the protests grew , scores of National Guard troops in riot gear and gas masks fanned out around ” the Xcel Center , while “ [ p ] olice helicopters buzzed over St. Paul … Humvees painted in fatigue green ferried water to police officers … and city dump trucks were used to block traffic on some streets . ”
The Times reported that Jerah Plucker , a documentary filmmaker , was swept up by police–along with several others –while listening to music in a park along the Mississippi River .
“ Over the loudspeaker [ the police ] are saying , ‘ You are being arrested . ' ”
Plucker told reporters .
“ They ’re telling us , ‘ Sit down , put your hands on your head . ”
Many others–both protesters and bystanders –had similar experiences .
A 17 - year - old youth was arrested trying to get into a concert on Monday on Harriet Island .
He was soon released , but not before his photo was broadcast on television identifying him as an “ anarchist ” bent on “ disrupting the convention . ”
Dylan Asplen was charged with “ felony riot ” –and spoke to his mother on the phone from jail .
His mother , Annette told reporters that they “ arrested him for walking down the street .
He said he did n’t do anything .
I am so mad , you have no idea …
It ’s a police state . ”
Keith Smith , a teenager from Menomonie , Wis. , told reporters he was beaten by police and then released without any medical treatment .
Minnesota Public Radio ( MPR ) reported that , “ sitting in his home in Menomonie , he lifted his shirt and displayed what appears to be a boot print on his right shoulder …
He also has scrapes on his arms , chest and hip . ”
Anita Betancourt , speaking outside the Ramsey County Law Enforcement Center days after Monday ’s arrests , told MPR she was waiting for her 19 - year old daughter , who had been in the Twin Cities to protest the war and convention because her brother was serving in Iraq .
As MPR reported , Betancourt ’s daughter told her mother in a phone call that “ the police just shot her and arrested her , and she was just standing there .
She told Betancourt that everything –all of a sudden –was just chaos all around her .
They started pushing and shooting people , and the gas and pepper spray and all that stuff . ”
Attorney Matthew Ludt–who has represented some of arrestees–told MPR that “ not only were they trying to keep demonstrators , protesters , people who want to get their message across off the streets … they swept up everybody else , which was bystanders as well as journalists . ”
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
REPORTERS APPEAR to have been systematically targeted by law enforcement during the protests .
Democracy Now ! host Amy Goodman was arrested and physically assaulted September 1 and charged with obstruction of a peace officer , as were DN !
producers Sharif Kouddous and Nicole Salazar .
Kouddous and Salazar were reporting on one of the protests against the convention .
Goodman was then arrested for the “ crime ” of asking after her wrongfully arrested colleagues .
According to an emergency alert from DN ! :
During the demonstration in which the Democracy Now ! team was arrested , law enforcement officers used pepper spray , rubber bullets , concussion grenades and excessive force against protesters and journalists .
Several demonstrators were arrested during this action , as was a photographer from the Associated Press .
Other independent journalists were also arrested , including Chicago - based freelance reporter Nathan Weber , who was thrown to the ground and received blows to the back of his head .
Four journalists from a student newspaper in Kentucky were detained as well .
The student - journalists were charged with rioting while covering Monday ’s protests .
Like Weber and the DN !
producers , the Kentucky students showed their media credentials –but were arrested anyway .
One was still in jail as of September 3 .
The escalating repression and arrests continued for the rest of the week .
This included hundreds of riot cops in full gear lining the streets of the permitted Poor People ’s March September 2 to try to intimidate the marchers .
On September 3 , following a Rage Against the Machine concert at the Target Center , 102 people were arrested for the “ crime ” of marching through the streets and chanting about “ democracy . ”
According to reports , police fired “ two rounds from what appeared to be either a beanbag or a pellet gun ” and pepper - sprayed people as they left the concert .
Even before the concert began–at around 7 p.m.–an activist campaigning for presidential candidate Ralph Nader was arrested outside the Target Center .
His crime ?
Informing people about an upcoming Nader campaign rally .
The point of the raids–and the repression since–is clearly to intimidate radicals and progressives .
But the issues that led thousands to protest the Republican convention in the Twin Cities–as well as the Democratic National Convention in Denver–are n’t going away .
Nor are the growing expectations that something must be done to address these injustices .
If we are to continue organizing and speaking out , we must stand behind all the victims of this police conspiracy to stifle dissent .
***

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Stress is a big challenge in life nowadays .
The sources of stress are many and the helpful ways to reduce stress are also plentiful .
Common symptoms of stress include skin problems , impotence , stomach ulcers , high blood pressure , fatigue , insomnia and frustration .
We do n't need to set a time to reduce stress , we need to incorporate some strategies in our daily life routine to prevent stress and reduce its effect on the body .
1 . Define your goals : we must define our life goals and begin to achieve these goals ; this action will support us against stress because we will feel that we know what our life purpose is and why , and that we control our own lives .
2 .
Take control of your diet : we can use simple ways in our diet plans to reduce stress by avoiding some stimulants such as coffee , alcohol , tea and sugar and we can use chamomile tea as an alternative because of its calming and relaxing effect .
We need to eat slowly in a calm environment to allow our digestive system to work well .
We can use honey as an alternative to sugar but in small amounts ( one or two spoonfuls per day ) .
3 . Take hot baths regularly : after a very busy day or when we feel that we need to relax ( I do this three times a week ) .
You can take a hot bath by sitting in warm to hot water and the water level should be above the waist , using lavender oil can also enhance this relaxing experience .
4 .
Aromatherapy : in the office you can use aromatherapy to relax and avoid stress .
One of the best ways is to use lavender oil on a source of heat and take in the scent ; this is a great way to relax during the day when you need it the most .
5. Exercise :
This is one of the important things you can do which will reduce stress and bring happiness .
When we exercise , our brains release substances which bring feelings of happiness and relaxation ; we need engage in some exercise regularly such as walking , dancing or swimming .
6 . Breathing techniques : Yoga , meditation and Tai Chi all use deep breathing techniques .
To meditate , simply sit with closed eyes and concentrate on your breathing .

The Page blog is reporting that Democratic activist and Hillary Clinton supporter Reba Shimansky has withdrawn her support of John McCain over his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate .
Shimansky said in a statement , “ The Palin selection may have energized the GOP base but it hurts him with independents .
I would have voted for McCain if he made a sensible choice for VP like Ridge which would have shown that he was willing to stand up to the rightwing crackpots in his party .
Therefore I will be sitting out the 2008 presidential election . ”
The fact that she used the word crackpots to describe the majority of the Republican Party is evidence that she should not have been supporting McCain in the first place .
Back in June Shimansky announced that she was supporting McCain because she was upset with the way the Democratic Party had treated Hillary Clinton , “ The Democratic professionals wanted to please Obama more than Hillary because they valued his supporters more than Hillary ’s .
I have said that I would do anything in my limited capacity to destroy Obama ’s candidacy ( who I do not like because of his trashing of Bill Clinton and his accomplishments as president ) and the best way to do that is to vote for McCain .
It is an emotional not rational vote .
My loyalty is to Hillary not the Democratic Party . ”

If we can put aside the fact that she was supporting McCain only out of bitterness over Clinton ’s defeat , she seems like the kind of supporter that Palin selection was meant to target .
This defection is not a good omen for the McCain campaign ’s argument to women that Palin ’s selection allows women to still make history .
Early polling has shown that while voters like Palin , a majority of them do n’t believe that she is ready to be president , and so far she has not swung female voters away from Obama .
The Palin pick was a cynical one .
It has motivated the Republican base and brought a degree of freshness to his campaign , but many Clinton supporters are insulted by this pick , and they are even more motivated to help Obama .
Notice that Shimansky did n’t stick with McCain once she that he had picked a fringe right winger .
This may come as a shock to McCain , but women base their votes on the issues too .
Palin will get loads of support from Republican women , but they were going to support McCain anyway .
I do n’t think she swings many female votes away from Obama .

Exquisite detail has been preserved in the fossils
Tiny fossils have helped refine the timing of the climate shift that gave rise to Antarctica 's remarkable Dry Valleys , a landscape akin to Mars .
The famously ice - free terrain enjoyed more benign , tundra - like conditions 14 million years ago - but then flipped to the intensely cold setting seen today .
Scientists tell a Royal Society journal that ancient lake - living shrimp - like creatures can pinpoint the big switch .
The ostracods would not have coped with a harsh , dry environment , they say .
Dr Adam Lewis , from North Dakota State University , US , explained : " Our dating says the lake existed 14 million years ago , and within about 250,000 years of that lake existing and holding those ostracods , all the glaciers in the surrounding area stopped melting and they become cold - based and began to evaporate .
" So after about 13.8 million years ago , there 's no water - it's bone dry , dry - frozen , " he told BBC News .
Antarctica's Dry Valleys , with their barren gravel - strewn floors , are said to be the closest place on Earth to Mars .
Valley floors are littered with the mummified corpses of dead animals
The air that falls into the region from the continent 's elevated interior has extremely low humidity .
There is so little precipitation in the valleys that they are technically regarded as deserts - as is much of Antarctica .
Animals such as seals which wander into this landscape and get lost will die and mummify .
The team found a range of fossils in sediments on the slopes of Mount Boreas , on the edge of McKelvey Valley .
These include mosses , diatoms and beetles .
But it is the 1 mm - long ostracods which catch the eye .
They are exquisitely well preserved , with their soft tissues visible in three dimensions .
Dr Mark Williams , from the University of Leicester , UK , said : " We 've got the legs and the mouth parts , and the reproductive organs ; and we can even see micron - scale hairs on the legs .
" This is a first of its kind from the Antarctic ; it 's unusual in the fossil record in general - it 's special .
" Notwithstanding the significance of the fossil preservation , the presence of lake ostracods at this latitude , 77 degrees South , is also of great note .
With modern ostracod distribution , the most southerly ones are at about 60 degrees South . "
The team says the fossils therefore represent a precise marker , indicating the switch from conditions which one might see in Northern Canada and Iceland today , where summer warmth brings a melt , liquid water and a flourish of life - to the more severe , arid conditions we recognise in the Antarctic today .
" This also helps us understand the whole evolution of Earth 's climate system because you 've got this huge climate jump that takes place about 14 million years ago when the oceans reorganise , Antarctica freezes over - a whole host of things change right at that point .
" What we 're doing with these ostracods is to say : ' that 's it , that 's the point ' . "
The fossil research is detailed in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Jonathan .

WASHINGTON - The Federal Communications Commission will adopt rules barring Internet service providers such as Comcast Corp. from interfering with their customers ' ability to share videos and other online files .
A majority of the five - member commission has agreed the FCC can halt the practice , chairman Kevin Martin said yesterday .
The agency has scheduled a Friday public hearing for a vote .
The agency also plans to censure Comcast , the largest US cable - television company , for interfering with customers using peer - to - peer file - sharing services , according to two people with knowledge of the plans .
Comcast will be required to take corrective action and wo n't face a fine , one of the people said .
" We continue to assert that our network management practices were reasonable , " Sena Fitzmaurice , a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia - based company , said .
Comcast has said it delays the transfer of some files when networks are congested to preserve service for other customers .
Martin on July 11 said Comcast had violated rules by hampering customers ' transfer of big files such as movies , and he said he wanted to stop the practice .
Those voting to censure Comcast include Martin , a Republican , and both agency Democrats , Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Copps , according to two people who declined to be identified because decisions are confidential until published .
FCC commissioner Robert McDowell in a column in The Washington Post yesterday said engineers have collaborated to solve problems of Internet congestion .
" If we chose regulation over collaboration , we will be setting a precedent by thrusting politicians and bureaucrats into engineering decisions , " he wrote .
" Let 's stick with what works . "
" This order would send a strong signal to the marketplace that arbitrarily interfering with users ' online choices is not acceptable , " Marvin Ammori , general counsel for Free Press , said .

Banks ' losses from the US subprime crisis and the ensuing credit crunch crossed the $ US500 billion ( $ 571 billion ) mark as writedowns spread to more asset types .
The writedowns and credit losses at more than 100 of the world 's biggest banks and securities firms rose after UBS AG reported second - quarter earnings , which included $ US6 billion of charges on subprime - related assets .
The International Monetary Fund in an April report estimated banks ' losses at $ US510 billion , about half its forecast of $ US1 trillion for all companies .
Predictions have crept up since then , with New York University economist Nouriel Roubini predicting losses to reach $ US2 trillion .
`'It just keeps spreading from one asset to another , so it 's hard to know when these writedowns will stop , '' said Makeem Asif , an analyst at KBC Financial Products in London .
`' The US economy needs to stabilize first .
But even then , Europe could lag and recover later .
There 's still a lot more downside . ''
Auction - rate securities have begun adding to the losses as regulators and prosecutors force banks to buy back bonds they 'd sold as safe investments .
UBS set aside $ US900 million to cover potential losses from repurchasing the securities , while Citigroup and Wachovia estimated losses at $ US500 million each .
Subprime collapse
The collapse of the US subprime mortgage market last year has saddled banks worldwide with $ US501 billion of losses from declining values of securities tied to all types of home loans and commercial mortgages as well as leveraged - loan commitments .
Banks and brokers have raised $ US353 billion of capital to cope with the writedowns , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
The gap between losses and capital infusions , which now stands at $ US148 billion , has regularly narrowed to about $ US80 billion as capital raising follows writedown announcements .
The following table shows the asset writedowns and credit losses as well as the capital raised in response .

Speaking at a forum Thursday night in New York City , John McCain said that " It 's easy for me to go to Washington and , frankly , be somewhat divorced from the day - to - day challenges people have . "
McCain was answering a question about Sarah Palin , and unintentionally pointed out a major flaw about himself in the process .
While McCain celebrates his birthday with a convicted conman and his movie star girlfriend , and criticizes Barack Obama for associating with celebrities , real American people are struggling .
Struggling to pay their mortgages and avoid forclosure on their homes .
Real Americans are figuring out a way to pay for rising gas prices and heating oil for the upcoming winter .
The American people do not want another president in office who is going to talk down to them and do nothing to solve everyday American issues .
Americans no longer want to see the national debt rising at a pace neverbefore seen in history .
John McCain can criticize if he 'd like .
That 's not going to fix all of the problems this country faces or help out the majority of American citizens who are struggling to provide for their families .
In this election , there is a choice between the same old president following the same old ineffective routines or a president with fresh , bold ideas and innovative plans to help out ordinary everyday citizens .
Barack Obama knows what it 's like to grow up poor , in a single - parent household .
He knows what it 's like to have bills to pay and a family to provide for .
McCain does n't even remember how many houses he owns .
If you want a president who admits he's out of touch with the challenges facing the American people , and you 're sad to see George W. Bush go , then vote for McCain .
If you want a fresh start with real solutions to problems faced by you and me and millions of other American families by someone who knows what it is like to fight to survive in today 's economy , then vote for Barack Obama .
I 'd prefer a president who understands my daily needs and will be able to provide me with some relief .
I 'd hope you would want that for yourself as well .
No need for glasses : Bionic ' super lenses ' that correct long AND short - sightedness developed
The future : The ' super lens ' would be a one off operation , doing away with the need to apply contact lenses daily
Bionic implants that promise to give 45 - year - olds the vision of someone 20 years younger could be available in just five years .
The ' super lenses ' will correct both long and short - sightedness , allowing patients to throw away their glasses for good .
What is more , those who undergo the half - hour operation will not develop cataracts in old age , the British Association 's Festival of Science heard .
Professor James Wolffsohn said : ' Everyone over 45 would benefit because it means they will be able to see distance and near absolutely naturally .
' It is the true definition of a bionic eye .
You are replacing something that has aged in the eye with a technological structure . '
The concept is based on existing technology - the tiny plastic lenses that have been implanted into the eye after cataract surgery for decades .
These are stiff , however , and while the operation makes vision clearer , it does nothing to treat short or long - sightedness .
More flexible lenses called accommodating intraocular lenses have recently hit the market but they , like laser surgery , only treat either long or short sight .
Scientists are now trying to create extra- flexible ' super lenses ' which could be squeezed by the eye 's muscles into the shapes needed to focus on both near and distant objects - and all points in between .
They would be inserted into the eye in a simple operation that replaces the existing lens .
The lenses - which are five to ten years from the market and expected to cost under £ 2,000 a pair - could be used to replace the clouded natural lenses removed in cataract operations .
But the biggest market is likely to be among those who start to wear reading glasses in middle - age .
Professor - Wolffsohn , an optometrist at Birmingham 's Aston University , said : ' When you are young , you can focus right up to the end of your nose .
' As you get older , the lens of your eye hardens and is no longer able to change its shape and focus so you have to hold something further away to read it .
' By 45 , you can no longer stretch your arms far enough and you need glasses . '
Operating in middle - age carries fewer risks , as people are generally healthier and better able to cope with anaesthetics .
Professor Wolffsohn said : ' At the moment you do cataract surgery when people are old but arguably you could do this surgery at the age of 45 and stop you ever getting cataracts .
' There will be issues about whether to do this surgery as a preventative or wait until they develop cataracts .
With the population living longer , you can guarantee most people will get cataracts . '
Professor Wolffsohn , who is helping several companies develop super - lenses , added : ' This is a one - off lens .
Contact lenses are a lot cheaper but you are paying for them for years . '
The remains of a 30 - foot - long predatory dinosaur discovered along the banks of Argentina 's Rio Colorado is helping to unravel how birds evolved their unusual breathing system .
Birds have a breathing system that is unique among land animals .
Instead of lungs that expand , birds have a system of bellows , or air sacs , which help pump air through the lungs .
This novel feature is the reason birds can fly higher and faster than bats , which , like all mammals , expand their lungs in a less efficient breathing process .
The discovery , announced at a news conference in Mendoza , Argentina , builds on decades of paleontological research indicating that birds evolved from dinosaurs .

University of Michigan paleontologist Jeffrey Wilson was a University of Chicago graduate student working with noted dinosaur authority Paul Sereno on the 1996 expedition during which the dinosaur , named Aerosteon riocoloradensis ( " air bones from the Rio Colorado " ) was found .
Although the researchers were excited to find such a complete skeleton , it took on even more importance as they began to understand that its bones preserved hallmark features of a bird - like respiratory system .
Arriving at that understanding took some time .
Laboratory technicians spent years cleaning and CT - scanning the bones , which were embedded in hard rock , to finally reveal the evidence of air sacs within Aerosteon 's body cavity .
Previously , paleontologists had found only tantalizing evidence in the backbone , outside the cavity with the lungs .
Wilson worked with Sereno and the rest of the team to scientifically describe and interpret the find .
The vertebrae , clavicles , and hip bones bear small openings that lead into large , hollow spaces that would have been lined with a thin layer of soft tissue and filled with air in life .
These chambers result from a process called pneumatization , in which outpocketings of the lungs ( air sacs ) invade the bones .
Air - filled bones are the hallmark of the bellows system of breathing in birds and also are found in sauropods , the long - necked , long - tailed , plant - eating dinosaurs that Wilson studies .
" In sauropods , pneumaticity was key to the evolution of large body size and long necks ; in birds it was key to the evolution of a light skeleton and flight , " Wilson said .
" The ancient history and evolutionary path of this feature is full of surprising turns , the explanations for which must account for their presence in a huge predator like Aerosteon and herbivores like Diplodocus , as well as in a chicken . "
In the PLoS ONE paper , the team proposes three possible explanations for the evolution of air sacs in dinosaurs : development of a more efficient lung ; reduction of upper body mass in tipsy two - legged runners ; and release of excess body heat .
Sereno , a National Geographic Explorer - in- Residence , said he is especially intrigued by heat loss , given that Aerosteon was likely a high - energy predator with feathers but without the sweat glands that birds possess .
At approximately 30 feet in length and weighing as much as an elephant , Aerosteon might well have used an air system under the skin to rid itself of unwanted heat .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
For Erich Scherfen , being on a government terror watch list is n't just a matter of inconvenience .
It could end his career .
Erich Scherfen served 13 years in the military , including flying National Guard helicopters .
Scherfen served in the U.S. military for 13 years , as an Army infantryman in the first Gulf War and then as a helicopter pilot in the National Guard .
After receiving an honorable discharge , he was hired as a pilot by Colgan Air Inc. , a regional airline operating in the Northeast and Texas .
In April , Colgan informed Scherfen that he was on a government list and would be suspended from his job .
He was told he faced termination on September 1 unless he was able to clear his name .
But Scherfen , of Schuylkill Haven , Pennsylvania , has been unable to do so and said he fears that it could mean he has no future as a pilot .
" My entire career depends on me getting off this list , " he said .
" I probably wo n't be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that I 'm on this list . "
Witold Walczak , an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Scherfen and his wife in a lawsuit , calls the government actions " unfair " and " unjust . "
" It is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation , your career , they have to provide you with some means to clear your name , " Walczak said .
The lawsuit , filed this week in federal court in Pennsylvania , asks the U.S. government to remove Scherfen and his wife , Rubina Tareen , from any watch lists or databases that inhibit their travel .
Scherfen is a convert to Islam .
His wife emigrated from Pakistan when she was 17 and is now a U.S. citizen .
She runs a small business selling books and DVDs about Islam , publications she describes as nonpolitical .
Watch the couple speculate on why they 're listed »
Scherfen and Tareen have both been stopped when traveling and told by security personnel that they are on " a list . "
Scherfen calls it " embarrassing . "
Tareen said she thinks they may be on a watch list because of their Muslim faith and her Pakistani heritage .
The two said they are not terrorists and do n't associate with people who are .
" I have no idea why I am on the list , and they 're not telling officially that I 'm even on the list , " Scherfen said .
iReport.com : Are you on the list ?
In a statement , the U.S. Justice Department said it will not confirm or deny that the couple 's names are on a watch list for national security and privacy reasons .
In May , Scherfen and his wife wrote to the Department of Homeland Security , asking for help with their case .
The department referred them to the Transportation Security Administration 's Traveler Redress Inquiry Program .
This week , they received a number to track their case , but their complaint has not been addressed .
A TSA spokeswoman said the agency is seeking " a meaningful resolution " to the couple 's case but said there is no timetable for doing so .
Meanwhile , a federal judge has the case under review .
He asked that Colgan move Scherfen 's termination date to October 1 .
The airline has done so , allowing more time for a possible resolution .
" Unfortunately , it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism , have no connection to crime and do n't belong on this list , " said Walczak , the ACLU lawyer .
Walczak acknowledged the need for the government to protect the country from threats with a watch list but said , " The problem with what the government is doing is that they really do n't care about innocent casualties . "
Scherfen said the pain of his situation is accentuated by the fact that he spent 13 years in uniform protecting the country .
" We served honorably , " he said .
" We served in a war .
And they 're thumbing their noses at us , basically , and that makes me feel ... really sad about this situation . "

TROY , N.Y .
— Despite their ubiquity , cell phones are not known for their ability to take picture - perfect photos .
But budding " liquid lens " technology promises to change that by providing phone photogs with the autofocus capabilities lacking in today 's cellular optics .
The latest advance in this area comes from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , here , where researchers have developed a liquid lens by placing a few drops of water into a cylindrical hole drilled in a Teflon surface and using a small speaker ( that plays a high - frequency sound ) to provide the resonance needed to move the water back and forth , changing the focus of the lens .
Light passing through the droplets transforms them into a mini camera lens , which is capped on both sides with plastic or glass .
The experiment , led by Amir Hirsa , associate chief of graduate studies in the school 's Department of Mechanical , Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering , used the liquid lens to capture 250 images per second .
" The mass of the system is pushed back and forth as a result of surface tension , " Hirsa says .
" This adds variable focus capability to lenses that have never had it before . "
He and a team of researchers have been working on the project since 2004 , thanks to a $ 400,000 grant from the National Science Foundation .
The researchers describe their findings in the upcoming issue of the journal Nature Photonics .
Hirsa says the research could pave the way to a more sophisticated liquid lens that could be hooked up to a computer program that would only snap digital pictures of scenes or an object that is in focus ( instead of taking a series of images in approximate focus from which a photographer can choose ) .
The lens is simpler than earlier liquid lens designs that use a combination of water ( or some other fluid capable of conducting electricity ) and oil as well as an electric charge .
By using water , sound and surface tension to adjust the focus , Rensselaer researchers are hoping to develop more efficient and less expensive lenses than those made by Varioptic , S.A. , in Lyon , France , although the company has a significant head start :
It first demonstrated a lens in 2005 that sandwiches drops of water and oil between glass or plastic , according to PC Magazine .
Varioptic 's design uses a small integrated circuit to deliver a low - voltage charge ( measured in milliwatts , or thousandths of a watt ) to the lens that causes the fluids to change shape .
A higher current pulls the drop in on itself , creating a concave effect whereas a lower voltage makes it rounder .
There are no moving parts , and the oil , which has to be of even density and temperature , helps keep the drop in shape and in place .
Varioptic earlier this year announced a partnership with Japan 's Seiko Instruments USA , Inc. , to begin mass producing liquid lenses by the end of 2008 .
In June Varioptic began working with China 's Shenzhen Akkord Electronics Company , Ltd. , to make the first 1.3 - and 2.0 - megapixel liquid lens variable - focus Web cameras .
Philips Electronics in the Netherlands and the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering ( IMRE ) in Singapore have also developed prototype liquid lenses .
Hirsa says his team will seek more NSF funding to study the dynamics of the liquid 's movement and find a way to package the lens in devices such as cell phones or Webcams without breaking it or disturbing the droplets .
" If you make the inside coated with something water - resistant , " he says , " the droplets would simply re-form if they were disrupted . "
